HEADLINE: Stopping Fraud at Trade Schools

 BODY:
New York State needs to do a better job of regulating the for-profit trade school industry, which is increasingly known for deceptive practices and saddling students with debt while providing them little in return. 
As a good first step, the Legislature should promptly pass a bill that broadens the state Department of Education's enforcement authority over the hundreds of for-profit trade schools in New York. While most abide by the state licensing law, some appear to be flouting it, along with rules that require state approval of their curriculums. Officials say a rash of suspect schools has sprung up in New York City to exploit immigrants and the unemployed, who are desperate to learn new skills.
In one case, city officials say, students who paid to attend a truck-driving school spent the entire course in the classroom and were never taught to drive. At other schools, students say they were promised jobs or business contacts that never materialized.
The New York State attorney general's office is currently investigating allegations of illegal business practices at several for-profit education companies, including one founded by Donald Trump. The Education Department's inability to properly monitor the industry stems in part from underfinancing of the enforcement division, which runs entirely on school application fees. The pending bill would fix that problem by raising the fee from a paltry $250 to $5,000. Fines for violating the licensing law would also increase.
The for-profit schools are sometimes poorly financed, which means they go broke before the students complete their courses of study. The bill would try to deal with this problem by requiring the schools to prove financial viability and by making it easier for students to recover their tuition from schools that abruptly shut down.
Reputable for-profit schools should support this bill to show that they are committed to cleaning up a troubled industry. People who want new skills need the Legislature to do more to protect them from rip-offs and exploitation.

HEADLINE: Online Video Start-Ups Seek to Carve Out a Place Beside YouTube

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- For many Internet users, YouTube is synonymous with online video. But Mike Michaud and several friends who live in suburban Chicago are trying to change that.
Mr. Michaud co-owns Channel Awesome, an aspiring Viacom of the online video world, which promotes online shows about video games, comic books and assorted realms of popular culture. He was a casualty of the recession, having been laid off by Circuit City, the electronics retail chain that later was closed, and now he is a beneficiary of the advertising rebound, having doubled his revenue last year, enough to employ seven people full time.
''People may still scoff at online video, but this is a real business now,'' he said over breakfast recently. Channel Awesome's primary partner is not YouTube, but Blip.tv, which distributes made-for-the-Web series and surrounds them with ads. The companies that create these series are small, are popping up in unexpected places -- like Mr. Michaud's home -- and are creating unlikely stars in lucrative niches. 
Channel Awesome's best-known weekly show, ''Nostalgia Critic,'' which another Circuit City cast off, Doug Walker, produces from his home five minutes from Mr. Michaud's, draws about three million views a month. Several of Blip's top production partners are on track to earn at least a $1 million in ad revenue from Blip this year, said Dina Kaplan, a co-founder of Blip.
Like YouTube, Blip splits advertising revenues with Web series producers. But unlike YouTube, which also streams amateur videos, and Netflix, which streams feature films and television shows, Blip is solely focused on those producers. Rather than competing directly, it is trying to carve a niche next to YouTube in the expanding world of Web video.
''This ecosystem that we started working with in 2005 has finally come into its own,'' Ms. Kaplan said, citing the success of companies like Mr. Michaud's, Blip's relationships with top advertisers like Procter & Gamble, and the growing popularity of streaming video on televisions.
Shows hosted by Blip's servers now account for 330 million video views a month, the company says. Blip is in its third round of financing by venture capital firms that have invested $18 million. But what the system has been lacking, Blip executives and other industry specialists say, are ways to find made-for-the-Web series that are worth watching. The problem, in industry parlance, is discovery, and it is a huge hurdle for Web video makers and sponsors to clear.
''There just isn't anywhere right now that focuses on original Web series and presents them in a clean, curated, well-lit environment,'' Mike Hudack, another co-founder of Blip and the company's chief executive, said last month as he showed his solution: a new home page for Blip that is updated daily with links to new episodes of shows.
The new home page divides shows into categories like sports and comedy, ranks shows by popularity and creates what Mr. Michaud calls ''real show pages'' for users to visit.
YouTube, too, is trying to solve the discovery problem by programming its home page and putting a new emphasis on channels of content. In March, the company, a unit of Google, bought a Web video production company called Next New Networks, and now the employees of Next New are training other budding YouTube producers.
Like so many other Web video companies, Blip is a partner of YouTube, so it avoids any insinuation that it is a competitor. But it would clearly prefer to rack up video views on its own sites, not YouTube's.
The audiences for most Web series are still puny by television standards, and so are the budgets for the series. Mr. Michaud, 29, who wore to breakfast a yellow shirt with the star symbol from Super Mario Bros. 3 imprinted on the front, said online video itself ''still has a lot of growing up to do.''
''My company has a lot of growing up to do,'' he said, ''but I believe that sometime in the next one to two years someone will create that one series that gets everyone talking.''
That one show, he said, could then start pulling people from traditional television ''to the endless options of online video.''
Many of Blip's top shows are part of a network, the same way that MTV is an umbrella for all sorts of shows. Along with Channel Awesome, Blip praises Rooster Teeth, a production company based in Austin, Tex., that makes the action drama ''Red vs. Blue'' and ''Immersion,'' which tests video game tropes in real life.
Mr. Hudack's other favorites include ''Dusty Wright's Culture Catch,'' a music and culture talk show and blog, and ''Aidan 5,'' a black-and-white sci-fi drama produced in Columbus, Ohio, and based on a film short.
''When it comes to Web video, Hollywood could learn lessons from Illinois and Texas,'' Ms. Kaplan said.
As the channel and show names imply, success often results from tackling topics that appeal to young viewers. They are some of the same people who are ''watching less television,'' Ms. Kaplan said, ''so if advertisers want to reach them, they have to start advertising on Web series.''
Last week, Blip signed its latest content deal, with a management company called the Collective, that will steer more videos -- and thus more views and ad impressions -- in Blip's direction. The Collective represents online stars like Lucas Cruikshank, who plays a helium-voiced character called Fred in a hit YouTube series. In celebration of the deal, Blip's new office space on Broadway in the NoLIta neighborhood of Manhattan was rearranged into a dance floor last Thursday night, where staff members at Blip, executives at the Collective and friends from YouTube all mingled. In the back, out of reach of 200-plus partygoers, an unopened bottle of Champagne sat at an employee's desk.
To hit the million-dollar mark that Ms. Kaplan mentioned, Channel Awesome has to add new series and maintain the audiences for its current series. Mr. Michaud is now looking for warehouse space in suburban Chicago, and benefiting, he said, from the weak real estate market. He considered the vacant Circuit City building where he once worked, he said, but concluded that the space was too small.

HEADLINE: A Generation Faces the Road Ahead

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''It's Not About You'' (column, May 31), David Brooks says young graduates need to know that fulfillment in life comes from losing yourself in the completion of important tasks, rather than losing yourself in reflection about what your ideal life would be.
While this advice is a useful antidote to the more self-centered members of my generation, Mr. Brooks takes his point a bit too far. In today's stagnant job market, those of my friends who can even find work are stuck, at least for now, in uninspiring jobs. 
They do not find fulfillment by losing themselves in their spreadsheets and paralegal briefs. Once the job market improves, I hope they set their sights on new, more promising careers that offer the chance for professional satisfaction. But in order to do that, they'll need to spend time lost in thoughts about their hopes, dreams and ambitions.
JOHN CALHOUN Bronx, May 31, 2011
To the Editor:
As a senior about to graduate from Northwestern University, I have been hearing words of wisdom from friends, family, co-workers and others for weeks now. Like the reflections of David Brooks, these pieces of advice are based on an understanding of our culture over the last quarter-century or so.
But as Mr. Brooks acknowledges, moving our country forward will be dramatically different. The changes in relationships, politics and economics will affect college graduates as they make the transition to ''adulthood.''
Mr. Brooks does not appear to appreciate the dynamic nature of this generation. Everything we have touched, we have changed. Whether it be the childhood experience, the institution of marriage, or even the idea of a life course -- no aspect of our lives has paralleled that of our parents.
It seems difficult to embrace the argument that we are unprepared to enter full-fledged adulthood, as that argument is based on an understanding of what adulthood has constituted in the past. With all that has changed in our lifetime, why are we to think that our understanding of adulthood is likely to stay the same?
SCOTT BELSKY Evanston, Ill., May 31, 2011
To the Editor:
The seniors now listening to those commencement speeches represent a minority of the youth population -- those who have the means to get a college degree.
The majority of young people have had too little structure, supervision and sound advice about the future, not too much. They haven't been taught to follow their inner lights. They want regular jobs, but they don't know what path to follow. Their parents are marginally employed and poorly educated. High school guidance counselors have caseloads of 500, community colleges are bursting at the seams, and most who enter needing remediation do not get into high-value programs like nursing, information technology and finance, let alone ever complete a degree.
Without a system that structures the transition to the labor market through a mix of school and work and engages employers in education -- as in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands -- the United States will continue to fail the majority of its young people.
The evidence: youth unemployment is in single digits in the countries above while the United States rate has soared to about 20 percent.
NANCY HOFFMAN Newton Centre, Mass., May 31, 2011
The writer is vice president and senior adviser, Jobs for the Future.
To the Editor:
David Brooks criticizes baby boomers for raising children with both too much structure and too much independence. That he doesn't acknowledge the contradiction between these accusations is evidence of his bias against the boomers. Rather than blame the boomers, shouldn't we credit them with raising a generation of young people prepared both to think on their own and to interact in structured settings?
Mr. Brooks worries that boomers have left their children unprepared to function in our modern economy. Yet in a society built on teamwork and the ability to adapt to rapid change, don't we want young people to break out of the status quo and still be able to work within the structure of an organization? Isn't that exactly how baby boomers raised their children?
LEONARD STEINHORN Washington, May 31, 2011
The writer, a professor of communication at American University, is the author of ''The Greater Generation: In Defense of the Baby Boom Legacy.''
To the Editor:
David Brooks does not mention that many graduates -- especially those who do postgraduate work -- will leave school with six-figure debt.
Many are forced to accept jobs that pay enough to retire their debt. For example, someone might want to practice family medicine (lower paying) but opt for orthopedic surgery (very high paying). I understand that this is the case in other fields, as in the choice between Wall Street and community banking.
Education debt is a major factor in career choice and may be depriving us of some of the best where we need them the most.

HEADLINE: Romney's Primary Task: Pitching Pragmatism

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
STRATHAM, N.H. -- Mitt Romney's second presidential bid, and with it the 2012 Republican race, will turn on the interaction between two divergent trends.
His party keeps moving away from him.
But the national agenda keeps moving toward him.
Four years ago, Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, entered the race for the Republican nomination with a reputation as a pro-business pragmatist with moderation embedded in his DNA. Neither his expertise nor his instincts matched the political moment. 
That campaign began after ''values voters'' helped President George W. Bush win re-election in 2004. The pastor-politician Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, won the allegiance of the conservative Christians at the heart of the party's base.
Mr. Bush's war in Iraq made national security the dominant issue in 2008. And so the leading national security candidate, Senator John McCain of Arizona, captured the Republican nomination.
This time, each variable has shifted.
The Republican electorate has continued to evolve in ways ill-suited to Mr. Romney's record and demeanor. But the issue that best suits him, the troubled American economy, has virtually silenced talk of anything else.
That resets the challenge facing Mr. Romney, who enters the 2012 race as a different candidate.
Ideological Trend
The modern Republican Party began emerging a half-century ago. At that time, Mr. Romney's father ran for president as a Michigan governor who backed the civil rights movement and pushed through his state's first-ever income tax. The moderate faction he championed has dwindled ever since.
By 2005, a Pew Research Center analysis described three principal elements of the Republican coalition, each overwhelmingly conservative. They were affluent, pro-business ''Enterprisers''; religiously observant ''Social Conservatives''; and populist ''Pro-Government Conservatives'' who favored more aggressive regulation of the private sector.
Last month, Pew's updated analysis of core Republican constituencies found that they have become more homogenous and ideological. Some 90 percent are whites, up from 83 percent in 2005; and 51 percent are over 50 years old, up from 42 percent.
White evangelical Christians represent 41 percent of these core constituents, up from 36 percent in 2005. Gone, in the Tea Party era, are the so-called pro-government conservatives; in fact, 8 in 10 core Republican voters agreed that ''government is almost always wasteful and inefficient.''
Those shifts don't benefit Mr. Romney. Many evangelicals mistrust his Mormon faith, and small-government conservatives loathe the universal health coverage mandate he enacted in Massachusetts -- a state-level variant of President Obama's sweeping health care law.
Yet this campaign's economic backdrop gives Mr. Romney a critical countervailing factor. Weak growth and high unemployment have placed the debate squarely on the subject where, by heritage and experience, Mr. Romney is most at home.
Focus on Jobs
That reshaped context was on display in New Hampshire as Mr. Romney announced his candidacy last week.
His kickoff speech contrasted sharply with the one he gave four years earlier. Then, he sought a breakthrough in Iowa, where a 2008 entrance poll found that evangelical Christians made up 60 percent of Republican caucus-goers.
''I believe in God,'' Mr. Romney said, invoking ''the sanctity of life,'' ''enduring values and morality'' and the need for ''marriage before children'' to strengthen families.
Now his strategy centers on New Hampshire, where evangelical Christians represent a distinct minority. In his only religious reference, he observed that ''we go to different churches, or maybe don't go to church so much.''
To compete with Mr. McCain, Mr. Romney spoke repeatedly in 2007 of battling a ''radical violent jihad.'' This time, in a cursory discussion of foreign policy, he praised Mr. Obama for dispatching Osama bin Laden.
Nodding to the Tea Party, Mr. Romney promised a Washington that ''learns to respect the Constitution, including the 10th Amendment.'' That reference to powers reserved for the states meshes well with his defense of his health plan as an appropriate state-level solution.
But Mr. Romney's speech concentrated on something he didn't mention in 2007: adding American jobs. He tied that to his work at the buyout firm Bain Capital, which grew ''from 10 employees to hundreds.''
''If you want to create jobs, it helps to have had a job,'' he said. ''From my first day in office, my No. 1 job will be to see that America once again is No. 1 in job creation.''
His challenge is selling economic pragmatism to ideological primary voters. As the nominal Republican front-runner, he remains vulnerable to rivals who can appeal broadly and strike more resonant emotional chords.
''In a general election, it's very powerful,'' said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster. ''The problem is, you've got to get there.''
But at least Mr. Romney can confront intraparty headwinds on his most comfortable subject. In 2008, his discomfort with the focus of the debate seemed to be part of his problem.
New Hampshire primary exit polls that year showed him receiving just 15 percent among voters preferring a candidate to ''say what he believes.'' The Pew pollster Andrew Kohut noted that as Mr. Romney tries to defend his early lead here in 2012, ''It's who he is that will be the issue.''

HEADLINE: The Strauss-Kahn Case: Sizing Up a Legal Clash's Many Facets

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON and JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN

 BODY:
A housekeeper in a Manhattan hotel says she was sexually assaulted by a guest in a room she was cleaning.
It is the type of case, harrowing as it may be for the accuser, that prosecutors of sex crimes hear routinely. Even the complications are standard for sex abuse: with no eyewitness or other direct evidence of a forcible attack, the case is shaping up to be a battle of she-said, he-said.
A case like this would typically go through weeks or months of investigation, the prosecutors would decide whether to go forward, the two sides would talk about a deal, and not too long after that the case would be decided either with a plea or a trial.
But this is no ordinary case. The defendant, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, is a man of global economic and political importance, a powerful figure highly unlikely to admit to embarrassing accusations. The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., is not quite a year and a half on the job and is still operating under the shadow of his predecessor, Robert M. Morgenthau, who held the post for 40 years. Historically, the office has been known to take on the most difficult of cases, even if it has been seen as overzealous. 
These variables have set this case on an international stage with unprecedented attention from the news media, something that will undoubtedly affect the strategic trajectories of all involved -- including the plea bargain posture of both sides, the legal issues raised in court and the chances of the accuser's filing a lawsuit.
Both sides have signaled that they will take an aggressive approach. Mr. Strauss-Kahn has hired a high-priced legal team, including a big-name lawyer who has lectured on the art of cross-examination.
The team has, in turn, hired investigators to check out the woman's past, and experts say no aspect of her life, like her personal history and any financial dealings, will go unscrutinized.
For his part, Mr. Vance moved faster than usual for an indictment and has assigned some of his most highly regarded senior prosecutors. They are looking into accusations that Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who resigned last month as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has engaged in questionable behavior before.
And this is only the beginning. Both sides will wrestle with a host of changing and complex issues -- strategies, realities and personalities -- going forward.
Will There Be a Plea Deal?
Most criminal cases -- especially sexual assault cases, which can be the hardest to prove -- are resolved long before trial with a plea deal. But egos and professional reputations on both sides, circumstance and worldwide publicity make it unlikely that Mr. Strauss-Kahn's case will end quietly in a deal, with the suspect admitting to a lesser crime and the prosecution accepting lesser punishment.
And Mr. Vance's office, at least publicly, is indicating it will take a hard line.
''This is a case that's going to trial,'' a former prosecutor said, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to be seen as taking a side in the case. ''You're not going to offer him a plea that's a nonjail disposition -- Vance would look foolish if he did that. And the defendant, he's got a perception of himself that doesn't permit him to stand up and say, 'I raped that woman.' ''
A major part of the plea deal calculus comes down to the central men in this drama: Mr. Vance, who finds himself with what is by far his most high-profile case yet, and Mr. Strauss-Kahn. The question is whether either man will cede any measure of defeat.
Prosecutors have expressed no shortage of confidence in their case against Mr. Strauss-Kahn.
The proof against him ''is substantial,'' Artie McConnell, an assistant district attorney, said during a bail hearing after the defendant was indicted. ''It is continuing to grow every day as the investigation continues.''
If that is the case, the prosecution would favor withholding a plea deal unless Mr. Strauss-Kahn asks for one and says he is willing to serve some prison time, said Linda Fairstein, a former sex crimes prosecutor in Manhattan.
But even if Mr. Strauss-Kahn does so, it is hard to envision Mr. Vance's office offering a sentence that would satisfy Mr. Strauss-Kahn, because, in such a politically charged case, Mr. Vance does not want to appear weak.
In deciding whether to offer a deal, prosecutors, of course, weigh the strength of their case: Are they sure they can get a conviction? Has other evidence emerged to affect the credibility of the accuser?
Mr. Vance's office said in a statement that it would not ''discuss its trial strategy in the media.''
''Any speculation about trial strategy or evidence will be just that: speculation,'' it said.
The prosecutors' swift action on the case may also hint at their belief in their evidence. They obtained an indictment within a week of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's arrest, even though they could have taken longer because he was granted bail. It is not unusual for prosecutors to delay indictments on sex crime charges for weeks, if not months, while they investigate cases, many of which lack definitive physical evidence and amount to credibility battles between the accuser and the accused.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn is accused of trying to rape the 32-year-old hotel housekeeper in the luxury suite of the Sofitel New York on May 14, then forcing her to perform oral sex. The defense has suggested that whatever happened was consensual. Evidence from the work clothes of the housekeeper matched DNA samples taken from Mr. Strauss-Kahn, but the defense has indicated that such evidence could be consistent with a consensual encounter.
Will the prosecutors' confidence remain intact? Inevitably, they will have to determine how to confront the longstanding societal stereotypes that lead people to view skeptically those who claim sexual assault, said Ms. Fairstein, who spent about 25 years as the chief of the Manhattan district attorney's sex crimes bureau.
Another challenge will be to determine Mr. Strauss-Kahn's motive. Even though the prosecution is not required to prove motive, jurors often want to hear one, Ms. Fairstein said.
''What would make him do something like this?'' she added. ''People are surprised when it's a man of distinction, power, wealth, education.''
The Defense's Attack
Fueled by the fortune of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's wealthy wife, the defense has hired Guidepost Solutions, a private investigation company led by Bart M. Schwartz, a former federal prosecutor, to look into the accuser's background.
Defense lawyers threatened that they had ''substantial information'' they could use to ''gravely undermine the credibility of the complainant in this case.'' During the trial, any such information -- if it exists -- will emerge during the cross-examination of the hotel housekeeper. In sexual assault cases, it is during cross-examinations that defense lawyers insinuate that the accuser is confused, mistaken or even lying, driven by money, vengeance or remorse.
An aggressive cross-examination, especially in sexual assault cases, carries the risk that jurors may take offense at watching the denigration of a person they believe to be a victim. Still, it is a risk that defense lawyers generally feel obliged to take.
''You really have to attack the witness's credibility'' in sexual assault cases, a Manhattan defense lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, said. ''While it may seem morally unseemly to the public, it's legally appropriate and we have to do the best we can for our clients.''
He added: ''You have to make this into a money thing at the end. Has she defaulted on loans or bounced checks?''
The cross-examination of the hotel housekeeper could go on for days, and Mr. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers will spend months preparing for it. For the defense team, it is its most important chance to call into question the prosecution's claim that the sexual encounter was coercive.
A person with knowledge of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's legal strategy who spoke on the condition of anonymity said there was no decision yet as to which of his lawyers, Benjamin Brafman or William W. Taylor III, would cross-examine the hotel housekeeper.
In the past, Mr. Brafman, a formidable cross-examiner, has spoken with evident pride about his ability to employ different approaches when confronting witnesses. In a taped lecture that is available online for a fee, Mr. Brafman said he was often asked, ''Is every cross a knock-down slugfest?'' The answer, he said, is ''absolutely not.''
He explained his preferred approach: ''More often than not, what you have to do is badger a witness in a way that doesn't necessarily make them break, but makes them either not credible or less credible or puts in doubt something that they have said.'' He added, ''That's a really good cross-examination.''
A person with knowledge of the defense's strategy said the legal team had not yet decided what approach to use with the hotel housekeeper.
''If you have a woman who views herself as a victim, when in fact this is consensual but she has personal regret after the fact, that is a very different type of cross-examination'' than if ''we find bad stuff about her,'' the person said.
Some details of a potential defense are already coming into focus, a person close to Mr. Strauss-Kahn's defense team said. The defense is expected to pursue the issue of whether it is even physically possible for an unarmed man, who is not particularly physically imposing, to force a person to engage in oral sex.
Treatment of Other Women
At Mr. Strauss-Kahn's arraignment, Mr. McConnell, the prosecutor, said his office was trying to verify whether Mr. Strauss-Kahn had ''engaged in conduct similar to the conduct alleged in this complaint on at least one other occasion.'' Since then, more than one woman has contacted investigators in New York to discuss encounters with Mr. Strauss-Kahn that they felt were aggressive or possibly coercive, a law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the case was continuing.
If Mr. Strauss-Kahn gets his way, he will have to answer only one accuser -- the hotel housekeeper -- at his trial. The prosecution may well try to have him answer to more. Judges in New York sometimes allow prosecutors to present evidence about past misdeeds, opening the scope of a trial beyond the crimes charged in the indictment.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn's words could open the door to this tactic. If, for example, he -- or other people testifying as character witnesses -- says that he is a perfect gentleman, the prosecution might have an opening to offer evidence of past encounters in which a woman claimed he behaved otherwise with her. But even if Mr. Strauss-Kahn does not offer prosecutors such a window, a judge might allow prosecutors to introduce evidence about other women with claims against Mr. Strauss-Kahn.
What type of past misdeeds are fair game at a trial in New York? That depends largely on a 1901 decision, People v. Molineux, which involved a man accused of trying to poison the fitness director of his athletic club. At the trial, prosecutors also tried to prove that the man, Roland Molineux, had previously poisoned another person. The Court of Appeals ruled that the prosecution had crossed a line by trying to link him to the previous death, and granted Mr. Molineux a new trial.
But there was a catch. The court's decision acknowledged several exceptions to the rule ''that the state cannot prove against a defendant any crime not alleged in the indictment.'' Under Molineux and subsequent rulings, evidence of past misdeeds can sometimes be admitted if it speaks to the defendant's criminal intent or an unusual modus operandi.
If, for instance, prosecutors found other hotel housekeepers who said Mr. Strauss-Kahn assaulted them, prosecutors might seek to place those women on the stand to suggest that Mr. Strauss-Kahn's encounter in the Sofitel was not consensual, legal experts said.
Because evidence of prior misconduct can sway a jury to believe that the defendant may be predisposed to crime, defense lawyers argue very hard against permitting prosecutors to present evidence of past behavior. A person with knowledge of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's defense strategy said that his legal team would fight efforts to bring in any evidence relating to Mr. Strauss-Kahn's past encounters with women.
''In a rape case, a trial of forcible compulsion, the fact that I flirt with women, or that I'm a cad, is not going to be admissible as a prior bad act no matter how offensive it is,'' the person said.
At this point, it is not clear whether prosecutors intend to put other women on the stand. A law enforcement official briefed on the case, speaking on the condition of anonymity because court proceedings were continuing, said that Mr. McConnell's mention of ''at least one other'' past accusation was a reference to the claim of a French journalist, Tristane Banon, who has publicly said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn had tried to rape her when she went to interview him in 2002. A lawyer for Ms. Banon had earlier said that she did not want to testify against Mr. Strauss-Kahn in New York.
Two people close to Piroska Nagy, a former subordinate at the I.M.F. who has said Mr. Strauss-Kahn pressured her into an affair, said on Wednesday that New York prosecutors had not sought to interview Ms. Nagy.
While investigating evidence is a crucial part of any prosecutor's case, one of the most important tasks for the prosecutors will be to manage the accuser's emotions and protect her from outside influences.
What If Accuser Backs Out?
It is difficult enough in any sexual assault case to get the accuser to come forward and cooperate all the way through the trial. It may be even harder in this case because of the enormous scrutiny surrounding the woman: several foreign news outlets have published her name, her friends and neighbors have been swarmed by a curious press corps, and, of course, her life will be thoroughly examined by Mr. Strauss-Kahn's well-paid defense team.
So far, it seems, the woman has held up well.
''This is a woman who believes in justice and was very strong in the beginning, even though she was scared and frightened,'' said Susan Xenarios, the director of the Crime Victims Treatment Center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, where the woman was treated after she said she was attacked.
Despite all the news media attention -- or because of it -- Ms. Xenarios said, she believes that the woman will see this case through ''because she almost can't not at this point.''
There have been reports that people connected to Mr. Strauss-Kahn may try to pay off the woman to recant her accusations; the defense team has denied those reports.
If the woman backs out and does not cooperate with prosecutors, it will be devastating to their case.
While they could force her to testify, and confront her with her grand jury testimony if she changes her story on the witness stand, that is typically not something that plays well before juries, Ms. Fairstein, the former prosecutor, said.
The Manhattan district attorney's office has a history of finding inventive ways to prosecute cases -- especially domestic violence charges -- in which people who claim abuse do not want to cooperate. The office has, for instance, used frantic 911 calls placed by the accuser in place of testimony from that person. Prosecutors could also use other eyewitness testimony, surveillance tapes or other definitive physical evidence.
But there was no 911 call by the woman in Mr. Strauss-Kahn's case and no eyewitnesses.
''No matter how keenly the prosecutors wish to go forward with this, it doesn't appear to be the kind of case in which that would be possible'' without the hotel housekeeper's cooperation, Ms. Fairstein said.
Prosecutors also must be wary of how any civil action taken by the woman, who has hired a lawyer, could affect their criminal case.
Ideally, she would wait for the criminal proceeding to finish before filing a lawsuit, but the law gives her only about a year from the date of the alleged attack to do so -- and few expect the case to be resolved in a year.
Filing a lawsuit also would open the door to talk of a financial settlement before the criminal case is resolved. This would be a tricky proposition, several lawyers said, because of laws against bribing or tampering with a witness.
It would be inappropriate to settle a civil lawsuit on the condition that she not cooperate or speak to the district attorney's office, several lawyers said.
But saying something like, ''I hope you would take a favorable view toward a noncustodial term,'' meaning a plea deal with no jail time, could fall within legal boundaries, Gerald L. Shargel, a defense lawyer, said.
But the accuser and the accused would seem to have little incentive in reaching a civil settlement before trial.
For one, a conviction at trial means a certain victory on the lawsuit, with only the amount of damages to be settled. So it may be in the best interest of the woman to let the criminal case play out first.
For Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a civil settlement could be seen by jurors in a criminal trial as an admission of guilt, and there is no assurance that prosecutors would then drop the case.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 11, 2011

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 6 about the complex legal facets of the sexual assault case against Dominique Strauss-Kahn misstated the time period that an accuser has to file a civil lawsuit in such a matter. It could be years from the time of an alleged attack, depending on the circumstances; it is not necessarily ''only about a year.'' A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail the day the article was published. This correction was delayed because The Times failed to follow up on the complaint.

HEADLINE: 'Culture Warrior' Looks to Broaden the Battle

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Exasperation crept into Rick Santorum's voice when he was asked the other day how he planned to win the Republican nomination for president in 2012 after having lost his last election as senator from Pennsylvania by more than 17 points in 2006.
Rather than discuss his strategy, he critiqued the question.
''Had I not run for re-election in 2006, you wouldn't ask me that,'' he said during a moveable interview in Manhattan as he left a fund-raiser at the Union League and walked across town to Pennsylvania Station, where he was catching a train back to Washington.
Some candidates, he said, did not run for re-election because they would have lost, and yet no one asks them about it. ''Look at Mitt Romney,'' he said. ''He served for one term as governor of Massachusetts and didn't run for re-election. Why?'' 
Mr. Santorum, 53, a former two-term senator, announced his candidacy for president on Monday at the picturesque county courthouse in Somerset, Pa. It is near where his grandfather, who immigrated from fascist Italy, first worked in the coal mines, and the backdrop is meant to visually reinforce his message that hard-working people came to this country to seek freedom and opportunity.
But the setting may also be a questionable choice; Mr. Santorum lost Somerset County, which usually votes Republican, in his 2006 re-election bid. In fact, his viability may be one of Mr. Santorum's biggest challenges as he joins a field of six declared candidates -- Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Gary Johnson, Tim Pawlenty, Ron Paul and Mr. Romney.
Mr. Santorum said his chief advantage was that throughout all of his campaigns, four out of five of which he won, he remained true to his conservative principles.
''My feeling is, losing an election is not the worst thing that can happen,'' he said. ''The worst thing that can happen is not standing up for what you believe in when you're running for that election.''
Mr. Santorum believes strongly in what he calls the culture of life. He is so well known as a crusader against abortion and same-sex marriage that it may surprise some voters and the news media that his interests in the Senate also included national security, foreign policy and entitlement programs.
''I have one major piece of legislation I passed, on partial-birth abortion, but I had two on foreign policy -- the Syria Accountability Act and the Iran Freedom and Support Act, both of which were opposed by Bush and took me a year or more,'' he said. He added: ''I spent the last four years at the Ethics and Public Policy Center giving lectures all over the country on radical jihadism and the 'Gathering Storm of the 21st Century.' I haven't done squat on moral, cultural issues.''
Nonetheless, the social issues are the ones that fire up the segment of the Republican primary base to which Mr. Santorum most appeals. And he has yet to address fully the issues that likely voters in a general election tell pollsters are most important: jobs and the economy.
His core message now is his belief in American exceptionalism, a philosophy that he says President Obama does not share. The Obama presidency, he said, ''has been a disaster'' in almost every respect.
Mr. Santorum has been laying the groundwork for his campaign for some time, beginning with trips to Iowa in October 2009. He has made 14 visits to Iowa, 17 to New Hampshire since April 2010, and 15 to South Carolina since December 2009, a combined total that may surpass that of any other candidate. He has a staff of almost 20 people.
The work brought him early success among the particularly conservative voters in South Carolina. In April, he won a straw poll at the Greenville County Republican Convention, in one of the most evangelical regions of that first-in-the-South primary state. And in May, he won the straw poll at the state party's dinner, which he was the only presidential candidate to attend.
He also got credit for showing up at the party's first presidential debate last month in South Carolina. Mr. Cain was proclaimed the runaway winner there, however, and he has also won straw polls by groups that might have been naturals for Mr. Santorum: at the Tea Party Patriots convention in February and the Conservative Values Conference in Iowa in March.
He could lose further ground in that niche if candidates like Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska enter the race.
Early polls suggest that Mr. Santorum is gaining little traction among Republican primary voters, though he has spent most of his career in politics. Perhaps his most significant victory came in 1994, when, at the age of 36, he toppled an incumbent Democratic senator, Harris Wofford.
But his loss in 2006 to Bob Casey Jr. was ''very damaging to his career trajectory,'' said Christopher P. Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College. ''He was too extreme, too much a culture warrior.''
Tom Jensen, a Democratic pollster based in North Carolina, said that Mr. Santorum consistently registered ''in the zero to 2 percent range'' in most states, and even in Pennsylvania, he was running in fifth place.
''He's not going to have a lot of resources,'' Mr. Jensen said, ''and more dynamic candidates are going to be tapping into his niche.''
''The only sign of hope for Rick is what has happened in the last month to Cain, who surged after the debate,'' he said. ''That's the only place Rick is going to get exposure, in the debates.''
Mr. Santorum said that the decision to run for president had been hard, especially because he has seven children, from a 3-year-old with special needs to a 20-year-old in college. But those children also inspired him to run.
''I fear for the future of the country,'' he said. ''If I have the ability to shape it, then what kind of dad am I that I didn't do that, didn't make the sacrifices that I thought would make the country better?''
He called himself a ''plodder'' and said he would simply keep plugging away.

HEADLINE: When a Nobel Prize Isn't Enough

BYLINE: By PETER A. DIAMOND. 
Peter A. Diamond is a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

 BODY:
Lexington, Mass.
LAST October, I won the Nobel Prize in economics for my work on unemployment and the labor market. But I am unqualified to serve on the board of the Federal Reserve -- at least according to the Republican senators who have blocked my nomination. How can this be?
The easy answer is to point to shortcomings in our confirmation process and to partisan polarization in Washington. The more troubling answer, though, points to a fundamental misunderstanding: a failure to recognize that analysis of unemployment is crucial to conducting monetary policy. 
In April 2010, President Obama nominated me to be one of the seven governors of the Fed. He renominated me in September, and again in January, after Senate Republicans blocked a floor vote on my confirmation. When the Senate Banking Committee took up my nomination in July and again in November, three Republican senators voted for me each time. But the third time around, the Republicans on the committee voted in lockstep against my appointment, making it extremely unlikely that the opposition to a full Senate vote can be overcome. It is time for me to withdraw, as I plan to inform the White House.
The leading opponent to my appointment, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the committee, has questioned the relevance of my expertise. ''Does Dr. Diamond have any experience in conducting monetary policy? No,'' he said in March. ''His academic work has been on pensions and labor market theory.''
But understanding the labor market -- and the process by which workers and jobs come together and separate -- is critical to devising an effective monetary policy. The financial crisis has led to continuing high unemployment. The Fed has to properly assess the nature of that unemployment to be able to lower it as much as possible while avoiding inflation. If much of the unemployment is related to the business cycle -- caused by a lack of adequate demand -- the Fed can act to reduce it without touching off inflation. If instead the unemployment is primarily structural -- caused by mismatches between the skills that companies need and the skills that workers have -- aggressive Fed action to reduce it could be misguided.
In my Nobel acceptance speech in December, I discussed in detail the patterns of hiring in the American economy, and concluded that structural unemployment and issues of mismatch were not important in the slow recovery we have been experiencing, and thus not a reason to stop an accommodative monetary policy -- a policy of keeping short-term interest rates exceptionally low and buying Treasury securities to keep long-term rates down. Analysis of the labor market is in fact central to monetary policy.
Senator Shelby also questioned my qualifications, asking: ''Does Dr. Diamond have any experience in crisis management? No.'' In addition to setting monetary policy in light of a proper understanding of unemployment, the Fed is responsible for avoiding banking crises, not just trying to mop up afterward.
Among the issues being debated now is how much we should increase capital requirements for banks. Selecting the proper size of the increase requires a balance between reducing the risk of a future crisis and ensuring the effective functioning of financial firms in ordinary times. My experience analyzing the properties of capital markets and how economic risks are and should be shared is directly relevant for designing policies to reduce the risk of future banking crises.
Instead of going to the Fed, however, I will go about my congenial professional existence as a professor at M.I.T., where I have taught and researched since 1966, and I will take advantage of some of the many opportunities that come to a Nobel laureate. So don't worry about me.
But we should all worry about how distorted the confirmation process has become, and how little understanding of monetary policy there is among some of those responsible for its Congressional oversight. We need to preserve the independence of the Fed from efforts to politicize monetary policy and to limit the Fed's ability to regulate financial firms.
Concern about the (seemingly low) current risk of future inflation should not erase concern about the large costs of continuing high unemployment. Concern about the distant risk of a genuine inability to handle our national debt should not erase concern about the risk to the economy from too much short-run fiscal tightening.
To the public, the Washington debate is often about more versus less -- in both spending and regulation. There is too little public awareness of the real consequences of some of these decisions. In reality, we need more spending on some programs and less spending on others, and we need more good regulations and fewer bad ones.
Analytical expertise is needed to accomplish this, to make government more effective and efficient. Skilled analytical thinking should not be drowned out by mistaken, ideologically driven views that more is always better or less is always better. I had hoped to bring some of my own expertise and experience to the Fed. Now I hope someone else can.

HEADLINE: The High Line Isn't Just a Sight to See; It's Also an Economic Dynamo

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
A decade ago, so many moneyed interests were united against saving the elevated freight tracks that cut through the West Side of Manhattan that the idea appeared to be doomed. Owners of land and buildings throughout Chelsea wanted the decaying High Line viaduct razed, and the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani supported their feelings.
But on Friday afternoon, there was Mr. Giuliani's successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, proclaiming that preserving the High Line as a public park revitalized a swath of the city and generated $2 billion in private investment surrounding the park. 
The mayor pointed to the deluxe apartment buildings whose glass walls press up against the High Line and the hundreds of art galleries, restaurants and boutiques it overlooks. All of that commerce more than makes up for the $115 million the city has spent on the park and the deals it has made to encourage developers to build along the High Line without blocking out the sun, Mr. Bloomberg said. On top of the 8,000 construction jobs those projects required, the redevelopment has added about 12,000 jobs in the area, the mayor said.
Indeed, what started out as a community-based campaign to convert an eyesore into an asset evolved into one of the most successful economic-development projects of the mayor's nine years in office. The co-founders of Friends of the High Line, a group that operates the city-owned park, said the mayor and his staff deserved credit for having embraced the park and rezoned the neighborhoods it passes through to help it flourish.
Robert Hammond, one of the founders, said the organization commissioned a study of the potential economic benefits of the project in 2002. ''We talked about a High Line district and that it would be good for the local economy,'' Mr. Hammond recalled. But, he added, ''we had no idea that it would happen this fast. If you had said then that 10th Avenue would be a location for some of the world's best chefs, it would just be ludicrous.''
Amanda Burden, the city's planning director, emphasized the boost to property values, saying that in one building that abuts the lower section of the High Line, the price of apartments had doubled since the park opened, to about $2,000 a square foot. Ms. Burden called the area ''Architects Row'' as she ticked off the roster of designers of nearby buildings, including Jean Nouvel, Annabelle Selldorf and Neil Denari.
Yet those exclusive accommodations are wedged in within a block of huge brick complexes of public housing, where sheets serve as curtains and dented air-conditioners list toward the earth. A seating area on the second half-mile segment of the High Line, which is to open this week, offers visitors a pigeon's-eye view of a Firestone auto-repair shop on 26th Street.
The second segment bisects the blocks between 10th and 11th Avenues from 20th Street to 30th Street. If the third section is completed, it will end near the terminus of the extended No. 7 subway line, said Robert K. Steel, the deputy mayor for economic development. People could ride the subway from Queens, then walk the High Line through Chelsea to the meatpacking district, said Mr. Steel, who recently became a resident of Chelsea, just a block from the High Line.
In a way, the High Line has done for those neighborhoods what new subway lines have done in other parts of the city, Mr. Hammond said. ''Normally, the farther you get from the subway the less expensive the housing is,'' said Mr. Hammond, who confessed that he rents an apartment in the West Village. ''But the closer you are to the High Line, the farther you are from the subway, and still, the closer the apartments are to the High Line, the more expensive they get.''

HEADLINE: STEEPER PULLOUT RAISED AS OPTION FOR AFGHANISTAN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, ERIC SCHMITT and THOM SHANKER; David E. Sanger and Eric Schmitt reported from Washington, and Thom Shanker from Forward Operating Base Dwyer, Afghanistan. Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's national security team is contemplating troop reductions in Afghanistan that would be steeper than those discussed even a few weeks ago, with some officials arguing that such a change is justified by the rising cost of the war and the death of Osama bin Laden, which they called new ''strategic considerations.''
These new considerations, along with a desire to find new ways to press the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, to get more of his forces to take the lead, are combining to create a counterweight to an approach favored by the departing secretary of defense, Robert M. Gates, and top military commanders in the field. They want gradual cuts that would keep American forces at a much higher combat strength well into next year, senior administration officials said.
The cost of the war and Mr. Karzai's uneven progress in getting his forces prepared have been latent issues since Mr. Obama took office. But in recent weeks they have gained greater political potency as Mr. Obama's newly refashioned national security team takes up the crucial decision of the size and the pace of American troop cuts, administration and military officials said. Mr. Obama is expected to address these decisions in a speech to the nation this month, they said. 
A sharp drawdown of troops is one of many options Mr. Obama is considering. The National Security Council is convening its monthly meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan on Monday, and although the debate over troop levels is operating on a separate track, the assessments from that meeting are likely to inform the decisions about the size of the force.
In a range of interviews in the past few days, several senior Pentagon, military and administration officials said that many of these pivotal questions were still in flux and would be debated intensely over the next two weeks. They would not be quoted by name about an issue that Mr. Obama had yet to decide on.
Before the new thinking, American officials were anticipating an initial drawdown of 3,000 to 5,000 troops. Those advocating steeper troop reductions did not propose a withdrawal schedule.
Mr. Gates, on his 12th and final visit to Afghanistan as defense secretary, argued repeatedly on Sunday that pulling out too fast would threaten the gains the American-led coalition had made in the 18 months since Mr. Obama agreed to a ''surge'' of 30,000 troops.
''I would try to maximize my combat capability as long as this process goes on -- I think that's a no-brainer,'' Mr. Gates told troops at Forward Operating Base Dwyer. ''I'd opt to keep the shooters and take the support out first.''
But the latest strategy review is about far more than how many troops to take out in July, Mr. Gates and other senior officials said over the weekend. It is also about setting a final date by which all of the 30,000 surge troops will be withdrawn from Afghanistan.
A separate timetable would dictate the departure of all foreign troops by 2014, including about 70,000 troops who were there before the surge, as agreed to by NATO and the Afghan government.
Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Afghanistan, sounded a cautious note about the state of the war in a telephone interview on Sunday. Although General Petraeus said there was ''no question'' that the Americans and the Afghans had made military progress in the crucial provinces of Helmand and Kandahar in the south, he said the Taliban were moving to reconstitute after the beating they took this past fall and winter.
''We've always said they would be compelled to try to come back,'' General Petraeus said, adding that the Taliban would be trying to ''regain the momentum they had a year ago.''
General Petraeus declined to discuss the withdrawal of American forces in July or the number he might recommend to the president. Late last week Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that General Petraeus had not yet submitted his recommended withdrawal number.
The decisions on force levels in Afghanistan could mirror how Mr. Obama handled the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. Senior Pentagon officials noted that after Mr. Obama set a firm deadline for dropping to 50,000 troops in Iraq, he then let his commanders in Baghdad manage the specifics of which units to order home and when. The argument over where to set those ''bookends'' promises to be one of the most consequential and contentious of Mr. Obama's presidency. It also has major implications for his re-election bid.
At one end of the debate is Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and, presumably, a range of Mr. Obama's political advisers, who opposed the surge in 2009 and want a rapid exit, keeping in place a force focused on counterterrorism and training.
At the other end is Mr. Gates, who leaves office at the end of the month and who won the 2009 debate over the troop surge along with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and senior commanders on the ground.
It is not clear what Mrs. Clinton's position is now as the internal debate is rejoined, and Mr. Obama's team has changed considerably in the past 18 months. Thomas E. Donilon, appointed national security adviser last fall, was leery of the surge and is likely to lean toward a speedier withdrawal, colleagues say.
Leon E. Panetta, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, supports greater use of unmanned drone technology and will have a voice as Mr. Gates's nominated successor. General Petraeus is leaving his post in Afghanistan shortly to head the C.I.A., assuming he is confirmed by the Senate this summer.
In the past, when administration officials were asked about the pace of withdrawal, they often said it would depend on ''conditions on the ground'' -- in other words, assessments of the strength of the Taliban, the pace at which Afghan troops and police are prepared to take over and the progress of the economic and political rebuilding of the country. ''Most of those would weigh in favor of staying longer,'' one senior official said.
But the growing list of so-called strategic considerations amounts to countervailing factors, senior officials said. Mr. Obama has said his goal is to dismantle Al Qaeda so that it can never use Afghanistan again to initiate a Sept. 11-style attack.
With the killing of Bin Laden, and with other members of the terrorist group on the run as American officials pick up clues from data seized at the Bin Laden compound, Mr. Obama can argue that Al Qaeda is much diminished.
The pressure to show Democrats that the cost of the war is declining is intense -- so intense that Mr. Gates, during his travels, warned against undercutting a decade-long investment by cutting budgets too rapidly.

HEADLINE: Vouchercare Is Not Medicare

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
What's in a name? A lot, the National Republican Congressional Committee obviously believes. Last week, the committee sent a letter demanding that a TV station stop running an ad declaring that the House Republican budget plan would ''end Medicare.'' This, the letter insisted, was a false claim: the plan would simply install a ''new, sustainable version of Medicare.''
But Comcast, the station's owner, rejected the demand -- and rightly so. For Republicans are indeed seeking to dismantle Medicare as we know it, replacing it with a much worse program. 
I'm seeing many attempts to shout down anyone making this obvious point, and not just from Republican politicians. For some reason, many commentators seem to believe that accurately describing what the G.O.P. is actually proposing amounts to demagoguery. But there's nothing demagogic about telling the truth.
Start with the claim that the G.O.P. plan simply reforms Medicare rather than ending it. I'll just quote the blogger Duncan Black, who summarizes this as saying that ''when we replace the Marines with a pizza, we'll call the pizza the Marines.'' The point is that you can name the new program Medicare, but it's an entirely different program -- call it Vouchercare -- that would offer nothing like the coverage that the elderly now receive. (Republicans get huffy when you call their plan a voucher scheme, but that's exactly what it is.)
Medicare is a government-run insurance system that directly pays health-care providers. Vouchercare would cut checks to insurance companies instead. Specifically, the program would pay a fixed amount toward private health insurance -- higher for the poor, lower for the rich, but not varying at all with the actual level of premiums. If you couldn't afford a policy adequate for your needs, even with the voucher, that would be your problem.
And most seniors wouldn't be able to afford adequate coverage. A Congressional Budget Office analysis found that to get coverage equivalent to what they have now, older Americans would have to pay vastly more out of pocket under the Paul Ryan plan than they would if Medicare as we know it was preserved. Based on the budget office estimates, the typical senior would end up paying around $6,000 more out of pocket in the plan's first year of operation.
By the way, defenders of the G.O.P. plan often assert that it resembles other, less unpopular programs. For a while they claimed, falsely, that Vouchercare would be just like the coverage federal employees get. More recently, I've been seeing claims that Vouchercare would be just like the system created for Americans under 65 by last year's health care reform -- a fairly remarkable defense from a party that has denounced that reform as evil incarnate.
So let me make two points. First, Obamacare was very much a second-best plan, conditioned by perceived political realities. Most of the health reformers I know would have greatly preferred simply expanding Medicare to cover all Americans. Second, the Affordable Care Act is all about making health care, well, affordable, offering subsidies whose size is determined by the need to limit the share of their income that families spend on medical costs. Vouchercare, by contrast, would simply hand out vouchers of a fixed size, regardless of the actual cost of insurance. And these vouchers would be grossly inadequate.
But what about the claim that none of this matters, because Medicare as we know it is unsustainable? Nonsense.
Yes, Medicare has to get serious about cost control; it has to start saying no to expensive procedures with little or no medical benefits, it has to change the way it pays doctors and hospitals, and so on. And a number of reforms of that kind are, in fact, included in the Affordable Care Act. But with these changes it should be entirely possible to maintain a system that provides all older Americans with guaranteed essential health care.
Consider Canada, which has a national health insurance program, actually called Medicare, that is similar to the program we have for the elderly, but less open-ended and more cost-conscious. In 1970, Canada and the United States both spent about 7 percent of their G.D.P. on health care. Since then, as United States health spending has soared to 16 percent of G.D.P., Canadian spending has risen much more modestly, to only 10.5 percent of G.D.P. And while Canadian health care isn't perfect, it's not bad.
Canadian Medicare, then, looks sustainable; why can't we do the same thing here? Well, you know the answer in the case of the Republicans: They don't want to make Medicare sustainable, they want to destroy it under the guise of saving it.
So in voting for the House budget plan, Republicans voted to end Medicare. Saying that isn't demagoguery, it's just pointing out the truth.

HEADLINE: WNET to Oversee New Jersey Public Television

BYLINE: ELIZABETH JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: New York's WNET will take over the television operations of the New Jersey Network for five years, if a plan presented on Monday by Gov. Chris Christie is ratified by the state legislature.

 BODY:
4:57 p.m. | Updated New York's WNET will take over the television operations of the New Jersey Network for five years under a deal announced on Monday by Gov. Chris Christie.
The plan, which would be carried out by a new WNET subsidiary, is intended to get the state of New Jersey out of the public broadcasting business. If ratified by the state legislature, it will take effect on July 1.
As part of the plan, four state-owned radio licenses would be acquired outright by New York Public Radio, which operates WNYC and WQXR. The remaining five radio licenses would be bought by the Philadelphia public broadcaster WHYY.
At a press conference in Trenton, Governor Christie expressed support for continuing "robust New Jersey public broadcasting," but added that "we need to have it in a way that is not continuing to cost the state taxpayers and can be perceived as truly independent from state government."
Under the deal, WNET's new subsidiary, New Jersey Public Media, will be contractually required to continue a weekday New Jersey-focused newscast on what will now be named NJTV, as well as live broadcasts of significant New Jersey State House events and election night coverage and a Sunday morning public affairs show. Critics of the deal had been concerned that the newscast would not continue.
Neal Shapiro, the president and chief executive of WNET, said in an interview that beginning in the fall the newscast would change format, with "more analysis, more context and less of an everything-that-happened-today feel." WNET also plans to work in partnership with other existing media outlets in the state, including newspapers, online journalists, universities and arts and culture organizations.
Following the announcement, several New Jersey legislators, and critics of the takeover plan, including union representatives and community groups, announced hearings on the pending deal.
In a statement, the "Keep the NJ in NJN" coalition questioned whether WNET would live up to its promise to continue local news programming, arguing that it didn't do so when it took over Long Island's WLIW-TV in 2003.
Mr. Shapiro, in the interview, blamed some of the cutbacks on the recession and said that new Long Island-focused programming was in the works.
NJTV will operate on a budget of roughly $8 million annually, less than half of its previous budget. WNET will take over NJN's federal subsidy from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting of about $2.2 million, plus about $2 million in income from renting space on its broadcast tower.
Despite public television's ongoing funding challenges, Mr. Shapiro said he was confident the new entity would be able to raise an additional $3 million to $4 million each year from philanthropists, foundations and other supporters. He added that "the money we raise in New Jersey will stay in New Jersey."
NJN's approximately 120 employees will lose their state jobs under the deal, although they will be able to reapply for posts at the new entity. The new newscast is expected to be produced with about 15 to 20 people, Mr. Shapiro said, with many of the station's other back office positions being consolidated with those of WNET.
On the radio side, the plan calls for New York Public Radio to pay $1 million in cash for the licenses it is acquiring, plus $1.8 million in non-cash compensation, including investments in New Jersey-centric news coverage and airtime for public service announcements, said Andy Pratt, a spokesman for the New Jersey Treasurer's office. WHYY will pay about $926,000 in cash and an additional $612,000 in in-kind consideration, he said.

HEADLINE: Economists Lower G.D.P. Forecasts for 2nd Quarter

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Quarter after quarter and month after month, the United States has been subjected to increasingly disappointing economic numbers. And this quarter is no different.

 BODY:
Quarter after quarter and month after month, the United States has been subjected to increasingly disappointing economic numbers. And this quarter is no different.
In light of a streak of bad news -- on jobs, auto sales, housing, manufacturing and retailing -- many economists have ratcheted down their estimates for gross domestic product in the second quarter. A small selection: Macroeconomic Advisers is now forecasting 2.6 percent annualized growth, down from its forecast of 3.7 percent about a month earlier. Barclays Capital has lowered its forecast to 2 percent, from 3.5 percent. IHS Global Insight is expecting 2 percent. Joshua Shapiro of MFR is predicting (gulp) 1.5 percent, about half of what he'd previously expected.You may recall that the same phenomenon occurred last quarter, when, for instance, Macroeconomic Advisers gradually slid its estimate down from 4.1 percent to 1.5 percent. The Commerce Department eventually reported that the economy grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent last quarter. (The government will release its initial estimate for second quarter G.D.P. on July 29.)
Then, as now, economists said not to despair because they expected growth to pick up "next quarter." But then those hopes were scuttled, and pushed off until tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.
Let's hope the sun comes out sometime soon.

HEADLINE: Q. Who Finished 112th in the Battle of the Brains?

BYLINE: VICTOR MATHER


HIGHLIGHT: Pat Gibson, an Irishman residing in England, retained his title at the World Quizzing Championship, and a City Room correspondent was satisfied with his position.

 BODY:
A quick update for our City Room report on Saturday's World Quizzing Championship.
Pat Gibson, an Irishman residing in England, retained his title. Mr. Gibson scored 186 out of a possible 210 points, 10 ahead of Kevin Ashman of England, a four-time champion, and Tero Kalliolevo of Finland. The top 100 also included people taking translated versions of the test in Belgium, Estonia, India, Ukraine and elsewhere.
Steve Perry was eighth, tying the record for highest finish by an American. Jon Blackwell, the top finisher at the New York site, Dempsey's Pub in the East Village, was 42nd.
To most players, the quiz seemed on balance a bit easier this year, and Mr. Gibson and many others improved their point totals from last year. 
Your City Room correspondent was happy to check in 112th out of 1,491 contestants worldwide. I was smug about knowing that TP Mazembe is a soccer team from the Democratic Republic of Congo and what a gamelan is, but chagrined about being unable to recall the last name of the first woman to win an Oscar for best director (it was she) or the name of Milton Friedman's economic school (hello, Chicago).
With the championships over for another year, the world's know-it-alls will now go their separate ways, to Trivial Pursuit games, tryouts for Jeopardy, and endless Sporcle sessions.
And here are the answers to the questions from Friday's post: What famous sculpture was originally meant to depict Dante in front of the Gates of Hell? The Thinker. What is the main ingredient of the Mexican liqueur Kahlua, which gives it its distinctive taste? Coffee. What South American writer wrote the novels "Paula" and "The House of the Spirits"? Isabel Allende. What is the biggest peninsula in the Adriatic, shared by Croatia, Slovenia and a small part of Italy? Istria. Whose "Orfeo" in 1607 is regarded as the world's oldest opera? Monteverdi. What Frenchwoman is the most successful female cyclist ever, winning 13 world championships from 1985 to 2001? Jeannie Longo. What battle in France in 732 is known in the Muslim world as the Battle of the Court of the Martyrs? Battle of Tours. What short name is given to the Chinese unit of length equal to 500 meters?

HEADLINE: A 'Golden Age' for Gas? 2 Caveats

BYLINE: CLIFFORD KRAUSS


HIGHLIGHT: Uncertainty about nuclear power after the Japanese disaster, an anticipated boom in demand from China and, most important, the wide development of gas fields from unconventional sources like shale rock are driving the fuel's popularity. But environmental concerns or a rise in prices could stand in the way.

 BODY:
Are we entering a golden age of gas?
The answer is yes, according to a report with just that title released on Monday by the International Energy Agency -- as long as the price for natural gas remains low and governments adopt strong regulations to overcome environmental concerns about hydraulic fracturing.
The report projects that natural gas could make up 25 percent of the global energy mix in 2035, up from 21 percent now, replacing coal, nuclear and some power from renewable sources like wind and solar. The drivers of the fuel's growing popularity are uncertainty about nuclear power after the recent Japanese disaster, an anticipated boom in demand from China and, most important, the widespread development of gas fields from unconventional sources like shale rock.
The I.E.A. study made the point that natural gas deposits are spread around the world and offer many countries more energy security. But it cautioned that "an increased share of natural gas in the global energy mix is far from enough on its own to put us on a carbon emissions path consistent with an average global temperature rise of no more than 2 degrees Celsius," or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.The new wave of drilling has produced a sudden glut of gas in the United States, but it has also set off controversy over the drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing, the high-pressure use of water, sand and chemicals to blast fractures into hard shale to unlock natural gas.
Hydraulic fracturing has been used for decades, but it is now combined with horizontal drilling, raising the the possibility that chemicals from fracking fluids could contaminate local water supplies. Some experts have also cautioned that drilling in shale can vent methane -- a powerful greenhouse gas -- into the atmosphere, undermining the argument that natural gas is environmentally more friendly than other fossil fuels.
I caught up with Fatih Birol, the I.E.A.'s chief economist, the other day and asked him if environmental concerns were a major impediment to greatly expanded production of natural gas. He acknowledged that they were a hurdle but added, "The good news is most of the issues related to water and chemical use and the greenhouse gas issue can be addressed by better regulations, stiff regulations and companies using the best practices."

The Madoff scandal has claimed another victim: Florida Stage, a well-regarded Palm Beach theater devoted to putting on new plays. In an open letter on its Web site, the theater said it was filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy after exhausting its operating funds.
The letter indicated that the theater's subscriber base has shrunk from more than 7,000 at its height to fewer than 2,000. "All of our efforts to raise additional donations, despite a loyal and generous core of funders, have failed," wrote Louis Tyrrell, the producing director. Mr. Tyrrell said that while the recession had bitten into ticket sales and donations, many of the theater's most reliable patrons had lost money with the convicted Ponzi scheme operator Bernard Madoff.
Established 24 years ago, Florida Stage had already tried a series of deep cost-cutting measures, including a move to a smaller and cheaper theater, but the belt-tightening was not sufficient.
On the Web site, Florida Stage describes itself as "the nation's largest theater dedicated to producing exclusively new and developing works." Among its world premieres have been works by frequently produced playwrights including William Mastrosimone, Lee Blessing, Deborah Zoe Laufer, Steven Dietz and Thomas Gibbons.
"You are the reason Florida Stage was born and has thrived" Mr. Tyrrell wrote in a farewell note to patrons. "For this, we are eternally grateful. For having to draw our curtain, we are eternally sorrowful."

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Is the Sky Falling?

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus, what's the most important social media lesson you've learned?

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
IS THE SKY FALLING? Our economic problems continue to linger. Private sector hiring and consumer confidence slumped in May. Manufacturing growth is the slowest since 2009. Michael Laparie, political blogger, confirms that the economy "officially stinks." He says, "I believe that high unemployment, which stems from the uncertainty that is currently undermining the confidence of small to mid-sized businesses, should be the No. 1 issue for Republicans in the 2012 elections." Intuit's Small Business Employment Index shows slow growth in May. The share of the population on food stamps grows in most states. Family income numbers make Greg Mankiw pessimistic. The Chicago Fed reports a cooling of business activity. Wall Street begins to panic. Snooki has a tough week. E.J. Dionne says we have an imagination deficit. Greece teeters on the brink (but if this guy isn't concerned why should we be?).
ALMOST FORGOT And cellphones may cause cancer.
THE MISUNDERSTOOD DEFICIT Speaking of deficits, the House votes to not raise the debt ceiling. Stan Collender says "it's not true" that the House's vote demonstrates that there's no support for increasing the government's borrowing limit unless deficit reductions are attached. Christopher Bergin says the poor are to blame for the deficit. David A. Levy and Srinivas Thiruvadanthai say that the federal deficit is America's misunderstood hero: "Without large deficits, corporate profits would plunge, leading to skyrocketing unemployment and another Great Depression." Stephanie Kelton, an economist, also thinks the government should keep spending: "As Uncle Sam's financial position turns negative, your financial position turns positive."
WHY THE SKY ISN'T FALLING Need proof? In Joplin, Mo., where the sky actually did fall, small businesses are mostly optimistic. Labor demand has quietly risen to pre-recession levels. And so has executive pay. Housing prices continue to fall, but many think they are near the bottom. Bloomberg Businessweek's Joshua Zumbrun says that rising rents are going to fuel inflation but renters in Miami are fueling a boom. Construction spending rises. A small-business owner wins the Small Business Administration's Perseverance Award. Gas prices continue to fall. The Restaurant Performance Index is at a three-year high. And here's definitive proof that Russia is no longer a threat to our national security.
THE TOOTSIE ROLL CONNECTION JPMorgan Chase has a new app for small businesses. An economist for polling giant Gallup told a Congressional committee on Wednesday that small businesses are struggling to get credit -- but a report says that small-business borrowing surged in April. The S.B.A. chief discusses her Tootsie Roll connection.
THIS KID COULD RUN A SMALL BUSINESS A Gallup poll says that most workers expect to keep working after retirement age (but I'm not sure this guy will make it). The Telegraph explains the benefits of hiring a manager with military experience. A small-business owner succeeds using personality tests in the hiring process. Recent college grads hear some wisdom. Dick Winters, war hero, explains what makes selfless leaders. Example: "Anticipate problems and prepare to overcome obstacles. Don't wait until you get to the top of the ridge and then make up your mind." Do you think that today's generation, like all the generations before it, is the laziest? I'm betting the manager at this Denny's restaurant does. This kid could run a small business.
MEDIUM IS BEAUTIFUL Kevin Drum says the idea that small businesses are the engine of job creation in the United States is outdated: "Since the recession began in 2008, the biggest net generator of jobs has been neither small businesses nor large businesses. It's been medium-sized businesses." Bill Fournet says small businesses have many advantages over big companies, such as "a small business has the advantage of knowing what it stands for and ensuring that those values are shared with its customers and staff every day."
I'D STILL RATHER BE IN FLORIDA The Hawaii market for buying and selling small businesses is back. An immigration reform bill in Georgia stresses growers. Optimism grows in New Hampshire as unemployment drops below 5 percent. Jellyfish attack Florida bathers. California passes an online sales tax bill and takes aim at high-income residents. The Texas Senate adopts legislation which says that a plaintiff must pay the winning party's legal fees if a complaint is judged to be groundless. Door-to-door salespeople in Daytona Beach are facing regulation and suspicion. The New York Times's Michael Cooper reports that states will need to raise taxes or face more cuts.
POTENTIAL WINNINGS SmallBizTrends lists a bunch of upcoming small-business awards. If you've started a business, completed your first sale or secured outside funding in the past six months, you could be eligible to win the Kauffman Foundation's Startup Open competition. A cool invention expo happens in Pittsburgh next week.
TECH TIPS Apple officially steps into the cloud with its new storage service. A Google search will now show flight schedules. Mobile apps save small businesses $17 billion a year. Skype goes down for a while. Bill Mathews, gadget geek, talks about not letting needless obstacles stand in the way of adopting new technology that can benefit your business.
ISN'T LIVING IN NEW JERSEY RISKY ENOUGH? The Startup Genome Project examines the science of start-ups. Some think New York is the new center for start-ups. A Michigan clean-tech start-up seeks $8 million, gets $500,000. A New Jersey couple risks it all to start a business.
OUR GOVERNMENT AT WORK Sam Graves applauds passage of the Small Business Extension Bill which prevents the expiration of seven S.B.A. programs, including the S.B.I.R. and S.T.T.R. innovation programs. The Internal Revenue Service is demanding full access to small-business accounting systems, reports the Atlantic's Megan McArdle. Robert Wood, a tax lawyer, warns employers about ways they can go to jail.
COME HERE OFTEN? WHAT'S YOUR D.N.A.? A new alarm clock helps oversleepers donate to charity. David Jackson lists 13 niche business ideas. Example: "A company that uses your D.N.A. to maximize the chances of finding compatible physical chemistry with your matches."
WHAT TO READ Business Insider lists 21 books every entrepreneur should read. Andrew Warner learns a lot from New York's real estate queen. The guys at Epic Meal Time make an 84-egg sandwich.
LESSONS FROM SOAP OPERAS Chris Brogan shares marketing's biggest mistake: "We're not always who we sell to, and even then, there are some differences when we're the ones creating the thing we're selling." Many online shopping sites are now using algorithms to analyze personal taste. Marketer Susan Oakes gives us three marketing lessons from soap operas. Example: "Soaps move at their own pace and don't jump from one story to the next ... if you ever feel tempted to change marketing strategy, branding or communication, take a few moments to ask yourself what is the business reason for it."
SUCCEEDING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA According to a survey, almost 70 percent of small businesses are using social media. Users say they're more likely to buy if a business answers their questions on Twitter. Valentine Belonwu lists 200 of the most fearless women online and in social media. Lisa Barone explains how social media increases her consulting revenue. Pew reports that 13 percent of online adults use Twitter. Alexandra Samuel offers 11 social media tools that can help put us on the right strategic path. Heidi Cohen explains how to have a winning social media personality: "Give people a reason to pay attention. Being honest and open is refreshing; people can spot the difference." Forty-six million Americans check social media sites multiple times a day.
THE WEEK AHEAD With not much data expected, we may get a break from bad news. Besides Thursday's weekly unemployment claims, watch for a growing trade deficit and the latest budget balance numbers on Friday. More important, June 7 is National Chocolate Ice Cream Day.
THIS WEEK'S AWARDS
WAYS TO ACHIEVE GOALS A.J. Perisho offers six steps for achieving goals. The first three: "1. Identify the goal and the time frame for its achievement. 2. Identify where you are now in relation to your goal. 3. Break the goal into yearly chunks."
(ONE MORE) REASON TO MOVE TO HAWAII A Hawaiian guy runs his law firm out of a storage unit. "I use my cellphone. I have my photocopier and desk, bookshelves with my Hawaii Revised Statutes and the Hawaii Digest, and some of my manuals. I'm looking to practice for, at the most, another 10 years. The price is right and so long as the cases keep on coming, I'll stay here."
WAYS TO LOOK LIKE AN AMATEUR Cameron Chapman suggests five social-media mistakes that make us look like an amateur and cost us sales. Example: "Too Much Self-Promotion. The problem comes in when all you ever do is post self-promotional updates. It's the equivalent of e-mail spam, and adds little or no value for your followers and fans. In a lot of cases, you'll alienate your current customers and they'll unfollow you."

HEADLINE: Artifacts | Happiness on Wheels

BYLINE: LINDA YABLONSKY


HIGHLIGHT: The new Fiat 500 Sport, a snub-nosed little roadster, proves to be surprisingly spacious and stylish. 

 BODY:
Driving makes me happy, especially in the summer. It isn't just the lure of the open road. It's also having wheels to get around a night of art openings in New York in the style they (and I) demand. That's not an easy get.
However small their carbon footprint or large their capacity for speed, most cars today are anything but cool. Those ballooning dashboards with their threatening airbags, the low-slung seats that frustrate any attempt to slide in or out with any dignity, the ultraconservative bodies in their humdrum colors - they're all a bore. I like a car with character. Usually that means an old classic, like the red Chevy Nova I drove for 12 years and still miss. At least I did, until I took the new Fiat 500 Sport for a test drive and felt happy all the time.
Well, almost all. The snub-nosed little roadster, which was prodded back to existence by Lapo Elkann, the grandson of Gianni Agnelli, is just now rolling out on the streets of New York. It's not perfect. It hesitated too much when accelerating from a stop, for one thing. And despite its precision stabilizers and antilock brakes, the car is so light that it skidded once on the muddy curve of a country road. That shouldn't have happened - not at 20 mph. But design-wise, the 500 put the retro Mini and VW Beetle (the cars it's here to beat) in the shade.
"It's just so chic!" one friend shrieked as he slipped into the passenger seat. And he was right. The simplified exterior was an unusual opalescent white, and the interior almost unbearably cute. It had charcoal side panels that dovetailed nicely with the red armchair-like seats, and the dashboard - the best part - was a white plastic reminiscent of an iPod.
Actually, taking the 500 on the road was like driving an iPod. It's as wired as any luxury car today, though its base price is only $15,500. Remote buttons for the Bose sound and Bluetooth communications systems were embedded in the race-car-like steering wheel, and the digital instrument panel was set into a hooded port that looked something like a nautical deck vent. It took forever to load the address book on my Blackberry so I could voice-dial a call, but when I did the signal was remarkably clear.
Still, the Fiat 500 is seriously compact. Forget about taking on more than one passenger who isn't a small child or will-o-the-wisp thin. Though two adults could, in theory, sit in the back seats just to drive around town, they would have to remain in a strictly upright position - something the round, lollipop headrests make both easy and comfortable.
The front is another story. Thanks to a tiltable wheel and easily adjustable seats, it can accommodate arms and legs of any length. When I asked a 6-foot-4 friend to get behind the wheel, he was amazed by both headroom and legroom. "I'd buy one," he said.
The last time Fiat sold cars on the American market was more than a quarter-century ago, so I couldn't help feeling disappointed when it didn't stop traffic. A few people did give me curious stares, and one man shouted, "What the hell kind of car is that!" But it didn't provoke the excitement I was hoping for.
Another disappointment was my test car's automatic transmission, which was no fun at all - and this is a car you want for fun. A five-speed manual transmission is standard on the Sport, which fairly begs for the greater engagement of a stick shift. Time and again, I found myself going much faster than I realized. The car had cruise control, but that's just riding, not driving. Then again, the knob handle on the black gear box rested not between the seats but just below the dash, placed better than any car I've ever driven. Which is saying something.
The original 1960s Cinqucento had a rear engine. Now it's stuffed under the hood. The rear seats fold down to make room for more cargo, but at heart this is a city car through and through. You can park it where larger cars would never dare to go, and it's good on fuel economy, even in heavy traffic.
All of this is beside the point when it's the look that counts. If the Fiat 500 looks like a joke next to a Mercedes, it's a good one: whoever drives it always has the last laugh.

HEADLINE: DealBook Portraits: Laurence D. Fink

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG and MAC WILLIAM BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: In the latest DealBook Portrait video, Laurence Fink of BlackRock talks about his fallout with Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman, his failed attempts to get a job at Goldman Sachs and his early trading stumble. 

 BODY:
Laurence D. Fink has come along way since his days working in his family's shoe store in California. As the head of BlackRock, Mr. Fink oversees the world's largest asset manager. The financial firm is also the go-to adviser for companies and governments. During the financial crisis, the federal government looked to BlackRock to help value billions of dollars in soured real estate assets. 
BlackRock is not to be confused with Blackstone, the big private equity company run by his old rival, Stephen A. Schwarzman. BlackRock was once a part of Blackstone, but Mr. Fink and Mr. Schwarzman had a falling out, resulting in the 1994 sale of BlackRock to PNC Financial Services Group for $240 million. 
Today, Mr. Fink says there are no hard feelings. 
"It was a very bitter divorce," he said. "But I don't regret it. I am larger." In the latest DealBook Portrait, Mr. Fink talks about his relationship with Mr. Schwarzman, his failed attempts to get a job at Goldman Sachs and his early trading stumble.
"I learned how in these big giants firms then they are your partners when you do really well, and I found out not great partners when you do poorly."

HEADLINE: Goolsbee Leaving as Top Economic Adviser

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, will leave the White House to return to the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
Austan Goolsbee, a longtime adviser to President Obama and the only economist left on his core economic team, plans to leave as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers by September after a year in the job to return to the University of Chicago.
 With the recovery flagging, the White House is eager to name a successor to Mr. Goolsbee this summer and is considering several academic economists, an administration official said on Monday. The job requires Senate confirmation.
 "Since I first ran for the U.S. Senate, Austan has been a close friend and one of my most trusted advisers," Mr. Obama said in a statement late Monday. "Over the past several years, he has helped steer our country out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and although there is still much work ahead, his insights and counsel have helped lead us toward an economy that is growing and creating millions of jobs. He is one of America's great economic thinkers." 
 Mr. Goolsbee, a left-of center economist who has advised Mr. Obama since he was a state senator, has been part of the inner circle since the earliest campaign days. He was the chief economic adviser at the Chicago headquarters and would call on outsiders on occasion for expertise.
 When Mr. Obama took office, he named Mr. Goolsbee as one of the three members of the Council of Economic Advisers; when the first chairman, Christina Romer, left last year to return to teaching at the University of California at Berkeley, Mr. Obama promoted Mr. Goolsbee to the top chair.

HEADLINE: The 10-Word Question That Could Cost Obama the Election

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: When Ronald Reagan asked voters "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" dwelling on President Jimmy Carter's economic and foreign policy failures, voters decided that they weren't, and Mr. Reagan became the 40th president. Against this background, it's worth considering the argument that President Barack Obama and the Republican nominee will have about the state of the economy.

 BODY:
The year 1980 was one in which economic forecasting models were in agreement that the economy had slumped too significantly to allow President Jimmy Carter to win re-election. Unemployment was at 7.5 percent and inflation was at 9.7 percent. Per-capita GDP and disposable income growth, adjusted for inflation, had been negative over the course of Mr. Carter's term. The economy was officially in recession for much of the election year. 
But Mr. Carter -- despite approval ratings in the 30s or low 40s -- was holding his own against Ronald Reagan. Some polls, even well after Labor Day, showed the horse race to be tied or even had Mr. Carter with a slim lead.
Mr. Reagan would win overwhelmingly, however, claiming 44 states (even Massachusetts and New York) while limiting Mr. Carter to just 41 percent of the vote. He surged in the final week of the campaign after he posed the following question to Americans in the presidential debate of October 28, the first and only such event in which he and Mr. Carter participated together:
"Are you better off than you were four years ago?" Mr. Reagan asked, dwelling on Mr. Carter's economic and foreign policy failures. Voters decided that they weren't, and Mr. Reagan became the 40th president.
*-*
This is one of the few stories which satisfies both those who take a more deterministic view toward presidential elections and those who instead see the results as more malleable based on the skills and qualifications of the candidates. For the former group, it is proof positive that the "fundamentals" catch up with a candidate sooner or later; for the latter, it is a testament to Mr. Reagan's political acumen.
I take the middle view here -- the fundamentals matter, but campaigns do, too. Many of these models, besides, are predicting a very close election -- while the consensus view of economists is that although another recession is unlikely, the recovery is likely to proceed in fits and starts.
Against this background, it's worth considering the argument that President Obama and the Republican nominee will have about the state of the economy -- and how the focal point of the electorate may change as we move into an election year.
Mr. Obama's approval ratings are relatively strong given the sour mood of the country. An average of current polls has them at about 50 percent and although they may be somewhat inflated because of the killing of Osama bin Laden, even at their nadir they were not much lower than 45 percent. (Although this could easily change, for the time being Mr. Obama remains the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to have never seen his Gallup approval rating drop below 40 percent.)
By contrast, most polls show that a significant majority of the country is dissatisfied with the condition of the country. Since 1974, CNN and Time Magazine have routinely posed a question in their polls that asks respondents to tell them "how well are things going in the country today". So far this year, an average of 39 percent of respondents have said things are going "very well" or "fairly well", while an average of 60 percent have said they're going "pretty badly" or "very badly". By contrast, Mr. Obama's approval has averaged 52 percent so far this year in CNN surveys, against 46 percent disapproval. 
Usually, CNN's presidential approval ratings and the "going well" question are in better alignment with one another. In the chart below, I've plotted the annual averages for these figures from CNN and Time polls for all years since 1974. (Gallup approval ratings are substituted for CNN/Time data prior to 1993 as I don't have their approval ratings handy prior to that year.) The first three years of Mr. Obama's term are represented by the red data points. 
All three of Mr. Obama's numbers are considerably above the regression line formed from the other presidents. That is, his approval ratings are higher than they "should" be based on the mood of the country. In a year like this one, for instance, where just 39 percent of people think things are going at least fairly well in the country, we'd expect the president's approval rating to be closer to 40 percent than 50 percent.
Some of this is explained by the fact that Mr. Obama is relatively new to the White House. The second chart, below, is based on a regression equation which attempts to predict presidential approval based on CNN's mood-of-the-country question, plus the number of years that the president has occupied the White House. For each year that he serves, a president's approval rating declines by roughly 2 points holding the mood of the country constant -- that is, voters hold the president to a higher standard the longer that he's been in office.
Even with this adjustment, however, Mr. Obama's approval numbers are overperforming. The equation would predict that Mr. Obama have an approval rating averaging 39 percent last year and 44 percent this year. Instead, those numbers in CNN's polls have been 48 percent and 52 percent, respectively.
So what does this mean? It may mean that voters are in fact cutting Mr. Obama quite a bit of slack for the difficulties he inherited from President George W. Bush. (In another CNN poll conducted last month, just 33 percent of respondents placed more blame on Mr. Obama and the Democrats for the direction of the economy, while 55 percent blamed Mr. Bush and the Republicans.) It may also mean that Mr. Obama is benefiting from strong personal favorability ratings: he's always scored pretty highly when voters are asked questions like whether he is a "strong and decisive leader", whether he "cares about people like you", and whether he is likable. 
The important question, though, is whether Mr. Obama can sustain those advantages as we head in to 2012. Here's one reason to think that he might not: the "going well" number and presidential approval have historically come into much sharper alignment with one another in presidential election years. Here is a comparison of the two figures in election years only:
Note that the correlation has improved from moderately strong to near-perfect. Americans may think of their presidents in fundamentally different ways in election years, taking their president's performance and their satisfaction with the direction of the country to be one in the same.
After all, if a good case can be made that things are going well in the country, the president can run commercials like Mr. Reagan's "Morning in America" ads from 1984. But if the case is weak, you can be certain that the president's opponents will be posing questions to the electorate much like the one that Reagan did in 1980. Note, for example, Tim Pawlenty's recent video previewing his presidential campaign. Although there's a lot of glossy biographical detail in the video, the punchline comes about 40 seconds in when Mr. Pawlenty stares at the camera and says "the truth is, our country's in big trouble." That is, of course, the fundamental argument that any competent opposition candidate will be making.
*-*
This is not to say Mr. Obama is doomed. He's still a favorite, in my view, to be re-elected. Unlike Mr. Carter -- who was almost as vulnerable on foreign policy as on domestic affairs because of the Iran hostage crisis -- this category is a strength for Mr. Obama. At the very minimum, he'll be able to cite the killing of Osama bin Laden. Depending on how things proceed over the next 18 months, he might also be able to note the winding down of the wars in Iraq, and possibly Afghanistan. While the political turmoil in the Middle East present risks to Mr. Obama, even something like the revolution in Egypt could be adopted as a point in his favor -- a sign that the world is changing, and for the better.
In addition, Mr. Carter represents the only case since 1896 when a party ceded control of the White House in the next election after regaining it. Quite often, there there is something gone awry with the country when the White House changes hands (an economic collapse, an unpopular war, a crisis of confidence) and the incoming party is given more of a grace period to reconcile the country's affairs. 
If there is a credible case to be made that the economy is getting better -- when coupled with what is likely to be a strong case on foreign policy -- then Mr. Obama is likely to be given the benefit of the doubt by voters. But if you instead see the White House spending more of its time blaming Mr. Bush for the state of the economy, that's a sign that they're afraid of Mr. Reagan's question -- and may have reached a stage where they're the underdogs in the race.

HEADLINE: Oil Drilling Off Cuba Raises Specter of What-If

BYLINE: CLIFFORD KRAUSS


HIGHLIGHT: The prospect of a blowout in Cuban waters may give the Obama administration an incentive to open the way for emergency assistance from the United States.

 BODY:
Florida voters have long opposed offshore oil drilling along their coasts, and given that Florida is a swing state in presidential elections, they have gotten their way. But it looks as if drilling is coming to nearby Cuban waters as early as the fall when the Spanish oil company Repsol is due to drill an exploratory well.
 There isn't much the Obama administration can do about drilling in Cuban waters, of course, with relations Washington and Havana stuck in cold-war limbo. Yet environmentalists and even some oil executives are concerned that a well blowout in Cuban waters could bring disaster to the Florida Keys. And with an American trade embargo against Cuba still in place, it would be difficult for oil companies to get equipment and other help from nearby American facilities.
 But there is some movement on the issue. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told reporters on Friday that Repsol has promised to voluntarily comply with United States drilling regulations and allow American regulators to board its rig for inspection before it starts drilling. Given the regulatory lapses that are thought to have contributed to the Deepwater Horizon disaster last year, that may not make Floridians feel much better. Here's a little prediction: this issue is not going to go away, and it may even give the Obama administration an opening to soften the embargo to guarantee American help in the event of a disaster. It would be interesting to see how that policy would play in Floridian politics.

HEADLINE: Vermont's Move Toward Single-Payer Health Insurance

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: A new universal health plan in Vermont represents a left-wing alternative to the changes being put into effect at the federal level, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
New England seems to be the testing ground for health insurance reform. The Affordable Care Act, now often called Obamacare by its critics, was modeled on health-insurance mandates put into place in Massachusetts under the governorship of Mitt Romney, a Republican, who announced last week that he was formally seeking his party's presidential nomination in 2012.
Now Vermont has passed legislation moving the state toward a Canadian-style universal, single-payer health-insurance system, to be phased in alongside national health-care changes. The plan relies heavily on the prospect of waivers that will allow it to reallocate some federal Medicaid funds and on other sources of money that have not yet fully specified.
The new law calls for establishment of a five-member board to set reimbursement rates for health-care providers and streamline administration into a single, unified system called Green Mountain Care that will cover all Vermont residents. In the long run, it aims to replace fee-for-service payment with a system that will pay health-care providers a specific amount of money to care for a specific population, providing incentives for preventive care.
The basic outlines represent a left-wing alternative to the health-insurance changes being put in place under the Obama administration, with a stronger commitment to equitable public financing, a single insurance pool and less reliance on the market.
Why has Vermont moved into the vanguard? The possible explanations range from the structural to the personal.
Vermont has less income inequality and racial and ethnic diversity than Massachusetts (despite increasing inequality and diversity in recent years) and probably has higher levels of "social capital."
It is a small state, with a population of less than 650,000. Private health-insurance companies have less to lose in Vermont than elsewhere, and their lobbyists may have been distracted by the national debate.
Single-payer advocates organized effectively around a "health care is a human right" campaign. The Vermont Workers' Center, affiliated with the national organization Jobs With Justice, played a vital role in building a robust political coalition in support of change.
Vermont has long been represented in Congress (first as a representative, currently as a senator) by Bernard Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist and is a longtime advocate of universal single-payer health insurance.
Gov. Peter Shumlin, a successful small-business owner, was elected in November after he made a strong case during his fall campaign for the positive impact that single-payer insurance could have on small businesses and job creation.
All these factors enhanced the political impact of economic evidence, which shows that single-payer health insurance can create a simpler, more streamlined payment system, cut administrative costs and expand access to high-quality care.
In testimony before the Vermont State Legislature, William Hsaio, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, described his experience designing single-payer health-care systems in several countries, most recently Taiwan. He also presented the results of a detailed analysis of the health-care system of Vermont, providing estimates of potential savings from three different strategies and making a strong case for the single-payer option. (A report written by Professor Hsaio, Steven Kappel and Jonathan Gruber provides more detail.)
My University of Massachusetts Amherst colleague Gerald Friedman, active in efforts to promote a single-payer system in this state, estimates that similar changes in Massachusetts could sharply reduce the cost of billing and processing insurance claims, generating savings of 17 percent. As he puts it, a universal single-payer approach is not just more affordable; in the long run, it may be the only affordable option.
The current Massachusetts health-insurance system, like that emerging on the national level, requires residents to buy health insurance and provides subsidies only to low-income families. As a result, it leaves many people vulnerable to increases in the cost of insurance and may also create political resentments among those with incomes just above the subsidy eligibility level, who are forced to buy insurance they can ill afford.
The system is not "wildly unpopular," as some conservatives assert, but it's not wildly popular either.
As Vermont moves forward with its plan, a fascinating standard of comparison should emerge. The Canadian single-payer system grew out of successful innovations in the province of Saskatchewan, which led other provinces to follow suit. Here in Massachusetts, many of us are looking hopefully over our shoulder at the Green Mountain State.

HEADLINE: Romney's Primary Task: Pitching Pragmatism

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's party keeps moving away from him, but the national agenda keeps moving toward him.

 BODY:
STRATHAM, N.H. - Mitt Romney's second presidential bid, and with it the 2012 Republican race, will turn on the interaction between two divergent trends.
His party keeps moving away from him.
But the national agenda keeps moving toward him.
Four years ago, Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, entered the race for the Republican nomination with a reputation as a pro-business pragmatist with moderation embedded in his DNA. Neither his expertise nor his instincts matched the political moment.
That campaign began after "values voters" helped President George W. Bush win re-election in 2004. The pastor-politician Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, won the allegiance of the conservative Christians at the heart of the party's base.
Mr. Bush's war in Iraq made national security the dominant issue in 2008. And so the leading national security candidate, Senator John McCain of Arizona, captured the Republican nomination.
This time, each variable has shifted. 
The Republican electorate has continued to evolve in ways ill-suited to Mr. Romney's record and demeanor. But the issue that best suits him, the troubled American economy, has virtually silenced talk of anything else.
That resets the challenge facing Mr. Romney, who enters the 2012 race as a different candidate.
Ideological Trend
The modern Republican Party began emerging a half-century ago. At that time, Mr. Romney's father ran for president as a Michigan governor who backed the civil rights movement and pushed through his state's first-ever income tax. The moderate faction he championed has dwindled ever since.
By 2005, a Pew Research Center analysis described three principal elements of the Republican coalition, each overwhelmingly conservative. They were affluent, pro-business "Enterprisers"; religiously observant "Social Conservatives"; and populist "Pro-Government Conservatives" who favored more aggressive regulation of the private sector.
Last month, Pew's updated analysis of core Republican constituencies found that they have become more homogenous and ideological. Some 90 percent are whites, up from 83 percent in 2005; and 51 percent are over 50 years old, up from 42 percent.
White evangelical Christians represent 41 percent of these core constituents, up from 36 percent in 2005. Gone, in the Tea Party era, are the so-called pro-government conservatives; in fact, 8 in 10 core Republican voters agreed that "government is almost always wasteful and inefficient."
Those shifts don't benefit Mr. Romney. Many evangelicals mistrust his Mormon faith, and small-government conservatives loathe the universal health coverage mandate he enacted in Massachusetts - a state-level variant of President Obama's sweeping health care law.
Yet this campaign's economic backdrop gives Mr. Romney a critical countervailing factor. Weak growth and high unemployment have placed the debate squarely on the subject where, by heritage and experience, Mr. Romney is most at home.
Focus on Jobs
That reshaped context was on display in New Hampshire as Mr. Romney announced his candidacy last week.
His kickoff speech contrasted sharply with the one he gave four years earlier. Then, he sought a breakthrough in Iowa, where a 2008 entrance poll found that evangelical Christians made up 60 percent of Republican caucus-goers.
"I believe in God," Mr. Romney said, invoking "the sanctity of life," "enduring values and morality" and the need for "marriage before children" to strengthen families.
Now his strategy centers on New Hampshire, where evangelical Christians represent a distinct minority. In his only religious reference, he observed that "we go to different churches, or maybe don't go to church so much."
To compete with Mr. McCain, Mr. Romney spoke repeatedly in 2007 of battling a "radical violent jihad." This time, in a cursory discussion of foreign policy, he praised Mr. Obama for dispatchingOsama bin Laden.
Nodding to the Tea Party, Mr. Romney promised a Washington that "learns to respect the Constitution, including the 10th Amendment." That reference to powers reserved for the states meshes well with his defense of his health plan as an appropriate state-level solution.
But Mr. Romney's speech concentrated on something he didn't mention in 2007: adding American jobs. He tied that to his work at the buyout firm Bain Capital, which grew "from 10 employees to hundreds."
"If you want to create jobs, it helps to have had a job," he said. "From my first day in office, my No. 1 job will be to see that America once again is No. 1 in job creation."
His challenge is selling economic pragmatism to ideological primary voters. As the nominal Republican front-runner, he remains vulnerable to rivals who can appeal broadly and strike more resonant emotional chords.
"In a general election, it's very powerful," said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster. "The problem is, you've got to get there."
But at least Mr. Romney can confront intraparty headwinds on his most comfortable subject. In 2008, his discomfort with the focus of the debate seemed to be part of his problem.
New Hampshire primary exit polls that year showed him receiving just 15 percent among voters preferring a candidate to "say what he believes." The Pew pollster Andrew Kohut noted that as Mr. Romney tries to defend his early lead here in 2012, "It's who he is that will be the issue."

HIGHLIGHT: Obama has conspired to raise gas prices -- and he stole the strawberries too. 

 BODY:
Via Steve Benen, I see that Haley Barbour has the explanation for higher gas prices. It's not demand from China and instability in the Middle East; it's a deliberate conspiracy on the part of the Obama administration (pdf):
BOB SCHIEFFER: Somebody told me that you actually said this week you think that the President is trying to drive up energy policy, energy prices on purpose. Did you say that?
GOVERNOR HALEY BARBOUR: No question about that. I mean, this administration's policies clearly have been to drive up the cost of energy, so Americans would use less of it. That's environmental policy. That's not energy policy. But that's their policy. They think it will give you less pollution. Make these alternative energy sources-- excuse me, Bob, more competitive. When-- when Barack Obama became president, gasoline was about a dollar eighty a gallon. And now it's up to four dollars a gallon. Why should we be surprised when his secretary of energy said in 2008, Steven Chu, what we really need in the United States is to get the price of gas up to where it in Europe.
BOB SCHIEFFER (overlapping): Well, you--
GOVERNOR HALEY BARBOUR: Well, we may need that in Berkeley but we don't need that in Biloxi, I can tell you that.
BOB SCHIEFFER: I've-- I've-- I've-- I've got to say governor, I've heard a lot of people give a lot of different reasons that energy prices have gone up but I believe you must be the first to say, he did it on purpose.
GOVERNOR HALEY BARBOUR: No, I don't think that at all. Barack Obama told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2008, under my cap-and-trade plan, you-- the electricity rates will necessarily skyrocket. Not my words Barack Obama's words--necessarily skyrocket. Now why would you try to push a cap-and-trade tax through to drive up the cost of electricity? Well, because they believe it will mean we'll use less electricity. There'll be less emissions. And so, I don't-- I don't back off from that one iota. And it is hurting the economy. The-- energy is a hundred percent of the economy. Energy is the life blood of the economy. That they've tried to raise the price of oil, they've tried to raise taxes, they've tried to raise the price of coal, they've tried to make it harder to get permits. So I don't-- I don't think there's any question that this is the policy of this administration.
Schieffer then drops the subject.
I know the craziness of this stuff isn't as easy to point out as the birther thing, but it's in the same league. And this is a sitting governor, a prominent member of the party, someone who has presidential ambitions that might even have been reasonable if he didn't make so many people think of Boss Hogg.
This gets at the heart of the current pundit problem. If you say that one of our two major parties has gone completely off the deep end, you're considered shrill and extreme. But if you don't say that, if you pretend that someone like Barbour is a reasonable guy with somewhat different views, then you're fundamentally lying about reality.

HEADLINE: The Fine Print of Goldman's Subprime Bet

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The Senate report about the subprime position of Goldman Sachs includes enough errors to raise some red flags about its conclusions. 

 BODY:
The vampire squid haters won't like this column.
For the past several weeks, I have been trying to understand if Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs's chief executive, could have perjured himself - as Senator Carl Levin has suggested - when he testified last year in front of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and declared, "We didn't have a massive short against the housing market."
Based on the subcommittee's report, which was referred to the Justice Department, I wrote a column raising questions about Mr. Blankfein's comments. At the time, his testimony seemed ridiculous in the face of evidence that Mr. Levin presented, which showed that the firm had regularly made large bets against the subprime market.
But upon further reporting - talking with executives at Goldman, who pointed me to other documents, and with officials in Washington, and then poring through the report, following the footnotes to the original sources and then cross-referencing them against other public records - I have come to a different and perhaps unsatisfying conclusion for those readers looking for a big scalp: Mr. Blankfein wasn't lying.
That's not to suggest Goldman always behaved well. There are other assertions in the subcommittee's report that detail some pretty egregious activity by certain executives.
But after comparing the report with publicly available filings and documents, there are enough questions about the accuracy of certain parts of the Senate report to raise some red flags.
Take this example: The report unequivocally states that in 2007, Goldman "reported net revenues of $11.6 billion, of which $3.7 billion was generated by the structured products group in the mortgage department, primarily as a result of its subprime investment activities."
The sentence was meant to show that Goldman's shorting of the housing market had provided a large percentage of the firm's revenue that year. The sentence in the report even included a handy citation for the information.
But in 2007, Goldman Sachs reported revenue of $45.98 billion, not $11.6 billion. That's a big difference.
When I spoke to Robert L. Roach, a counsel and chief investigator for the Senate subcommittee who helped draft the report, he said, "We made a mistake." He said it was a "typo" and insisted that "we weren't trying to cook anything."
The figure was Goldman's net earnings, not its revenue. He pointed out that later in the report - 93 pages later in a different context - the report accurately described Goldman's revenue as $45.98 billion.
Mr. Roach protested that Goldman had never brought the mistake to his attention in the two months since the report was published. There has clearly been much antagonism between Goldman and the various bodies investigating the firm, even as Goldman says it is cooperating. Staff members of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission complained when Goldman dumped hundreds of thousands of documents on it; Goldman said privately that the commission was engaging in political theater.
Yet there are other sections in the Senate report that appear to go beyond sloppiness. The report says that Goldman's structured products group made $3.7 billion, mostly by going short in 2007. That is correct. But the report omitted the total net revenue for the mortgage department, which included structured products.
According to a document Goldman Sachs provided to the subcommittee and made public on its Web site a year ago, Goldman had "less than $500 million of net revenue from residential mortgage-related products - approximately 1 percent of the firm's overall net revenues."
In other words, while one part of the department had gone short, another part had gone long.
So when Mr. Blankfein contended that the firm was "not consistently or significantly net 'short the market' in residential mortgage-related products in 2007 and 2008" the numbers - if you believe them - are on his side.
Mr. Roach said he was unaware of where the figure of less than $500 million came from, although in the document that Goldman provided the subcommittee, a series of bar charts broke down its exposure for every quarter of 2007 and 2008. Mr. Roach pointed to a different document that showed the firm had made $1.13 billion.
This isn't meant to say that part of the firm didn't go short - it did and the firm has repeatedly said so. But the suggestion that the short was a huge directional bet by the firm to profit off a real estate collapse may not completely stand up.
One document the subcommittee cited as evidence that Goldman had been "massively short" was a presentation by Josh Birnbaum. Mr. Birnbaum, a Goldman trader who ran the structured products group, tried to persuade his bosses that he and his group were deserving of a bigger bonus because of their successful short positions. To make his point, Mr. Birnbaum said that "the shorts were not a hedge," a quote that Mr. Levin's report brandished as proof that Goldman was lying about its short position.
But it's hard to give much weight to the quote. Left out of the subcommittee's report was the answer Mr. Birnbaum gave under oath during his testimony. When asked whether the shorts had been hedged, Mr. Birnbaum said, "I was not aware of what the firm as a whole was - what the firm's position on mortgages was."
After his testimony, when he realized that the government had him saying "the shorts were not a hedge" in a presentation, he doubled back. He tried to suggest in written testimony that he believed what he had originally written in his presentation but that his oral testimony had also been accurate - a hard circle to square.
More important, if Goldman made only $500 million in net revenue from its residential mortgages when Mr. Birnbaum's unit made $3.7 billion from shorts, it is clear that it also had huge long positions. Had it been "massively short," the firm should have made much more than $500 million.
Mr. Levin's office referred questions about the report to the permanent subcommittee.
The senator also made use of Goldman's "top sheets" as evidence the firm was short the residential housing market. The report says that a top sheet from June 25, 2007, shows that the firm was short $13.9 billion. That would be quite a big short position.
But in studying the document, the subcommittee may have mixed apples and oranges. It added in $4.1 billion worth of short positions for commercial real estate to residential real estate. And the subcommittee ignored the footnote on the bottom of the document that the "top sheet" had not included long positions in other parts of the business that people close to the firm said were in excess of $5 billion.
Subtract those positions, and Goldman had a net short position of less than $5 billion in residential mortgages - not nearly triple that.
Goldman haters will think that this column is an apology or spin for the firm. That wasn't the point. Of course, some of what Goldman and others did ahead of the financial crisis is deeply troubling - and possibly even illegal - and they should be punished if a crime was committed. But on this particular score - about Mr. Blankfein's testimony - the evidence is far from convincing.
As even Mr. Roach acknowledged, "It's about how you define 'massive' and 'large' - and I'm not trying to be cute."

HEADLINE: Bank and Energy Shares Reflect Wall Street's Unease

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks fell for a fourth consecutive day on Monday, led lower by banks and energy companies. Persistent concerns about a slowing economy also weighed on the broader market.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 61.30 points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,089.96. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 13.99 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,286.17. It was the first closing below 1,300 for the S.& P. index since March 23. The Nasdaq composite fell 30.22, or 1.1 percent, to 2,702.56. 
All 10 industry groups in the S.& P. index fell. Energy and financial companies each lost 2 percent.
The nation's biggest banks declined 2 percent or more, after a speech by a Federal Reserve governor on Friday indicating that banks may be required to set aside more cash to cover potential losses. If the proposal were to take effect, banks would be left with less money to lend, which could hurt earnings. Citigroup and Bank of America each lost about 4 percent, and JPMorgan Chase shares dropped 2.5 percent.
Airline stocks fell after an industry group cut its profit estimates for this year by half. The group blamed disasters in Japan, unrest in the Middle East and higher fuel prices. Delta Air Lines and AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, each lost more than 3 percent.
Investors also remained focused on the grim unemployment report released last Friday, which sent stocks sharply lower that day.
''Wall Street came back, quickly and very strongly, at a time when the populace was still weak in terms of low job growth and low wage growth,'' said Daniel Penrod, a senior industry analyst at California Credit Union League. ''That appeared to be overly optimistic.''
The Labor Department reported that employers added only 54,000 new workers in May. The unemployment rate inched up to 9.1 percent from 9 percent.
Pending regulation and lawsuits also affected some individual companies. Lorillard, the tobacco company, fell 7 percent, the most of any company in the S.& P. 500 index. Investors are concerned that the Food and Drug Administration could ban menthol cigarettes. The company makes the most popular menthol cigarette, Newport.
The oil field services company Halliburton fell 4.5 percent after the Supreme Court ruled that shareholders could pursue a class-action lawsuit that claimed the company had inflated its stock price.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 3/32, to 101 3/32, and the yield was 3 percent, up from 2.99 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Clean Energy in New Jersey

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Gov. Christie Abandons a Good Idea'' (editorial, May 31): 
Gov. Chris Christie's decision to withdraw New Jersey from the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a troubling display of ideological flip-flopping and special-interest kowtowing.
Since the initiative's inception, energy costs to consumers are down 15 to 30 percent, almost 18,000 jobs have been created, and the region's economy has grown by more than $2.3 billion, yet the governor claims that the program has been ineffective.
After we spent years positioning New Jersey as a responsible leader in the fight to stem climate change, the governor is setting us on a backward trajectory.
Experts have been warning us for years about the effect our dependency on fossil fuels will have on our climate, not to mention our national security because of our heavy reliance on foreign oil.
At what point will the needs of the human race surpass the desire to appeal to a conservative ideology for personal political attainment?

HEADLINE: City Assisting Food Industry With Space And Money

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Several of New York's largest food factories have shut down in the past two years, but city officials are taking steps to preserve the industry.
Rather than conceding what is left of the city's food-making trade, officials are arranging new spaces for kitchens and processing plants for small companies and securing private financing to help established food makers grow. On Tuesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, plan to announce that the city will put $1 million into a $10 million loan pool. The rest of the money will come from the Goldman Sachs investment bank.
Food makers have been one of the few sources of growth recently in the city's industrial sector. While overall employment in manufacturing has shrunk by almost two-thirds since 1990 and continued to slide last year, the number of jobs in food-making businesses rose by about 6 percent last year, according to statistics kept by the city. 
Even more important is the steady growth in the number of food companies started before and during the recession, said Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. Although New York lost some big employers, including the Stella D'oro cookie factory in the Bronx and the Wonder Bread bakery in Queens, the total number of food businesses has been rising, he said.
Of course, some of the new companies were started by people who lost jobs on Wall Street or in other high-paying professions during the financial crisis, and many involve just one or two people baking cupcakes or cookies in their apartments. Still, city officials say they have seen evidence that the trend is sustainable and could create a substantial number of jobs for less-skilled workers and new immigrants.
''There's a significant chance that a large percentage of these businesses will not be successful at all or will not be able to scale up significantly,'' Mr. Pinsky said. ''But you don't need everyone to succeed. You want as high a percentage as possible to continue operating.
''You then need some of the business to go from small to medium sizes, and you want a small percent to really succeed and become large businesses.''
To improve the odds, the Economic Development Corporation is revamping several spaces, including the former Federal Building in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, to suit light manufacturing operations like food making. Next, it will look for a small-business lender to manage the $10 million loan fund established to help finance the growth of some promising small companies.
Alicia Glen, a managing director of the Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group, said the food industry ''struck us as a pretty good bet to make'' because it offered opportunities for poor people and immigrants to find well-paying jobs in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Ms. Glen said the industry-specific fund would be a first for her group.
Speaker Quinn said these initiatives would provide ''the much-needed financial lifeline to not only turn aspiring entrepreneurs into small business owners, but will also strengthen the existing industrial businesses.''
Adam Friedman, the director of the Pratt Center for Community Development, said he thought city officials could be on the right track because ''New York is like this great big test kitchen.''
Mr. Friedman said the mix of cultures and steady flow of immigrants in the city created ''new ideas for food,'' some of which could become popular enough to be exported regionally or nationally.
New York would then have to fight to keep businesses from moving, Mr. Friedman said, because ''after they get to a certain size, it may make sense for them to leave.'' But that usually does not happen until a business needs more than 30,000 square feet of working space, he said. ''That's the tipping point.''

HEADLINE: Unemployment Solutions, From the O.E.C.D.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Against Learned Helplessness'' (column, May 30):
I take issue with Paul Krugman's assertion that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's latest Economic Outlook ''never even suggests possible solutions to the employment crisis.'' 
In our report, we precisely identify the 50 million jobless workers in the O.E.C.D. area as the most pressing policy challenge facing our economies and warn that failure to act now may result in crisis-driven unemployment becoming permanent.
High unemployment can be tackled through short- and long-term measures. Countries can create jobs by reducing labor costs, through temporary and targeted tax reductions. Governments can also help the unemployed find jobs, notably by strengthening public employment services and training.
We argue that countries like the United States that extended unemployment benefits during the crisis to shelter the unemployed from hardship and to keep them actively looking for jobs should continue these measures until labor market conditions improve. We also believe that unemployment insurance extended in several countries to workers not previously covered could become permanent.
In addition to treating the causes of unemployment and ways to deal with it, we focus specifically on policies to accelerate the return to work. We welcome constructive criticism on our policy advice but expect that it be based on a full consideration of what we actually say.

HEADLINE: Deal Eases New Jersey Out of Public Broadcasting

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
WNET in New York will take over the television operations of the New Jersey Network for five years under a deal announced on Monday by Gov. Chris Christie.
The plan, which would be carried out by a new WNET subsidiary, is part of a deal intended to get the State of New Jersey out of the public broadcasting business. If ratified by the Legislature, it will take effect on July 1. 
As part of the deal, four state-owned radio licenses would be acquired outright by New York Public Radio, which operates WNYC and WQXR. The remaining five radio licenses would be bought by the Philadelphia public broadcaster WHYY.
At a press conference in Trenton, Governor Christie expressed support for continuing ''robust New Jersey public broadcasting,'' but added that ''we need to have it in a way that is not continuing to cost the state taxpayers and can be perceived as truly independent from state government.''
Under the deal, WNET's new subsidiary, New Jersey Public Media, will be contractually required to continue a weekday New Jersey-focused newscast on what will now be named NJTV, as well as live broadcasts of significant New Jersey State House events, election night coverage and a Sunday morning public affairs show.
After the announcement, several New Jersey legislators and critics of the takeover plan -- including union representatives and community groups -- announced hearings on the pending deal. In a statement, the Keep the NJ in NJN coalition questioned whether WNET would live up to its promise to continue local news programming, arguing that it had not done so when it took over WLIW-TV in Long Island in 2003.
In an interview, Neal Shapiro, the president and chief executive of WNET, said that new Long Island-focused programming was in the works and blamed the recession for some cutbacks.
NJTV will operate on a budget of roughly $8 million annually, less than half of its previous budget. WNET will take over NJN's federal subsidy from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting of about $2.2 million, in addition to about $2 million in income from renting space on its broadcast tower.
Despite public television's financing challenges, Mr. Shapiro said he was confident the new entity would be able to raise an additional $3 million to $4 million each year from philanthropists, foundations and other supporters. He added that ''the money we raise in New Jersey will stay in New Jersey.''
NJN's approximately 120 employees will lose their state jobs under the deal, although they will be able to reapply for posts at the new entity. The new weekday newscast is expected to be produced with about 15 to 20 people, Mr. Shapiro said, with many of the station's other back-office positions being consolidated with those of WNET.
On the radio side, the plan calls for New York Public Radio to pay $1 million in cash for the licenses it is acquiring. That does not include $1.8 million in noncash compensation, including investments in New Jersey news coverage and airtime for public service announcements, said Andy Pratt, a spokesman for the state treasurer's office. WHYY will pay about $926,000 in cash and $612,000 in in-kind consideration, he said.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Family Should Curb Stake

BYLINE: By LISA LEE and CHRISTOPHER HUGHES

 BODY:
Sam Walton will soon be back. The Wal-Mart founder's descendants are poised to see their stake in the $190 billion company creep above 50 percent, without much fanfare, thanks to the latest $15 billion share buyback program. The watershed brings governance risks, and investors deserve better.
Wal-Mart's founding family has always had a big say in the boardroom of the company, the world's largest retailer. After Sam Walton died in 1992, family members retained a stake of around 38 percent from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. Starting in 2003, a series of big share buybacks began to push the family stake higher, to 43 percent in 2008 and now to 49 percent, according to the latest filings. 
The Waltons need only sit still to maneuver something like a premium-free takeover. The buyback plan announced last week makes this a near certainty. If it happens around the current share price and the family neither sells nor buys, its ownership will climb to 53 percent. Even if Wal-Mart shares burst from their trading range of weeks and soar 50 percent, completing the repurchase would still tip majority control into the family's hands.
A shift from slightly less than 50 percent ownership to slightly more than 50 percent may seem of little practical consequence. But the impact is more than cosmetic. Once the threshold is crossed, for example, New York Stock Exchange rules would no longer require Wal-Mart to ensure that a majority of its directors are independent. The company says it will do that anyway. But that's little more than a ''trust us.'' Investors should want more certainty.
Better yet, there may be an alternative. The new buyback follows a $15 billion plan announced a year ago, of which all but $2 billion was spent, and other big outlays before that. But they haven't excited investors. Wal-Mart's shares have lagged Costco's, as well as the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over one- and two-year time frames. Wal-Mart's first-quarter dividend amounted to $1.3 billion. If it really has $15 billion to spare, raising its payout and keeping the family's holding at less than 50 percent would do the job.
Liberal Arts Risk
What beats Oxford and costs less than Harvard? A group of star British professors has an answer: their new, $:18,000-a-year ($29,555) college.
The London-based New College of the Humanities can be seen as a free-market response to the decline in government support for the humanities. With a focus similar to American liberal arts colleges, it will offer five subjects (including economics) with one-to-one teaching. This was previously available only at Oxford and Cambridge, and even there it's proving unsustainably expensive.
N.C.H. also looks like a classic services start-up. Twelve founding professors own about 30 percent of the equity. Slightly more private investors hold the rest. The total capital raised is about $:10 million. It will finance a three-year path to break-even, at which point profits may be paid out.
But N.C.H. needs brainy enrollees. Top British universities will be charging homegrown students $:9,000 a year from 2012. Parents are already asking whether Ivy League colleges might offer better value. N.C.H.'s fees are twice as high, though will still be cheaper than the $35,000-plus tuition quoted by Harvard and what many overseas students pay elsewhere in Britain. Moreover, N.C.H. expects to offer discounts for about a fifth of students from the start.
Even with that aid, institutions need cachet to charge so much and attract the brightest students. If N.C.H. can get there, British parents may swallow its premium pricing. But it's still hard to see anyone turning down a place at Cambridge or University College London to pay more for N.C.H. And for parents whose children don't make it there, or for non-British students, the extra cost of Harvard or Yale may still seem justified.
If N.C.H. works, the founding academics get the best of all worlds: an institution of their own making, with the cushion of continuing tenure at the top universities where they're already based. The business angels, meanwhile, get kudos and the prospect of a yield on their modest investment. But the academics are smart not to give up their day jobs just yet. The profit potential looks far less gold-plated than their qualifications.

HEADLINE: Utah: 2 Plead Guilty in Data Breach

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Two former state workers pleaded guilty Monday to their roles in the release of a list of 1,300 names of people suspected of being in the country illegally. Teresa Bassett, 59, pleaded guilty to two felony counts of computer crimes, but maintained her innocence during a hearing in Third District Court in Salt Lake City. Ms. Bassett recently changed her name to London Grace Wellington. The other defendant, Leah Carson, 32, pleaded guilty to making a false statement by an unemployment compensation agent, a misdemeanor. Both worked for the Department of Workforce Services when they were accused of compiling the list from people who had applied for benefits. It was anonymously sent to law enforcement and members of the news media, along with a note demanding the deportation of those listed. Ms. Bassett was charged with felonies because she released the information, a prosecutor said. Ms. Carson only helped gather it.

HEADLINE: In Today's Arenas, Noise Roars Even When the Cheering Stops

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
DALLAS -- It was only the pregame show. As the ear-splitting cacophony rocked American Airlines Center before a recent Dallas Mavericks playoff game, the team executive Martin Woodall whooped gleefully over the din: ''My clothes are shaking!'' His words were discernible only to a lip reader; their sound stood no chance.
At sporting events across the nation, and in the N.B.A. in particular, noise has become a part of the show -- rarely more so than in Dallas, where the Mavericks face the Miami Heat in Game 4 of the N.B.A. finals Tuesday night. It is hard to tell if the Mavericks' favorite machine during these playoffs is Dirk Nowitzki, their star player, or their sound system.
The Mavericks' equipment involves more than simply pumping up decibels to levels that some experts fear could contribute to long-term hearing loss. Rather, with fans spoiled by earbud fidelity and 5.1-channel home theater systems, owners like the Mavericks' Mark Cuban have turned hosting a game into producing an event -- with ''assisted resonance'' and ''crowd enhancement,'' buzzwords for insiders and euphemisms for others. 
Sixty mammoth speakers hanging above the court thunder music and clamorous sound effects louder than a jumbo jet engine. More speakers encircling the seating bowl replicate a roaring herd of horses in perfectly timed surround sound.
After tip-off of the recent playoff game against Oklahoma City in the Western Conference finals, microphones in the backboard amplified rim clangs, sneaker squeaks and the occasional player profanity, while devices dangling above the crowd -- in the rare instances when the public-address system was not active -- could redirect courtside crowd sounds into the distant upper mezzanine.
''It's way better than old school -- everyone's getting into the game,'' Mark Busbee, a 40-year-old Mavericks season-ticket holder, said during the second quarter of Game 5 of the Mavericks-Thunder series. ''It's a new era, a new age -- why not leverage the technology that's here today? It's never too loud. If you don't like it, watch the game at home.''
The Mavericks have received a few complaints about the cacophony, which lasts through most two-hour games at decibel levels between a power mower's 90 and a rock concert's 110. (The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers 115 decibels for any time period to be dangerous.) Eventually, the only thing that speaks consistently louder than public-address systems is the attendance figures they help create.
Few seem to be boycotting games just because, as in Game 5, 97-decibel rock was played during timeouts, ''Jack and Diane'' by John Mellencamp inexplicably accompanied DeShawn Stevenson dribbling upcourt, and a potentially placid halftime was filled with a thumping drum band and other histrionics. Even when a hairdo-guessing contest led its hostess to screech ''Yeaaaahhh!'' at 105 decibels -- high-pitched sounds in that range can be particularly noxious to human ears -- the crowd grew louder to compensate.
''I've been here 27 years -- when I started we said nothing except maybe, 'Basket by Rolando Blackman,' '' said Steve Letson, who coordinates Dallas's audio and visual presentations from courtside. ''We don't know for sure, but they seem to respond to it. The more they respond, the more we respond.''
Sports fans have long used their vocal cords, Thunderstix and, as in last year's World Cup, vuvuzelas to inspire the home team and rattle the visitors. Noisy crowds can be especially helpful to the hosts in football, where loud cheering can drown out the quarterback's snap count.
Decibel levels are like pitch speeds, with scoreboards clearly inflating them for effect; at a recent Mets game, while a video board exhorted fans to ''Make Some Noise!'' a faux decibel meter pushed a ludicrous 120 (only about 10,000 fans were even at Citi Field).
The proliferation of luxury suites -- into which patrons often take cover from the noise -- has put greater emphasis on the size and clarity of sports sound systems. Rings of spiffy mezzanines force conventional seating rows to reach far higher and farther from game action. For example, the Chicago Bulls' former home could fit inside United Center, which opened in 1994, said Jack Wrightson, the primary acoustic engineer for that arena and Dallas's American Airlines Center. Volume affects volume.
''All of the owners are interested in crowd noise,'' said Wrightson, who redesigned Dallas's system two years ago to accompany Cuban's new $14 million video boards. ''But the size of the buildings today makes that a real problem you have to solve. The large interior volume creates the potential for echoes and reverberation, which you don't want at a sporting event or a concert. The arena speakers have to be properly timed, and insulation installed throughout the building, to compensate.''
Some echoes can last longer than the game itself, some experts fear, in the form of tinnitus -- ringing in the ears for up to 12 to 24 hours -- or, more slowly and stealthily, long-term hearing loss. William Martin, a professor of otolaryngology at Oregon Health and Science University, said that OSHA's 115-decibel limit derived from economic considerations, not just medical ones, and that sports arenas presented a distinct risk, particularly to children.
''Ears are extremely sensitive devices -- they're designed for when you're walking in the woods and you hear a twig break, signaling that the bear that ate your friend last week is close,'' said Martin, who has worn earplugs at many Trail Blazers games at the Rose Garden in Portland, Ore., one of the loudest arenas in the N.B.A. because of its low roof.
''There are subtle but gradual consequences of bombarding your ears,'' he added.
Mark Stephenson, a senior research audiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a division of the Centers for Disease Control, said that one or two nights at a loud sporting event were probably benign. People who attend dozens of games -- and perhaps the athletes themselves -- could be at risk, he said.
Few of the 21,092 jubilant Mavericks fans in the final game against Oklahoma City, in which Dallas came from behind to win and advance to the finals, appeared too upset. In the corner seats near courtside, the resultant delirium peaked at 112 decibels and spent more than a minute over 95.
It did not exceed OSHA's 115 -- until the final seconds ticked away, that is.
Dallas's increasingly excited crowd pushed the meter to 113, then 114, and then, for one brief moment, past 115 and the officially, undeniably, dangerous level. For Lonnie Franklin, a longtime fan doing more than his share, it was aural ambrosia.
''You shouldn't be able to think at times like this!'' he shouted as fans around him stormed the court. ''It's well worth it!''

HEADLINE: How to Steal A Russian Airport

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
The decision to pull the initial public offering was announced on the last Sunday in May, late at night. The company that had been planning to sell its shares to the public -- hoping to raise somewhere between $700 million and $1 billion -- was the Domodedovo airport, the biggest and best-run of Moscow's three airports, and the only one not owned by the state.
The airport's investment bankers blamed the problem on the usual suspect: ''market conditions'' -- meaning that they weren't going to get the price that they had hoped for. And I suppose, in some literal sense, that was true. But it didn't begin to capture the real story. 
A few days ago, I wrote about the human cost of Russia's lack of respect for the rule of law. There is also a business cost, one that hurts Russia on a daily basis. The decision by the owners of the Domodedovo airport to withdraw its I.P.O. is a perfect example -- and helps explain why Russia simply cannot have a modern economy until it has a real rule of law.
It is no coincidence, of course, that the best airport in Moscow is the only one in private hands. The management company, East Line Group, took over Domodedovo in 1996 when it was ''a small, rundown airport,'' according to The Moscow Times. It poured enormous sums into upgrades and new terminals, attracted new business -- and forced the government-run airports to spend money just to keep pace. It was good for everyone -- including Domodedovo, which had revenues of $1 billion a year. This is how the textbooks say capitalism is supposed to work.
In January, however, a suicide bomber got past the airport's security, killing 37 people and wounding 180. Russia's president, Dmitri Medvedev, ordered the prosecutor general to write a report. It seems fair to say that Russia's plutocrats saw this as their opening.
In mid-May, days before the airport announced its plans to go public, the prosecutor general lowered the boom. His report concluded that the airport's offshore ownership structure was ''unacceptable,'' because it allowed Domodedovo, as he put it, ''to hide the real owners and those making the management decisions at the airport.''
As is always the case when the plutocrats are getting ready to pull a fast one, the charge has a surface plausibility. The East Line Group's ownership is byzantine, involving several companies registered in the Isle of Man. Yet somehow that never mattered while it was spending all that money to build a more profitable airport. Besides, offshore ownership is almost as common in Russia as the corporate structure is in America; even state-owned companies often use an offshore structure. Why do companies go this route? In part, at least, to keep assets away from the grasping hands of the plutocrats.
Sure enough, a few days after the report, the news leaked out that a man named Igor Yusufov was putting together a group that hoped to buy a $1 billion stake in Domodedovo. Who is Yusufov? He's a former energy minister who served under the Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. According to The Financial Times, until a few months ago, he was also a special deputy to Medvedev. The Russian business newspaper Vedomosti described him as a potential ''peacemaker'' between the government and the airport's owners.
Well, yes, that's one way of describing him. Here's another way, the way most foreign investors saw it. He was using the report to squeeze the airport's owners and get a piece of a thriving company at a shamefully low price. Is it any wonder the I.P.O. was soon called off? How can anyone invest in a Russian company that is being shaken down by the government? That threat, which looms over every private venture in Russia, had become all too real for the owners of the Domodedovo airport.
This same dynamic explains why Russia, despite its well-educated population, has so little innovation: As likely as not, innovators will be pushed aside by government thugs as soon as they achieve success and profits. It happens all the time. As The Moscow Times put it recently, ''After seeing the way the authorities are strong-arming East Line, fewer investors will risk putting their time and resources into resuscitating a failing business or pumping money into a new one.''
As it happens, Russia itself has been trying to raise badly needed revenue by selling off pieces of state-run companies in I.P.O.'s. So far, it hasn't been going very well. A handfulhave alreadybeen canceled. Every time, executives and officials have blamed ''market conditions.''
In truth, as long as the plutocrats thumb their noses at the rule of law and steal corporate assets with impunity, no Russian company is going to get the price their assets may deserve. That's the real market condition. It won't change until the practice ends.
For that to happen, though, the plutocrats would have to start caring about their country -- and not just themselves.

HEADLINE: The Steep Price of Visiting

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
As if high fuel prices and rising hotel rates were not enough to splash cold water on travel plans, consider the variety of taxes and fees that cities are levying on visitors.
In the last two years, cities including Boston, Baltimore and San Jose, Calif., have passed tax increases on hotel rooms, restaurant meals or parking garage rates. And major business travel destinations like San Diego and Atlanta are considering higher taxes. Last month, Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia signed legislation permitting Atlanta to raise its hotel room tax by one percentage point and San Diego's mayor, Jerry Sanders, proposed increases of one to three percentage points -- based on the hotel's proximity to the city's convention center -- to help pay for an expansion of the center. 
For financially troubled municipalities, these tax proceeds help fill depleted coffers, and taxing visitors rather than local voters can be politically advantageous. The most common way to tax visitors is via a special tax, in addition to the ordinary sales tax, on hotel rooms. For travelers, this ''bed tax'' can add significantly to the cost of lodging, especially for long stays or visits to cities with high hotel rates. In some cases, the tax burden -- on top of high airfares and room rates -- is significant enough that some travelers are even altering their plans, cutting their stay short or seeking out cheaper properties.
''The hotel tax is so visible, they see how these taxes are hitting the bottom line of their hotel bill, and that becomes, in many regards, what sticks in people's minds,'' said Deborah Sexton, president and chief executive of the Professional Convention Management Association, a trade association for people who plan large conventions and trade shows. ''All those dollars add up. In the end, it's going to mean fewer people attending or people staying for a shorter period of time.''
The U.S. Travel Association corroborates this observation, saying that many travelers have cited high tourist taxes as a reason to go to less expensive hotels or restaurants, or not to visit certain destinations at all.
Dan Poynter, an author who took a recent trip to New York City to attend BookExpo America, said he had changed his travel habits because of taxes. In 2010, Mr. Poynter said, he stayed for more than a week when he attended BookExpo, But this year, after seeing how high the hotel taxes were, he cut his visit in half.
''I was shocked when I went to check out and saw that they tacked on like $49 a day in taxes,'' he said. ''I just don't want to spend the money and give it to New York City when they're gouging us.'' The tax on hotel rooms in New York City is 5.875 percent, plus $2 per room for the bed tax, plus 8.875 percent in combined city and state sales tax. In Mr. Poynter's case, his hotel room last year cost $313 a night plus a $27.78 sales tax, $18.39 in city taxes, a $2 occupancy tax and a $1.50 Jacob K. Javits Convention Center tax.
New York City's taxes on visitors, in fact, ranked second in the nation in a study published last year by the Global Business Travel Association. The highest taxes in the association's list of 50 destinations were levied by Chicago. There, the combination of hotel room, rental car and restaurant taxes in the city center are estimated to cost travelers an average of $38.75 a day.
By contrast, visitors to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., would pay an average of $21.22 in daily taxes if they stayed in the city center.
The bed tax, the largest component of the total taxes borne by visitors, is usually used to finance the development or expansion of convention centers and to market the destination. Doug Ducate, president and chief executive of the Center for Exhibition Industry research, says a convention center is typically a municipality's largest expenditure. Cities issue bonds to pay for construction of new convention centers or expansions of existing centers, and the bed taxes help pay the cost of the bonds.
In 2009, when the recession cut into business travel and convention bookings slowed markedly, travel tax receipts around the country also plummeted. Even Las Vegas, a city that has weathered previous recessions relatively well, struggled. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which markets the city and operates the Las Vegas Convention Center, earns 80 percent of its revenue from bed taxes, its president and chief executive, Rossi Ralenkotter, said.
''We saw a decline not only in our visitor counts, but our convention counts as well as the average daily rate,'' he said. ''Our budget declined $67 million over two fiscal years,'' he added, even with a recent countywide hotel tax increase, because that money was earmarked for other purposes.
In recent months, the tide has been turning. Mr. Ralenkotter said the average daily room rate rebounded by 10 percent in the first quarter of this year, and visitor numbers had increased as well.
Even if Las Vegas could have raised its hotel tax to make up the difference, it might not have wanted to. Higher hotel taxes can have drawbacks for cities. Raising taxes too high can make a destination less attractive, especially for large event bookings or price-wary groups. For this reason, cities are sometimes cautious in escalating taxes on out-of-towners. San Francisco contemplated raising its 15.5 percent hotel tax by an additional two percentage points last year, but rejected the measure after vociferous criticism from local businesses.
High taxes on airfares, combined with fuel surcharges, have created another burden for travelers, especially those taking trans-Atlantic flights, Robert Mann, an airline industry consultant, said. In fact, passengers who seek lower prices by flying multiple carriers may wind up paying more in taxes than those who book through a single carrier, Mr. Mann said, because taxes and fees are generally levied at the point of origination. Two one-way tickets means two originations, which could potentially mean two sets of additional charges.
Some American travelers near the Canadian border even drive to airports in Canada to find some relief from high taxes. ''I think there are some folks who fly through Toronto, for example,'' Mr. Mann said. ''It can sometimes be less expensive than some of the U.S.-imposed taxes, especially for international journeys.''

HEADLINE: In State Parks, the Sharpest Ax Is the Budget's

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
DECEPTION PASS STATE PARK, Wash. -- As the summer season gets under way, budget-strapped state parks across the country are pursuing creative and sometimes controversial solutions simply to stay open. Many are imposing steep new fees, leaning ever more heavily on volunteers and, in one ominous effort to raise money, even pushing to drill for oil and gas beneath hiking trails and picnic pavilions.
The vast majority of states have cut park financing, often significantly, since the economic downturn took full hold in 2008, and some were cutting long before that. Some parks are closing altogether; Gov. Jerry Brown of California in recent days announced plans to permanently close 70 of the state's 278 parks this fall. Even where parks remain open, the compromises they make to do so are often uncomfortable.
''There have been lines that have been crossed that were unthinkable a couple of years ago,'' said Richard Dolesh, chief of public policy for the National Recreation and Park Association. 
Here in Washington, one of only a handful of states that has not charged entrance fees to state parks, the revenue stream is about to change. Beginning July 1, the parks will no longer receive state money for their operating budgets. Instead, they will rely directly on new entrance fees -- $30 for an annual pass, $10 for one day. It is far from clear that the new plan will compensate for the $70 million in state money that parks are losing each year.
''We're totally free of the tax system,'' said Jack Hartt, the manager here at Deception Pass State Park. ''If you support the park system, you'll buy a pass. If not, you won't.''
''Customers,'' Mr. Hartt said, ''is the new buzzword.''
One of the most inventive efforts is in Ohio, where the Legislature is set to approve a bill that would allow drilling for oil and gas in the shale beneath some state parks. Lawmakers say parks would directly benefit from revenues. The number of full-time Ohio parks employees has declined by nearly 40 percent over the last decade, and the state says it faces $1 billion in delayed repairs and maintenance.
''I don't want to see the parks become refineries or anything like that,'' said Paul Wolf, president of Friends for the Preservation of Ohio State Parks. ''But it's a tough decision to make. If parks deteriorate, what good is keeping drilling out of the parks?''
When a State House committee passed the measure last month, Jack Shaner of the Ohio Environmental Council said in a statement: ''Under park rules, it is unlawful for a camper to tack a clothesline to a tree. But under the bill, it would be O.K. for a driller to chop his way through the forest to set up a drilling rig. This puts a whole new spin on 'getting away from it all.' ''
The resignation some feel about the Ohio plan is rooted in a broader sense nationwide that the status of parks has permanently changed, that parks officials cannot passively presume that lawmakers, Democrat or Republican, will rescue them. Yet some officials also worry that rising fees, rising gas prices and a need to ''market'' parks to people who will spend money will keep those with lower incomes from enjoying public lands.
''We're catering more to Middle America, to middle-class recreationists, and there's nothing wrong with that,'' said Richard Just, the chief planner at the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation and immediate past president of National Association of Recreation Resource Planners.
But, Mr. Just said, a basic pact between parks and the public -- the idea that parks will be easily accessible and affordable, and safeguarded by the state -- is at risk. He recalled a new board member of the association asking, ''In what way are they state parks anymore?''
Last year, Gov. C. L. Otter of Idaho proposed eliminating the parks department altogether. That plan died amid resistance and concerns over a loss in federal matching funds. In California, federal rules also complicate Governor Brown's plan. But in Idaho, parks officials are not relaxing. Mr. Just pointed to Farragut State Park near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, where he said the state makes money from entrance fees as well as by selling discs to users of its Wreckreator Frisbee golf course. The idea is to do what the views of the northern Rockies apparently cannot do alone: attract a variety of park users and their money.
''We've put all of our eggs in the marketing basket,'' Mr. Just said. ''We're paying a lot more attention to -- and I hate this phrase -- running them like a business, because they're not a business.''
Efforts at streamlining and privatizing are everywhere. Colorado just approved merging its parks department with the Division of Wildlife. Arizona and Florida are considering privatizing park operations. Local governments have taken over operations at certain state parks. Community groups mow grass and plow snow. One, in Aurora, N.Y., is paying for a portable toilet for Knox Farm State Park.
In Georgia, parks financing has been cut by almost 50 percent since 2008, said Becky Kelley, the parks director there. Georgia parks are in the middle of what Ms. Kelley called a ''repositioning,'' expected for completion in 2015, that is intended to make them financially independent by raising revenues from sources like parking fees and overnight Father's Day packages at golf courses in state parks.
''We were told by the General Assembly to 'pursue a strategy of self-sufficiency,' '' Ms. Kelley said. ''We realized we could not hunker down and wait it out. This was a different day.''
As fees rise, some services are declining. Maintenance and repair backlogs grow while staff shrinks. ''They just redid the bathrooms, but now they're not even open,'' said Margo Townsend, walking West Beach at Deception Pass, which spans two islands in Puget Sound.
At nearby Rosario Beach, also in Deception Pass, ''We've got rangers with degrees cleaning restrooms,'' said Sammye Kempbell, a volunteer.
Often the only park representatives at a site, volunteers are growing accustomed to authority. Ms. Kempbell applied for grant money to buy the cart she uses to haul educational materials out to teach children by the tide pools. She also leads volunteer training.
Ms. Kempbell has been doing this work for eight years and loves it. But at 68, she said she would like to spend a little more time enjoying parks and a little less time saving them -- not that she expects the need to go away.
''A lot of us who do these things are retirees,'' said Ms. Kempbell, hauling her cart off the rocky beach as the tide rose and an afternoon rain began to fall. ''We need some young blood.''

HEADLINE: Republican Who Broke Ranks On War Is an Outcast No More

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
GREENVILLE, N.C. -- On matters like abortion, military spending and religion, Representative Walter B. Jones seems thoroughly in tune with this conservative, staunchly Republican district in eastern North Carolina, home to the Marine Corps' Camp Lejeune and thousands of military retirees.
On the issue of war, however, Mr. Jones has defied typecasting. An early critic of the American invasion of Iraq, he has been ostracized by the Republican leadership in Congress. And now he is emerging as a leading advocate for swiftly withdrawing American forces from Afghanistan, a position that has made him, of all things, a liberal hero.
''When you talk about war, political parties don't matter,'' he said in an interview.
But Mr. Jones may no longer be the outlier he was six years ago. Late last month, an amendment intended to accelerate the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan sponsored by Mr. Jones and Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, nearly passed -- in part because 26 Republicans broke with their leadership to support it, triple the number who voted for a similar measure last year. Their ranks included at least three freshmen elected with Tea Party support. 
Some foreign policy analysts now see Mr. Jones, 68; Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas; and a small coterie of Tea Party stalwarts as the leading edge of a conservative movement to rein in American military power -- a break from the muscular foreign policy of President George W. Bush.
''They reflect a growing discontent within the Republican Party about the wars and a growing feeling that they don't want to spend money on them anymore,'' said John Isaacs, executive director of the Council for a Livable World, an advocacy group that promotes arms control. ''They are military noninterventionists.''
Mr. Jones agreed, saying: ''We can't police the world anymore. We're not the world power. It's China. Our economy is in chaos.''
Conversations with voters in Mr. Jones's district, which embraces much of North Carolina's Atlantic coastline, suggest that many who were baffled or infuriated by his opposition to the Iraq war in 2005 are liking his views on Afghanistan in 2011.
At a Memorial Day event in Beaufort on May 28, August Braddy, 68, declared that Mr. Jones -- who over eight terms has voted with the American Conservative Union more than 80 percent of the time -- was too liberal. But on Afghanistan, Mr. Braddy, who was wearing a red Tea Party shirt, said he thought Mr. Jones was right.
''We're broke; we can't afford it,'' he said. ''We did what we went there to do: get Bin Laden.''
Polls suggest that Republican voters are moving in Mr. Jones's direction. In a New York Times/CBS News poll last month, 43 percent of Republicans said the United States should reduce troop strength in Afghanistan, double the number who said that in November 2009. Some prominent Republicans, including Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Grover Norquist, the antitax champion, have also begun questioning the American mission in Afghanistan.
Still, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress remain supportive of the war. On Mr. Jones's amendment, 207 Republicans voted no, while 178 Democrats voted in favor. But the amendment failed by just 11 votes, and Mr. Jones believes that by fall, it will pass.
For many of the Republicans who are questioning the war, cost is clearly the driving factor. Mr. Jones makes that case in his district, telling voters that spending $8 billion a month to prop up what he calls a corrupt government is a waste of money.
''If we're going to cut programs for children who need milk in the morning, if we're going to cut programs for seniors who need a sandwich at lunch, if we're going to cut veterans benefits, then, for God's sake, let's bring back our troops from Afghanistan,'' he said in Beaufort, to loud applause.
But Mr. Jones's wrenching odyssey from disciple of Speaker Newt Gingrich to war opponent was far more about personal guilt than budget deficits.
The son of a Democratic congressman, Mr. Jones was elected in the Republican tide of 1994 with the support of a conservative icon, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. He came to be a steadfast supporter of Mr. Gingrich's small-government agenda.
In 2002, Mr. Jones voted for the resolution authorizing the invasion of Iraq. He also persuaded House cafeterias to rename their French fries ''freedom fries,'' tweaking the French government for opposing the invasion.
But Mr. Jones now says he had misgivings about the vote almost immediately. After he attended his first funeral at Camp Lejeune for a Marine killed just weeks into the invasion, those misgivings grew into pangs of doubt.
He started writing letters to the relatives of every American killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. (He has signed more than 10,370 at last count.) And he began consulting with critics of the invasion, including Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, a retired Marine.
''I came to believe we were misled, we were lied to,'' Mr. Jones said recently. ''The people around Bush manipulated the intelligence.''
In June 2005, he stunned his party establishment by appearing at a news conference with Mr. Paul and Representative Dennis Kucinich, a liberal Ohio Democrat, to call on Mr. Bush to start reducing troop levels in Iraq.
Mr. Jones's offices were immediately flooded with calls from angry constituents who branded him a traitor and demanded his resignation. He made the cover of Mother Jones magazine in 2006 and drew a tough primary challenge in 2008 from an opponent who called him ''a poster boy for the left.'' Mr. Jones won handily.
A convert to Roman Catholicism, Mr. Jones says he has not missed a Sunday Mass in nearly 40 years. His faith, he says, caused him to question the war.
''I did not vote my conscience and I sent kids to die, and they didn't have to go,'' he said. ''I thank God that he made me feel guilty about my vote on Iraq.''
Afghanistan is different from Iraq, he says, because he believes that the latter invasion was justified. But he has come to believe that the strategy of trying to strengthen the government of President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and build that country's security forces is doomed.
In Beaufort, about 50 miles from Camp Lejeune, several former Marines at the Memorial Day event agreed.
''We're losing a lot of people there and not seeing anything in return,'' said Gregory Barnett, who spent 22 years in the Marine Corps. ''Now that we've gotten Bin Laden, we've been there long enough.''

HEADLINE: Taps for a Community Hospital

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
CLEVELAND -- A railroad bridge separates Huron Hospital, one of the last remaining institutions in the impoverished neighborhood of East Cleveland, from the city's downtown and its two major hospitals.
These days, boarded-up houses and empty, overgrown lots surround Huron Hospital, which was built on part of the former estate of John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil. Like residents in other areas with declining populations, this neighborhood, largely African-American, has relied on the hospital as a safe haven. Residents worry about crime and the lack of even a grocery store.
Facing mounting financial losses and sharply declining patient admissions, the Cleveland Clinic, which owns Huron and eight other community hospitals, announced on Monday that it would close the 211-bed hospital, opening a much smaller family health center in its place. 
The decision by one of the nation's leading health care systems to close a neighborhood hospital, once a relatively rare event, reflects a stark new reality that is likely to play out across the country at hundreds of other hospitals that can no longer afford empty beds or wings and unused medical services. The federal health care law, which is likely to reduce payments for in-patient care, as well as changing demographics and a lessening dependence on hospitals, are converging into a death knell for longstanding health institutions. While many hospitals will be bought and converted into clinics or other health care centers, a lot are likely to be closed.
''I think we're going to see a lot of this activity over the next three to five years,'' said Chas Roades, chief of research for the Advisory Board Company, a firm that works with hospitals.
Closing a hospital remains an exceedingly difficult proposition, with the potential for a strong reaction from community leaders and politicians, who oppose the move, as well as the threat of local doctors who send their patients to competitors.
The clinic's announcement was quickly followed by denunciations from community leaders.
''Needless to say, I am very disappointed,'' said Representative Marcia L. Fudge, a Democrat, who added that she worried about health systems choosing to rid themselves of hospitals in communities of the greatest need. ''Care goes beyond dollars and cents.''
Cleveland officials, who had already been upset by the trauma unit closing, say they were blind-sided and talked of possible legal action, according to a statement by the City of Cleveland.
''It rips the soul out of the community,'' said Gary A. Norton Jr., the mayor of East Cleveland. He added that residents would be left without 24-hour emergency care and in-patient services.
Dr. Delos M. Cosgrove, the chief executive of Cleveland Clinic, defended the decision, and insisted that the clinic was not abandoning East Cleveland. Huron had already lost its trauma center, nursing education program and its separate medical intensive care unit, and had ''really outgrown its useful life,'' he said in an interview.
Aside from maintaining the cutting-edge medical care at the clinic's main campus, this health system also needs to concentrate services in fewer community hospitals, where they will have the kind of volume and expertise necessary to deliver quality care, he added. ''When we took over the hospital, we signed up to look after this community,'' he said.
The clinic estimates it will continue to lose as much as $8 million operating the family health center at Huron, which is costing about $25 million to build and is expected to open in October.
At a time when the health sector is one of the few that has steadily added jobs as the rest of the economy continues to struggle, closing any hospital is a significant blow. Huron Hospital is the largest employer in East Cleveland, and the city stands to lose about $700,000 a year in tax revenue, even with the addition of the health center. The clinic says it will offer a job to any current employee and plans to work with officials on finding ways to make up the lost income.
''I think the hard thing for us to appreciate, and we try to, is the sense of abandonment. It's real,'' said Dr. Gus Kious, a family physician who runs Huron and has watched the decline accelerate in the last few years. Admissions for acute care dropped below 7,000 in 2009 from about 8,000 and were projected to fall below 6,000 this year.
The clinic says it will make sure the community has access to medical care, including at its main campus. The system involved the community in its plans for the family health center, which will help navigate patients to the main campus or another community hospital and offer transportation.
But no promise will likely lessen the impact of losing a neighborhood stalwart for the poor, in contrast to the clinic's steadfast investments in hospitals situated in wealthier, better insured areas.
In Pittsburgh, for example, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center came under sharp criticism last year when it closed a local hospital, Braddock, which was situated in a neighborhood similar to East Cleveland. Community leaders sued over accusations that the medical center violated the civil rights of residents, and a settlement resulted with specific steps taken to guarantee access.
Efforts to anticipate the community's needs mean that the Cleveland Clinic is ''ahead of the game in many ways,'' said Paul Umbach, the chief executive of a Pittsburgh firm that helped the clinic make the assessment.
Dr. Cosgrove describes the decision as part of a broader strategy. Obstetrics, for example, is no longer housed on the main campus, and is available at four hospitals besides Huron. The clinic has stopped doing open heart surgery at all but three of its facilities. Hospital beds will not be added, he said. ''We're not building hospitals. We're building outpatient facilities.''
Much of the consolidation in other communities will take place as systems buy small hospitals and merge them with others, retooling the older ones as outpatient clinics or specialty hospitals, said Paul B. Ginsburg, the president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit research group that studies health care trends across the country. ''It often happens by mergers, but in Cleveland, the mergers were all done.''
Even in Cleveland, whose economy suffered in the downturn, some expansion continues. At University Hospitals, which is the clinic's main competitor, hospital officials have embarked on an ambitious plan to add and expand. The system recently opened a 144-bed community hospital, Ahuja Medical Center in Beachwood, not too far from the clinic's Hillcrest Hospital. University Hospitals has just opened a cancer hospital at the site of its main campus and recently renovated its emergency department. While the system embarked on these ventures well before the economic downturn, executives say they do not regret the decisions.
''We also felt we needed to grow,'' said Dr. Achilles A. Demetriou, the chief operating officer of University Hospitals. ''There was significant opportunity to capture market share.''
But the clinic argues that it has no choice but to make difficult decisions about where to invest and feels it should close any hospital that has outlived its original mission.
''How do you responsibly respond to all the changes in our community, in medicine and in health care reform?'' asked Dr. David Bronson, the president of Cleveland Clinic Regional Hospitals.

HEADLINE: Geithner Warns Against 'Race to the Bottom'

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner warned other countries Monday against trying to benefit from stiffer financial market rules in the United States by keeping their own regulation light. 
''The United Kingdom's experiment in a strategy of 'light touch' regulation to attract business to London from New York and Frankfurt ended tragically,'' he said in excerpts of a speech at an Atlanta monetary conference.
''That should be a cautionary note for other countries deciding whether to try to take advantage of the rise in standards in the United States,'' Geithner added.
He said the United States wants to avoid ''another race to the bottom around the world'' as efforts are made to impose regulations to lessen the risk of a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Global agreement on rules would reduce opportunities for ''regulatory arbitrage'' in which companies seek out the jurisdictions with the slackest regulation in order to push the envelope on allowable activities.
''As we act to contain risk in the U.S., we want to minimize the chances that it simply moves to other markets around the world,'' Geithner said.
He also said there was a need to develop international minimum standards for margins that are required on uncleared derivatives trades. Without such standards the effort to get central clearing of these trades established will suffer.
''Risk in derivatives will become concentrated in those jurisdictions with the least oversight,'' Geithner said, adding: ''This is a recipe for another crisis.''

HEADLINE: Elusive Explanations for an E. Coli Outbreak

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
The hit-and-miss struggle of German health authorities to identify the contaminated food behind one of the deadliest E. coli outbreaks in recent years underscores the difficulties of following a pathogen through the complex food supply chain, as well as deficiencies in even the most modern health systems in diagnosing this deadly illness.
After mistakenly suggesting that Spanish cucumbers were the likely culprit several days ago, German authorities focused Sunday on bean sprouts from a German farm, only to report on Monday that the first 23 of 40 samples from that farm had tested negative for E. coli. The results from the remaining samples had yet to come back. That does not entirely eliminate the farm as the outbreak's origin, since even one positive test is sufficient to make the connection.
But determining the origins of an outbreak that has killed 22 and left 600 people in intensive care presents a difficult mystery to unravel, with vital clues disappearing day by day as contaminated food is thrown away and farm and factory equipment is cleaned. Patients -- whose illnesses first alerted health authorities to the outbreak -- may have only cloudy memories of the meal that landed them in the hospital. Did the sandwich last month in Hamburg contain sprouts, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers -- or all four? 
After E. coli infection, diarrhea can take a week or more to emerge and it takes another week before the most serious complications, like kidney failure and anemia, occur.
That means that as German investigators interview patients and visit farms to hunt for traces of the germ, the smoking gun may be long gone. Finding the offending food ''is sometimes going to be easy and sometimes going to be difficult and I think this is one of those,'' said Dr. Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the division that handles food-borne diseases for the United States Centers for Disease Control.
''What did you eat four weeks ago?'' Dr. Tauxe said. ''You're dealing with memory here -- so it's hard to pull apart.''
He said that even if hundreds of patient stories pointed investigators to a particular food -- say, bean sprouts -- it might be impossible to prove conclusively that they are to blame. To do so, scientists must visit the restaurant, farm or food processing plant and find the germ in water, or on food or other material.
''Even if all the samples are negative, maybe you just missed it,'' Dr. Tauxe said. ''You can go to a place reeking of chlorine, and find nothing.''
Indeed the largest serious outbreak of E. coli, which sickened more than 8,000 people in Japan in 1996 has been widely attributed to eating contaminated radish sprouts, but scientists were never able to prove contamination in the laboratory.
To identify suspected sources, scientists painstakingly question victims about what they have eaten, searching for statistically significant patterns.
Some scientists complain that health systems in the United States and Europe are not using all available tools to better diagnose toxic E. coli; earlier detection would allow for more effective treatment and limit the scope of outbreaks, they say. Routine tests for patients with bloody diarrhea look for other germs -- shigella, salmonella and campylobacter -- but not E. coli. Such tests are readily available but more expensive.
''This suffered from a lack of primary diagnosis, and that's crucial because no one is looking for it,'' said Dr. Flemming Scheutz, the Copenhagen-based head of a World Health Organization collaborating center that specializes in E. coli. ''The first alert didn't go out until people were hospitalized.''
Likewise, Dr. Scheutz expressed concern that the decentralized German health system had made doctors initially unaware of the scope of the outbreak, familiar only with the cases in their region. A nationwide reporting system collects such information in the United States.
Dr. Lothar H. Wieler, a professor of veterinary medicine at the Free University of Berlin, said he was reluctant to criticize health officials. But he said German vets had a faster warning system for infectious disease than doctors who treated humans did. Germany has strict laws on sharing patient data.
''It would certainly be good to have a reporting system where officials get data very fast,'' he said. ''That is technically possible but must be implemented.''
But over all, said Frederic Vincent, a European Commission spokesman for health and consumer policy, German officials had acted logically in confronting ''one of the worst E. coli outbreaks ever.''
Mr. Vincent defended their decision to publicly blame Spanish cucumbers, even though it proved unfounded and has decimated Spain's farm economy. He said that 80 percent of the ill Germans had recalled eating the vegetable, that many of Europe's cucumbers were grown in Spain and that initial tests had revealed the presence of E. coli on Spanish cucumbers -- though it later proved to be a different strain.
E. coli strains range from benign to highly toxic. Accordingly, infections range from mild disease to a potentially deadly illness. The toxin-producing strains can result in severe bloody diarrhea and, in some cases, a syndrome characterized by kidney failure and anemia.
There were about 3,500 confirmed cases involving those strains in the European Union last year, Mr. Vincent said, and nearly 1,000 in Germany in 2008, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. But many if not most cases probably go undetected. A few countries, like Ireland and Denmark, test aggressively for the disease, so their numbers appear high, Dr. Scheutz said.
The outbreak in Germany was caused by a relatively rare strain of E. coli, O104, which possesses 2 potentially deadly qualities encoded into its genes: it produces the so-called shiga toxin and it also sticks to intestinal walls.
Dr. Alfredo Caprioli, who runs the European Union reference laboratory for E. coli in Rome, said the strain had previously been identified as the culprit in a few cases, including two in Germany in 2001; in those no food source was ever implicated.
Because the strain is rare, scientists remain uncertain of just how much toxin it produces or even where it hides in nature, which make tracing and combating outbreaks more difficult. The high number of severe illnesses in the current outbreak could be because the strain is extraordinarily virulent, because the food that caused the outbreak was highly contaminated or because a huge number of people were exposed to it, Dr. Tauxe of the American disease centers said.
But the outbreak does have some classic features. Women have been infected far more frequently than men have, which is common when the contaminated food involves raw vegetables, rather than meat -- the other common source of E. coli. ''In the past, when we see the majority of patients are women, we think salad,'' said Dr. Scheutz.
Two weeks into the outbreak, German health officials have a lot to sort out. ''These can take a very long time -- we may never find it,'' said Mr. Vincent of the European Commission, noting that a 2006 E. coli outbreak that resulted from contaminated spinach originating in California took over a month to work out.
''But hopefully we can get very lucky,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Charter Schools Tied to Turkey Grow in Texas

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
TDM Contracting was only a month old when it won its first job, an $8.2 million contract to build the Harmony School of Innovation, a publicly financed charter school that opened last fall in San Antonio.
It was one of six big charter school contracts TDM and another upstart company have shared since January 2009, a total of $50 million in construction business. Other companies scrambling for work in a poor economy wondered: How had they qualified for such big jobs so fast?
The secret lay in the meteoric rise and financial clout of the Cosmos Foundation, a charter school operator founded a decade ago by a group of professors and businessmen from Turkey. Operating under the name Harmony Schools, Cosmos has moved quickly to become the largest charter school operator in Texas, with 33 schools receiving more than $100 million a year in taxpayer funds.
While educating schoolchildren across Texas, the group has also nurtured a close-knit network of businesses and organizations run by Turkish immigrants. The businesses include not just big contractors like TDM but also a growing assemblage of smaller vendors selling school lunches, uniforms, after-school programs, Web design, teacher training and even special education assessments. 
Some of the schools' operators and founders, and many of their suppliers, are followers of Fethullah Gulen, a charismatic Turkish preacher of a moderate brand of Islam whose devotees have built a worldwide religious, social and nationalistic movement in his name. Gulen followers have been involved in starting similar schools around the country -- there are about 120 in all, mostly in urban centers in 25 states, one of the largest collections of charter schools in America.
The growth of these ''Turkish schools,'' as they are often called, has come with a measure of backlash, not all of it untainted by xenophobia. Nationwide, the primary focus of complaints has been on hundreds of teachers and administrators imported from Turkey: in Ohio and Illinois, the federal Department of Labor is investigating union accusations that the schools have abused a special visa program in bringing in their expatriate employees.
But an examination by The New York Times of the Harmony Schools in Texas casts light on a different area: the way they spend public money. And it raises questions about whether, ultimately, the schools are using taxpayer dollars to benefit the Gulen movement -- by giving business to Gulen followers, or through financial arrangements with local foundations that promote Gulen teachings and Turkish culture.
Harmony Schools officials say they scrupulously avoid teaching about religion, and they deny any official connection to the Gulen movement. The say their goal in starting charter schools -- publicly financed schools that operate independently from public school districts -- has been to foster educational achievement, especially in science and math, where American students so often falter.
''It's basically a mission of our organization,'' said Soner Tarim, the superintendent of the 33 Texas schools.
The schools, Dr. Tarim said, follow all competitive bidding rules, and do not play favorites in awarding contracts. In many cases, Turkish-owned companies have in fact been the low bidders.
Even so, records show that virtually all recent construction and renovation work has been done by Turkish-owned contractors. Several established local companies said they had lost out even after bidding several hundred thousand dollars lower.
''It kind of boils my blood a little bit, all the money that was spent, when I know it could have been done for less,'' said Deborah Jones, an owner of daj Construction, one of four lower bidders who failed to win a recent contract for a school renovation in the Austin area.
Harmony's history underscores the vast latitude that many charter school systems have been granted to spend public funds. While the degree of oversight varies widely from state to state, the rush to approve charter schools has meant that some barely monitor charter school operations.
In Washington, concern is growing. A number of charter schools across the country have been accused of a range of improprieties in recent years, from self-dealing on contracts to grade-changing schemes and inflating attendance records to increase financing.
Last year, the inspector general's office in the federal Education Department cited these complaints in a memo alerting the agency of ''our concern about vulnerabilities in the oversight of charter schools.''
The Texas Education Agency has a total of nine people overseeing more than 500 charter school campuses. ''They don't have the capacity at the state level to do the job,'' said Greg Richmond, president of the National Association of Charter School Authorizers. Even so, the state's education commissioner, Robert Scott, last year took the unusual step of granting Harmony permission to open new schools outside the normal approval process.
Officials at the education agency said staffing was sufficient to oversee charter schools. They would not discuss Harmony's contracts, but a check of the agency's past audits -- largely desk reviews of financial statements submitted by the schools -- did not find any alarms raised about Harmony contracting.
In April, however, the agency notified Harmony of an unreleased preliminary audit questioning more than $540,000 in inadequately documented expenses, the vast majority involving federal grant money. Neither the agency nor Harmony would disclose details of the findings.
Starting Out
The charter school movement did not begin in Texas, but the state embraced it with ideological fervor in the late 1990s as a pet project of the governor at the time, George W. Bush. The schools' independence from local school boards and union contracts, the theory went, would free them to become seedbeds of educational achievement in a landscape of underperforming failure.
While Texas charter schools must meet core curriculum standards, they may emphasize some subjects over others, as Harmony does with math, science and technology. They do not have to hew to standard public school calendars or hours. They may -- and some do -- pay teachers less than the standard state-mandated salaries. (In exchange for this flexibility, the schools get less state money than regular schools, with various calculations showing an annual difference of between $1,000 and $2,000 per pupil.)
David Bradley, a member of the Texas Board of Education, served on the panel that reviewed the early charter proposals. ''The only requirement was that you expressed an interest,'' he said, adding, ''The first time Harmony came forth, they had a great application, and they were great people.''
One of those people was Yetkin Yildirim, who had arrived from Turkey in 1996 to attend the University of Texas in Austin. He also worked as a volunteer tutor in local high schools. The idea for the Harmony schools was born, he said, when he and friends -- including Dr. Tarim -- saw how much less rigorous the American high schools were in teaching science and math.
''Then we realized that something can be done,'' said Dr. Yildirim, now a University of Texas professor specializing in asphalt technology. They spent a year writing their proposal, and in 2000 the group opened its first school, in Houston.
The schools represented the expansion of a mission that had already created hundreds of schools -- and a number of universities -- in Turkey and around the world. According to social scientists who have studied them, these schools have been the primary vehicle for the aspirations of the Gulen movement, a loose network of several million followers of Mr. Gulen, who preaches the need to embrace modernity in a peace-loving, ecumenical version of Islam. At the center of his philosophy is the concept of ''hizmet'' -- public service.
The movement is also influential in Turkish politics and controls substantial commercial holdings, including a bank, Asya; one of Turkey's largest daily newspapers, Zaman; and an American cable television network, Ebru-TV, based in New Jersey.
Mr. Gulen, 70, considers his teachings a bulwark against Islamic extremism. Yet he and the movement that bears his name have been surrounded by controversy in Turkey. He came to this country in 1999 while under pressure from secular Turkish authorities who accused him of promoting an Islamic state. He was charged, though the case was thrown out. More recently, the arrests of Turkish journalists critical of the Gulen movement have led to accusations of retaliation by followers in the current government, which has a more religious leaning.
Mr. Gulen now lives in a Pennsylvania retreat owned by a foundation. In an interview there last year with The International Herald Tribune, he said he had not benefited financially from the movement. His only possessions, he said, were a blanket, some bed sheets and a few prized books.
Still, at least for the schools, America has been a land of opportunity. The creation story has been enacted across the country -- Turkish immigrants, often scientists or professors, founding charter schools run by boards of mostly Turkish-born men. Today the United States has more Gulen-inspired schools than any country but Turkey, according to a presentation by Joshua Hendrick, a professor at Loyola University Maryland whose 2009 dissertation explored the movement.
In Texas, Harmony now educates more than 16,000 children. Eight schools have opened in the last year alone.
Dr. Yildirim said that while he had been influenced by Mr. Gulen -- he writes and speaks about his teachings -- his primary motivation in starting the schools was to give back to the community.
''My life changed here. I'm so thankful for that,'' he said. ''I believe some people born in this country are taking some things for granted.''
At first, Harmony Schools used a mix of local American and Turkish immigrant contractors. But as it has grown, especially in the rush of new schools, Harmony has increasingly relied on its Turkish network.
In response to questions, Harmony provided a list showing that local American contractors had been awarded 13 construction and renovation jobs over the years. But a review of contracts since January 2009 -- 35 contracts and $82 million worth of work -- found that all but 3 jobs totaling about $1.5 million went to Turkish-owned businesses.
TDM, builder of the new San Antonio school, is one of several companies that stand out -- for the size of their contracts, their seemingly overnight success or both. One of TDM's owners, records and interviews show, is Kemal Oksuz, president of the Turquoise Council for Americans and Eurasians, an umbrella group over several foundations established by Gulen followers. Since TDM was formed in November 2009, its work has involved only Harmony Schools and a job at the Turquoise Council headquarters, according to a company accountant.
Another TDM principal is a civil engineer, Osman Ozguc.
''Please don't think that I'm a new guy, inexperienced in this area,'' Mr. Ozguc said when asked about the San Antonio project, explaining that he had 26 years of construction experience, mostly on large projects in Turkey. ''I provided all the requirements asked in the bid. And when we got the job, we delivered in a very short time period, and with a very economical result.'' He did acknowledge that change orders had added about $1 million to the cost.
Mr. Ozguc said he formed TDM after a split from Solidarity, another Houston company that has done major ground-up construction jobs for Harmony in the past two years. Records show that Solidarity is run by Levent Ulusal, a civil engineer with a prior connection to Harmony: he was a school business manager until March 2009, when he joined Solidarity.
Since Texas charter schools do not get separate public money for facilities, Harmony's construction program is financed by bonds that will be paid off over time using regular public payments to the schools, bond documents show. The group has issued more than $200 million in bonds since 2007, making it the state's largest charter school bond issuer.
With public money in play, Texas law requires charter schools to award contracts to the bidder that offers the ''best value.'' Lowest is not necessarily best, with the schools given leeway. But the criteria for choosing the best bidder must be clear.
Last year, local contractors questioned the fairness of bidding on two Harmony renovation jobs in the Austin area. On one job, in the suburb of Pflugerville, the low bidder, at $1.17 million, was a well-known Texas company, Harvey-Cleary. The job went to Atlas Texas Construction and Trading, even though its bid was several hundred thousand dollars higher. Atlas, with offices in Texas and Turkey, shows up on a list of Gulen-affiliated companies in a 2006 cable from the American Consul General in Istanbul, Deborah K. Jones, that was released by WikiLeaks.
A vice president of Harvey-Cleary said Harmony never explained its decision.
The same day Atlas won the Pflugerville contract, it got a job at another Austin-area Harmony school, even though four bidders came in lower.
Harmony Schools asked two architects to analyze the disputed Austin jobs. Both architects had previously worked for Harmony Schools; both concluded that the jobs should have been awarded to Atlas.
Atlas has an eclectic business portfolio: for several years, it has also supplied breakfast and lunch at many Harmony schools. The contract is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Two other bidders submitted formal catering proposals. One was Preferred Meal Systems, a national company that undercut Atlas's price by 78 cents a day, a substantial margin given that the two meals are often supplied for about $4.
Jim Drumm, the regional vice president for Preferred Meal, said that when the company learned that its bid was lower than the winner's, ''We attempted, without success, to recontact Harmony Schools to learn why our proposal was rejected.''
Dr. Tarim said Preferred Meal was turned down because its food is heated in special company-installed ovens. With no kitchens in the schools, he said, there is no room for ovens.
Inside the Schools
Recently Dr. Tarim led a tour of one of Harmony's big renovation jobs -- the new home of the Harmony Science Academy, the chain's marquee Houston high school. The academy, one of 11 Harmony schools in Houston, was recently rated among the city's top 10 high schools by Children at Risk, an advocacy group. The campus used to be an ITT business center, and even now, the low-slung buildings communicate office park more than high school. There is also a new building, constructed by TDM, housing a gym and the Cosmos Foundation's headquarters.
This being Texas, the academy is conspicuous for the absence of a football field. But in many ways, the Harmony Schools seem much like standard public schools, albeit of the strict, testing-oriented sort in vogue today.
Students wear uniforms, and anything that detracts from uniform appearance -- even hoop earrings or highlighted hair -- is frowned upon. One teacher described a disciplinary system in which students receive points for behavioral infractions as minor as tilting back in a chair.
The students, as at most Gulen-inspired schools, represent a racial and ethnic cross-section of the community. Many are children of immigrants drawn by the upwardly mobile allure of careers in technology and health care. Beginning in fourth grade, all students must complete science projects.
In a physics class, students demonstrated a homemade hovercraft -- a simple plywood disc fitted with a chair. Rigged to a leaf blower, the contraption levitated inches above the ground, even with someone in the chair.
The project illustrates principles of physics, but the larger point, said the teacher, Levent Sakar, is developing an excitement about science.
''Once a student does a project like that, they will never forget it,'' he said.
Still, the bottom line is measurable achievement. And so the Harmony schools place a heavy emphasis on preparing for state assessment tests, with four practice tests annually, according to schedules on school Web sites. Each practice test occupies the better part of a week, and students who fail get mandatory tutoring, some of it on Saturdays.
Judging school quality, of course, is an imprecise business. But by the measure that Harmony and most charter schools have embraced -- scores on the state tests -- the Harmony schools seem to be succeeding. Last year, 16 of the schools were deemed ''exemplary,'' the highest rating, while seven were rated ''recognized,'' and the other two ''academically acceptable.'' The eight new schools have not yet been rated.
The Harmony schools advertise themselves as college preparatory schools with every graduate accepted to college, and a bulletin board in the hallway at the science academy displays pictures of this year's senior class, along with their college acceptances. But Harmony's ''100 percent'' acceptance rate actually represents only a small census, since most of the schools do not have senior classes and many students transfer earlier on. Statewide, 154 students graduated this year, the largest class yet.
And while the schools' combined math and English SAT scores -- an average of 1026 -- were 37 points above the statewide average last year, they fell short of the 1100 on those two parts that the state regards as predicting ''college readiness.''
Dr. Tarim, who came from Turkey and studied aquatic ecology at Texas A&M, objects to common references to the schools as Turkish. Still, even if they are American charter schools first and foremost, the schools do have an undeniable Turkish flavor.
Many of the furnishings are imported from Turkey -- at a San Antonio school, the entryway features a turquoise arch, and the lobby ceiling is decorated with images of the sun and a star and crescent moon. Harmony advertises that its teachers ''are recruited from around the world,'' but most of its foreign teachers are Turkish men, and all but a handful of the 33 principals are men from Turkey. In addition to the standard foreign languages, the schools offer instruction in Turkish. They encourage students and teachers, even parents, to join subsidized trips to Turkey.
What they avoid, as publicly financed schools, is religious instruction. And amid jabs from critics -- educators, disaffected parents and bloggers -- about their Turkishness and ties to a Muslim group, the schools take great pains to separate themselves from the Gulen movement. They are not ''Gulen schools,'' they insist, and have no affiliation with any movement.
''I'm not a follower of anybody,'' Dr. Tarim said in an interview. Records show, however, that when applying to the State of Texas to form Harmony schools, he was a consultant to Virginia International University in Fairfax, one of the private universities that lawyers for Mr. Gulen say were originally inspired by his teachings.
At a forum on the schools last December in Houston, Dr. Hendrick, the Maryland professor, argued that such denials had only deepened the ambiguity and helped fuel suspicion. ''Why do leaders deny affiliation when affiliation is clear?'' he asked.
Ultimately, some scholars say, the schools are about more than just teaching schoolchildren.
Hakan Yavuz, a Turkish-born assistant professor at the University of Utah's Middle East Center, says he does not oppose the movement, though he is critical of what he calls its male domination and lack of transparency. In his view, the schools are the foundation for the movement's attempts to grow in the United States.
''The main purpose right now is to show the positive side of Islam and to make Americans sympathize with Islam,'' Dr. Yavuz said.
Teachers and Visas
Around the country, the most persistent controversy involving the schools -- and the one most covered in the news -- centers on the hundreds of Turkish teachers and administrators working on special visas.
The schools say they bring in foreign teachers because of a shortage of Americans qualified to teach math and science. Of the 1,500 employees at the Texas Harmony schools this year, Dr. Tarim said, 292 were on the special ''H-1B'' visas, meant for highly skilled foreign workers who fill a need unmet by the American workforce.
But some teachers and their unions, as well as immigration experts, have questioned how earnestly the schools worked to recruit American workers. They say loopholes have made it easy to bring in workers with relatively ordinary skills who substitute for American workers.
''I think they have a preference for these H-1B workers,'' said Dr. Ronil Hira, a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology who has studied the visa program. ''It may be a preference for a variety of reasons -- lower wages or a network where they've got family or friends and connections and this is a stepping stone for them to get a green card.''
The American jobs, often offered to educators at Gulen schools around the world or graduates of Gulen universities, also provide a way for the movement to expand its ranks in this country, Dr. Yavuz said.
American consular employees reviewing visas have questioned the credentials of some teachers as they sought to enter the country. ''Most applicants had no prior teaching experience, and the schools were listed as related to'' Mr. Gulen, a consular employee wrote in a 2009 cable. It did not say which schools had hired the teachers. Some with dubious credentials were denied visas.
In February, a Chicago charter school union affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers complained to the federal Department of Labor, alleging that the Chicago Math and Science Academy and Concept Schools, a group that operates 25 schools in the Midwest, had abused the visa system by ''routinely assigning these teachers duties or class load that seemingly do not take into account the laws governing H1-B visa holders.''
The Labor Department had already been investigating at least one Concept school. The investigation appeared to have been triggered by a complaint in July 2008 by Mustafa Emanet, a network systems administrator and teacher at a middle school in Cleveland. By law, imported teachers must be paid ''prevailing wage.'' Mr. Emanet alleged that while his visa reflected his promised salary, $44,000, he was actually paid $28,000 his first year.
A Labor Department spokesman said the investigation was ongoing.
Expanding the Network
The heart of the movement's Texas operations is the Turquoise Center, a Houston complex that houses several foundations established by Gulen followers. Their activities show how the movement has integrated itself into life in Texas, often by dint of the foundations' connections to the Harmony Schools.
The Turquoise Center opened in 2008, financed partly through donations from Gulen followers, who on average tithe 10 percent of their income, experts say. The money, Dr. Hendrick wrote in his dissertation, goes ''to pay for a student's scholarship, to provide start-up capital for a new school, to send a group of influential Americans on a two-week trip to Turkey or to sponsor an academic conference devoted to Fethullah Gulen.''
Dozens of Texans -- from state lawmakers to congressional staff members to university professors -- have taken trips to Turkey partly financed by the foundations.
One group, the Raindrop Foundation, helped pay for State Senator Leticia Van de Putte's travel to Istanbul last year, according to a recent campaign report. In January, she co-sponsored a Senate resolution commending Mr. Gulen for ''his ongoing and inspirational contributions to promoting global peace and understanding.''
In an interview, Ms. Van de Putte described the trip as a working visit.
The Raindrop Foundation says its mission is to promote Turkish culture in America. It sponsors cooking classes, traditional Turkish dinners and performances of the Whirling Dervishes, a dance group associated with Sufi Muslim tradition. It also organizes an annual Turkish Language Olympiad where 6,000 students, many from Harmony schools, compete in Turkish language, poetry, dance and singing contests.
The 2011 singing winner was a Hispanic girl from a Harmony school in northwest Houston.
The Raindrop Foundation's president, Mehmet Okumus, is a former Harmony school principal, and some of the foundation's income -- $770,000 a year, he said -- comes through arrangements with the schools. Two Raindrop Foundation units, Zenith Learning and Merit Learning, operate after-school programs, test preparation programs and summer camps at the schools. Parents pay Zenith up to $200 a week to leave their children after school. Of that, Harmony collects 25 cents per child per day, according to Dr. Tarim.
Another group at the Turquoise Center, the Institute of Interfaith Dialog, sponsors lectures on interfaith relations and finances the Gulen Institute at the University of Houston, which sponsors graduate scholarships in social work and pays for graduate students to study in Turkey.
The Institute of Interfaith Dialog -- founded by Mr. Gulen himself, according to court documents -- does not appear to have business dealings with Harmony. But its president, Yuksel Alp Aslandogan, does. Indeed, in 2002, he purchased the former Austin church that became Harmony's second school.
Dr. Aslandogan, a former computer science professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, paid $1.375 million for the building, then leased it to Harmony. Last year, he said in an e-mail, Harmony bought it for $1.7 million. He described his original purchase as ''an investment opportunity toward a good cause'' but declined to say how much he made off the deal, emphasizing that he had to pay taxes and make repairs.
Dr. Aslandogan has other connections to Harmony. He is chief executive of the Texas Gulf Foundation, a nonprofit that provides an array of services to the schools.
The foundation, in fact, grew out of Harmony: its owners and operators originally worked for the schools, according to a statement from Harmony, but left to form Texas Gulf, which they believed would ''provide Harmony and other Texas schools with quality services at lower costs.'' Until recently, Texas Gulf had offices at a Harmony campus.
Since 2007, Harmony says, it has paid Texas Gulf $525,000 for services that include an online professional development program for teachers and administrators, an assessment tool for students and special education assessments.
Dr. Aslandogan reflected on his role in Texas' Turkish community in a PBS program on the Gulen movement broadcast in January. He said he donates ''beyond the expected level in my income'' and added: ''I believe that all these actions -- charitable donations, volunteerism -- are pleasing to God. That's why I am doing all this.''

HEADLINE: The People's Opera, in Peril

BYLINE: By JULIUS RUDEL. 
Julius Rudel was the general director and principal conductor of the New York City Opera from 1957 to 1979.

 BODY:
THE New York City Opera was born in 1943, a year after I graduated from the Mannes Music School. Laszlo Halasz, the company's first music director, hired me as a rehearsal pianist and vocal coach. I was 22 and had arrived in the United States five years earlier, after Hitler took over my native Austria.
That an opera company could be created while World War II raged spoke to America's best aspirations. Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia called it ''the people's opera,'' in contrast to the older Metropolitan Opera, and from the beginning, it was. It brought opera to the masses, including immigrants like myself. It exposed audiences to innovative and challenging works. It showcased the talents of American singers and composers. 
Today, City Opera, to which I devoted some of the best years of my conducting career, is fighting to survive. Last month, it revealed plans to leave Lincoln Center, its home for the last 45 years, and to perform at various, unspecified locations around New York. It slashed its $31 million budget and laid off nearly a quarter of its administrative staff members. And it declined to say what operas it will put on next season, where they will be performed or how they will be financed. The vague plans put forward would leave the company not even a shadow of what it was intended to be -- and became.
Some have blamed the company's woes on its Lincoln Center location, citing the expense and the proximity to the Met. But I believe the location has become a scapegoat for the hardships of a company that has suffered from inconsistent leadership by its board and a failure to engage in the smart programming and strategic planning that companies need to survive in hard times. I cannot sit by and watch as the legacy that was built by a company, if not a family, of talented, dedicated people is cast aside.
In 1965, when we considered moving from our first home (New York City Center, on West 56th Street) to the New York State Theater (now the David H. Koch Theater) at Lincoln Center, I was apprehensive, fearing that we might be forced to abandon the qualities that had allowed us to grow. I was wrong.
From our first night in our new home -- Feb. 22, 1966, the North American premiere of Alberto Ginastera's ''Don Rodrigo,'' starring a 25-year-old Placido Domingo -- the benefits were apparent: the ambience, the proximity to other institutions (including, yes, the Met), and the attention the international music press lavished on the new arts complex. That attention helped us to attract, despite our low fees, top-flight singers, conductors and directors.
The new space and new technologies also allowed us to put on memorable productions of Arrigo Boito's ''Mefistofele,'' Leos Janacek's ''Makropulos Case'' and Erich Wolfgang Korngold's ''Tote Stadt,'' among others. We presented new works and reinterpreted old ones to sold-out houses. At its peak, we presented 200 performances a year in New York and undertook annual tours to Los Angeles and Washington.
We also developed teams of ensemble singers, many of whom went on to major international careers -- Beverly Sills, Norman Treigle, Phyllis Curtin, Beverly Wolff, Samuel Ramey, Catherine Malfitano and many, many others -- and helped establish the American opera singer as a force to be reckoned with. If we had become the traveling band that is currently being proposed, many of those careers might never have blossomed.
Indeed, Lincoln Center solidified the company's place not as New York's second opera company, but as New York's other opera company. We were never thought of, and never thought of ourselves, as a lesser Met.
Over 68 years, I have seen City Opera thrive and I've seen it struggle. I realize that today's economic climate and changing paradigms in the arts pose monumental challenges. Opera companies everywhere face the question of how to attract and retain audiences; keeping the opera experience fresh and meaningful, making certain that what is presented is first-class, and experimenting with innovative repertory and productions that steadily build audiences are vital to assure opera's survival.
Once before, in 1956, City Opera faced the threat of bankruptcy, but instead of retrenching and cutting, the board boldly moved forward, securing the financing we needed to stabilize the company and then grow. The current board must reconsider its decision and demonstrate the commitment and vision its predecessors had.
If the board and management of City Opera cannot finance, produce and support full seasons of new works and standard operas in interesting productions with first-rate casts as we once did, they should be replaced, so that 68 years from now no one will wonder what ever became of City Opera.

HEADLINE: Hitler's First Anti-Semitic Writing Finds a Buyer

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT, Germany -- In 1919, a soldier in Munich discovered that he could galvanize small groups of fellow trench warfare veterans with virulently anti-Semitic diatribes. A superior officer, impressed with the soldier's oratorical skills, asked him to commit his ideas to paper. Out of that came the first written record of Adolf Hitler's obsessive hostility toward Jews, an embryonic form of the worldview that would later lead to the Holocaust and millions of deaths.
Now, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles has acquired what may be the original version of the document, known as the Gemlich Letter. In July, the center plans to put it on public view for the first time, at its Museum of Tolerance, making the letter the centerpiece of its Holocaust exhibit.
The text of the letter is well known to scholars. It is considered significant because it demonstrates just how early in his career Hitler was formulating his anti-Semitic views. 
''It is his first written statement about the Jews,'' said the historian Saul Friedlander, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2008 for his study of the Holocaust. ''It shows that this was the very core of his political passion.''
The version of the letter best known to scholars is in an archive in Munich, and news that another copy had made its way to Los Angeles was met with some skepticism among historians. The market for Hitler memorabilia is notorious for forgeries.
''It has to have very good provenance,'' said Klaus Lankheit, deputy director of the archive at the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich. ''From my experience, I would be very skeptical.''
But Othmar Plockinger, an expert on early Hitler documents, says it appears that the document acquired by the Wiesenthal Center is the original letter written by Hitler, and that the one in Munich is a copy made about the same time. ''There are a lot of points that make me believe it could be the original,'' Mr. Plockinger said of the Wiesenthal Center's document.
Mr. Plockinger compared a copy of the document acquired by the center with the version of the Gemlich Letter at the Bavarian State Archives in Munich. Mr. Plockinger, who is working on an annotated version of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' for the Institute of Contemporary History, cautioned that more research would be needed to be 100 percent sure.
Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and director of the Wiesenthal Center, says he is convinced that the four-page letter, acquired by the organization for $150,000 through a dealer, is genuine. ''I am absolutely certain our copy is signed by Adolf Hitler,'' Rabbi Hier said.
Rabbi Hier provided records indicating that the document was found in the final months of World War II by an American soldier named William F. Ziegler. In a handwritten letter in 1988 provided by the dealer who sold the document to the Wiesenthal Center, Mr. Ziegler said he had found the document among others scattered on the floor of what appeared to be a Nazi Party archive near Nuremberg.
Rabbi Hier also provided documents from the dealer showing that Hitler's signature on the letter had been validated in 1988 and again in 1990 by Charles Hamilton Jr., a New York handwriting expert and dealer who was famous for exposing fake Hitler diaries in 1983. Mr. Hamilton died in 1996.
Rabbi Hier said he had a chance to acquire the letter when it first came on the market in 1988, but was skeptical because the document was typed. That seemed odd to him for the period in question, when Hitler was an ordinary soldier in a country devastated economically by war. Typewriters were very costly in 1919, and even many military units did not have them.
''How did he get hold of a typewriter?'' Rabbi Hier asked.
This year, Rabbi Hier learned that there was a plausible explanation. In 1919, during the upheaval that followed Germany's defeat in World War I, Hitler was attached to a military propaganda unit of the Bavarian Army in Munich that was trying to stamp out Bolshevik sentiment carried home by prisoners of war in Russia.
Hitler's ability to hold the interest of his listeners drew him to the attention of a superior officer, Capt. Karl Mayr. When a soldier named Adolf Gemlich, who was doing similar propaganda work for the army in Ulm, wrote asking for a clarification of ''the Jewish Question,'' Captain Mayr gave Hitler the assignment.
Hitler wrote to Mr. Gemlich that occasional pogroms against the Jews were not enough -- the Jewish ''race'' must be ''removed'' from Germany as a matter of national policy.
Ian Kershaw, a British author of best-selling Hitler biographies, says it is very unlikely that Hitler already envisioned the industrialized extermination of the Jews that he would pursue. ''Not even Hitler was capable of imagining in 1919 what could be done,'' Mr. Kershaw said.
But the letter, Mr. Kershaw said, showed that ''already in 1919 Hitler has a clear notion of removal of the Jews altogether.''
Hitler either wrote the letter in longhand and had it typed by someone in Captain Mayr's office, or dictated the letter, according to a 1959 article in a German historical quarterly, which appears to be the first scholarly mention of the document.
Captain Mayr later turned against Hitler and died at the Buchenwald concentration camp during the final months of the war.
The document in the state archives in Munich is not the original and is not signed by Hitler, said Johann Pornbacher, a representative of the archives. He says the archives has no record of where the original is.
Mr. Plockinger, the historian who examined both versions, said that the copy in the Munich archive corrected some typographical and punctuation errors in the Wiesenthal Center document. At the same time, the Munich copy adopted some nonsensical commas written by hand in the Wiesenthal Center document.
''This wouldn't make sense to a forger,'' Mr. Plockinger said. ''So structural aspects speak in favor of the authenticity'' of the document acquired by the Wiesenthal Center.
Rabbi Hier said he had persuaded members of the Wiesenthal Center board of trustees to donate the $150,000 purchase price for the Gemlich letter.
The dealer, Joseph Maddalena, president of Profiles in History, said he first acquired the letter two decades ago from a small-time operator in Kansas, who in turn had bought it from Mr. Ziegler, the soldier who is said to have found the letter. Mr. Maddalena said he never met Mr. Ziegler and did not know if he was still alive.
''In terms of the Holocaust,'' Rabbi Hier said, ''we have nothing that would compare to this document.''

HEADLINE: Top Obama Economic Player to Return to University Post

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Austan Goolsbee, a longtime adviser to President Obama and the only economist left on his core economic team, plans to leave as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers by September, after a year in the job, to return to the University of Chicago.
With the recovery flagging, the White House is eager to name a successor to Mr. Goolsbee this summer and is considering several academic economists, an administration official said on Monday. The job requires Senate confirmation. 
''Since I first ran for the U.S. Senate, Austan has been a close friend and one of my most trusted advisers,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement late Monday. ''Over the past several years, he has helped steer our country out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and although there is still much work ahead, his insights and counsel have helped lead us toward an economy that is growing and creating millions of jobs. He is one of America's great economic thinkers.''
Mr. Goolsbee, 41, a left-of-center economist who has advised Mr. Obama since the president was a state senator, has been part of the inner circle since the earliest days of the Obama presidential campaign in late 2006. He was the chief economic adviser at the Chicago campaign headquarters and would call on outsiders on occasion for expertise; many of the Democratic economists with experience in government initially were allied with Mr. Obama's main rival for the nomination, Hillary Rodham Clinton, because they had worked in her husband's administration.
Mr. Goolsbee's lack of Washington experience and his relative youth were believed to work against his getting one of the top economic posts as Mr. Obama filled his administration after the 2008 election. Mr. Obama named Mr. Goolsbee one of the three members of the Council of Economic Advisers. But when the chairwoman, Christina D. Romer, left last year to return to teaching at the University of California, Berkeley in September, Mr. Obama promoted Mr. Goolsbee to the cabinet-level chairmanship.
In that job, Mr. Goolsbee has focused on developing the economic arguments for government assistance and public-private partnerships for promoting innovation, research and development, education and infrastructure -- an area he once taught about, and will do so again -- even as the federal government is reducing spending elsewhere to try to rein in the growth of the national debt.
The theme of spending ''investments'' to ''win the future,'' introduced in Mr. Obama's State of the Union address in January, has been a staple of the president's agenda and speeches since.
''Austan's insights and counsel on how business and government can work together to foster innovation and grow the economy have been invaluable,'' said Jeffrey R. Immelt, chairman and chief executive officer of General Electric, who worked with Mr. Goolsbee as head of Mr. Obama's advisory Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.
Advisers say Mr. Obama knew when he elevated Mr. Goolsbee last year that Mr. Goolsbee would not stay long in the job and wanted to return to the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, which already had extended his leave from his tenured job. Mr. Goolsbee, who had been a professor there for 14 years, in an interview said it was ''a dream job'' and ''I didn't want to give that up.''
He said he made a final decision in recent weeks. Typically chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers do not serve long given that many are on leave from professorships, a fact that Mr. Goolsbee alluded to. He also dismissed any suggestion that the timing was bad given the recent evidence that the recovery was stumbling.
''I think the trend is going the right way,'' Mr. Goolsbee said. ''I think most of the private sector is anticipating the economy will pick back up in the second half of the year.''
While the University of Chicago is generally known for a conservative brand of economics, Mr. Goolsbee has a reputation as a left-leaning centrist and a strong advocate of free trade, a stance that has left union leaders in the Democratic base suspicious of him.
Mr. Goolsbee has advised Mr. Obama since the economy fell into recession and the financial system nearly collapsed amid the 2008 campaign and, once Mr. Obama was in the White House, was part of an initial economic team that included Ms. Romer, Lawrence H. Summers and Peter R. Orszag, each of whom has left.
In that crisis atmosphere, tensions built on occasion between Mr. Goolsbee and Mr. Summers, who headed the White House National Economic Council and coordinated administration policy. In one disagreement, Mr. Goolsbee supported bailing out General Motors but not Chrysler; when Mr. Summers did not invite Mr. Goolsbee to a pivotal meeting, Mr. Obama summoned him to hear his views.
Ultimately Mr. Obama decided to bail out both companies.
''As a guy who was with Mr. Obama from the start, he's had a real role to play,'' said Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who worked closely with Mr. Goolsbee during the campaign and when Mr. Volcker headed Mr. Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board.
Mr. Goolsbee, an amateur comic, was the public face of White House policies more often than predecessors, often using a white board, and is likely to play an informal role from Chicago during the 2012 campaign.
''Austan has a great facility for communicating economics,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief strategist, who has returned to Chicago to begin campaign planning. ''The fact that he's going to be back here is really useful.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the pending departure of Austan Goolsbee as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers misstated the name of the school at the University of Chicago to which he is returning as an economics professor. It is the Booth School of Business, not the Graduate School of Business, its former name.

HEADLINE: Resistance Bogs Down Financial Overhaul

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Nearly one year after Congress passed financial changes to rein in the banking sector, more than two dozen of the legislation's rules are behind schedule, and no end to the wrangling over details is in sight.
The delays come as regulators extend public comment periods on the rules, and as some on Wall Street and in Congress resist the changes. One result may be that many new safeguards do not take hold in earnest before the next election, an outcome that could open the door for newly elected officials to back away from the overhaul.
The rules are mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law and range from curbs on executive compensation to consumer banking protection provisions to more transparency in the trading of derivatives, those complex financial instruments that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.
So far, 28 of the financial overhaul rule-making deadlines have been missed, according to Davis Polk, a law firm that is tracking the rules. Of the 385 new rules to be written, the law firm says, regulators have completed only 24 requirements; they were supposed to have taken 41 such actions by now. 
''There's an attempt to kill this through delay,'' said Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland and a former official at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is in charge of writing batches of the rules. ''The difference between eight or nine months and 24 months could be cataclysmic here.''
The setbacks and resistance extend across many types of new rules, including ones to limit the debit card fees that banks can charge retailers and to require banks to retain more of the risk in certain home loans.
But the efforts were especially apparent at a hearing last month in Washington related to derivatives. Some of the most powerful players in the derivatives market -- which is closely controlled by just a small group of banks -- argued that the government should allow a slow pace of changes for rewriting derivatives contracts.
On Monday, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, spoke about the Dodd-Frank rules in a speech in Atlanta, warning that there were efforts by groups that oppose the reform to starve regulators of the resources they need to put new rules in place.
''Those in the U.S. financial community who are supporting these efforts to block resources and appointments are looking for leverage over the rules still being written,'' Mr. Geithner said.
He specifically focused on derivatives rule-writing, where some financial groups have complained that European rules may differ from the new rules in the United States. He said he hoped regulators in Europe and Asia would create standardized rules to prevent a ''race to the bottom.''
Regulators in the United States overseeing the process say it is difficult to tell how many of the concerns that financial executives and their lobbyists raise are valid and which ones are exaggerated.
''For us, it's a question of figuring out the legitimate interests of folks who say, 'Wait a minute, slow down' because they really want us to get it right, and some of them who really have an ulterior motive of just running the clock out,'' said Bart Chilton, one of the three Democratic commissioners of the commodities futures trading agency, which is overseeing most rule-writing for derivatives. ''It's going a lot slower than I had envisioned.''
Financial firms argue that slower deliberations may lead to smarter outcomes. Some lawmakers agree, and some voted in recent weeks in Congressional committees to delay derivatives rules at least a year. Many of those rules were to have been completed by the July anniversary of the Dodd-Frank bill.
Regulators have been swamped by public comments and asked for more funds and personnel to meet the demands. In April, the C.F.T.C. extended all of its derivative comment periods for a month.
''Right now there's a tacit truce on the deadlines,'' said Margaret E. Tahyar, a partner at Davis Polk, which represents financial institutions. ''Really, it's the right thing to have a little bit more time on this. There really hasn't been anything like this ever before in terms of rule-makings.''
Perhaps nowhere are the stakes higher for the megabanks than with derivatives, which insure against many different risks in the economy. Some of the Dodd-Frank rules center on increasing security and transparency in this $600 trillion market. For instance, many are related to clearinghouses, which provide a central repository for money backing those wagers. Some of the changes threaten to cut into banks' lucrative profit margins.
At the derivatives round table in May, bankers and other representatives of financial firms asked for substantial implementation periods on derivatives rules. For instance, Athanassios Diplas, of Deutsche Bank, said the bank would need 18 to 24 months ''simply to sign documentation'' related to the new rules because of ''bandwidth'' issues, according to a transcript from the event.
He said, ''If you think about it even in man-hours or man-weeks or whatever, one client -- an attorney can do 100 of these a week, which sounds pretty aggressive -- we're talking about 800 man- weeks.''
Stephen O'Connor, an executive from Morgan Stanley, came up with an even more lengthy estimate, saying his clients say it could take an entire day to renegotiate contracts and that could mean ''100 man-years worth of effort.''
One Goldman Sachs banker, R. Martin Chavez, said that documents on valuing derivatives represented ''a mind-bendingly difficult problem you could fill libraries with, with very boring Ph.D.'s on that topic.''
One panelist was quick to argue that the bankers were trying to stall the rules. James Cawley, the chief executive who runs an electronic trading operation called Javelin Capital Markets, jumped in, saying, ''We don't think we are putting men on the moon when it comes to documentation.''
Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and Goldman did not make these bankers available for interviews.
Two of the commodities agency's commissioners, Scott O'Malia, a Republican, and Gary Gensler, the Democratic chairman, attended the round table, with Mr. Gensler leaping out of the audience periodically to pose questions. Afterward, Mr. O'Malia said he disagreed with critics who say ''this is a delay tactic.''
''The panelists made it very clear they need months, not years,'' he said in a speech at the Heritage Foundation.
Mr. O'Malia called the agency's extended comment period ''a natural pause.'' Mr. Gensler said in an interview that the extension was a good move but that ''the American public is not protected until we finalize these rules.''
One way that banks can delay progress is by haggling within industry associations over small turns of phrase in legal agreements. The banks lately have been clashing with large customers, like hedge funds, in discussions of new paperwork needed for dealing with trade rejections, situations in which derivatives trades do not go through because of client financing problems. Late last month, JPMorgan Chase was supposed to host a meeting to discuss it, but lawyers for large banks canceled the meeting at the last minute. The banks, large customers say, drafted the documents in ways that favor the biggest banks because it would make it more difficult for customers to use a large number of banks for trading.
The issue of whether new documents or rules give advantages to just a handful of banks is particularly relevant because the Justice Department and the European Commission have been investigating this market for antitrust behavior.

HEADLINE: Ford Strategy Will Call for Stepping Up Expansion, Especially in Asia

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Despite gloomy economic conditions and uncertain prospects for global auto sales, the Ford Motor Company is accelerating its expansion plans and setting high targets for international growth, particularly in Asia.
Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, is expected on Tuesday to unveil an aggressive strategy to increase the company's worldwide sales to 8 million vehicles a year from 5.3 million by middecade. That would put the Detroit automaker at the top echelon of world production. Last year, Toyota, the leader, sold about 8.42 million vehicles.
But Ford will be playing catch-up in Asia, where competitors like Toyota, General Motors and Volkswagen have larger shares and better brand recognition. 
''Ford is trying to make up for lost time in Asia,'' said Michael Robinet, director of global forecasting at the research firm IHS Automotive. ''They have to do a lot of heavy lifting in the next decade to become a major player.''
Mr. Mulally plans to share Ford's growth goals with investors and analysts at a meeting in New York, representing another step in the revitalization of the nation's second-biggest auto company.
''We're clearly transitioning into a growth mode after going through a horrific recession and industry collapse,'' Mr. Mulally said in an interview on Monday. ''We are now positioned to serve customers where the market is growing.''
After revamping its core North American business and posting eight straight profitable quarters, Ford is pushing hard to build up operations in Asia. The company has already exceeded expectations for its turnaround in its home market, and now has the financial strength and product lineup to try to repeat that success in what has been its weakest region.
The company expects to expand sales of its Asia-Pacific-Africa division to one-third of its global sales by 2020, from 15 percent of its overall volume currently.
Its steepest challenge appears to be in China, where other automakers have more established brands and deeper ties to consumers. G.M., for example, is the market leader in China with a 14 percent share, while Ford has less than 4 percent, according to IHS Automotive.
But Ford has drastically transformed its product portfolio since Mr. Mulally took over as chief executive five years ago, from an overreliance on trucks and S.U.V.'s to smaller cars. Mr. Mulally said that by 2020, small cars would make up about 55 percent of all Ford sales.
New cars like the Fiesta subcompact and Focus sedan are made on global platforms and sold in various markets around the world. That is a huge change from how Ford operated in the past, when it made different cars and trucks for specific regions of the world. Now the company can sell the same models in China, for example, that it offers in the United States. The change has cut costs and allowed Ford to shorten the time it takes to develop new products and refresh older ones.
Mr. Mulally said that transformation was the main reason that the company could now concentrate on gaining new customers in fast-growing markets like China and India.
''Up until now we haven't had the products,'' he said. ''And now we have a company that's operating profitably in all the regions of the world.''
Ford's two hometown competitors, G.M. and Chrysler, both required considerable financial assistance from the United States government to survive and restructure in bankruptcy court.
Ford, by contrast, was able to weather the recession without federal aid. The company mortgaged most of its assets in 2006 to borrow $23 billion, then sold off noncore brands like Volvo and Jaguar and reorganized operations to produce a new lineup of smaller, more fuel-efficient models.
The strategy paid off. Last year, Ford earned a $6.6 billion profit and increased its United States market share for the second consecutive year -- the first time it had done that since 1993.
The company continued its surge in the first quarter of this year when it posted a $2.6 billion profit that beat analysts' projections. Meanwhile, Ford has paid back $17 billion of its debt, while maintaining cash reserves of $21 billion.
Ford has already started its product blitz overseas. By middecade, it will increase the number of models it offers in India to eight vehicles, from three, and in China to 15, from five. It is also building several new plants in Asia and adding dealers.
In the past, Ford's Asia strategy relied heavily on its Japanese partner, Mazda. But it has substantially reduced its stake in Mazda, and is building up its own regional staff of executives and other people.
''Asia is clearly the next frontier for Ford,'' said Mr. Robinet of IHS Automotive. ''It's definitely possible for them to grow significantly because they're working from such a low base.''
Mr. Mulally said he was undaunted by Ford's underdog position. He said that Chinese consumers were well aware of Ford's products from the Internet, and appreciated its growing reputation for quality and fuel-efficiency around the world.
''The entire industry in China is growing, so it's not like you're taking share away from another competitor,'' he said. ''You have all these new customers that are now entering the marketplace and looking for world-class products.''

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Rules for Drug Firm in a Patent Dispute

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Monday sided with a drug company over Stanford University in a patent dispute concerning a test to measure the amount of H.I.V. in a patient's blood.
In a second decision, the court ruled that plaintiffs in a securities fraud class action against Halliburton did not have to prove that false statements from the company caused them to lose money in order to band together in a class action.
In the patent case, Stanford v. Roche Molecular Systems, No. 09-1159, the court considered how a 1980 federal law, the Bayh-Dole Act, affected rights to the H.I.V. test. It was invented by Dr. Mark Holodniy, a fellow at Stanford's department of infectious diseases who had been assigned by the university to conduct research at the Cetus Corporation, a private firm. 
Dr. Holodniy had signed a contract saying that ''I agree to assign'' inventions arising from his employment at Stanford to the university. He later signed a contract saying that ''I will assign and do hereby assign'' to Cetus inventions arising from his time there.
Roche Molecular Systems bought Cetus's rights in the H.I.V. test and created a kit that became widely used in hospitals and clinics. Stanford sued for patent infringement; Roche said it was entitled to sell the kits in light of the agreement between Dr. Holodniy and Cetus; and Stanford responded that the doctor had no rights to assign given the Bayh-Dole Act, which specifies how rights in patents are allocated when federal money is involved.
The ''general rule,'' Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority in a 7-to-2 decision, is that ''rights in an invention belong to the inventor,'' even if created on an employer's watch. (Outside the patent context, Chief Justice Roberts said, the basic rule often goes the other way. ''No one would claim,'' he wrote, ''that an autoworker who builds a car while working in a factory owns that car.'')
A lower court ruled that Dr. Holodniy's agreement with Stanford had been only a promise to assign his rights in the future while the one with Cetus had been an authentic assignment. That interpretation of the two agreements, which was not at issue in the Supreme Court, meant, the chief justice said, that Roche would win unless the Bayh-Dole Act had altered the basic rule that inventors controlled their patent rights.
The act allocates rights between the federal government and federal contractors like Stanford, Chief Justice Roberts wrote. But, he continued, ''nowhere in the act are inventors deprived of their interest in federally funded inventions.''
The act, the chief justice wrote, ''simply assures contractors that they may keep title to whatever it is they already have.'' But, he wrote, ''you cannot retain something unless you already have it.''
The decision may not be particularly consequential. With more carefully drafted assignment agreements, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, ''the statute as a practical matter works pretty much the way Stanford says it should.''
In a dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said he would have returned the case to the lower courts for further consideration of two questions: the proper interpretation of the interaction of the two assignment agreements and whether the Bayh-Dole Act should be assumed to require assignment of patent rights by employees of government contractors to their employers.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the dissent.
In the securities fraud case, Erica P. John Fund v. Halliburton, No. 09-1403, the court considered what plaintiffs must prove in order to join together in a class action.
The plaintiffs, who bought Halliburton stock from 1999 to 2001, said the company had made false statements designed to inflate its stock price on three topics: its financial exposure to asbestos claims, how much it stood to make from its engineering and construction business, and the expected benefits of a merger with Dresser Industries.
The lower courts ruled that the plaintiffs had met most but not all of the requirements to proceed as a class. The missing element, the federal appeals court in New Orleans said, was that they had failed to prove ''loss causation,'' that is, ''that the corrected truth of the former falsehoods actually caused the stock price to fall and resulted in the losses.''
In a unanimous decision written by Chief Justice Roberts, the court ruled that such proof was not required at the class certification stage.
It was true, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, that finding proof that the investors had relied on the misstatements was part of the class certification basis. But loss causation is a logically different issue, he wrote. It requires proof, he said, that ''a misrepresentation that affected the integrity of the market price also caused a subsequent economic loss.''
In presenting its case to the Supreme Court, Halliburton essentially conceded that proof of loss causation was not required at the class certification stage. What the appeals court actually meant in using the phrase, Halliburton contended, was ''price impact,'' that is, that the false statements affected the stock price in the first place.
''We do not accept Halliburton's wishful interpretation of the court of appeals' opinion,'' Chief Justice Roberts wrote. ''Whatever Halliburton thinks the court of appeals meant to say, what it said was loss causation.''

HEADLINE: An Elaborate Choreography, by Arabs and the West, to Push Transition in Yemen

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Reporting was contributed by Yasser Alarami and Kawkab al-Thaibani from Sana, Yemen, and Laura Kasinof and Scott Shane from Washington.

 BODY:
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Diplomatic maneuvering intensified on Monday to push President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen to accept a peaceful transition from power while he recuperates in a Saudi military hospital from burns and other injuries sustained during an attack on his palace mosque.
Top aides maintained that Mr. Saleh would return home within a matter of days. But the United States, Saudi Arabia, the European Union and the other Gulf Arab states engaged in a choreographed effort to stress that the fractious country, rocked by street protests demanding Mr. Saleh's ouster for four months, needed change. 
In Washington alone, the White House, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and her spokesman all said that the time had come to implement peaceful, democratic transition through a delayed Arab plan that would usher in a temporary government and organize new parliamentary elections over a 90-day period.
''We think an immediate transition is in the best interests of the Yemeni people,'' Mrs. Clinton said when asked at a news conference if Mr. Saleh should stay outside Yemen. ''The instability and lack of security currently afflicting Yemen cannot be addressed until there is some process that everyone knows is going to lead to the sort of economic and political reforms that they are seeking.''
Obama administration officials have been pressuring Mr. Saleh for weeks to accept the plan, negotiated by the Gulf Cooperation Council. But with President Saleh's sons and nephews still in charge of much of the country's security forces, it remains critical to get him to agree to step down formally and begin a political transition, they said.
In Saudi Arabia, which wields substantial if imperfect influence over Yemeni tribes through cash subsidies, the cabinet issued a statement urging that the transition plan move forward, as did the G.C.C. Mr. Saleh, 69 and the president of Yemen for the past 33 years, had been on the brink of signing and then balked three times in recent months.
In the Yemeni capital of Sana, opposition groups tried to encourage the transition by referring to Abed Rabbo Mansour al-Hadi, Mr. Saleh's vice president who he left in charge, as the ''acting president.'' But real estate told the actual story. Mr. Saleh's sons and nephews were operating from the presidential palace, while Mr. Hadi remained in his usual offices.
''The G.C.C. initiative is the only way for Yemen to get out of this crisis,'' said Abdul Karim al-Eryani, former prime minister and presidential adviser. ''It has to be restarted in whatever way the vice president can arrange.''
Efforts continued to bolster a fragile cease-fire in Sana and elsewhere in the country, including the embattled southern city of Taiz. In Sana, sporadic skirmishes left at least three men dead, said the media office of Sheikh Sadeq al-Ahmar, the head of the main tribe competing with Mr. Saleh.
In the southern city of Zinjibar, armed men killed seven soldiers and wounded 12 others, Reuters reported, the latest in a series of clashes since the town was seized by armed militants believed to be members of Al Qaeda.
Both Washington and Riyadh had grown weary of dealing with Mr. Saleh even before the street protests began, finding him as much adversary as ally. But the idea of the country sinking into anarchy gives them pause.
Washington was dispatching a team to Yemen to both cement the cease-fire and move the political process forward, Yemeni officials said, although one aide close to Mr. Saleh in Riyadh said the Americans should concentrate on the cease-fire and nothing else.
The key hurdle remains the same one that has dogged Yemen for months -- Mr. Saleh refusing to sign the agreement, which would grant him immunity from prosecution in exchange for stepping down. Western officials said they were giving Mr. Saleh time to recuperate before engaging in that conversation again.
Although aides around Mr. Saleh stress that he is alert and in command, Arab and Western diplomats said that talk of a two-week recovery period for him was likely to prove optimistic. The idea of an extended absence leaving Yemen vulnerable to instability is another reason neighboring states and Western powers are pushing for an immediate transition.
The jockeying commenced in earnest in Sana.
The first step in the agreement negotiated by the G.C.C. was for Mr. Saleh to cede power to his vice president. Since Mr. Hadi is running Yemen in his absence, opposition groups said, the first step in the plan was a good as completedand it was time to move to step two, the formation of a transitional government.
The leaders of the Youth Movement for Change, who have been organizing the street protests, issued a statement urging all political groups to begin forming a national transitional government made up of technocrats. If there was no sign of this within 72 hours, they threatened to take over government buildings and become the transitional government themselves, said Abdul Ghani al-Aryani, a political analyst and founder of the Democracy Awakening Movement.
The youth movement also urged people to continue celebrating Mr. Saleh's ouster, even if it remained unclear that he was gone for good. Protesters have been holding up signs for months saying ''Leave,'' and one newspaper captured the mood of uncertainty with a giant red headline reading, ''Left?''
Mr. Saleh was flown to Riyadh on Saturday with about a dozen of his top political allies who were with him when the mosque in the presidential palace was hit with explosives. They are all being treated at the Armed Forces Hospital.
Nouman Duweid, the governor of Sana, flown out a day later, remains in a coma, said Tareq Shami, the spokesman for the General People's Congress. Other officials evacuated were the prime minister, the speaker of parliament, the head of the Shura council and two deputy prime ministers, including one, Sadiq Ameen Abu Ras, who lost a leg, Yemeni officials said.

HEADLINE: Courts Upend Budgets as States Look for Savings

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
State budget battles -- usually between governors and legislatures -- are increasingly involving another branch of government, the judiciary. In recent weeks, court decisions have upended budget negotiations in California, Nevada and New Jersey, and more cases are pending in other states.
Many of the recent decisions are the direct result of the economic downturn. The courts are finding that many struggling states are not meeting their responsibilities as they strive to save money. And because many states have been forced to close budget gaps year after year, these decisions are having an outsized impact, and intensifying fiscal pressures.
In Nevada, for example, a court decision last month that the state had illegally used local revenue to balance its last budget opened a big deficit in its coming budget. That led the state's new Republican governor, Brian Sandoval, to break a campaign pledge and agree to extend more than $600 million worth of taxes that had been set to expire. The State Senate approved extending those taxes on Monday.
The courts have also delivered stinging rebukes to some states, finding that they sometimes broke the law in their efforts to cut spending and find new sources of revenue to cope with the aftermath of the Great Recession. The courts said their measures illegally hurt local governments, poor schoolchildren and prisoners. 
Cases pending in other states could affect education spending in particular, an area where courts have been ordering states to spend more money, or to distribute it more fairly, for years. Education advocates in several states say recent budget cuts have effectively undone the gains they had made in the courts.
A judge in North Carolina has scheduled a hearing for this month, for example, to examine whether education cuts there violate previous court orders.
''The current financial difficulties of the state do not relieve, justify or excuse the State of North Carolina from its constitutional obligation to provide each and every child in North Carolina an equal opportunity to obtain a sound basic education,'' the judge, Howard E. Manning Jr. of Wake County Superior Court, wrote in announcing the hearing.
School districts in Kansas have filed a lawsuit arguing that with recent cuts in education spending, the state has effectively reneged on the promises it made to abide by old court rulings -- a charge the state denies.
''Just because the checkbook is empty doesn't mean that the constitutional standard is swept away,'' said John S. Robb, a lawyer for the school districts, adding that Kansas had cut taxes as it cut education spending. ''Especially if you are cutting taxes and claiming poverty,'' he added.
Mr. Robb and education advocates in other states said they were heartened by a court ruling last month in New Jersey that Gov. Chris Christie's cuts in the schools budget had violated a court order directing the state to adequately finance the education of students in its poorest school districts.
''Like anyone else,'' the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled, ''the state is not free to walk away from judicial orders enforcing constitutional obligations.'' The court ordered the state to spend another $500 million in those districts.
The ruling was one of several that sent governors and lawmakers scrambling as they rushed to pass budgets in the waning weeks of the fiscal year.
A ruling in Nevada upended the state's budget negotiations just days before the new budget was due. The Nevada Supreme Court said the state had illegally balanced its budget with local money that was meant to build wastewater treatment facilities in the Las Vegas area.
The ruling opened a large deficit because, by implication, more than $600 million in similar money that the state was counting on to balance its budget was probably off limits, too.
Mr. Sandoval has faced sharp criticism from the right for his decision to close the new shortfall by extending taxes that had been set to expire.
The governor said he had few alternatives, calling the court's decision a ''game changer'' in an interview on ''Face to Face with Jon Ralston,'' a Nevada public affairs television show. ''It changed the entire dynamic with regard to the budget,'' Mr. Sandoval said.
Court rulings are also adding wrinkles to budget negotiations in California, which has been struggling to close the biggest deficit in the nation.
In ruling last month that California's prisons were dangerously overcrowded, the United States Supreme Court put more pressure on the strapped state to find acceptable alternatives or to begin freeing prisoners.
''In addition to overcrowding, the failure of California's prisons to provide adequate medical and mental health care may be ascribed to chronic and worsening budget shortfalls, a lack of political will in favor of reform, inadequate facilities, and systemic administrative failures,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority.
Another ruling last week by the Federal District Court in Northern California ordered the state to immediately begin paying higher monthly reimbursement rates to parents caring for foster children in California.
The decision noted that two and a half years had passed since the state was found in violation of the federal Child Welfare Act, but that ''nothing has changed for the foster parents.'' The state is including $10.7 million more in the budget to begin paying the higher rates.
Court cases can have an impact at the local level as well. In New York City, the Bloomberg administration's effort to cut a program that provides rental assistance for homeless families is being challenged in court.
State officials have varying reactions to the court rulings.
Governor Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, complained after the schools ruling that ''as a fundamental principle, I do not believe that it is the role of the State Supreme Court to determine what programs the state should and should not be funding, and to what amount.''
Dissenting judges in some of these cases have expressed similar concerns.
Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a Democrat, used the prison ruling to support his push to extend tax increases and to share some of that money with counties, which would be asked to house some inmates in county jails. In Nevada, some lawmakers said that by creating a crisis, the court actually served as a catalyst for compromise.
But the rulings can complicate the lives of some budget makers.
''These court cases, when they come down -- and of course we have no position on the legal rulings -- but from a finance or budget perspective, it is basically favoring certain spending over others,'' said Scott D. Pattison, the executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers. ''If you're going to spend more on corrections because of a case causing that to occur, that's less money for something else. It's a very difficult proposition for the states simply because they're operating from a zero-sum-game perspective.''
How States Responded to Court Rulings: NEVADA: THE RULING: The Nevada Supreme Court ruled last month that the state had illegally balanced its budget by using revenues collected by localities. THE IMPACT: The state's new Republican governor, Brian Sandoval, broke a campaign pledge and agreed to extend more than $600 million in taxes that had been set to expire so he could close the budget hole created by the ruling.; CALIFORNIA: THE RULING: The United States Supreme Court ruled that conditions in California's overcrowded prisons were so bad that they violated the ban on cruel and unusual punishment. THE IMPACT: Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, has used the ruling to push his plan to transfer some prisoners to county jails and to raise taxes to help pay for it.; NEW JERSEY: THE RULING: The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled last month that Gov. Chris Christie's past cuts to education were unconstitutional. THE IMPACT: The court ordered the state to spend $500 million more on the affected districts, and Mr. Christie, a Republican, directed the Legislature to find a way to pay for it.

HEADLINE: Frustration As Nominee For the Fed Withdraws

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Helene Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The decision by a noted economist Monday to end a 14-month wait for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is renewing concerns among some Democrats about the fighting spirit of the Obama administration.
The candidate, Peter A. Diamond, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Nobel Prize laureate for his work on labor markets, cited Republican opposition in asking the White House to withdraw his nomination. 
But Democratic leadership did not press for a vote on the nomination, and Congressional aides said that the White House invested relatively little energy in fighting for Mr. Diamond. Moreover, they said that the administration had not submitted nominations for vacancies atop several of the federal agencies charged with overhauling and improving financial regulation in the wake of the 2008 crisis.
''There's a deep feeling of frustration,'' said one Democratic aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. ''No one wants to insult the administration or put them in a position that's uncomfortable for them or worse for them. So you're just sitting around waiting for them to take the lead.''
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said on Monday that the White House did everything it could to push the nomination, and he lamented the ''partisan obstructionism'' that had prevented approval of Mr. Diamond.
''I don't have a tick-tock on the different actions that different members of the administration took in support of this nomination,'' Mr. Carney said in response to a question from a reporter. ''We strongly supported it. We thought he was highly qualified. We regret that it's come to this and he's withdrawn his nomination.''
The withdrawal leaves two empty seats on the Fed's seven-member board, which, along with selected presidents of the Fed's regional banks, sets monetary policy. The position of vice chairman for supervision, created last year as a top bank regulatory post, also is vacant.
President Obama has not nominated a head for the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees national banks, or a new chairman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank deposits and cleans up failed banks. There is no nominee to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The White House has said for months that it will submit nominations ''as soon as possible.'' On Monday it promised action ''in short order.'' It is widely expected to nominate the F.D.I.C.'s vice chairman, Martin J. Gruenberg, to replace Sheila C. Bair, who ends her term as chairwoman in July. Mr. Gruenberg, seen as relatively noncontroversial, could be packaged with other nominees in the hope of a halo effect.
Democrats say that they hold Republicans responsible for preventing votes. In addition to derailing Mr. Diamond, Republicans forced the withdrawal earlier this year of a nominee to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and have said they will not allow a vote on any nominee to lead the consumer agency until the bureau is restructured.
There are also strategic considerations. A senior White House official said that the Obama administration had to weigh the costs of trying to pressure Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, to push for cloture votes in the face of Republican opposition.
''We could go for a symbolic cloture vote. It would burn 30 hours on the clock. That's 30 hours that the Senate is in session. So it's a big ask of Harry Reid to say 'put aside your legislative agenda and go for a cloture vote,' '' the official said.
Mr. Diamond focused his criticism on Republicans in a sharply worded opinion article published Monday in The New York Times. ''We should all worry about how distorted the confirmation process has become, and how little understanding of monetary policy there is among some of those responsible for its Congressional oversight,'' he wrote.
Mr. Diamond said that Republicans were mistaken to treat his expertise in labor economics as irrelevant to decisions about monetary policy. ''Understanding the labor market -- and the process by which workers and jobs come together and separate -- is critical to devising an effective monetary policy,'' he wrote.
Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee, reiterated on Monday his belief that Mr. Diamond had lacked the necessary qualifications.
''It is my hope that President Obama will now nominate someone capable of garnering bipartisan support in the Senate,'' Mr. Shelby said in a statement Monday. ''It would be my hope that the president will not seek to pack the Fed with those who will use the institution to finance his profligate spending and agenda.''
Mr. Shelby added that he had great respect for Mr. Diamond and wished him the best.
The Fed board of governors has long been populated with a mix of people including lawyers, bankers and economists with a wide range of specialties. Mr. Shelby himself has voted for a labor economist on at least one previous occasion: he supported the 1994 nomination of Janet Yellen, now the Fed's vice chairwoman.
But the nomination became a proxy for a broader fight between the White House and Congressional Republicans over the government's role in the economy. Mr. Diamond publicly supported a continuing Fed program to stimulate growth by purchasing $600 billion in Treasury securities. Mr. Shelby and other Republicans described the program as a backdoor method of lending the government more money.

HEADLINE: Public Opinion on the Wars? New Polls Offer Conflicting Evidence

BYLINE: JAMES DAO


HIGHLIGHT: One new poll finds that most Americans say the war in Afghanistan is not worth fighting, while another shows that Americans are likely to blame the nation's debt on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

 BODY:
What is the trend line of American public opinion about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan these days? Two new polls offer conflicting evidence.
A Washington Post/ABC poll released on Monday found that support for the war in Afghanistan had actually risen in the past month. The poll, conducted last week, found that 43 percent of Americans say the war is worth fighting, compared with 31 percent in March.
Still, a majority of Americans still say the war is not worth fighting, despite the killing last month of Osama bin Laden by United States forces in Pakistan, the Post said.
A different poll by the Pew Research Center shows that Americans are more likely to blame the size of the nation's debt on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq than on other factors, like spending on domestic programs or the weak economy.
The poll, conducted late last month, found that 60 percent of Americans said that the two wars contributed a great deal to the size of the national debt, compared with 42 percent who cited the national economy and 24 percent who pointed to domestic programs. Even fewer, 19 percent, said tax cuts enacted over the past decade were the major cause.
The Pew poll, perhaps not surprisingly, found that Republicans were more likely than Democrats to support reducing foreign aid. But there was remarkable agreement among members of both parties about trimming the debt by reducing overseas military commitments: 56 percent of Republicans and 63 percent of Democrats supported that idea.
The findings come amid signs that some Republicans are growing impatient with the war in Afghanistan, with the cost being a major reason. A resolution intended to accelerate the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan was narrowly defeated in the House two weeks ago.
Though the measure received just 26 Republican votes, that was triple the number who voted for a similar measure last year.
The Pew poll, with 1,509 adults, had a margin of error of plus or minus three and a half percentage points. The Washington Post/ABC poll, with 1,002 adults, had the same margin of error.

HEADLINE: The High Line's Beery Locavorism

BYLINE: GLENN COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: How Brooklyn Brewery crafted an exclusive beer for The Lot on Tap using New York state wheat.

 BODY:
New York state farm to New York City table? Ho-hum. But New York state farm to New York City brewery? Hasn't happened in at least a century. And indeed, a high degree of difficulty marked the creation of what is believed to be the first modern commercial beer brewed in the city from local wheat. (The Tundra Brewery in Stamford, N.Y., is now selling a beer made from New York state grains at Manhattan Greenmarkets.) Here, then, is the unexpectedly complicated recipe for a seemingly simple new summer brew: 1. Take 1 sponsor. That would be the High Line, the elevated public park in Manhattan that, on Tuesday, is opening a new, half-mile section from West 20th Street to West 30th Street, followed on Wednesday by a temporary public plaza called the Lot at 30th Street at its northern terminus. The plaza's ornament? A 350-seat bar (The Lot on Tap, operated by Colicchio & Sons) that will be the only place in town pouring a newly crafted beer: Brooklyn High Line Elevated Wheat. 
2. Add 1 pinch history. Friends of the High Line, the nonprofit that is the park's operator and co-creator, wanted the brew to embody the culinary history of the High Line. So it insisted that "the majority of the ingredients had to be sourced from New York," said Melina Shannon-DiPietro, the nonprofit's food director. The High Line, a former railway spur, supplied food to New Yorkers from 1934 until its very last delivery -- a load of frozen turkeys -- in 1980. 3. Blend with brewmaster. The High Line approached Garrett Oliver of the Brooklyn Brewery. Turns out that he'd long been fascinated with New York beery locavorism, explaining that "there were fields of barley in New Amsterdam, and wild hops are still growing in Brooklyn from beer production in the 1800s." But year-round, inexpensive grain from the West and Midwest long ago supplanted New York's output.
4. Combine with brewing profile. "We wanted the new beer to be summery," Mr. Oliver said. "We thought it should be a light, Belgian-style wheat beer, but fermented with yeast used to make a beer that is lightly flavored, but nicely fruity." 
5. Look for local substitutions. Brooklyn Brewery has experience making Belgian-style wheat beer, but had used a strain of wheat that doesn't grow well in New York state. So he reached out to the state's agricultural community. 
6. Fold in 1 matchmaker. Ultimately Bob Lewis, the special assistant for market development at the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, put Mr. Oliver together with North Country Farms, a two-year-old stone mill in Watertown, N.Y. The mill was able to supply high-quality hard red winter wheat, which flourishes upstate. 
7. Mix generously with wheat. Some 500 pounds of cracked wheat arrived from North Country Farms, milled from the output of upstate wheat farmers. "This is our first sale to a brewery anywhere," said Kevin Richardson, president of North Country, whose primary customers until now have been European-style artisanal bread bakers. "It's great that it's in New York. We're hoping that it could be a new market for wheat growers in the northern part of the state." 8. Add water. 800 gallons of it, from New York's Catskill system, of course. 9. Sweeten to taste. Mr. Oliver chose 60 pounds of wildflower honey from Tremblay Farms in Chemung County in the Finger Lakes region of New York, adding it to the kettle during the boil. 10. Pour in yeast. 7 gallons of a Bavarian strain, imported from the West Coast. 11. Simmer in the Great Barley Compromise. The High Line project was started at the wrong time of year for Brooklyn Brewery to contract for New York barley and hops for its new beer, unlike the Tundra Brewery, which grew barley and hops on its own farm. So Brooklyn had to settle for 600 pounds of alien barley from a malting house in Canada, Mr. Oliver said. He also added several pounds of hops to the mix -- none of it from New York because "most of the processing facilities are in the Pacific Northwest." 
12. Let stand with a name. "Elevated refers not only to the structure of the High Line," Miss Shannon-DiPietro said, "but also suggests that it's a little bit special. This beer is about connecting New Yorkers with the agricultural lands of the north country, and it's good for the brewer, and good for New York's agricultural economy -- so how's that for elevated?" 
Yield: After three weeks of boiling, fermenting and aging, 40 kegs of beer have been produced: pale gold, with 4.8 percent alcohol by volume. That's $7 for 16 ounces, on tap.

HEADLINE: Team Kosovo, Made in New York

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER BELAC


HIGHLIGHT: Newly independent Kosovo cannot field an international team to play in any FIFA-sponsored events, but that doesn't keep a group of Kosovars from forming a team for the Cosmos Copa NYC.

 BODY:
Every four years soccer fans all over the world re-establish their sense of patriotism and national pride through the World Cup. But not only do many nations not qualify for the global party, some don't even have a team that can attempt to qualify. Such is the fate of Kosovo. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but is not yet recognized by the United Nations and its soccer federation is not recognized by FIFA. So Kosovar soccer as an international entity remains in limbo.
But that doesn't mean a Kosovo team can't play in New York. Zef Kabashi, a first generation Kosovar-American and a familiar face on the New York soccer scene, has organized a Kosovo team to compete in this years Cosmos Copa NYC. It's a sort of World Cup of New York that has grown to become a major tournament in the city. "Kosovo hasn't been accepted by FIFA, it hasn't been accepted by UEFA. For this tournament to accept Kosovo, it would be a big deal and a start in the right direction," Kabashi said. "I think everything starts here in New York City. This is the world's capital and anything that starts here can spill over across the ocean." 
Kosovo is one of 22 "national teams" vying for eight spots in the main draw of the Copa NYC. It will play Ghana in a single elimination game on "One Shot Saturday," June 18 at the Parade Grounds in Brooklyn. If it wins that game, it would play two 60-minute playoff games on June 19 at the College of Staten Island to advance to the main draw.
To Kabashi, the short-term symbolism of this team is part of his greater vision for the Kosovar community in New York. "I hope to bring everybody together. That's the goal," he said. "Whether it be from Staten Island, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, or Long Island, we want to bring the community together and from this point on start a development program for younger players." There are parallels, however, between Kosovar soccer in New York and internationally. Players who elected to play for Kosovo in this years Cosmos Copa NYC had a difficult decision to make, the same decision many ethnic Albanian players from Kosovo who play professionally will have to make. If Kosovo were to be recognized by FIFA, it could change the landscape of several national teams across Europe; including Albania, Switzerland and Finland, all of whom currently feature Albanians of Kosovar descent on their rosters. "When I thought about entering the tournament in 2010, I hesitated because I did not want the feeling of separation from Albania," said Kabashi. "I submitted the application for entrance into the tournament this time around for Albanians from Kosovo because I thought the people of this war-torn, now considered the youngest country in Europe, should be recognized."
All the national teams at this years Copa NYC will feel a sense of pride when they don their respective uniforms, but for Kosovars, the feeling might be that much more poignant. "Playing for Albania was a proud moment, it was a great moment. Playing now for Kosovo is an intense moment because of everything that's happened over the years," said Kabashi. "My parents were born there and they lived off of that land. I think I speak on behalf of all the players that are playing for Kosovo this year; it's going to be a proud moment, but an emotional moment. This is for home." While it may be years before this young nation has a chance to compete internationally, the spirit is getting a kick start from its diaspora. "With Kosovo I see a future," Kabashi said. "There's going to be time for improvement, time to grow, but we still have a long way to go. Soccer-wise I think we can make strides, and great strides within the country itself."

HEADLINE: Main St. Stop in Flushing Joins List of Subway's Busiest

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Off the Rails: A station in Queens cracks the list of the top 10 most heavily trafficked subway stations.

 BODY:
The Main Street station on the No. 7 line, in Flushing, Queens, made a rare appearance last year in the coveted New York City Subway Top 10: the 10 most heavily trafficked stations in the underground, according to ridership data released by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
More than 18.6 million passengers streamed through the station's turnstiles in 2010, in a uptick of nearly 2 percent from 2009. That was enough to bump last year's No. 10 station, the Fulton Street complex in Lower Manhattan, down a notch to No. 11.
The rest of the top 10 looked nearly identical to years past. Times Square topped the list again with 58.4 million riders, followed by the stations beneath Grand Central Terminal, Herald and Union Squares, and Pennsylvania Station. 
Transit officials measure ridership by clicks at the turnstile, so the data do not capture in-station transfers or the number of riders who depart from a station. 
The subway as a whole recorded just over 1.6 billion rides in 2010, about 1.5 percent more than the year prior, despite a sizable fare increase and the wholesale elimination of two train lines, the W and the V, because of budget cuts.
Some of that increase may reflect improvements in the city's economy. Ridership dropped significantly in 2009 as businesses laid off thousands of workers in some of New York's marquee industries.
Still, that economic slide may not have been entirely stanched. Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street, near a locus of corporate skyscrapers and high-end retail shopping, lost riders for the second year in a row; since 2008, its passenger count has fallen nearly 16 percent.
Aside from stations plagued by construction, the biggest drops in ridership came at the Broadway station on the G line and the East 180 Street station in the Bronx, each of which lost about 10 percent of its clientele last year. The G line seemed particularly hard hit: seven of its stations lost riders.
In Manhattan, the Broad Street stop, near the Stock Exchange, dipped by about 9 percent, perhaps not surprising since the M line, which used to travel to the station from parts of Queens and Brooklyn, was redirected along a different route halfway through the year. 
Similarly, the Rector Street and City Hall stops in Lower Manhattan recorded declines after the W train, which used to serve those stations on weekdays, was eliminated.
One of the biggest increases came at the F stop at Roosevelt Island, where residents were without the use of their signature tram for the first half of 2010. The stop at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street also recorded a big rise, with 23 percent more riders than the year before.
Not a single station along the L line lost ridership, in a testament to the ongoing popularity of the rapidly gentrifying communities along its route in in Brooklyn. The Morgan Avenue station alone recorded a 20 percent uptick in 2010.
Only four stations outside Manhattan, including Main Street, made the top 25, including busy complexes at Borough Hall in Brooklyn and Jackson Heights in Queens.

HEADLINE: Who Are The Rentiers?

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Little old ladies, not. 

 BODY:
Following up on my rentier post and the eurocentric followup, a question: who are we talking about? That is, who stands to gain from deflation, and lose if inflation is, say, 4 percent over a period of 10 years? Is it little old ladies living on fixed incomes, and salt of the earth workers who have scrimped and saved?
Well, no. There are, of course, some ordinary people who would lose a bit from higher inflation. But Social Security -- the bedrock of retirement for most Americans -- is indexed to inflation, and retirement accounts invested in stocks wouldn't be hurt. 
If you want to see who really has a stake in the inflation dispute, go to Edward Wolff's latest on the American wealth distribution (pdf). Here's the takeaway:
Financial securities are overwhelmingly held by the rich -- more than 60 percent by just one percent of the population, more than 98 percent by the top 10 percent. It's true that middle-class Americans own significant shares of deposits, and that some part of their pension accounts would be in bonds. On the other hand, middle-class Americans owe the lion's share of debt; relatively speaking, the wealthy have hardly any.
So if you think about the distributional consequences of the choice between a Japan-style lost decade of very low or negative inflation and a Mankiw-Rogoff strategy of higher inflation for a while, it's very much about benefits to the wealthy versus benefits to the middle class. Since I've been arguing that some inflation would help the economy recover, what we're seeing in practice is that defending the interests of a small wealthy slice of the population takes priority over a possible recovery strategy.

HEADLINE: Girardi and Yankees' Pick Go Back a Long Way

BYLINE: DAVE CALDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: Dante Bichette Jr., the Yankees' No. 1 draft pick, has a long history with the man who may one day be his manager. 

 BODY:
Joe Girardi says he got to know Dante Bichette in 1993, when both joined the Colorado Rockies, an expansion team. The Rockies lost 95 games and were outscored by more than 200 runs, and Girardi and Bichette were about as opposite as two players could get.
"He's more of a free spirit, and everybody knows how I am, so we don't need to go into that," Girardi, the rather intense manager of the Yankees, said with a chuckle Tuesday afternoon.
But Girardi and Bichette became lasting friends. Girardi remembered Tuesday how Dante and Marianna Bichette would stay at his house when the Rockies played in Chicago. Girardi recalled how he would take Dante Jr., their infant son, for car rides to get him to fall asleep.
On Monday, the Yankees drafted Dante Bichette Jr., an 18-year-old third baseman from Maitland, Fla., with their first selection, the 51st overall pick. Girardi said the Yankees took Bichette because he was the best player available. But Girardi also said, "I'm thrilled to death, because I've known this little guy for a long time."
At 6 feet 1 inch, 215 pounds, Bichette is no longer such a little guy, but he has a history with Girardi. The Yankees and the Boston Red Sox have a history, too, but that did not stop the Red Sox from stepping into Bronx territory with their second-round draft pick.
With the 81st overall selection, the Red Sox drafted Williams Jerez, an outfielder from Brooklyn, who played recently for an amateur team known as Hank's Yanks, which is sponsored in part by Hank Steinbrenner.
Hank's Yanks were assembled by Ray Negron, the Yankees' community adviser, and his friend Herman Hernandez II as a way to give players ages 15 to 18 from varied socio-economic backgrounds a chance to be seen by major league scouts in the summer.
Negron was delighted with the Boston pick.
"He's a terrific player who will play in the major leagues, and a wonderful kid," Negron said Tuesday of Jerez, who played scholastically at Grand Street Campus in Brooklyn.
When asked if it bothered him that the Red Sox, the Yankees' bitter rival, took a player who got attention because of a project started by a Steinbrenner, Negron said, "We got kids off the street playing baseball; that's what this was about."
In the fourth round, the Yankees drafted another member of Hank's Yanks: Matt Duran, a shortstop from New Rochelle (N.Y.) High School who hit 10 home runs and nearly .600 in the scholastic season. Negron said the Yankees got the better player in Duran.
Bichette has committed to attend the University of Georgia, but he said he planned to turn professional as soon as possible, and not just to play for a manager whom he still calls Uncle Joe. (Bichette said, "I think I'm going to have to stop that.")
"It's the most prestigious club around," Bichette said in a conference call. "I think there's nothing better than being a Yankee. You grow up as a little kid dreaming of being a Yankee, of hitting a home run in Yankee Stadium."
Bichette's father, now 47, played 14 major league seasons, but none for the Yankees. Dante Bichette Jr. described his hitting style as pretty much the same as his father's. Dante Jr. hit .640 with 10 home runs in 30 games this year for Orangewood Christian School.
Bichette also played in the 2005 Little League World Series for a team from Maitland that also included Tanner Stanley, the son of the former major league catcher Mike Stanley.
"I've seen Junior basically working at this his whole life," Girardi said.
Girardi said he awoke Tuesday to text messages notifying him of the Yankees' pick. Before batting practice, he said he had talked to Dante Sr., but not to his son. Eighteen years seemed as if they had flown past.
"You think, 'This is the kid we drafted today, and it's the kid I was trying to get to sleep in that car seat,' " Girardi said, smiling again.
INSIDE PITCH
Derek Jeter, who entered the day 14 hits shy of 3,000, batted leadoff for the Yankees against the Red Sox on Tuesday, but Joe Girardi used him as a designated hitter for the fifth time this season instead of at shortstop. Eduardo Nunez started at shortstop and batted ninth. Asked if he wanted to give Jeter an opportunity to reach 3,000 hits on a 10-game homestand, Girardi said: "You can't physically wear him down or risk hurting him to do that. We're going to have to be smart about doing this. We're going to play it pretty much the same way we have all year long."

HEADLINE: Thiel: Tech Bubble? What Tech Bubble?

BYLINE: CLAIRE CAIN MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: Peter Thiel, a prominent Silicon Valley investor, says we are not being carried away in a second tech bubble. The doomsayers are simply hungover from the last bubble's burst, he said. 

 BODY:
There has been lots of chatter about a technology bubble in Silicon Valley. LinkedIn's initial public offering, Groupon's upcoming I.P.O. and bloated start-up investments and valuations are bringing back painful memories of the dot-com bubble's burst roughly a decade ago.
But this time there is no bubble, says Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder, early Facebook investor and hedge fund manager.
"We don't have a tech bubble for a variety of reasons," Mr. Thiel said in an interview. "If anything, we need to be encouraging people to be doing more in tech."
Mr. Thiel isn't shy about calling out bubbles. He was outspoken about the dot-com bubble, the housing bubble and what he now thinks is a bubble in higher education.
But he says the technology industry today is missing a key component for a bubble: the ability for the general public to invest and potentially lose money. Despite a couple much-hyped I.P.O.s, almost all the new tech companies are still private, so venture capitalists are the only ones risking their money.
"The first component of a bubble -- something a lot of people believe and can act on -- doesn't even exist," Mr. Thiel said. "Most of these companies are privately held. There is no way for the public to become involved." 
The doomsayers are simply hungover from the last bubble's burst, he said. "People are still burned out from the '90s."
Much of the bubble talk surrounds five companies: Groupon, LinkedIn, Zynga, Facebook and Twitter. Mr. Thiel estimates that those five companies account for three-quarters of the value of new Web companies and, he said, five companies do not make a bubble. If they did, we have bigger problems, he said.
"We need technology for our society to get better in the decades ahead," Mr. Thiel said. "So if you say there are not even five good companies, that even those five companies are fake, that is saying that our society is completely stagnant and that nothing is happening at all."

HEADLINE: Despite Worries, Serving at the Top Carries Little Risk

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Corporate directors and officers have about the same chance of being held liable for their poor management of a public company as they have of being struck by lightning. 

 BODY:
They are paid millions, but some complain that it's no longer worth it.
These men and women argue that, as corporate directors and officers, they have too much chance of liability for a company's operations. Because of this, they claim, the risks of serving as a director or officer have become too great, and it will become harder to recruit and retain competent directors and officers. But the truth is that they have about the same chance of being held liable for their poor management of a public firm as they have of being struck by lightning.
The day-to-day management of a company is largely regulated by state law. Since most companies are incorporated in Delaware, this means Delaware law. And Delaware law on this matter sets an extremely high standard for finding directors and officers liable for a company's mismanagement. A Delaware court is not going to find them liable no matter how stupid their decisions are. Instead, a Delaware court will find them liable only if they intentionally acted wrongfully or were so oblivious that it was essentially the same thing.
Under this standard, a Delaware court recently refused to hold Citigroup's board accountable for its decision to enter the subprime mortgage market, a decision that resulted in billions of dollars in losses and the company's near failure. The boards of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers are also scot-free so far.
And only last week the board and management of Massey Energy won a case in Delaware Chancery Court that would make it significantly more difficult for them to be held liable for their ostensible poor oversight of the company's safety practices that led to the Upper Big Branch mine explosion and the death of 29 men.
Even if there is liability or a settlement, it is almost always covered by insurance of directors and officers. One study found that from 1980 to 2006, there were only two instances of directors of a company incorporated in Delaware being required to personally pay for their misconduct.
One of those involved litigation against the board of Fuqua Enterprises. The Fuqua directors had the unfortunate luck to be insured by Reliance Enterprises, which went bankrupt. They paid an undisclosed portion of a $7 million settlement.
The other known personal-liability case involved the sale in 1980 of the TransUnion Corporation. The 10 TransUnion directors paid a total of $1.35 million. There you have it, no more than $8.35 million in personal payments by directors over more than 26 years.
There can also be liability for board members and executive managers under federal law. These are largely securities fraud cases where the directors or officers make a misstatement or omission.
This has nothing to do with the oversight of the company, but often there are misstatements about accounting or the company's financial condition. Instances of personal liability for officers and directors in these cases are only a bit less rare, again because the standards are high and insurance often covers the matter.
The same study found only nine cases where a director was held personally liable for securities fraud in a 26-year period. Three of these were highly notable, Enron, WorldCom and Tyco.
And no directors from the financial crisis have yet been found liable under these laws. Officers are faring just as well, and the only prominent payment was by Angelo R. Mozilo of Countrywide Financial Corporation. He paid $22.5 million of a $73 million fine. The rest was paid by Bank of America. Meanwhile, the fines of David Sambol, Countrywide's former president, and Eric P. Sieracki, the ex-chief financial officer, were paid in full by Bank of America.
The only financial crisis case to go to trial, involving officers of BankAtlantic, had its jury verdict finding civil liability overturned by the judge. And unlike with Enron and WorldCom, it seems there will be no criminal cases involving securities fraud stemming from the financial crisis.
What about the Dodd-Frank financial reform, you might ask? It doesn't change much. The main provision concerning the personal liability of officers and directors involves systemically important financial institutions, or the "too big to fail" entities. And if one fails, Dodd-Frank authorizes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to claw back two years of compensation from those held substantially responsible for the failure.
This is a weak penalty. An economically important bank with hundreds of billions of dollars in assets fails, and the penalty is only two years of pay? Nonetheless, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and a number of other industry groups objected to the F.D.I.C.'s proposed rules on this requirement. The financial industry groups again argue that such a standard will drive away directors and officers as well as make it harder to recruit these people.
This is laughable. First, we've already seen that liability for boards and management is extremely rare. Moreover, many of the directors of Lehman and Bear Stearns continue to serve on other boards, and one Lehman director, Jerry A. Grundhofer, has apparently been so chastened about the liability issue surrounding large banks that he is serving on the Citigroup board.
More telling, there is no empirical evidence whatsoever supporting this argument. Instead, you have the occasional self-serving statements by officers and directors that they are resigning because of "liability" reasons. Officers in particular like to say that they are taking a company private for this reason. But more often than not, it is because there is more money in being private.
This is not to say that it has not become more difficult to be a director or officer. Regulation has certainly increased. So has scrutiny. This has made the work of being a director or officer of a public company harder and more time-consuming. And yes, if a company declares bankruptcy, these people will lose a lot of their investment and may in rare circumstances have to pay back some of their salary.
But is that too much to ask? According to a recent study by Equilar for The New York Times, the median salary of a chief executive at the top 200 major companies was $9.6 million last year. Salaries for chief financial officers at companies listed on the S.&P. 500-stock index shot up last year by 26.1 percent, according to Equilar, and the median salary is now $3 million.
The prominent law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz recently issued a memorandum calling for director salaries to increase because of the increased burdens on this position. Outside director salaries average about $200,000 for Fortune 500 companies, according to Tower Watson.
The upside of serving as a director or officer thus appears huge. The downside is very limited. Yes, there will be increased regulation to comply with and some of it may even be unjustified, but that conflates liability with regulation. Remind directors and officers of this the next time they complain about the risk they are taking because of their jobs.

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: But he seems to have someone else in mind. 

 BODY:
Here. 
But I have to say, he seems to be attacking a straw man named "Paul Krugman" who bears little resemblance to the Princeton economist of the same name. Here's what I actually said about QE2:
I believe that given the grim economic situation, all players in the game should be trying to do whatever they can. There are other things the Fed can do; they would help; uncertainty about how much they would help shouldn't be a reason not to try.
But it would be a big mistake to count on monetary policy alone. The zero lower bound on short rates really does matter, even if longer-term rates are positive. The Fed can control short-term interest rates, it can influence long rates - there's a world of difference between those two statements. So it's not safe to assume that the Fed can, for example, hit any target for nominal GDP that it chooses.
What that means is that while the Fed should be doing more, so should other actors: unconventional monetary policy should go along with fiscal stimulus. The Fed deserves to be chastised for not doing more; that's not the same as saying that the Fed should be the only target of criticism.
Meanwhile, Koo seems to think that the decline of the dollar has been a disaster. I have no idea why; parallels with 1987, when the United States was not in a liquidity trap, seem off point. As far as I can see, the modest fall in the dollar has been entirely good news for the US economy.

HEADLINE: The Switzerland of America

BYLINE: AARON ASTOR


HIGHLIGHT: Throughout the war, East Tennessee would remain a thorn in the eyes of the Confederate republic, and an enticing and romantic rallying cry for the Union. 

 BODY:
East Tennessee, wrote a pamphleteer shortly after the end of the Civil War, had long been considered the Switzerland of America. "Its towering mountains locking up deep, rich and verdant valleys and coves, its succession of ridges and valleys, its magnificent forests, its roaring streams, the general fertility of the soil, the glory of the climate, the salubrity of the atmosphere, the sublimity, beauty and picturesqueness of the scenery, the freshness and voluptuous abundance of the country, all conspire to make it one of the most desirable spots in America."
The two regions had more in common than just natural beauty. East Tennessee was fiercely independent and often contrarian in its political currents, especially during the Civil War. When Middle and West Tennessee citizens voted on June 8, 1861 to join the Confederacy, most East Tennessee voters rejected the call. It would remain a thorn in the eyes of the Confederate republic, and an enticing and romantic rallying cry for the Union-even though its complex views on race and the government would vex both contemporaries and historians for decades to come.
At the center of the Tennessee state flag sit three stars, representing the three geographic sections of the state - East, Middle and West. The division is more than just a cartographic feature: each region has its own economic foundation, social makeup, political traditions and culture rooted deeply in the state's history. Once an extension of North Carolina, Tennessee received its first white arrivals in the 1760s. In violation of the 1763 Proclamation Line, which forbid white settlement beyond the crest of the Appalachian Mountains, early settlers established one of the earliest experiments in self-government under the self-described Watauga Association of 1771. 
The British warned against this "dangerous" example, but after losing the 13 colonies the new state of North Carolina faced its own rebellion in its far-western reaches, with the ultramontane settlers proclaiming the new state of Franklin in 1784. The chaotic claims to separate statehood contributed significantly to the need for a new federal Constitution. 
Closer to home, however, many settlers and land speculators simply bypassed the upper Tennessee River valley, by trekking through the Cumberland Gap and then sailing down the Cumberland River to the more fertile basin around what later became Nashville. 
The state of Tennessee was born in 1796; so too was the rivalry between East and Middle (and later West) Tennessee. East Tennesseans quickly grew frustrated as economic and political power shifted to the Nashville area. The promise of a river-born empire based in Knoxville proved fleeting as the sucks and shoals downstream along the Tennessee River, which flows through Knoxville and eventually reaches the Ohio River, prevented boats from reaching the Mississippi River for most of the year. Knoxville, it became clear, would never be an American commercial and industrial powerhouse like Pittsburgh, Cincinnati or St. Louis-though it soon became clear that Nashville, located on the more navigable Cumberland River, might one day be. 
Finally in the early 1850s, after decades of frustration, population loss, and threats to create a separate state of East Tennessee, the region received state support for a new railroad connecting Knoxville to Virginia and Georgia, boosting its small but growing commercial class. Few East Tennesseans, however, lived close enough to the railroad - despite the support of the region's mostly Whig voters for federally subsidized internal improvements - to capitalize on the growing market connections to the rest of the South. For the most part, the region remained defined by small farmers and communities, with few connections to, or sympathy with, the slaveholding economy of the Coastal and Lower South.
Meanwhile, the new cotton-based Mississippi River city of Memphis had begun to siphon what little political power East Tennessee still possessed. By 1860, Middle and West Tennessee were the dominant regions in state affairs, with cotton planters and traders around Memphis allying with slave-owning cereal producers around Nashville. A robust trade in goods to the Cotton Belt of Alabama and Mississippi - and slaves, traded on the Memphis levee by future Confederates like Nathan Bedford Forrest - cemented Middle and West Tennessee to the destiny of the Lower South. 
Pulled in various directions, Tennessee faced the Civil War with fear and uncertainty. The state's moment of decision came on June 8, 1861, when citizens across the Volunteer State cast their ballots in a referendum on separation from the federal government. Despite reticence over lost trade in the Ohio River market, and clear evidence of electoral fraud and violence, the Middle and West Tennessee counties voted overwhelming to join the new Confederacy. Support for secession was almost unanimous among the white population along the Alabama border; Franklin County, today the home of the University of the South at Sewanee, even voted to secede from Tennessee and join the state of Alabama during the impatient months before Tennessee's own secession vote. Though voters in many Tennessee River counties in West Tennessee expressed doubts about secession - the river flows north at that point - the statewide vote was never in doubt.
In part because of such reticence, Tennessee was the last state to secede from the Union and join the Confederacy. Indeed, its own secession ordinance, advocated by Governor Isham Harris and passed by the legislature on May 6, revealed just how contested the very notion of "secession" was in the minds of Tennesseans. "We, the people of the State of Tennessee, waiving any expression of opinion as to the abstract doctrine of secession, but asserting the right, as a free and independent people, to alter, reform, or abolish our form of government in such manner as we think proper," the ordinance stated before declaring relations with the Federal government null and void. Secessionists knew that even the most ardent Unionists would accept language affirming the right of a people to "abolish our form of government," as the Revolutionary generation had done in 1776.
Unionism had been persistent across the state throughout the secession crisis. And after Lincoln's troop call-up in April 1861, the legislature still needed to tread carefully on the constitutional question of secession because most political leaders in the East remained unconvinced of the need to join the new Southern Republic.
Some voters in East Tennessee supported secession too, especially those living in railroad towns like Bristol, Knoxville, and Chattanooga. But most East Tennesseans resented those latter-day secessionists and despised the dominant planter class in the rest of the state. 
No politicians symbolized this spirit better than Senator Andrew Johnson, who refused to yield his seat in Congress after secession, and a vituperative Knoxville editor - and later governor and senator - named William "Parson" Brownlow. Johnson, as defender of the class interests of the non-slaveholding masses of East Tennessee, warned that "it is not the free men of the north that [secessionists] are fearing most but the free men South." In a letter to a former newspaper subscriber, the colorful Brownlow wrote that secession was based in "falsehood, fraud, and perjury" and affirmed, "I think it the most natural thing in the world for a nation to fight for its Government against a vile rebellion which has never yet been able to allege an excuse." 
What explains East Tennessee's persistent Unionism? The loss of political power to the rest of the state clearly grated on the region's frustrated citizens. But more important was the relative unimportance of slavery. To be sure, nearly all white East Tennesseans supported the institution of slavery in 1860 - Parson Brownlow famously defended the peculiar institution in an 1858 debate with a Connecticut abolitionist, while Andrew Johnson owned slaves at his Greeneville home. But a deep heritage of antislavery activity in the region suggests, at the very least, ambivalence about the institution not present elsewhere in the South. 
In fact, before the abolitionist movement took hold in Massachusetts in the 1830s, local activists like Elihu Embree preached the end of slavery to mountain communities near the North Carolina border. The Tennessee Manumission Society boasted support from nearly all East Tennessee counties, making it one of the strongest abolitionist organizations in America before 1830. And Benjamin Lundy established one of the first great abolitionist newspapers in Greeneville before he headed for Baltimore, where a young William Lloyd Garrison became one of his top disciples.
Blount County, just south of Knoxville and Knox County, typified the region's ambivalence toward slavery. One of the most influential early residents of Maryville, the county's largest city, was Isaac Anderson, who founded the Presbyterian Southern and Western Theological Seminary to serve the legions of Scots-Irish migrants settling in the region from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas. One of Anderson's first students was a slave he purchased in the Blount County courthouse in 1816. Immediately freed, this student, named George Erskine, received his training for the Presbyterian ministry and then headed off for Liberia. Anderson would continue to preach an antislavery gospel in the Presbyterian church and as head of Maryville College, which he founded in 1819. Meanwhile, a local Quaker community in nearby Friendsville served a robust branch of the Underground Railroad that funneled runaway slaves through the Great Smoky Mountains. 
But Blount County was not entirely abolitionist. Indeed, by 1860, 10 percent of the county was enslaved - enough for most of the population to support the institution's continued existence, though not large enough for most voters to privilege defense of slavery over perseverance of the Union. Like other Upper South conservative Unionists, Blount Countians believed the Union was the best protector of slavery and the social order; voters in the county gave 81 percent support for the Union. 
The same was true across the region. Smoky and Cumberland Mountain counties like Sevier and Scott cast more than 95 percent of their vote for the Union. Scott County, in a perfect inversion of Franklin, even voted to separate from Tennessee following a visit to the county seat by Andrew Johnson; the county, renamed the Free and Independent State of Scott, would not request formal readmission to Tennessee until 1986. 
Once statewide secession was a fact, many East Tennesseans settled on a new strategy: throw off the yoke of planter hegemony once and for all by creating a new state of East Tennessee. Not everyone agreed, though, and the result was a a vicious guerrilla war that tore families and communities apart, fueling local tensions for decades after the Civil War ended. 
The legacy of East Tennessee's Unionism is remarkably strong. Lincoln Memorial University, named after the fallen president, was founded in Harrogate, Tenn. in 1897. And thanks in part to Parson Brownlow's violent expulsion of Confederate sympathizers after 1863, the region became a postwar Republican Party stronghold. Even at the height of the "Solid South" of the early 20th century, when voting Republican was considered practically a mortal sin in the rest of the South, East Tennesseans refused to vote Democratic - Tennessee's Second Congressional District, based in Knox and Blount Counties, has not elected a Democrat since 1852.

HEADLINE: A Hybrid Power Plant Takes Shape in Turkey

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Solar and wind power will supplement natural gas at optimal points during the day at the plant, which will be built in Karaman, Turkey. 

 BODY:
How can the electric system take intermittent energy sources like wind and sun and integrate them with conventional fuels for electricity, like natural gas? 
General Electric and a small California company called eSolar announced a new strategy on Tuesday: use the solar power to make steam that will supplement the steam from the natural gas. And tack on some wind machines nearby, in an arrangement that lets the natural gas compensate for variations in the wind and sun. 
The technology turns a natural gas plant and a solar plant into conjoined twins; wind is more like a half-sibling.The two companies said they would break ground this year on a hybrid electric plant in Karaman, Turkey, to be owned by a Turkish project developer called MetCap Energy Investments. Part of it will look like a conventional combined-cycle gas plant in which the gas is burned in a jet engine that drives a generator, and the exhaust gases are used to make steam to turn a steam turbine that also drives a generator. 
But standing nearby is a 250-foot tower surrounded by about 25,000 mirrors, each about the size of a big flat-screen television. Computers keep the mirrors focused on the tower, and inside the tower, water is boiled into steam. The steam flows into the turbine along with steam from the natural gas plant. In broad outline, using the sun to boil water into steam and supplementing that with natural gas is not new. But most such projects use parabolic troughs with black pipes running down the center. The tower design allows steam to be heated to temperatures 200 degrees higher than the troughs, which means that the system will produce far more electricity per acre. 
The design is rather modest on the renewables side; the plan is for 450 megawatts of natural gas, 50 megawatts of solar power and 22 megawatts of wind power. But Turkey grants a subsidy equal to 10 euro cents per kilowatt-hour for renewable power, said Paul Browning, president and chief executive of the thermal products division of GE Energy. 
"There are some savings from the control system, the switch yard, some of the interconnections,'' Mr. Browning added. G.E. is boasting that the plant will be 69 percent efficient, a phenomenally high number. Most natural gas plants have an efficiency ranging from 30 to 50 percent. GE calculates the figure by counting the sun and wind at zero, as a kind of hamburger helper for the natural gas. The calculation ignores the wind and sun that does not get converted to electricity, but on the other hand, the wind and sun are inexhaustible.
The design is based on a new model of G.E. natural gas plant calledFlexEfficiency that is able to vary its output rapidly to make it a good dance partner for variable sources like wind and sun.
Mr. Browning said a customer that was considering supplementing natural gas with solar power would have to weigh the cost of gas, the cost of capital and the available incentives. "Gas in the U.S. is very cheap right now, and the renewable incentives in the U.S. are -- let's call them inconsistent and difficult to project into future,'' he said. The price of natural gas in Turkey is more than double the price in the United Sates, he said. 
The Turkish plant will be in commercial operation by 2015, he said. Future plants could have a higher proportion of solar energy, depending on market conditions, he said. 
The California company eSolar operates two power towers on the edge of the Mojave Desert. Last year it received an $11 million grant from the Energy Department to work on the design of a system that would heat molten salt rather than water. The salt stores heat that can be turned into electricity during periods of clouds or darkness, said John Van Scoter, the company's chief executive and president. 
At the Turkish plant, there is no need for storage; the solar part will run when there is sunshine, and be replaced by gas when there is no sun.

HEADLINE: Nurses Rally for Health Care Funding

BYLINE: SEAN COLLINS WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: Members of the nation's largest nurses' union protest in front of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce building and rally at the Capitol.

 BODY:
Hundreds of members of the nation's largest nurses' union demonstrated outside the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.
The union, National Nurses United, held the event to promote its "Main Street Contract for the American People," which aims, in part, to increase tax revenue from corporations to prevent cuts in entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
The protesters started in Lafayette Square and marched to the chamber's headquarters. Two demonstrators in tuxedoes -- one labeled "Goldman" and the other "Sachs" -- collected "invoices" of demands like "pension contribution increases" and "Mortgage payments" from nurses on the steps of the building.
After the event, a spokeswoman from the chamber said the country's corporate tax burden was too high as it is.
"The chamber welcomes all voices to the debate, but the debate has to remain focused on creating American jobs and keeping our economy growing," the chamber's director of communications, Blair Latoff, wrote in an e-mail. "Right now U.S. businesses are saddled with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, which is undercutting our global competitiveness."
Ms. Latoff, who did not see the protest but learned of it afterward, also noted that President Obama supported lowering the corporate tax burden. In his most recent State of Union address, Mr. Obama said he wanted Congress to close loopholes in the tax code and "use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years."
After the chamber demonstration, protesters boarded buses to Upper Senate Park for a rally, which included a speech by Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont.
"From birth to death, the people who are at our sides when we get sick are our nurses," he said.
Mr. Sanders recently introduced a bill to create a single-payer health care system, which would require state governments to provide universal coverage. The measure is not expected to move forward.
"Health care must be a right for all people," Mr. Sanders said at the rally. "We are at that moment where we got to push. We got to shove."
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, also spoke.
"The Republicans once had a 'Contract With America,'" Mrs. Boxer said, referring to the agenda the Republican Party used to capture the House in 1994. "I'm ready for a good contract, and this is it."
After the rally, representatives from the nurses' union met with members of Congress to lobby for support.
Although much of the union's political support comes from liberals, National Nurses United has a nonpartisan mission, the executive director of the group, Rose Ann DeMoro, said in an interview. Mr. Sanders' comments on a single-payer system were not intended to be the theme of the day, she said.
Ms. DeMoro, in a letter in The New York Times last month, criticized both sides of the debate over entitlement spending. In it, she called the plan of Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, to turn Medicaid into a block grant program a "thinly veiled scheme to destroy" the program and attacked the Democrat-backed health care overhaul last year because it "expands the role of private insurers."
"The politicians spend all our time lowering our expectations about what is possible," Ms. DeMoro said on Tuesday.
Calls for increased governmental involvement in the health care system are unlikely to gain traction any time soon. After the midterm elections, in which Republicans took control of the House, the House voted to repeal the law. The measure was defeated in the Democrat-controlled Senate.
Many nurses at the rally said they were concerned that staffing reductions in hospitals and doctors' offices due to budget cuts could be dangerous to patients.
"People are suffering, because there are not enough nurses at the bedside," said Pamela Young, 54, who traveled from Oviedo, Fla., for the event.
With more than 160,000 members, National Nurses United formed in 2009 with the consolidation of three unions: United American Nurses, Massachusetts Nurses Association, and California Nurses Association/National Nurses Organizing Committee.

HEADLINE: Pawlenty Talks Tough on Obama

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: During a question-and-answer session after his economics speech Tuesday, the Republican candidate used some pretty raw language to describe President Obama's economic policies.

 BODY:
Tim Pawlenty hails from Minnesota, where folks are Midwest nice. But you wouldn't know that from listening to him recently.
During a question-and-answer session after his economics speech on Tuesday, Mr. Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, used some pretty raw language to describe President Obama's economic policies.
"If Obama's economic policies are kept in place, we are in deep doo-doo," Mr. Pawlenty said, and then rephrased to use a more evocative term. 
That's not the first time that Mr. Palwenty has used tough words aimed at the sitting president. In one recent radio interview, Mr. Pawlenty accused the president of being so nervous during intelligence briefings that he might wet his pants. 
"I think what happens now is that the intelligence folks come in and brief him in the morning and he's probably looking for a pair of Depends," Mr. Pawlenty said. "And so I think he's in over his head on a lot of levels."
In an interview last Sunday on ABC's "This Week" program, Mr. Pawlenty referred to Mr. Obama as "any doofus."
"I think any doofus can go to Washington, D.C., and maintain the status quo or incrementally change things," he said. He added a few moments later that "doofus" was a "Minnesota term" that "would mean someone who was relatively low performing."
And last month, while Mr. Obama was in Europe, Mr. Pawlenty shot off a Twitter message aimed directly at the president. The message mocked Mr. Obama's trip, which included a visit to a bar in the Ireland town of his mother's ancestors.
"@BarackObama sorry to interrupt the European pub crawl, but what was your Medicare plan?" Mr. Pawlenty posted to Twitter.
Mr. Pawlenty's advisers are well aware of his tendency to speak what's on his mind. Asked about Tuesday's suggestive comment, his spokesman, Alex Conant said: "There probably are better ways to describe President Obama's economic policies. But let's face it, the economy under President Obama really isn't pretty."

HEADLINE: Pawlenty Promises High Growth, Low Taxes, Tight Spending

BYLINE: BY MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Tim Pawlenty describes the tax and spending cuts he would favor as president, and decries what he calls President Obama's "central planning."

 BODY:
Tim Pawlenty, the Republican former governor of Minnesota, called on Tuesday for across-the-board federal spending reductions and large tax cuts for businesses and individuals, saying that such policies would drive rapid economic growth, create jobs and reduce debt.
Declaring that President Obama's "central planning" doesn't work, Mr. Pawlenty said that if he is elected president, he will aim for a national economic growth rate of 5 percent, a target he called "a big, positive goal" that is achievable. 
"The addiction to spending must be brought to a halt, and we must have a president who has a growth agenda," Mr. Pawlenty, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2012 election, said in a speech at the University of Chicago. "The president is satisfied with a second-rate American economy produced by his third-rate policies. I'm not."
In the speech, which his aides said was a major economic policy address, Mr. Pawlenty urged a reduction in business income-tax rates to 15 percent, from 35 percent. Under his plan, individual federal income taxes would be flattened to just two rates: 10 percent for the first $50,000 of income and 25 percent for income above that threshold. He also urged elimination of all taxes on capital gains.
Such broad tax cuts would be costly, and Mr. Pawlenty did not provide specifics about how he would offset the impact of the cuts on the federal government's debt - an issue that has become a central one in his party. He said economic growth would provide much of the money to pay for the tax cuts.
He also said he would overhaul the tax code, calling it a "9,000-page monstrosity" that is "chock full of special deals for special interests." But he did not say which tax provisions he would eliminate, or whether he would get rid of popular and costly tax deductions like the one for home-mortgage interest.
"Reform would not only help offset short-term revenue loss from the rate cuts," he said, "it would also reduce cronyism, favoritism and government manipulating markets for political purposes."
Mr. Pawlenty used the speech to attack Mr. Obama's economic policies, accusing the president of being a "champion practitioner of class warfare." 
"Elected with a call for unity and hope, he's spent three years dividing our nation and fanning the flames of class envy and resentment to deflect attention from his own failures and the economic hardship they have visited on America," Mr. Pawlenty said.
In addition to broad tax cuts, Mr. Pawlenty said that as president he would seek temporary presidential authority to freeze government spending and to impound up to 5 percent of the federal budget until the nation's budget is balanced. He said he would wage an "unrelenting trench battle against the overregulation that's suffocating America's entrepreneurial spirit." And he called for cuts in programs that are better done by private companies.
"We can start by applying what I call the Google test," he said. "If you can find a good or service on the Internet, then the federal government probably doesn't need to be doing it." As examples he cited the Postal Service, Amtrak and federal home-mortgage agencies.
Mr. Pawlenty has fared poorly in recent polls, which give his rival Republican hopefuls a large lead and suggest that voters remain unfamiliar with him. The speech was an early effort by one of the Republican candidates to lay out an alternative to Mr. Obama's economic policies.
Democrats responded quickly, saying Mr. Pawlenty's proposals would increase the federal deficit and impose hardship on middle-income Americans.
"Tim Pawlenty's plan to extend and expand the Bush tax cuts, deeply slashing taxes paid by the wealthiest Americans and corporate America and sending our deficit soaring even higher, is not an economic plan, it's a prescription for economic disaster," Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement.
Eddie Vale, a spokesman for Protect Your Care, a Democratic-leaning organization, said Mr. Pawlenty's "Google test" would lead to cuts in health care, Medicaid, Social Security and veterans' benefits.
"It's also pretty sad and pathetic how quickly the regular-blue-collar-guy veneer has fallen off as he rushes to cry crocodile tears over class warfare while taking away health care from seniors and kids to pay for tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires and big oil," Mr. Vale said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Can the Yield Gap Be Closed - Sustainably?

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: It's not just that intensive agriculture causes nitrogen from fertilizer to volatilize into a major greenhouse gas, or that it washes into rivers; such farming is not sustainable over the long haul even on its own terms.

 BODY:
In my article on Sunday about the future of the food system, I briefly mentioned the potential for improved agricultural output in Africa. The situation there is a prime example of a larger problem that concerns the world's agronomists: the yield gap.
That term is used to describe the enormous gulf between the crop yields obtained by the most successful farmers and the least successful. Farmers in the United States, for example, routinely grow five times as much corn per acre as small farmers in Africa. While Africa has the world's largest concentration of below-potential agriculture, other areas also lag. They include parts of South Asia, such as rice farming areas in northeastern India, and the agricultural regions of many ex-Communist countries.
Experts say that closing the gap must be a prime strategy for feeding the world. And there is no technological mystery about how to do it: the strategy of using high-yielding modern crop varieties and nitrogen fertilizer has already been proven, in the Green Revolution, to raise output for farmers. But getting these tools into the hands of poor smallholder farmers requires both political leadership and large public investment. 
China did it, transitioning from a famine-plagued country to one able to feed itself. To a considerable extent, India and Pakistan did it. But most African governments, chronically short of funds and often plagued by poor leadership, have not done it.
The original Green Revolution bypassed Africa for other reasons, too. It worked best in the irrigated agriculture systems that had long prevailed in Asia, and for a handful of major cereal crops, primarily rice, wheat and corn. Irrigation is relatively uncommon in Africa, a continent dependent on rain to water its crops. 
Moreover, while the big grains have made inroads in Africa, the continent still depends on a slew of smaller crops as dietary staples, like cassava, savory types of bananas, sorghum, millet and so forth. These crops were not the target of much investment in the original Green Revolution.
Nowadays, with a renewed focus on global food security, efforts are afoot to bring a new Green Revolution to Africa and other areas plagued by yield gaps. And the question is not simply: Can it be done? The better question is: Can it be done sustainably?For as I outlined in a blog post on Sunday, intensive agriculture causes many environmental problems, particularly in areas where heavy subsidies for nitrogen fertilizer lead to its overuse. Some of the nitrogen volatilizes into a major greenhouse gas, and some of it washes into rivers and helps create dead zones where the rivers meet the ocean. 
Perhaps even more worrisome, much of the intensive agriculture created by the Green Revolution is not sustainable over the long haul even on its own terms, since it depends on mining non-renewable resources. In parts of India, farmers are withdrawing groundwater at alarming rates; that is true in other areas, too, including parts of China and the United States.
Those risks would be bad enough, but as I outlined in my article, a new one looms: climate change. No continent's agriculture is more at risk from climate change than Africa's. So the task on the continent is not just agricultural development, but making that agriculture more resilient in the face of rising risks from heat, drought and erratic weather of all kinds.
In light of these challenges, many experts have begun to use the term "sustainable intensification" to describe what needs to happen. That essentially means that we need to close the yield gap in as many places as possible, especially in Africa, but in a way that is as sensitive as possible to environmental concerns and assuring the long-run durability of agriculture itself. 
"We've got to increase the amount of food, and we've got to do it without damaging the environment," said Roy Steiner, a deputy director of global development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. "That's not an easy thing to do."
As I mentioned briefly in my article, numerous entities are trying to tackle these problems. The United States has introduced an ambitious new program called Feed the Future to help 20 of the poorest countries improve their agriculture. Governments of other rich countries have pledged billions in aid, although as I reported, the money has been slow in coming. 
The World Bank has increased its lending for agricultural projects. The Rockefeller Foundation, the original instigator of the Green Revolution, is still involved in supporting agriculture in poor countries.
But perhaps the single most interesting new entrant on this stage is the Gates Foundation. When I interviewed Bill Gates, he told me that the decision he and his wife made in 2006 to invest in agricultural development was partly a function of the huge gift to their foundation that year by Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor. "Without his gift, what we ended up doing in agriculture would have been very modest," Mr. Gates said. "The fact that we have a reasonably sized program -- he gets a lot of the credit for that."
The Gates Foundation has posted its strategy and a list of its agricultural projects, and Mr. Gates gave speeches in 2009 (here -- video and text are on separate tabs) and this year (here, also separate tabs) outlining the foundation's approach. 
When he delivered this year's speech in Washington, Julie Borlaug, the granddaughter of Norman E. Borlaug of Green Revolution fame, stood up in the audience to thank Mr. Gates for his work.
Among the major recipients of money from the Gates and Rockefeller foundations is an entity called the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, which is working to develop more advanced tools and techniques. A separate project called Water Efficient Maize for Africa aims to get high-yielding, drought-resistant corn seeds into the hands of African farmers. 
Not only is the Gates Foundation paying to scale up flood-tolerant rice in India and nearby countries, it is working to bring variations of that crop to Africa. One of the foundation's most interesting endeavors has been to help finance a World Food Program strategy of buying local crops within Africa, as a way to connect small farmers better to regional markets. 
The Gateses and their foundation have been attacked ideologically, for instance here and here, for some of their positions, including a refusal to rule out genetically modified crops as a potential answer to agricultural problems in Africa and Asia. The critics also fear that the Gates Foundation's work will lead to more corporate control of agriculture in poor countries. 
Mr. Gates answered some of this criticism in his 2009 speech in Des Moines, declaring that technological approaches and environmental sustainability were not really in conflict. "I believe it's a false choice, and it's dangerous for the field," he said then. 
Activist groups have also faulted the Gates Foundation because a separate entity that manages its investments has bought some shares of Monsanto, the big American agricultural company. (The Gateses explain the investment philosophy of their money-management arm here.) Anybody who has watched the Gates Foundation over the years knows that it has a long history of trying to work with corporations rather than going to war with them; in fact, the foundation pioneered a whole new approach that leverages foundation money and corporate interests in pursuit of social goals. That tactic has paid dividends for the Gateses in the field of public health, inducing drug companies like GlaxoSmithKline to take on projects to help some of the world's poorest people. 
It will be interesting to see what they manage to coax out of the Monsantos and Syngentas of the world. Already, Monsanto has donated rights to a gene-altered corn variety designed to resist drought so that it can be adapted for Africa. Natalie DiNicola, a vice president at Monsanto, told me that her company was one of 20 or so agricultural companies that had committed publicly to working with entities like the Gates Foundation, "all recognizing that we need a new vision for agriculture that's going to be able to meet food security needs, conserve resources, and serve as a foundation for economic development."
Abroad, Mr. and Mrs. Gates have become as well-known for their charitable work as for Mr. Gates's role in founding Microsoft. Indeed, one of the most interesting elements of their role as charitable entrepreneurs is that the Gateses have become, in effect, roving ambassadors for the United States.
My colleague Hari Kumar interviewed a farmer in India, Anand Kumar Singh, who had been amazed by the resilience of the flood-tolerant rice financed by the Gates Foundation. Mr. Singh was among a group of farmers in Bihar state who met with Bill and Melinda Gates when they visited India a few months ago. 
"The world's richest man and his wife sat on the ground with the poor farmers of Bihar and inquired about our agriculture and our lives," Mr. Singh told Mr. Kumar. "I cannot forget that experience throughout my life."
The Gates Foundation has been working in agriculture for only five years, and the renewed international focus by the world's governments on agricultural development is even shorter than that, dating essentially to the 2008 food crisis. Many agronomists I spoke with for my article are hopeful that these efforts will, in coming years, produce what some of them call a "greener revolution" in the agriculture of poor countries.
"There are more pieces of the puzzle in place now," said Robert Paarlberg, an agricultural expert at Wellesley College, "than at any time in previous decades."

HEADLINE: What Your Taxes Do (and Don't) Buy for You

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: The notion that Europeans pay much higher taxes that Americans does not acknowledge that in return they generally receive health care, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and servedon the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul.
Last week I showed that total taxes at the federal level -- individual and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes and so on -- are at a 60-year low as a share of the broadest measure of income, the gross domestic product.
Some readers took issue with my failure to include state and local taxes in the calculation. I have now done that, using data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which represents the major developed countries. Among its most important responsibilities is the collection of internationally comparable data on a wide variety of topics, including taxes and health care spending.The table below shows total taxes, including state and local government taxes, as a share of G.D.P. in 2008, the latest year for which there is complete data. The table makes clear that the United States has very low taxes by international standards.
When Americans see these data they are usually incredulous that Europeans submit to such seemingly oppressive tax levels. Conservatives, in particular, tend to view freedom as a fixed sum: the bigger government is as a share of G.D.P., the less freedom there is for the people (if government consumes, say, 40 percent of G.D.P., then people are only 60 percent free).
The late Milton Friedman popularized this idea, but even he thought that freedom would not be seriously threatened in Western democracies until government spending reached 60 percent of G.D.P. We are far away from that "tipping point," as he called it; in 2010, total federal, state and local government spending amounted to 36 percent of G.D.P.
American conservatives tend to ignore the composition of spending; to them, just about all spending is equally bad. Europeans don't have this attitude because their governments provide them with benefits from which all residents gain.
First is cash allowances that almost all families with children receive. We have something similar, the earned-income tax credit. Because it is part of the tax code, it reduces the tax burden; in Europe such programs are part of the budget and thus raise spending. Moreover, the earned-income tax credit benefits only low-income workers; in Europe, family allowances benefit virtually all families with children.
The impact on the tax burden can be dramatic if one views family allowances as negative taxes. For example, in Luxembourg, an average married worker with two children pays a nominal income tax rate of 16.5 percent (including state and local income taxes), while an American in the same situation would pay 5.2 percent. But once family allowances are subtracted from the Luxembourg worker's income-tax payment, the effective tax rate falls to just nine-tenths of 1 percent.
More importantly, almost every other country has some form of national health insurance that covers, on average, 72 percent of all health costs. The comparable figure in the United States is 46.5 percent, and almost all of that is accounted for by Medicare and Medicaid, which largely benefit the elderly and the poor.
Average American workers must pay for health care out of their pockets, or through their employers in the form of lower wages. Europeans prefer to pay higher taxes and get government health care for every resident in return.
Conservatives universally believe that whenever the government provides a service it will be vastly more costly than if the private sector does so. This is why they support the plan offered by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, to essentially privatize Medicare. Conservatives believe competition will drive down health costs for the elderly.
But O.E.C.D. data show that Americans pay vastly more for health care than the residents of any other major country. In 2008, we paid 16 percent of G.D.P. in total health care costs, public and private combined. The people with the next heaviest health care burden were the French, who paid 11.2 percent of G.D.P. Indeed, at 7.4 percent of G.D.P., the governmental share of health spending in the United States is about the same as total health care costs in many other countries, including (as a percentage of G.D.P.) Luxembourg (6.8 percent), Israel (7.8 percent), Japan (8.1 percent), Britain (8.4 percent) and Norway (8.5 percent).
In other words, if we had a health care system like those in most developed countries, we could, in effect, give every American an increase in their disposable income of 8 percent of G.D.P. - about what they pay in federal income taxes - and have health care no worse than they have in Britain or Japan. It would be like abolishing the federal income tax in terms of allowing people to spend more of their income on something other than health care.
Because most people have little more choice about medical spending than they do about the taxes they pay, one can think of the two as being similar in nature. In the table below, I have added private health care spending as a share of G.D.P. to the tax data in the table above. This puts the United States and other countries on the same footing, by accounting for the fact that they get health care mostly through government while Americans mostly pay for it themselves.
As one can see, the burden of taxes plus private health care spending substantially equalizes the loss of disposable income in the United States and other countries, because we pay 8.6 percent of G.D.P. for health care over and above what the government pays, whereas those in other major countries pay an average of just 2.3 percent of G.D.P. out of their pockets.
Looking at taxes alone, the burden in the United States is 25 percent below the O.E.C.D. average, but including the additional health costs Americans pay, the United States is just 4.7 percent below average.
In short, a substantial portion of the higher tax burden that Europeans pay is really illusory. They are really just paying their health insurance premiums through their taxes rather than through lower wages, as we do.
Middle-class Europeans also get cash benefits from government that offset much of the tax burden in a way that the United States offers only for the poor. There may be reasons why it is better not to subsidize every family with children and not provide government health insurance for every citizen. But the idea that Europeans are enslaved by high taxes, as most American conservatives believe, is just nonsense.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Replacement

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus at look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
Today's Times The political standing of Representative Anthony D. Weiner appeared in danger after the news conference in which he admitted having inappropriate online exchanges with at least six women, The Times's Michael Barbaro reports. Mr. Weiner, a Democrat from New York, said he was not resigning. But there was a striking absence of any public expressions of support from his colleagues, and the House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi, called for an ethics investigation into Mr. Weiner's conduct. With a major debate growing inside the White House over how quickly to reduce the number of American troops in Afghanistan, senior military officials pushed back Monday against the possibility of a major reduction in forces that they said could imperil gains on the ground. American officials said that although NATO was on track to reach its goal of training 305,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers by October, attrition remained a significant problem, The Times's David Sanger and Thom Shanker report.In Congress, Representative Walter B. Jones is emerging as a leading advocate for swiftly withdrawing American forces from Afghanistan, a position that has made him a liberal hero. James Dao explains why that is an unlikely place to be for the congressman, who otherwise seems thoroughly in tune with his conservative, staunchly Republican district in eastern North Carolina, home to the Marine Corps' Camp Lejeune and thousands of military retirees. Austan Goolsbee, a longtime adviser to President Obama and the only economist left on his core economic team, is leaving his post as chairman of the Council on Economic Advisers after a year on the job, and the White House is eager to name a successor, The Times's Jackie Calmes reports. 
 Mr. Obama has yet to nominate a new head for the Comptroller of the Currency, or a new chairman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. There is no nominee to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the top spot at the Federal Housing Finance Agency remains vacant. After the decision by a noted economist Monday to end a 14-month wait for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, there are renewed concerns among some Democrats about the Obama administration's perceived lack of urgency and enthusiasm to fill top positions in the agencies charged with overhauling financial regulation, the Times's Binyamin Appelbaum reports. 
Happenings around Washington The president and first lady will host Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for the administration's first visit by a female head of government. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold hearings to examine the nominations of Geeta Pasi to be ambassador to Djibouti, Donald W. Koran to be ambassador to Rwanda and Lewis Alan Lukens to be ambassador to Senegal.

HEADLINE: The Ironman Triathlon Comes to New York

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
Bringing the nation's biggest triathlon to the nation's biggest city turned out to be an organizational feat comparable to the Ironman itself. When it was officially announced Tuesday that the Ironman U.S. Championship would be contested in New York and New Jersey in August 2012, it capped seven years of planning with the knowledge that the 140.6-mile course could not involve closing any New York City streets.
So, the 2.4-mile swim will be contested in the Hudson River, the 112-mile cycling course will be on the Palisades Parkway through Bergen and Rockland Counties, and the 26.2-mile run will start in Fort Lee, N.J., before crossing the George Washington Bridge and finishing in Manhattan's Riverside Park. The inaugural race will feature a field of 2,500 athletes. 
''With this, New York is going to become the triathlon capital of America,'' said John Korff, the race organizer who for the past 11 years has staged the Olympic-distance NYC Triathlon, which is much shorter: a 1,500-meter swim, a 40K cycling segment and a 10K run. ''We are going to have the two most popular races at their distances in the country. This is going to be a huge perceptional change. People think this is a concrete jungle but it's a recreation center, too. We'll show them you can swim, bike and run in New York City.''
But Korff said when he took the idea of the race to city officials, they told him closing roads was not an option. The same economic pressures that have prompted the New York Police Department to announce a fee for services during events like the New York City Marathon have prevented the approval of new events that require costly services like closing roads.
Even proposing a course mostly in New Jersey had its challenges -- Korff said he was told the Palisades Parkway had never been closed for anything other than an emergency in its existence -- but he eventually carved out a route that worked: except for two blocks in Manhattan needed for the marathon segment.
''I brought the two cops up to 181st and Cabrini and said I've got 140.4 miles and I need these two blocks,'' Korff said. ''When they said, 'It's not going to be easy,' I knew the answer would be yes.''
Eventually, the answer was yes, so most of the marathon course could proceed down the western shoreline of Manhattan. Race officials said the economic impact on the tri-state area was expected to be about $50 million.
''The event will showcase New York City to participants and spectators from around the globe and help the city continue to attract visitors in record numbers,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a statement. ''Together with our partners in New Jersey, we'll be ready to host a first-class competition.''
Entrance into the field is on a first-come-first-served basis with online registration starting next Wednesday. The registration fee has not yet been set. Korff said the field size of 2,500 triathletes was a conservative estimate of what the course could hold and might grow to as many as 3,500 in future years. From this race, 75 finishers will qualify for the world championship Ironman, in Kona, Hawaii.
The race becomes the 25th Ironman race worldwide, and the 10th in the United States.

HEADLINE: Rector at Muslim University In Russia Is Shot to Death

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Gunmen on Tuesday killed the rector of a Muslim university in southern Russia who had been leading a government-sponsored effort to counter violence in the region by reviving the local traditions of Sufi Islam that he said were less likely to inspire suicide bombers. 
The rector, Maksud I. Sadikov, of the Islamic University of the North Caucasus, was shot to death in a car in Makhachkala, the capital of the Dagestan region, Russian prosecutors said. Mr. Sadikov's bodyguard was also killed, they said.
The prosecutors had not arrested or identified any potential suspects by late Tuesday, and no group immediately stepped forward to take responsibility for the attack.
Mr. Sadikov was a proponent of the idea that state support for Sufism could diminish the threat of terrorism in Russia. Sufism was once widespread in the North Caucasus but faded after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the arrival of proselytizers from Middle East who sought to spread Sunni Islam.
In an interview about his work in February, Mr. Sadikov said that no Sufi had committed a suicide bombing in Russia.
''One of the best methods to resist the ideology of extremism is a good religious education,'' Mr. Sadikov said. He said a moderate Islamic education was an ''anti-venom'' against terrorism.
The effort, and the government financing it received, had put him at odds with militants in the Islamic insurgency in Russia that began in Chechnya in the 1990s and has spread to other regions, including Dagestan.
His university, a sprawling complex beside a mosque in Makhachkala, was involved in one of the few nonmilitary approaches that the Russian government has attempted to resolve the long-running rebellion. President Dmitri A. Medvedev has also tried to use economic aid to ease unemployment in the area.
Militants have sent dozens of suicide bombers into central Russian cities, including Moscow, over the past decade. In the past 18 months, 76 people have died in attacks on the Moscow subway system and at its main airport. Those attacks led the police to put additional metal detectors in public spaces.
Mr. Sadikov said his strategy was to prevent radical Islamic ideas from taking root in young men. In southern Russia, as in Iraq and Afghanistan, most suicide bombers are adherents of fundamentalist Sunni sects, including the Salafi tradition that is the state religion in Saudi Arabia.
The Russian government latched onto Mr. Sadikov's observations and threw official support behind other forms of Islam.
The United States tried a similar tactic in Iraq by introducing moderate imams at the prisons where insurgents were being held.
Mr. Sadikov's university was intended to educate elementary school teachers for a pilot project to teach Sufi Islam in public schools. This year, 1,300 students were enrolled, making it the largest effort of its kind in the North Caucasus. His university taught what he characterized as pacifist Sufi practices, like performing a ritual whirling dance or taking pilgrimages to holy sites.
Critics countered that the Sufi monopoly of formal religious education in the North Caucasus only served to further alienate fundamentalist Sunni believers by compelling them to worship at home.
The state's support also made the university a target. In the February interview, Mr. Sadikov said that he was keenly aware of the dangers inherent in his project. ''The radicals are saying, 'You need to punish the impure Muslims,' '' Mr. Sadikov said.

HEADLINE: Calling for 'Achievable' Target, Christie Plans Cut in State's Renewable Energy Goals

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday that he planned to scale back New Jersey's goals for renewable energy as he looked for an ''achievable'' approach to generating electricity in the state.
His change is part of an overhaul of the state's 10-year energy master plan, which had been expected since last year, when he asked the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to evaluate renewable energy targets he found too aggressive. But after his decision last month to withdraw from a multistate trading system, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, environmental advocates called the move another setback undermining the state's leadership on energy initiatives.
Public hearings will be held on the plan before it becomes final. The revision sets the amount of electricity to be obtained from renewable sources like solar or wind power at 22.5 percent by 2021, down from 30 percent. It also puts more emphasis on electricity powered by natural gas; the state is already seeking to build three new gas plants. 
Speaking at a news conference in Trenton, Mr. Christie, a Republican, said he was not retreating from having wind and solar power play ''a continuing larger role in supporting the energy needs of the state.'' The new plan maintains support for offshore wind projects and emphasizes development of large-scale commercial and industrial solar energy projects, particularly on landfills and brownfield sites.
But the governor called the 10-year goal of 22.5 percent realistic, ''not a pie-in-the-sky number.''
''We wanted to put forward a document that was responsible and achievable,'' he said.
Some legislators and environmental advocates said they were disappointed that a state that was second only to California in solar power capacity would cut back on its public policy commitment to renewable energy. ''The renewable energy goals were achievable,'' said Matt Elliott, the clean energy advocate for the environmental group Environment New Jersey. ''We're increasing the amount of solar every year and seeing the costs drop.''
Bob Smith, a Piscataway Democrat who is chairman of the State Senate's Environment and Energy Committee, said the progress of generating solar power would be endangered if the new plan ''sends a signal that we're not quite as serious as we used to be.''
''If you make the numbers more aggressive, you're going to see more renewables,'' he said.
In announcing last month that New Jersey would withdraw from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which provides participating states with hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in clean energy and energy efficiency projects, Mr. Christie said the program was an ineffective way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Officials in participating states like New York and Massachusetts challenged that assessment, calling the program a success.
On Tuesday, Mr. Christie said he wanted to create a ''basket of options'' from which the state would draw the most economically and environmentally sound sources of power generation for New Jersey, which, he said, had some of the highest electricity rates in the country.
Nuclear power will continue to be part of the policy mix, he said, as well as conservation efforts like making government buildings more energy efficient.
Michael Egenton, senior vice president for government relations at the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, called the proposed energy plan ''business-friendly'' for advancing a diversified energy portfolio. ''It keeps in mind the energy costs in the region,'' he said. ''We also recognize that in a state like New Jersey, we need everything on the table.''

HEADLINE: Fleeing to Foreign Shores

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Reva Medical, a maker of medical devices in San Diego, wanted to go public last year to raise money to satisfy impatient venture capitalists and finance research for its heart stents.
But it found little investor interest in the United States for an early-stage medical device company that had not yet made a profit.
Reva Medical did what a small but increasing number of young American companies are doing -- it looked abroad for money, in Reva's case the Australian stock exchange.
After an eight-month road show, meeting investors and pitching the prospects of a biodegradable stent, the 12-year-old company sold 25 percent of its stock for $85 million in an initial public offering in December. 
''There are so many companies that require capital like our company, and they don't have access to the capital markets in the United States,'' said Robert Stockman, Reva's chief executive. ''People are looking at any option to stay alive, which is what we did.''
Reva's example shows that nearly three years since the financial crisis began, markets in the United States are barely open to many companies, leading them to turn to investors abroad. Denied a chance to list their stock and go public here, they are finding ready buyers of their shares on foreign markets.
Nearly one in 10 American companies that went public last year did so outside the United States. Besides Australia, they turned to stock markets in Britain, Taiwan, South Korea and Canada, according to data from the consulting firm Grant Thornton and Dealogic.
The 10 companies that went public abroad in 2010 -- and 75 from 2000 to 2009 -- compares with only two United States companies choosing foreign exchanges from 1991 to 1999.
The trend reflects a decidedly global outlook toward stocks, just as the number of public companies in the United States is shrinking.
From a peak of more than 8,800 American companies at the end of 1997, that number fell to about 5,100 by the end of 2009, a 40 percent decline, according to the World Federation of Exchanges.
The drop comes as some companies have merged, or gone out of business, or been taken private by private equity firms. Other young businesses have chosen to sell themselves to bigger companies rather than go public.
To be sure, as the economy improves and investors shaken badly by the financial crisis begin to regain their confidence, American stock markets may once again open up for companies trying to go public and listings may rise in the United States.
LinkedIn, the social networking site for business professionals, had a successful initial public offering last month on the New York Stock Exchange, and Groupon, the social buying site, has registered its plans to go public in the United States.
But these are big companies, enjoying the popularity of being Internet darlings. Executives and analysts fear that a long-term structural shift in American equity markets means these markets are now closed to legions of smaller, more ordinary businesses. They could more easily have gone public in the United States in the past. But they now remain private or, for the time being, have to market themselves overseas and rely on foreign investors.
For example, initial public offerings by American companies totaled only 119 in the United States last year, according to Dealogic -- higher than the depressed rates of the previous two years but a far cry from the 756 companies that went public at the peak in 1996.
As young, fast-growing companies are forced to look overseas for public status and investors, executives and analysts fear that they may increasingly shift their geographic focus -- and as a result any jobs they create will be abroad.
''Issuers have to put themselves through a grinder to go overseas, so any significant percentage of overseas listings is a sign that our markets have become hostile to innovation and job formation,'' said David Weild, a former vice chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange and a senior adviser to Grant Thornton.
A variety of factors explain each company's decision to list on a foreign exchange, like the increased regulatory costs of going public in the United States. Underwriting, legal and other costs are typically lower in foreign markets, companies say.
The Alternative Investment Market, or AIM, a part of the London Stock Exchange intended for small company listings, is a popular destination for some American companies. The cost of an initial public offering there is about 10 to 12 percent of total capital raised, compared with 13 to 15 percent on Nasdaq, according to Mark McGowan of AIM Advisers, which helps American companies list on AIM.
In addition, the extra annual cost of maintaining a public listing, including complying with Sarbanes-Oxley rules, can be typically much higher in the United States: $2 million to $3 million each year depending on the size of a company compared with a cost as low as $320,000 on AIM or $100,000 to $300,000 in a market like Taiwan, according to advisers.
There are concerns that some foreign exchanges attract companies because their oversight may be less stringent. But companies insist standards are high.
A more important factor than cost, said Sanjay Subhedar, managing director of Storm Ventures, a California venture capital firm, is that investors in the United States who traditionally participate in I.P.O.'s and the banks that underwrite the offerings are no longer interested in share sales by small companies.
Institutional investors like mutual funds want the liquidity of larger offerings with abundant buyers and sellers, he said; bank underwriters want to focus on the more lucrative fees that bigger deals generate.
One of the companies he invests in, Integrated Memory Logic (iML), of Campbell, Calif., last year became one of the first non-Taiwanese companies to list on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. A supplier of semiconductor chips for LCD screens, it raised $40 million with a 10 percent sale of the company after the exchange changed its rules to allow foreign companies to join.
Integrated Memory Logic, which had a work force of 60 when it went public, has since added a handful of engineers in the United States but also another 40 employees in Shanghai, Taipei and Seoul, South Korea.
''Because of the nature of the industry, large mutual fund companies and investment banks don't want to do an offering of less than $100 million,'' said Mr. Subhedar. ''This means unless the company has a market size of $500 million, you can't really go public in the United States. We were in the $250 million to $350 million range.''
Another reason to go abroad, some American businesses like HaloSource of Seattle are discovering, is that investors in the United States may not be as interested as foreign investors in companies whose growth potential is strongest overseas.
HaloSource makes water purification devices for use in American pools and spas but also for drinking water in countries like India, China and Brazil. Last year, it had an $80 million initial public offering on AIM. One reason it chose London, according to James Thompson, chief financial officer, was that investors there were more sympathetic to growth opportunities in emerging markets. ''Though it is a smaller capital market than New York, AIM is much more globally focused.''
For some companies like HaloSource, the move to a foreign exchange may make longer term strategic sense as their growth shifts away from America to markets like China and India. Integrated Memory Logic's biggest suppliers of the wafers for its semiconductor chips and its biggest customers are in Asia -- so a listing in Taiwan raises its profile in a region that is already home to most of its corporate partners.
Another company, Samsonite, the luggage company that was founded in Denver in 1910 but shifted its corporate location to Luxembourg in 2009, now sees most of its growth coming from Asia. It plans a $1.5 billion offering in Hong Kong next week.
The attraction of an Asian listing will be underlined further this month when Prada, the Italian fashion house, lists its shares in an offering that could generate $2.5 billion, also in Hong Kong.
But while some companies see their foreign I.P.O. as a long-term move, others see it as an interim step, one that after further expansion could lead them to seek investor interest back home and a dual listing in the United States.
One reason Reva Medical chose Australia was that country's system of research hospitals that it intends to use for its clinical trials.
Mr. Stockman, the chief executive, also sits on the board of another company, HeartWare International, based in Massachusetts and Florida, that carried out an Australian I.P.O. in 2005, and then listed on Nasdaq in the United States in 2008.
In its Australian I.P.O., Reva sold stock to investors from Britain, Australia and Hong Kong, as well as America.
Mr. Stockman said two Wall Street investment banks told him there was no interest in an offering of the company in the United States. Instead, he found an underwriter, Inteq, in Australia. In the end, the cost of the Australian listing was $7 million, roughly what it would have cost Reva to list in the United States, he said.
One of the biggest costs was travel time and flights. He concedes that he would have preferred to list in the United States in the first place -- after all the traveling back and forth to Australia, and the long road show in Asia, the United States and Europe.
''All things being equal, it would have been easier,'' he said. ''It is a long way.''

HEADLINE: Girardi and Yankees' Top Pick Go Back a Long Way, a Lifetime to Be Exact

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
Joe Girardi says he got to know Dante Bichette in 1993, when both joined the Colorado Rockies, an expansion team. The Rockies lost 95 games and were outscored by more than 200 runs, and Girardi and Bichette were about as opposite as two players could get.
''He's more of a free spirit, and everybody knows how I am, so we don't need to go into that,'' Girardi, the rather intense manager of the Yankees, said with a chuckle Tuesday afternoon. 
But Girardi and Bichette became lasting friends. Girardi remembered Tuesday how Dante and Marianna Bichette would stay at his house when the Rockies played in Chicago. Girardi recalled how he would take Dante Jr., their infant son, for car rides to get him to fall asleep.
On Monday, the Yankees drafted Dante Bichette Jr., an 18-year-old third baseman from Maitland, Fla., with their first selection, the 51st overall pick. Girardi said the Yankees took Bichette because he was the best player available. But Girardi also said, ''I'm thrilled to death, because I've known this little guy for a long time.''
At 6 feet 1 inch, 215 pounds, Bichette is no longer such a little guy, but he has a history with Girardi. The Yankees and the Boston Red Sox have a history, too, but that did not stop the Red Sox from stepping into Bronx territory with their second-round draft pick.
With the 81st overall selection, the Red Sox drafted Williams Jerez, an outfielder from Brooklyn, who played recently for an amateur team known as Hank's Yanks, which is sponsored in part by Hank Steinbrenner.
Hank's Yanks were assembled by Ray Negron, the Yankees' community adviser, and his friend Herman Hernandez II as a way to give players ages 15 to 18 from varied socio-economic backgrounds a chance to be seen by major league scouts in the summer.
Negron was delighted with the Boston pick.
''He's a terrific player who will play in the major leagues, and a wonderful kid,'' Negron said Tuesday of Jerez, who played scholastically at Grand Street Campus in Brooklyn.
When asked if it bothered him that the Red Sox, the Yankees' bitter rival, took a player who got attention because of a project started by a Steinbrenner, Negron said, ''We got kids off the street playing baseball; that's what this was about.''
In the fourth round, the Yankees drafted another member of Hank's Yanks: Matt Duran, a shortstop from New Rochelle (N.Y.) High School who hit 10 home runs and nearly .600 in the scholastic season. Negron said the Yankees got the better player in Duran.
Bichette has committed to attend the University of Georgia, but he said he planned to turn professional as soon as possible, and not just to play for a manager whom he still calls Uncle Joe. (Bichette said, ''I think I'm going to have to stop that.'')
''It's the most prestigious club around,'' Bichette said in a conference call. ''I think there's nothing better than being a Yankee. You grow up as a little kid dreaming of being a Yankee, of hitting a home run in Yankee Stadium.''
Bichette's father, now 47, played 14 major league seasons, but none for the Yankees. Dante Bichette Jr. described his hitting style as pretty much the same as his father's. Dante Jr. hit .640 with 10 home runs in 30 games this year for Orangewood Christian School.
Bichette also played in the 2005 Little League World Series for a team from Maitland that also included Tanner Stanley, the son of the former major league catcher Mike Stanley.
''I've seen Junior basically working at this his whole life,'' Girardi said.
Girardi said he awoke Tuesday to text messages notifying him of the Yankees' pick. Before batting practice, he said he had talked to Dante Sr., but not to his son. Eighteen years seemed as if they had flown past.
''You think, 'This is the kid we drafted today, and it's the kid I was trying to get to sleep in that car seat,' '' Girardi said, smiling again.
INSIDE PITCH
Derek Jeter, who entered the day 14 hits shy of 3,000, batted leadoff for the Yankees against the Red Sox on Tuesday, but Joe Girardi used him as a designated hitter for the fifth time this season instead of at shortstop. Eduardo Nunez started at shortstop and batted ninth. Asked if he wanted to give Jeter an opportunity to reach 3,000 hits on a 10-game homestand, Girardi said: ''You can't physically wear him down or risk hurting him to do that. We're going to have to be smart about doing this. We're going to play it pretty much the same way we have all year long.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Fair Rewards of Invention

 BODY:
Before the Bayh-Dole Act was passed in 1980, the billions of federal dollars spent on scientific research rarely benefited the public through commercial applications. Fewer than 5 percent of government patents were licensed to industry. To push patents into practical use, the law set up a scheme for awarding the rights to institutions, like universities, that have incentive to bring inventions to market. 
Since 1980, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, has been granted control of 3,673 patents. A recent study found that companies started by M.I.T.'s graduates, faculty and staff generate annual world sales of $2 trillion.
In a 7-to-2 decision this week, the Supreme Court undermined the act's purpose by ruling that it does not automatically give a university title to an invention by a faculty member when the research is federally financed.
The case, Stanford University v. Roche Molecular Systems, involved a Stanford researcher who had transferred his rights to methods for testing AIDS treatments to a private company that was eventually acquired by Roche. Roche commercialized the procedure and incorporated it into H.I.V. test kits. Stanford sued Roche, arguing that the researcher's assignment of rights was invalid under the Bayh-Dole Act. The court held that even though the researcher may have had an obligation to the university, he had legally assigned his rights to the private firm.
Although the decision is based on a literal reading of a poorly drafted initial agreement between Stanford and the researcher, it is likely to have a broader effect. It could change the culture of research universities by requiring them to be far more vigilant in obtaining ironclad assignments from faculty members and monitoring any contracts between researchers and private companies. Relationships between the university and its faculty are likely to become more legalistic and more mercantile.
By stressing ''the general rule that rights in an invention belong to the inventor,'' the majority opinion of Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. romanticizes the role of the solo inventor. It fails to acknowledge the Bayh-Dole Act's importance in fostering collaborative enterprises and its substantial benefit to the American economy.

HEADLINE: In Santa Monica, Circumcision Opponent Abandons Efforts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The primary backer of an effort to get a ban on circumcision on the ballot in Santa Monica is abandoning her push, saying the proposed legislation had been misrepresented as an effort to impinge on religious freedom. A similar measure in San Francisco is scheduled for a fall vote. 
The woman, Jena Troutman, a mother of two boys who began the process of trying to get a ban on the Santa Monica municipal ballot in 2012, said the news media had distorted the effort.
''The religious opposition really rose up, and I never intended it to be about that at all,'' Ms. Troutman said. ''Ninety-five percent of babies who are circumcised have nothing to do with religion -- that's what I was focused on. Once I discovered this bill was not going to open up the conversation but was closing it down, I wanted no part of it.''
Ms. Troutman said she wanted to focus on educating parents through the Web site she runs, wholebabyrevolution.com.
In recent days, criticism of the two measures had focused on their author, Matthew Hess, who lives in San Diego and created an online comic called ''Foreskin Man,'' which features characters like ''Monster Mohel.'' Several organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League, said the comic relied on anti-Semitic imagery.
Mr. Hess defended the comic, saying it was intended to be from a baby's point of view. ''It was designed to really evoke a response that talking about studies and statistics never does,'' Mr. Hess said. ''What would that baby be thinking other than 'That man coming at me with a knife is a monster'?''
Mr. Hess said Tuesday that he was optimistic about the prospect of the ban passing in San Francisco.
Catherine Schneider, senior vice president of community engagement at the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, which had begun efforts to fight the plan, said she was relieved that the issue had been dropped in Santa Monica. But, she said, many leaders expect that similar efforts will crop up in other cities.
''It's scary to think that we would have had to launch a political campaign to maintain status quo,'' she said. ''To fight one of these campaigns, you need to raise around $500,000, and in this economy we can all think of better ways to spend that money.''

HEADLINE: Senate May Alter Law for Widows From Rig Blast

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Jason Anderson's death was both tragic and especially unlucky. Tragic, like the death of any man who leaves a widow and two young children. Unlucky because his life's end, with 10 other men in the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig last year, constituted death on the high seas, which under maritime law limits the recovery available to his widow in court.
Shelley Anderson, Jason's widow, has not yet filed suit against Transocean, the owner of the rig, or BP, the owner of the well, in part because any compensation she might be awarded would be limited by maritime statutes -- one of them 160 years old -- that protect ship owners and limit damages in cases concerning death on the high seas. 
''You don't get the same remedy if you're killed on water than if you're killed on land,'' said Ms. Anderson's lawyer, Ernest H. Cannon.
A court can compensate Ms. Anderson for direct economic loss for a death that occurs on the high seas, like her husband's estimated lifetime earnings, but not for the less tangible things like loss of care, comfort and companionship, as well as pain and suffering, that are a common part of suits concerning deaths on land.
Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, introduced the Deepwater Horizon Survivors' Fairness Act in January to address elements of the current laws that he called ''antiquated and unfair.'' The bill would amend the Shipowners Liability Act of 1851, the Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 and the Jones Act of 1920 to allow broader compensation for victims of the Deepwater Horizon blast.
''These widows and fatherless children should not lose financial support because of inequities in old and antiquated maritime laws,'' Mr. Rockefeller said.
The bill, which will be considered by the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday, was narrowed in scope from a version that passed the House last year but was opposed by maritime business interests and stalled in the Senate.
Congress has looked at the question of death at sea in the past: a bill exempting air passengers who die over water from the Death on the High Seas Act was passed by Congress in 2000, after the loss of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island. Like the Deepwater Horizon bill, the air passengers bill was made retroactive so it could cover the 1996 accident.
The new Deepwater Horizon bill only affects the specific victims of the blast, and negotiators have agreed to drop a provision that was unpopular in certain precincts of the legal community. That provision would allow those claiming death and disability to sue in state court and avoid the enormous federal action that has consolidated most of the cases related to the spill.
Ms. Anderson said she did not want her case to be ''lumped in'' with ''the guy who rents Sea-Doos on the beach in Florida'' claiming lost tourism revenues.
To Mr. Cannon, the chance to appear before sympathetic jurors in state court would mean getting much more for his clients than dealing with a federal judge juggling thousands of other cases. ''Who would not want these widows to get their day in court?'' he asked.
With that provision gone and the likelihood of the remainder of the bill's passage uncertain -- and considering the delays involved in any large-scale litigation -- many of those with death and disability claims are seeking to settle rather than to go to court. Six of the 11 death cases have been settled, either directly with the companies involved or through the $20 billion fund created by BP; those familiar with the terms have said that the payments have reached as much as $20 million apiece.
Many of the physical injury claims, too, are working their way through the fund. Tony Buzbee, a Houston lawyer, said he had reached settlements with the fund for two of his clients and would do so for more than a dozen others in the next week. Ultimately, all death and personal injury claims from the rig could total hundreds of millions of dollars.
Mr. Cannon said that even if he ultimately negotiated a settlement for Ms. Anderson, the Deepwater Horizon bill was important because it raised the range of what his client might receive.
The companies have approached the widows one by one, pledging to do right by them, Ms. Anderson said. But she said their efforts had seemed more like stalling than preparing an offer.
''Transocean people sat in my kitchen and said, 'Don't worry, Shelley -- we will take care of you.' '' But no offer has emerged, and Ms. Anderson said the wait for a final resolution of her losses was difficult for her and her children.
''I need the help now,'' she said. ''I don't need it when they can drive themselves and have their own jobs and their own families.''
Transocean issued a statement that said, ''From the first hours Transocean has focused on providing support for its employees and the families of those who were lost aboard the Deepwater Horizon, including continued full pay and benefits for eight months following the incident and professional counseling for those in need.''
BP declined to comment on the bill or the cases.
Courtney Kemp, whose husband, Wyatt Kemp, died on the rig, said she hoped Congress would pass the bill. ''If any of them had had someone killed the way we did,'' she said, ''they would want the law changed.''

HEADLINE: A Gold Rush, Deep in a City's Sewers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and YASIR GHAZI

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Deep below the workshops in Baghdad's cramped, run-down jewelry district, unemployed men spend their days scouring the city's sewer system for the one thing they say can bring them money: flakes of gold.
Several times a month, men desperate for an income descend as far as 15 feet into the dark in search of gold bits that have been washed down the drain by craftsmen cleaning up after a day of etching and molding jewelry. With a flashlight in hand and a mask to help with the stench, they spend hours combing through the thick muck, reaching in with their bare hands to pluck out glints of gold. On a good day, the men say they collect enough to earn about $20 from a smelter, which sells reconstituted blocks of gold back to the same jewelers whose pipes seed the sewers. 
''Because it's disgusting and dirty,'' said Ali Mohammad Freji, 30, ''I do not tell my family what I do because I'm embarrassed.''
Mr. Freji is among a group of about a dozen men who search for gold on a daily basis. Their plight illustrates the larger problems that still exist in Iraq's economy eight years after the American invasion. Despite the billions of dollars spent by the United States and other countries to try to rebuild the country's infrastructure and buoy its economy, there are still too few jobs, with as many as 40 percent of the work force either unemployed or reliant on part-time work.
But the jewelry district is the one place where the wealth has trickled down, literally, from the jewelry shops to the sewers.
''Thank God for everything we got. It's a small thing that nobody cares about, but it means a lot to me,'' said Abbas Abdul-Razzaq, 30, who searches the sewers for gold.
The men search about eight sewers once a month. When they are not underground, they sweep the streets of the jewelry district in search of gold dust that has been created in the process of making the jewelry. The men accumulate cigarette butts, food wrappers and dirt from inside and outside the shops. Then, beside a rusty boat on the shores of the Tigris River, they use water to sift through the trash until their pans are full of gold dust and small pieces of the precious metal.
''The gold shop owners work with the gold and then clean up and wash their hands, and the little pieces flow down to the pipes here,'' Mr. Freji said. ''The gold collects in the sewers, but the dust goes with the water into the river.''
Although the price of gold has skyrocketed in recent years, the men here said they were making less money because of reverberations from the war and advances in technology in jewelry making.
After the United States invaded Iraq in 2003 and years of sectarian war ensued, many of the city's jewelers fled, leaving a void in jewelry production.
With few tariffs on imports, cheaper and better designed jewelry from the United Arab Emirates and Turkey flooded into Iraq, making it difficult for the remaining jewelers to compete with the imports.
''Before, we considered ourselves lucky because there are so many workshops,'' Mr. Freji said. ''The government's policy of not having tariffs hurts us because there are no longer many gold shops.''
Now the only workshops that remain do special requests, like engraving.
''I only sell imported jewelry because people would rather buy it, because it has the best designs,'' said Mohammad Hashim, 46, a shop owner. ''There are catalogs for the imported jewelry and television ads for the companies producing it.''
Those remaining goldsmiths rely on more efficient machinery, and fewer flecks are washing into the sewers.
''Whenever there's a new technology for making jewelry we are hurt because modern tools don't create lots of dust,'' said Mr. Freji, who said he has been trying to get a job with the government since 2008. He said he even paid a bribe to a government official several years ago in the hopes of becoming a police officer, but nothing came of it.
The work of sifting through sewage is dirty, smelly, and not surprisingly the men said they hated it. Their feet and hands are irritated from spending so much time in water, and their legs ache from squatting on the shores of the river to sift through their pans. In the winter, the cold water makes them shiver.
''I wish I could find another job,'' said Mr. Abdul-Razzaq. ''I'd take any job -- anything, I just want a permanent job.''
''Maybe when we get older it will affect our health,'' he said.
Ibrahim Youssef, 25, said he became envious when he saw ads for gold on television.
''In France and Germany there are these big factories of gold, and I think about how much money I could make there by just cleaning up,'' Mr. Youssef said. ''Those people are not smart because they are not going through the garbage and dust. Nobody cares about their dust.
''I see reports in Brazil of people who go to natural gold mines and just take big pieces and don't take the small ones. I feel sad because we are looking for small ones. We could make so much money there.''

HEADLINE: Borrowing By Consumers Increased 3.1% in April

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer borrowing rose by nearly $7.2 billion in April, fueled by greater demand for school and auto loans, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. 
The increase, of 3.1 percent, pushed consumer borrowing to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $2.43 trillion, just above the nearly four-year low of $2.39 trillion, reached in September.
But a category that measures credit card use fell for the second time in three months. It has risen only twice since August 2008.
The overall report includes auto loans, student loans and credit cards, but it excludes mortgages and other loans tied to real estate. The Fed will give a more complete picture of Americans' debt on Thursday, when it issues a report on household net worth.
Households began borrowing less and saving more to cope with the recession that officially ended in June 2009. Credit card use has fallen nearly 19 percent in the last 20 months and has dropped 5 percent in the last year.
Overall borrowing has increased in recent months. Analysts say the reason for the increase is also a reflection of the weak economy: the gains have been driven by more people borrowing money to attend school.
High unemployment, steep gas prices and a weakening housing market have also forced people to resist reaching for their plastic.
''When you take out student loans, you're still seeing credit card use, and borrowing over all, falling,'' said Paul Dales, chief United States economist at Capital Economics. ''That's a sign about how people view the economy.''
Most economists say borrowing will increase this year. But they do not expect consumers to increase their debt.

HEADLINE: Rain Helps Ease Drought In China

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Xiyun Yang contributed research.

 BODY:
NANJING, China -- Heavy rains since last Friday have brought some relief from the worst drought in the Yangtze River region in 50 years, but also caused flooding in at least two southern provinces, state news organizations reported Tuesday.
The six-month drought had resulted in water shortages for 3.5 million people. With the rains, that number has dropped to 2.15 million, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. The amount of farmland affected by the drought has dropped by 3.68 million acres, to 5.68 million. 
Flooding has occurred in parts of the provinces of Guizhou and Hunan. In Guizhou, at least nine people were killed and 13 others were missing, and 60,000 people had to be evacuated from their homes. Economic losses, mostly because of flooded farmland, were estimated at $26 million, China Daily reported.
Despite the rains, the central government is urging local officials to continue with relief efforts because the levels of many major lakes, rivers and reservoirs in central China remain low.
Here in Jiangsu Province, one of China's economic powerhouses, rain is still scarce. From Friday to Monday, only a tenth of an inch of rain fell, much less than the 3 inches that fell in Jiangxi Province during the same period. Water levels remain low along the section of the Yangtze running past the former national capital of Nanjing, where a famous 525-foot-long bridge completed by Chinese engineers in 1968 spans the river.
The drought's severe impact on rich agricultural land and on the Yangtze, the country's most important river for shipping, has raised politically delicate questions about China's most ambitious water and energy projects. In recent weeks, some Chinese news organizations have run stories asking whether the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydroelectric project, could be worsening the effects of the drought downstream from its location in the middle of the Yangtze.
Last week, Shanghai Daily ran an article quoting a water official saying that the dam's planners had failed to properly gauge the dam's environmental impact. Two of China's largest freshwater lakes, Dongting in Hunan and Poyang in Jiangxi Province, both connected to the Yangtze, have suffered from lower water levels in part because of the storage of water in the reservoir behind the Three Gorges Dam, the report said. In May, senior officials in Beijing released a vaguely worded statement saying there were ''urgent problems'' associated with the impact of the dam.
Some Chinese are even pointing to the dam as a direct cause of the drought. Jay S. Famiglietti, director of the University of California's Center for Hydrologic Modeling, based in Irvine, said in an e-mail that Chinese water officials and scientists he had met with on a recent trip to China seemed very concerned that this belief had become widespread, despite there being ''absolutely no causal link''.
''At virtually every stop we heard that the general population is blaming the dam for the drought, or more generally, for any anomalous weather events,'' he said. ''The management at Three Gorges was particularly sensitive to these claims.''
The drought has also raised questions about the wisdom of a plan by Chinese leaders to transfer at least six trillion gallons of water each year via canals from the Yangtze River and its tributaries to cities in the parched north. Critics of the $62 billion project, called the South-North Water Diversion, point out that the Yangtze region is increasingly afflicted by droughts, and so precious water should not be sent north. On Saturday, the water level at Danjiangkou Reservoir in Hubei Province, the starting point of the middle channel of the project, was more than 26 feet lower than average, Xinhua reported.
Last week, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited the reservoir in Hubei and the two large freshwater lakes in Hunan and Jiangxi, Xinhua reported. Afterward, he told officials at a seminar in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, to push forward with drought relief because it was ''key to maintaining stable and rapid economic growth in the country.'' Farmers in drought-stricken areas would get subsidies from the central government, he said.
The slowdown in shipping along the Yangtze has caused economic distress for some businesses and hampered critical industries. For example, ships carrying coal down the Yangtze have sometimes been forced to carry less coal because of the low water levels, according to a report last Friday by China Business News. Electricity plants that use coal are scattered all along the Yangtze, and the drought has worsened electricity shortages that had already been afflicting some provinces.

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: The Way America Eats

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Hooked on Meat,'' by Mark Bittman (column, June 2): 
The other day, I asked the manager of our local chain grocery store why we were offered only Peruvian asparagus in the springtime. Remember when fresh, locally grown asparagus would come in? No longer. Why eat produce that has no flavor? Why not go next door and grab a salty, fatty burger in a bag? It's so much easier.
Why do we eat so much meat? Mr. Bittman has some strong answers: evolutionary psychology, convenience and propaganda posing as marketing. Might we add all the misinformed diets promoting proteins while vilifying grains and carbohydrates?
Why does the whole world want to eat like us?
Doesn't it know that our American diet is killing us and our economy? Health care skyrockets out of control mainly because we have no convenient access to fresh produce and tasty, humanely raised meat products.
Americans want to eat the good stuff, but it must be readily available. We're busy and misinformed.
JANE McCLAREN Southern Pines, N.C., June 6, 2011
The writer is the author of ''Honest Eating.''
Editors' Note: With this letter, we continue a feature in which we invite readers to respond to an interesting letter, in hopes of spurring a dialogue.

HEADLINE: 2 Hoteliers Form Partnerships To Enhance Luxury Image

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
TWO of the world's largest hotel companies are reaching out to other industries to establish partnerships that they hope will help their luxury brands continue their recovery.
At a reception at Christie's in New York on Tuesday, Marriott International announced ''strategic partnerships'' with Christie's; Tumi; Keri Glassman, a nutritionist; Aromatherapy Associates; and Treasury Wine Estates, as part of a brand initiative to deliver ''a deeper luxury guest experience'' at JW Marriott hotels worldwide.
In April, Hilton Worldwide announced a ''luxury manifesto'' involving video interviews with executives it calls ''industry influencers'' in the retail, fashion, publishing and culinary fields. It is posting these on the Facebook pages of its Waldorf Astoria and Conrad brands, and basing policies and services on executives' comments.
As the luxury hotel segment ''emerges somewhat from the recession, it is looking for ways to enhance the luxury experience that do not involve spending money on the plant, or on increasing staff,'' said Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. ''These could be nontraditional ways, including tie-ins with luxury products that have an image value or the potential for guest service enhancement.'' 
According to Smith Travel Research, revenue per available room for United States luxury hotels reached a peak of $204.68 in 2007, then fell 5.4 percent in 2008 and a far steeper 23.2 percent in 2009. Mr. Hanson said that represents the greatest decline the segment has experienced.
Although revenue per available room for luxury hotels jumped 8.9 percent last year and is expected to rise an additional 10 percent this year, Mr. Hanson says he does not expect it will fully recover to 2007 levels until possibly 2014.
Although Smith Travel Research said demand for luxury hotels in the United States rose 12 percent last year, Mr. Hanson said much of that was because of discount rates. He also said demand had been significantly outstripped by growth in supply, up 20 percent from 2008 through 2010.
Such growth is one reason Marriott has created the JW Marriott partnership program: Marriott is opening three such hotels this year and six next year, mostly in Asia and the Middle East. When 13 more planned for completion by 2015 open, the 27-year-old brand will have 77 hotels in 29 countries, 65 percent abroad.
Also driving the partnership, said Mitzi Gaskins, vice president of JW Marriott, is ''some confusion'' by guests between the more downscale Marriott and JW Marriott brands. (The company's most upscale brand is Ritz-Carlton.)
''We're making an effort to drive awareness among luxury consumers. One way is through our partnerships,'' she said. ''We want to align ourselves with people in a space relevant to our consumers. Our goal is offer unique experiences and knowledge to our guests.''
Executives of the partner companies will provide information about their areas of expertise to JW Marriott customers, through content on the brand's revamped Web site and in a new in-room quarterly magazine.
Christie's is displaying works it will auction at JW Marriott hotels and this week it will show Beatles photographs at the JW Marriott Grosvenor House London. Christie's also is creating city guides for hotel guests in six cities. And Aromatherapy is developing a signature scent, spa treatments and bath amenities for the brand.
Marriott, which manages or franchises JW Marriott hotels but does not own them, is spending $500,000 on the partnership program, which is to last two years, Ms. Gaskins said.
John T. A. Vanderslice, global head of luxury brands for Hilton Worldwide, said he had come up with the ''luxury manifesto'' to learn about ''the changing face'' of the luxury market ''from its respected leaders.'' It is ''experiencing a reincarnation postrecession, but no one single vision of luxury has emerged,'' he said.
Executives he has interviewed for the Facebook videos include the designer Tommy Hilfiger , the restaurateur Danny Meyer, and Stephen I. Sadove, chief executive and chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue. Conversations with them and others have inspired Hilton to revise its staff training and to offer ''transformational experiences'' to guests, like gladiator training at the Rome Cavalieri, and dog sledding at the Waldorf Astoria in Park City, Utah. Mr. Vanderslice declined to disclose the cost of Hilton's program.
There are 24 Waldorf Astoria hotels, with nine in development, while there are 16 Conrads, with 17 in development. Hilton, which describes Conrad as its ''global contemporary luxury brand,'' manages all but one of both brands' hotels, and owns the original Waldorf-Astoria .
The two marketing efforts are getting mixed reviews from industry observers.
Steven Kent, lodging analyst for Goldman Sachs, said the JW Marriott brand is particularly important to its parent, ''because its larger boxes and lots of rooms'' have a greater impact than Marriott's average hotel on company operations.
Marriott, he said, is aiming to shift ''JW Marriott into the higher end of upscale travel. Any affiliation'' with other luxury companies that ''it puts into consumers' psyche is helpful,'' he said.
Andrew Sacks, president of Agency Sacks, a New York branding and marketing agency for the affluent market, said if the partnerships are ''superficial, don't add a lot of value, don't have substance, the customer will see through them.'' He called the JW Marriott initiative ''a nice way to bring consistency to a disparate product,'' while he said Hilton's videos ''make sense, because they implicitly show an understanding of what business people desire,'' a wish to learn.
Henry Harteveldt, travel analyst for Forrester Research, said that if consumers do not feel the partners ''are a credible luxury provider, or they had a negative experience with them, there's the risk of a negative association for the hotel.''
''The last thing'' Marriott or Hilton ''want to do is to be perceived as the hospitality industry's Marie Antoinette, advertising a somewhat lavish product line while a lot of other people are suffering in this economy,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 14, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The advertising column on Wednesday, about hotel companies forming partnerships to enhance their luxury brands, misstated the name of the Hilton hotel chain. It is Hilton Worldwide, not Hilton International, which was its name when the company was public. Because of an editing error, the column also misstated the location and timing of art auctions that are one element of a partnership between the auction house Christie's and JW Marriott hotels. Works of art that Christie's is displaying at the hotels, including the JW Marriott Marquis Miami, will be auctioned elsewhere later; they were not auctioned at the Miami hotel last December.

HEADLINE: Historic Illinois Mall Seeks New Life as Main St.

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF

 BODY:
MOUNT PROSPECT, Ill. -- Like many people approaching their 50th birthday, the Randhurst Mall is having a little work done.
Randhurst, which opened in this inner-ring Chicago suburb in 1962, was the first enclosed mall in the Chicago area and, for a brief period, the largest enclosed mall in the world. The original architect was Victor Gruen, a Viennese immigrant with a socialist bent who, improbably, became the father of the modern enclosed mall.
Now, after a long period of decline, Randhurst is undergoing a $190 million overhaul that involves demolishing most of the original center and replacing it with an open-air street of shops and additional anchor tenants. The developer is Casto Lifestyle Properties of Sarasota, Fla.
''Our approach is to look for good real estate that has the wrong real estate product and that's often the case with 40-year-old malls,'' said Brett Hutchens, the president and chief executive of Casto Lifestyle Properties. 
The new anchors include an AMC multiplex as well as a 120-room Hampton Inn and Suites hotel. In addition, the shopping street will include about 22,000 square feet of rentable second-floor office space.
The renovation at Randhurst is another sign of an end of an era in retailing that began in 1956 when Gruen -- then in his late 40s after having been a store designer in New York and Los Angeles -- unveiled Southdale Mall in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina.
Southdale consisted of two department stores at either end of an enclosed two-level retail arcade with a large public ''garden court'' with plantings, sculpture, a fishpond, a cafe and a 21-foot-high aviary.
M. Jeffrey Hardwick, Gruen's biographer, said the garden court was central to the architect's theories about retailing. ''He believed that if you can keep people at the mall, if you entertain them long enough, they'll eventually spend money,'' Mr. Hardwick said.
Over the course of his long career, Gruen designed over 80 malls and shopping centers, including Northland and Eastland outside of Detroit; South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Calif.; and Cherry Hill Mall in New Jersey. In the process, he defined suburban shopping for the baby boom generation.
Randhurst Mall, built six years after Southdale, included three department stores as well as a garden court with a ''floating restaurant'' surrounded by 20-foot-tall palm trees. The court was topped by a flying-saucerlike concrete dome that became a local landmark.
The cost was $21.5 million. At one million square feet, Randhurst was then the largest enclosed mall ever built.
''It had this mod-'60s design that was really breathtaking,'' said Gregory T. Peerbolte, the author of ''Randhurst: Suburban Chicago's Grandest Shopping Center,'' a new book on the mall. ''It was the biggest thing that ever happened in Mount Prospect.''
The mall also had an indispensable cold-war accessory, an underground bomb shelter large enough to accommodate all of Mount Prospect's 18,000-plus residents.
Randhurst dominated shopping in the area for the next decade before being overtaken by the even larger -- four anchors, two million square feet of space -- Woodfield Mall in nearby Schaumburg in 1971.
By the early 2000s, Randhurst was down to one anchor tenant and a handful of specialty stores.
During this period, mall management approved the construction of several freestanding big box stores like Costco and Home Depot along the perimeter of the 100-acre property. These stores are unaffected by the redevelopment.
The redeveloped center, which has been renamed Randhurst Village, essentially reverses Gruen's concept while embracing his notion of shopping malls as community centers.
Larry Beame, president of Beame Architectural Partnership in Coconut Grove, Fla., the designer of the new center, said the goal was to create ''a traditional Main Street shopping experience'' with diagonal parking in front of the various storefronts and outdoor public spaces for dining and socializing.
The bomb shelter has been converted into underground parking for the new Hampton Inn and Suites hotel.
The new AMC Theater, which replaced an older AMC movie house, opened in April and has 12 screens and digital sound and projection.
The rest of the shopping center, about 800,000 square feet total, will open in phases over the next year.
Christina Sternberg, senior vice president of domestic development for AMC Entertainment, said the area's demographics helped to explain the company's decision to invest in a new theater at a mall that seemed at the end of its life cycle. ''We feel there's a population density there, there's affluence and a market opportunity that wasn't being filled by our existing offering,'' she said.
The redevelopment of Randhurst reflects a number of retail trends under way for much of the last decade but accelerated by the recession.
Development of ''enclosed regional malls,'' as the sector is known, boomed in the 1980s and '90s, with the peak year being 1990, when 19 major centers were completed. But construction has slowed sharply over the last decade. Since 2006 only one major enclosed mall, City Center in Las Vegas, has been completed in the United States.
The slowdown has been due to cultural and demographic shifts in the nation's population, said Ellen Dunham-Jones, a professor of architecture at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a co-author of ''Retrofitting Suburbia: Urban Design Solutions for Redesigning Suburbs.'' Changes include a reduction in the number of suburban households with children and an increase in empty-nester households.
Raymond T. Cirz, chief executive of Integra Realty Resources, a New York company that specializes in real estate valuation and appraisal, described malls as a ''mature concept'' and said he expected only ''selective development of enclosed malls in the future.''
''I see a fair amount of 'de-malling' taking place,'' similar to what has happened at Randhurst, he added. ''It's mainly centers that have antiquated design but good locations relative to the demographics of the trade area.''
Another factor in the decline of enclosed malls is that they are more expensive to develop and operate than open-air ''lifestyle centers.''
''Malls have to be heated and air-conditioned and cleaned and maintained,'' said Paul Vogel, a retail real estate consultant based in Chicago, ''and these costs are passed on to the tenants. The square-foot charge for an open-air center is probably 30 percent cheaper.''
And even in cold climates like the Chicago area, open-air centers are popular with both parents and their children because the experience is seen as an outdoor activity rather than merely shopping, Ms. Dunham-Jones said.
''To the degree that shopping is perceived as a leisure activity,'' she said, ''both groups like to tie that in with outdoor time.''
Would Victor Gruen approve? ''I think so,'' Mr. Hardwick said. ''He was always out to please and attract American consumers. If this is a better mousetrap, he would be in favor of it.''

HEADLINE: An Unexpected Trend Toward Office Sublets

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
Six months ago, when the law firm Venable began a search for a permanent home in New York, it did not end up moving far. Venable, based in Baltimore, had been subletting 52,000 square feet at 1270 Avenue of the Americas. With the agreement about to expire, it decided to stay on and sign a direct lease with its landlord, Tishman Speyer, for the same space.
Venable is one of a number of major tenants that have recently converted sublease space into direct leases, a trend that is being driven by the tightening commercial real estate market.
Conventional wisdom holds that subleasing -- in which tenants vacate their offices before the end of their lease and rent it to another tenant at a discount -- has a negative impact on the market. Landlords must compete against the lower rents, while tenants bristle at the restrictive terms that often are a part of a sublease. 
But the industry perspective is now shifting. Tenants are embracing subleases as a means of locking in below-market rents, while landlords, who are facing fewer vacancies, are using it to attract tenants and then converting the leases into direct deals when the subleases expire.
''Landlords don't usually like the fact that sublease space rents for less, and tenants don't like that the leases offer little flexibility,'' said Moshe Sukenik, an executive vice president and principal at Newmark Knight Frank who represented Venable. ''But there is a silver lining that can result in a win-win for everyone involved.''
Over the last 18 months, the availability of sublease space has sharply contracted. As of April, the inventory in Manhattan over all, as measured in square feet, was down nearly 40 percent compared with October 2009, according to data from Newmark Knight Frank. Downtown recorded a 40 percent drop, while in Midtown, it was 35 percent. In the Midtown south area, that figure was close to 47 percent.
''We are going to see the sublease space that is still available be rapidly absorbed,'' said Mark A. Jaccom, the chief executive of the tristate region for Colliers International. He said he was working with four tenants now in sublease space in Midtown that were negotiating to convert their agreements into direct leases.
Steven M. Durels, an executive vice president and the director of leasing and real property at the SL Green Realty Corporation, said: ''When doing these kinds of deals, we do not have to contribute any money to tenant improvements and we don't have to offer any free rent'' to the sublease tenants. ''The inducement to the new tenant is embedded in the economics of the sublease, while for us, we eventually get full market rent with no transaction costs.''
Another method by which sublease space is being reduced is through buyouts, where tenants who want to leave before their lease expires can pay a fee to the landlord, who then re-lets the space, ideally at a higher rent. SL Green, a real estate investment trust, employed this strategy at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, where it is the landlord. Bank of America wanted to vacate two floors before its lease expired, but rather than subleasing the space, it paid SL Green a fee to be free of its lease obligation. SL Green then re-let the space, including 27,712 square feet on the second floor of the building to Ally Financial and 24,692 square feet on the 24th floor to the News Corporation. As a result, Mr. Durels said, ''we were paid a buyout fee and were able to rent out the spaces at higher rents than what Bank of America had been paying us.''
''A few years ago, when we had higher vacancy rates, there wasn't much of an incentive to get involved in sublease deals,'' said Dennis Friedrich, the president and chief executive of United States commercial operations for Brookfield Office Properties. ''Now that vacancy rates are much lower, we are helping existing sublease tenants convert their leases into direct deals.'' Brookfield recently converted a 175,000-square-foot sublease with Commerzbank and a 250,000-square-feet sublease with OppenheimerFunds at 2 World Financial Center into long-term direct leases.
Such deals can be economical for tenants. The online high-end clearinghouse Gilt Groupe recently signed a direct 10-year lease at 2 Park Avenue after subletting space at the building for two years, doubling its offices to 100,000 square feet.
''We had a great deal on the sublease space -- it was roughly a 75 percent discount to the market rents because the term was so short,'' said Melanie Hughes, the chief human resources executive at Gilt Groupe. And even though Gilt is facing a rent increase by signing a direct lease for the space, ''there were several compelling reasons for staying here instead of moving somewhere new,'' Ms. Hughes said.
Among them: Employees had grown comfortable in the space, and there were low costs associated with any build-out since the offices came equipped with furniture from the previous tenant, Yahoo. Gilt had also already established a good working relationship with the landlord and was comfortable with the level of service at the building.
But some executives say they believe that, from a landlord's perspective, encouraging subleasing is not good business. ''Sublease space degrades the value of a building because it always rents for cheaper,'' said Mitchell Arkin, an executive director of Cushman & Wakefield. ''No owner that I have ever worked for has thought that subleasing at a lower rent is better than signing a direct lease.''
During this downturn, however, sublease space may have proved to be somewhat less of a drag on the market. That is because there has been less of it, said James Delmonte, a vice president and director of research for the New York office of Jones Lang LaSalle. During the last downturn, sublease space peaked at 45 percent of the overall available Class A space in Midtown in 2002. This time, it peaked at just 35 percent.
''So in previous downturns, landlords couldn't raise rents because they had to stay competitive with sublease availability,'' Mr. Delmonte said. ''But this time around, there isn't as much sublease space, so landlords are raising rents more readily.''
Venable, the law firm, said a sublease-to-direct-lease transaction was the perfect fit. When the original deal was signed in October 2007, the firm had been in New York for only a handful of years, and ''a sublease was a nice way to be conservative about our growth options while still committed to a presence here,'' said Edmund M. O'Toole, the partner in charge of the New York office for Venable.
While the five-year sublease from the law firm Seyforth Shaw was for the 24th through 26th floors, the new, 10-year direct lease extends the offices into part of the 27th floor, for a total of nearly 62,000 square feet.
Tishman Speyer, Venable's landlord at 1270 Avenue of the Americas, is providing the firm with two floors of temporary space while its offices undergo the multimillion-dollar renovation, which is expected to be complete by the end of November.

HEADLINE: Enjoying the Quiet Pleasures of a Meeting of Minds

BYLINE: By NATE CHINEN

 BODY:
Vinicius Cantuaria and Bill Frisell sat facing the audience, but angled toward each other, throughout their calmly transfixing show at the Highline Ballroom on Monday night. Each cradled a guitar -- nylon-string acoustic for Mr. Cantuaria, electric for Mr. Frisell -- and both often had slight smiles on their faces, the sort of expression you might wear while hearing an old friend tell a fondly half-remembered tale. The setting was sparse, but the performance, part of the Blue Note Jazz Festival, conveyed a sense of fullness. 
It lasted about 90 minutes and drew mainly from ''Lagrimas Mexicanas'' (E1), the album that Mr. Cantuaria and Mr. Frisell released early this year. Produced by Lee Townsend, it's a casually refined collaboration that takes advantage of both musicians' versatility. In addition to guitar and vocals, Mr. Cantuaria plays overdubbed hand percussion; Mr. Frisell plays acoustic and electric guitars and tends to an array of sampled loops. At times it sounds as if they're working with a band.
That wasn't the case in the show, and it turned out to be a good thing. Mr. Cantuaria played his guitar without a pickup, using an external microphone and no discernible effects. Mr. Frisell flirted with some looping and occasionally used an octave pedal, but in both cases he exercised a scrupulous subtlety. Their roles were consistent: Mr. Cantuaria sang and finger-picked a rhythmic scaffolding, while Mr. Frisell improvised light filigree, elevating the songs with his economical phrasing and softly glowing tone.
Mr. Cantuaria originally comes from Brazil, but he has lived in New York awhile, and ''Lagrimas Mexicanas'' (''Mexican Tears'') is his nod to the city's Spanish-speaking cultural mix. The album's title track inspired the liveliest digressions from both guitarists, and the longest lead-in before the vocals. ''Aquela Mulher,'' an early highlight of the show, touched on aspects of Cuban son. ''Lagrimas de Amor'' was more delicate but no less focused, with a coordinated guitar line and a barely audible atmospheric buzz deployed by Mr. Frisell.
Still, a few of the more gratifying moments revolved around Brazil, the source of Mr. Cantuaria's main sustenance. This included a reverential cover of Antonio Carlos Jobim's bossa nova standard ''Vivo Sonhando,'' sung in the introspective but self-assured style of Joao Gilberto; and ''Quase Choro,'' a ballad with an intriguing chord progression, from one of Mr. Cantuaria's solo albums.
Mr. Frisell played as beautifully on those songs as on the material from ''Lagrimas Mexicanas,'' meshing easily with his partner and ducking in and out of step with the syncopations. On the album this muted sensitivity can feel a bit too tasteful, and ultimately lulling. Here in its barest form, it was a kind of seduction.

HEADLINE: Despite Liability Worries, Serving at the Top Has Little Risk

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer at Shearman & Sterling, is a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
They are paid millions, but some complain that it's no longer worth it.
These men and women argue that, as corporate directors and officers, they have too much chance of liability for a company's operations. Because of this, they claim, the risks of serving as a director or officer have become too great, and it will become harder to recruit and retain competent directors and officers. But the truth is that they have about the same chance of being held liable for their poor management of a public firm as they have of being struck by lightning.
The day-to-day management of a company is largely regulated by state law. Since most companies are incorporated in Delaware, this means Delaware law. And Delaware law on this matter sets an extremely high standard for finding directors and officers liable for a company's mismanagement. A Delaware court is not going to find them liable no matter how stupid their decisions are. Instead, a Delaware court will find them liable only if they intentionally acted wrongfully or were so oblivious that it was essentially the same thing. 
Under this standard, a Delaware court recently refused to hold Citigroup's board accountable for its decision to enter the subprime mortgage market, a decision that resulted in billions of dollars in losses and the company's near failure. The boards of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers are also scot-free so far.
And only last week the board and management of Massey Energy won a case in Delaware Chancery Court that would make it significantly more difficult for them to be held liable for their ostensible poor oversight of the company's safety practices that led to the Upper Big Branch mine explosion and the death of 29 men.
Even if there is liability or a settlement, it is almost always covered by insurance of directors and officers. One study found that from 1980 to 2006, there were only two instances of directors of a company incorporated in Delaware being required to personally pay for their misconduct.
One of those involved litigation against the board of Fuqua Enterprises. The Fuqua directors had the unfortunate luck to be insured by Reliance Enterprises, which went bankrupt. They paid an undisclosed portion of a $7 million settlement.
The other known personal-liability case involved the sale in 1980 of the TransUnion Corporation. The 10 TransUnion directors paid a total of $1.35 million. There you have it, no more than $8.35 million in personal payments by directors over more than 26 years.
There can also be liability for board members and executive managers under federal law. These are largely securities fraud cases where the directors or officers make a misstatement or omission.
This has nothing to do with the oversight of the company, but often there are misstatements about accounting or the company's financial condition. Instances of personal liability for officers and directors in these cases are only a bit less rare, again because the standards are high and insurance often covers the matter.
The same study found only nine cases where a director was held personally liable for securities fraud in a 26-year period. Three of these were highly notable, Enron, WorldCom and Tyco.
And no directors from the financial crisis have yet been found liable under these laws. Officers are faring just as well, and the only prominent payment was by Angelo R. Mozilo of Countrywide Financial Corporation. He paid $22.5 million of a $73 million fine. The rest was paid by Bank of America. Meanwhile, the fines of David Sambol, Countrywide's former president, and Eric P. Sieracki, the ex-chief financial officer, were paid in full by Bank of America.
The only financial crisis case to go to trial, involving officers of BankAtlantic, had its jury verdict finding civil liability overturned by the judge. And unlike with Enron and WorldCom, it seems there will be no criminal cases involving securities fraud stemming from the financial crisis.
What about the Dodd-Frank financial reform, you might ask? It doesn't change much. The main provision concerning the personal liability of officers and directors involves systemically important financial institutions, or the ''too big to fail'' entities. And if one fails, Dodd-Frank authorizes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to claw back two years of compensation from those held substantially responsible for the failure.
This is a weak penalty. An economically important bank with hundreds of billions of dollars in assets fails, and the penalty is only two years of pay? Nonetheless, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and a number of other industry groups objected to the F.D.I.C.'s proposed rules on this requirement. The financial industry groups again argue that such a standard will drive away directors and officers as well as make it harder to recruit these people.
This is laughable. First, we've already seen that liability for boards and management is extremely rare. Moreover, many of the directors of Lehman and Bear Stearns continue to serve on other boards, and one Lehman director, Jerry A. Grundhofer, has apparently been so chastened about the liability issue surrounding large banks that he is serving on the Citigroup board.
More telling, there is no empirical evidence whatsoever supporting this argument. Instead, you have the occasional self-serving statements by officers and directors that they are resigning because of ''liability'' reasons. Officers in particular like to say that they are taking a company private for this reason. But more often than not, it is because there is more money in being private.
This is not to say that it has not become more difficult to be a director or officer. Regulation has certainly increased. So has scrutiny. This has made the work of being a director or officer of a public company harder and more time-consuming. And yes, if a company declares bankruptcy, these people will lose a lot of their investment and may in rare circumstances have to pay back some of their salary.
But is that too much to ask? According to a recent study by Equilar for The New York Times, the median salary of a chief executive at the top 200 major companies was $9.6 million last year. Salaries for chief financial officers at companies listed on the S.&P. 500-stock index shot up last year by 26.1 percent, according to Equilar, and the median salary is now $3 million.
The prominent law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz recently issued a memorandum calling for director salaries to increase because of the increased burdens on this position. Outside director salaries average about $200,000 for Fortune 500 companies, according to Tower Watson.
The upside of serving as a director or officer thus appears huge. The downside is very limited. Yes, there will be increased regulation to comply with and some of it may even be unjustified, but that conflates liability with regulation. Remind directors and officers of this the next time they complain about the risk they are taking because of their jobs.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: O.A.S. Promises to Tackle Drug Trafficking and Crime

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
SAN SALVADOR -- Goaded by what they say are extraordinary levels of violence, the Central American nations and their allies are moving closer to a transnational strategy to attack drug trafficking and organized crime.
The Organization of American States -- which concluded its annual meeting here on Tuesday, with ''citizen security'' as its theme -- promised to help develop a plan to guide the broader effort.
At the same time, diplomats continued to lay the ground work for a regional meeting in Guatemala on June 22 and 23 involving the Central American nations, Colombia, Mexico and the United States. That meeting is expected to generate agreements among several nations and develop a multimillion-dollar investment from international donors. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to attend, State Department officials said. 
Officials from the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank also are set to attend, a reflection of the concerns in the business community over the increasing violence and its economic costs.
The track record in getting governments in the region to share resources and information has been spotty, and several diplomats said any concrete action might depend on the United States jump-starting the process -- at a time when the Obama administration is focused on other regions that are a higher national security priority and the State Department's chief diplomat for Latin America is preparing to leave for academia.
Nonetheless, the severity of the violence in Central America, which the United Nations has called among the worst in any corner of the world that is not in a war zone, is pushing the nations to the table in a way they have not been before, said Ennio Rodriguez, the Central America specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank.
''We are not being romantic about it,'' he said. ''Building trust is not going to be easy for governments of different political standpoints. But a trusting platform is being developed.''
Central America has some of the highest murder rates in the world, brought on in part by transnational drug traffickers that are pushing an increased amount of narcotics through the region and expanding into kidnapping, extortion and money laundering.
Last month, 27 people -- farmworkers and their families -- were massacred in northern Guatemala near the Mexican border, an attack that the authorities blamed on one of Mexico's most notorious gangs, the Zetas.
Jose Miguel Insulza, the secretary general of the O.A.S., said in an interview that it would probably take years to reduce the crime rate, with an overhaul of the region's justice systems a priority.
''The main problem is impunity,'' he said. ''There is no point in having police if the judge is going to let the guys go.''
Analysts said the Central American nations must overcome mistrust of one another's law enforcement agencies and militaries. It took the United States and Mexico several years to reach a level of cooperation that satisfies both sides, though American investigators only work with Mexican law enforcement units that they have vetted. American diplomats have also complained of a lack of coordination among Mexican agencies.
''Countries have enough problems within themselves coordinating various security agencies and sharing information,'' said Shannon K. O'Neil, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York who studies Latin America. ''Doing that across countries just adds to the complexity and escalates the levels of mistrust.''
Kevin Casas-Zamora, a former vice president of Costa Rica and a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that Central American nations have worked together on economic accords to smooth trade, but have not been as successful on political matters.
''There are different levels of political and institutional development in the region,'' he said. ''The Costa Ricans are extremely suspicious of anything that smacks of political integration. They see their institutions as much better than those in Nicaragua or Honduras.''
And there will not be much regional cooperation, he said, unless the United States takes an active role.
President Obama, in a visit here to El Salvador in March, promised $200 million to combat organized crime in Central America, but diplomats and government officials in the region say it is not nearly enough.
''It's a drop in the bucket,'' Oscar Alvarez, the security minister of Honduras, said Monday.
Arturo Valenzuela, the United States assistant secretary of state overseeing Latin America, is leaving his post this summer, after less than two years, to return to teaching. He attended the assembly here and, in an interview, said the United States would press for more coordination among the nations. But, he said, relying on the United States to deliver ever more aid was ''an outdated view.''
''It's more a problem of strategy and how to make it effective,'' he said. ''It's not just a matter of resources.''

HEADLINE: Keeping Protectionism at Bay: Trade restrictions are exactly the wrong response to a sluggish global economy

 BODY:
The world's big trading nations have done a fairly good job over the last two years of resisting protectionism even as their economies stalled or shrank. But their patience with open markets seems to be wearing thin. 
With growth still slow and unemployment high, many developed countries are resorting to measures that restrict imports -- from antidumping investigations to tariff increases. This must stop.
The World Trade Organization has been monitoring new trade restrictions since the Group of 20 industrialized nations promised to refrain from protectionism in 2009. It found that between October 2010 and April 2011, these nations imposed 122 new restrictions affecting about 0.5 percent of world imports. That is more than twice as many as in the period between May and October 2010.
This trend does not yet threaten global trade, which expanded by more than 14 percent last year, according to the W.T.O. But it indicates an erosion of the discipline that kept world markets open through the downturn and prevented protectionism from further denting global growth.
Every country has given in to temptation to some degree. Brazil increased tariffs on tools and toys. China opened antidumping investigations against American grain imports and imports of photographic paper from the United States, the European Union and Japan. The United States imposed a special tax on some foreigners who win government procurement contracts.
This course is not surprising given the sluggish recovery. In Europe and the United States, the end of fiscal stimulus has left communities and industries foundering. And with the international solidarity sparked by the global financial crisis eroding, governments want to give domestic firms an advantage.
Since the financial crisis began in 2008, G-20 countries have imposed 550 measures to restrict or potentially distort trade. Such measures disrupt international supply chains, reduce economic activity and dent the sense of common purpose that was needed to survive the economic crisis. Giving in to the protectionist impulse now can only make matters worse.

HEADLINE: The Gas Is Greener

BYLINE: By ROBERT BRYCE. 
Robert Bryce, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, is the author, most recently, of ''Power Hungry: The Myths of 'Green' Energy and the Real Fuels of the Future.''

 BODY:
IN April, Gov. Jerry Brown made headlines by signing into law an ambitious mandate that requires California to obtain one-third of its electricity from renewable energy sources like sunlight and wind by 2020. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia now have renewable electricity mandates. President Obama and several members of Congress have supported one at the federal level. Polls routinely show strong support among voters for renewable energy projects -- as long as they don't cost too much.
But there's the rub: while energy sources like sunlight and wind are free and naturally replenished, converting them into large quantities of electricity requires vast amounts of natural resources -- most notably, land. Even a cursory look at these costs exposes the deep contradictions in the renewable energy movement. 
Consider California's new mandate. The state's peak electricity demand is about 52,000 megawatts. Meeting the one-third target will require (if you oversimplify a bit) about 17,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity. Let's assume that California will get half of that capacity from solar and half from wind. Most of its large-scale solar electricity production will presumably come from projects like the $2 billion Ivanpah solar plant, which is now under construction in the Mojave Desert in southern California. When completed, Ivanpah, which aims to provide 370 megawatts of solar generation capacity, will cover 3,600 acres -- about five and a half square miles.
The math is simple: to have 8,500 megawatts of solar capacity, California would need at least 23 projects the size of Ivanpah, covering about 129 square miles, an area more than five times as large as Manhattan. While there's plenty of land in the Mojave, projects as big as Ivanpah raise environmental concerns. In April, the federal Bureau of Land Management ordered a halt to construction on part of the facility out of concern for the desert tortoise, which is protected under the Endangered Species Act.
Wind energy projects require even more land. The Roscoe wind farm in Texas, which has a capacity of 781.5 megawatts, covers about 154 square miles. Again, the math is straightforward: to have 8,500 megawatts of wind generation capacity, California would likely need to set aside an area equivalent to more than 70 Manhattans. Apart from the impact on the environment itself, few if any people could live on the land because of the noise (and the infrasound, which is inaudible to most humans but potentially harmful) produced by the turbines.
Industrial solar and wind projects also require long swaths of land for power lines. Last year, despite opposition from environmental groups, San Diego Gas & Electric started construction on the 117-mile Sunrise Powerlink, which will carry electricity from solar, wind and geothermal projects located in Imperial County, Calif., to customers in and around San Diego. In January, environmental groups filed a federal lawsuit to prevent the $1.9 billion line from cutting through a nearby national forest.
Not all environmentalists ignore renewable energy's land requirements. The Nature Conservancy has coined the term ''energy sprawl'' to describe it. Unfortunately, energy sprawl is only one of the ways that renewable energy makes heavy demands on natural resources.
Consider the massive quantities of steel required for wind projects. The production and transportation of steel are both expensive and energy-intensive, and installing a single wind turbine requires about 200 tons of it. Many turbines have capacities of 3 or 4 megawatts, so you can assume that each megawatt of wind capacity requires roughly 50 tons of steel. By contrast, a typical natural gas turbine can produce nearly 43 megawatts while weighing only 9 tons. Thus, each megawatt of capacity requires less than a quarter of a ton of steel.
Obviously these are ballpark figures, but however you crunch the numbers, the takeaway is the same: the amount of steel needed to generate a given amount of electricity from a wind turbine is greater by several orders of magnitude.
Such profligate use of resources is the antithesis of the environmental ideal. Nearly four decades ago, the economist E. F. Schumacher distilled the essence of environmental protection down to three words: ''Small is beautiful.'' In the rush to do something -- anything -- to deal with the intractable problem of greenhouse gas emissions, environmental groups and policy makers have determined that renewable energy is the answer. But in doing so they've tossed Schumacher's dictum into the ditch.
All energy and power systems exact a toll. If we are to take Schumacher's phrase to heart while also reducing the rate of growth of greenhouse gas emissions, we must exploit the low-carbon energy sources -- natural gas and, yes, nuclear -- that have smaller footprints.

HEADLINE: Emerging Nations Warm to Lagarde for I.M.F. Role

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN and KEITH BRADSHER; Liz Alderman reported from Paris and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong. Reporting was contributed by Heather Timmons in New Delhi, Elisabeth Malkin in Mexico City, Andrew E. Kramer in Moscow and Alexei Barrionuevo in Sao Paulo.

 BODY:
PARIS -- As the race for a new leader at the International Monetary Fund moves toward a pivotal deadline this week, the global charm offensive by the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, appears to be paying off.
Despite their alarm over efforts to put yet another European in one of the most powerful positions in global finance, China, Brazil and other fast-growing nations appear to be concluding that it would be in their interest to support Ms. Lagarde over her main rival, the Mexican central bank governor, Agustin Carstens.
For now, some of the biggest developing nations seem to see Ms. Lagarde as their best bet for increasing their power at the I.M.F. as their economies gain status in the global financial order.
With a deadline looming Friday for nominations to the I.M.F. directorship, Ms. Lagarde has mounted an energetic campaign -- including sending messages via Twitter of her impressions of meetings with country leaders at each stop, and promising to give developing nations more sway at the fund. 
On Tuesday, Ms. Lagarde sought to broaden her appeal in India. There, officials have fumed about the European arrogance they perceive in pushing her to succeed the former I.M.F. chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned last month to fight charges in New York of attempted rape and sexual assault.
Ms. Lagarde vowed Tuesday at a news conference in New Delhi to represent the needs of emerging markets so thoroughly that ''a little part of me will become Indian.''
Ms. Lagarde plans to go to China on Wednesday. Her campaign could gain even more momentum if leaders there decide that supporting her could pave the way for a Chinese citizen to be named as one of the I.M.F.'s three deputy managing directors, three people with ties to Beijing's decision makers said.
Mr. Carstens is on his own international tour and plans stops in India, China and Japan to seek support.
Although I.M.F. representatives from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa have condemned the ''obsolete, unwritten convention'' of reserving the top job for a European, they have not displayed similar solidarity for one candidate of their own.
Instead, officials in Brazil, Russia and China have already privately conceded that Ms. Lagarde may have more ability than Mr. Carstens, or another candidate, to increase their own influence at the I.M.F.
''I think that it will be very difficult to compete with Christine Lagarde,'' said Sergei A. Storchak, a Russian deputy minister of finance. ''The countries with the most votes in the I.M.F. stand behind her.''
Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Carstens began their campaign swings through emerging economies in Brazil. But after the meetings, Brazilian government officials privately said they were leaning toward Ms. Lagarde. Argentina was also not willing to commit to Mr. Carstens.
On Tuesday, before her news conference in New Delhi, Ms. Lagarde met with the prime minister of India, Manmohan Singh, and the finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. Mr. Mukherjee later told reporters that India had not decided to back Ms. Lagarde, and that it would like to be part of a consensus of nations that chooses a new managing director for the fund.
Europeans and the Group of 8 wealthy economies have backed Ms. Lagarde to address concerns that a debt crisis in the euro monetary union, where most of the I.M.F.'s rescue programs are focused, could become more unwieldy if a European did not run the fund. The I.M.F. has lent about 100 billion euros to Greece, Ireland and Portugal to prevent a wider crisis.
''It would be a mistake at this point to give up the European leadership of the I.M.F.,'' said a senior fund official, who would not be identified because the selection process was not complete. ''The sovereign debt problems in Europe are still so severe that the international community doesn't have one or two years for a new candidate to learn on the job,'' the official said.
In an interview Monday, Mr. Carstens, whose resume includes four years as a senior I.M.F. official, played down concerns that he would not be able to manage Europe's debt crisis, saying he would bring a ''pair of fresh eyes'' to the situation.
He pledged to take new steps to improve the representation of emerging markets and developing countries at the I.M.F., calling those taken so far too ''timid.''
With both candidates campaigning on similar platforms, the outcome may hinge as much on personalities as on what each nation thinks it can leverage politically from the new I.M.F. managing director.
China's could be a crucial swing vote. China holds the sixth-largest share of voting rights at the I.M.F. -- after the United States, Japan, Germany, France and Britain.
And yet, as Ms. Lagarde heads to Beijing for talks, Chinese officials find themselves in a difficult diplomatic position.
Zhou Xiaochuan, China's central bank governor, has for several years led an international campaign to grant emerging economies a bigger role at international financial institutions. Now, though, Chinese officials, according to people with ties to the decision makers, may perceive that their own national interest is best served by seeing Ms. Lagarde hold the top job -- even though she would be the 11th consecutive European to lead the I.M.F. since it went into operation in 1947.
A government adviser in Beijing who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue said the Chinese government did not yet feel ready to play a more central role in complex global financial negotiations by having a Chinese hold the top job -- particularly as the European debt crisis unfolded.
China leans toward supporting Ms. Lagarde because she appears better positioned to persuade fellow European officials to continue giving up some of their influence at the I.M.F., said Eswar S. Prasad, a former head of the China section at the I.M.F. who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington and a professor at Cornell.
The selection of Ms. Lagarde would also strengthen the argument for someone from an emerging market to replace John Lipsky, one of the three deputy managing directors of the I.M.F., after he retires in August. While China does not have a natural candidate for the top job, managing director, it does have a candidate to become a deputy to the I.M.F.'s next leader.
Two year ago, China sought, unsuccessfully, the creation of a fourth deputy managing director slot for one of its top economists, Zhu Min. Mr. Zhu was named instead as the only special adviser to the managing director, a rung below deputy managing director.
Chinese officials and state media have avoided any talk of individuals for the top job. The foreign ministry has called for the I.M.F.'s ''senior management'' to include representatives from emerging markets, a choice of wording widely viewed as hinting that Mr. Zhu should be promoted to deputy managing director.
None of this has stopped Mr. Carstens from pressing his case, although he acknowledged in the interview that he faced a struggle. ''What introduces noise to the process is the very open support that Ms. Lagarde has from the European countries,'' he said.
At this point, the biggest cloud over Ms. Lagarde's candidacy is the possibility of a judicial inquiry into whether she once abused her authority as finance minister. A French court is to decide on Friday, the same day the I.M.F. nominations are due, whether to investigate her role in a lucrative arbitration award in 2007 to Bernard Tapie, a French businessman. Any investigation would start before the I.M.F. is scheduled to select the next managing director on June 30.
For Mr. Carstens, long-shot chances are no reason to forgo seeking the position. ''It's essential to take the risk,'' he said. He cited a Mexican expression, ''There is no worse struggle than the one that is never fought.''

HEADLINE: Resistance Grows: Massachusetts, New York and Illinois Reject the Obama Enforcement-Only Way

 BODY:
Add Massachusetts to the groundswell of states and localities opposing President Obama's misconceived and failing immigration dragnet.
Gov. Deval Patrick announced on Monday that his state would not participate in Secure Communities, the fingerprint-sharing program that the Obama administration wants to impose nationwide by 2013. Gov. Andrew Cuomo halted New York's involvement last week. Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois rejected it last month. They join a long list of elected officials, Congress members and law-enforcement professionals who want nothing to do with the program for the simple reason that it does more harm than good. 
The program sends the fingerprints of every person booked by state or local police to federal databases to be checked for immigration violations. It was supposed to focus on dangerous felons. But it catches mostly noncriminals and minor offenders, as New York said, ''compromising public safety by deterring witnesses to crime and others from working with law enforcement.''
For years Mr. Obama, like George W. Bush before him, has relentlessly pushed forward with immigration enforcement schemes while failing to give any relief to millions desperate to shed their illegal status.
Real reform requires a comprehensive strategy: stricter enforcement plus legalization for the millions whom it would be foolish to uproot from our society and economy. As Mr. Obama has driven deportations to record levels, he has gotten no closer to fixing a failed system. But he has made Republican hard-liners happy by bolstering the noxious argument that all undocumented immigrants are mere criminals, deportees-in-waiting.
This is a failure of decency and good sense. It merely punishes and does nothing to actually come to grips with the problem of illegal immigration. Resistance has mostly been heard at the ground level, from immigrants and advocates who say families are being split apart, workers frightened and exploited, the American dream dishonored. So it's good to hear powerful Democrats -- Mr. Obama's friends and allies from large states -- telling him that with Secure Communities he has gone way overboard.
What these states' actions mean, practically speaking, is unclear. States like New York signed contracts with the Department of Homeland Security to enter Secure Communities, and now the administration insists that they must participate. If they send suspects' fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal checks -- as states must and will continue to do routinely -- then the F.B.I. will share that data with the Department of Homeland Security. There is no way to opt out.
We'll see about that. The idea that the federal government can commandeer states' resources for its enforcement schemes seems ripe for legal challenge. And it's wrong to make state and local police departments the gatekeepers of immigration enforcement. It should not be up to local cops to drive federal policy by deciding which neighborhoods and people are the focus of their crackdowns.
We welcome the votes of no-confidence in Secure Communities. The message is clear and growing louder: Mr. Obama and the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, need to try something else. That something else is real immigration reform that combines a path to legality with necessary measures to secure our borders and deport real criminals who are here illegally.

HEADLINE: Fed Wants Priority Put On Deficit

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The leaders of the Federal Reserve are talking like people ready to sit down and let others take the lead in addressing the nation's economic problems.
''Monetary policy cannot be a panacea,'' the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told an audience of bankers Tuesday in Atlanta.
He said that growth remained slow and uneven, but he made no mention of the possibility that the Fed would intervene, noting instead that ''a healthy economic future'' required a plan to shrink the federal deficit. 
William C. Dudley, one of Mr. Bernanke's top lieutenants, expanded on the same theme Tuesday night, saying that the government needed to balance its books, and that the nation needed to reduce its dependence on borrowing and consumption.
''These are fundamentally structural issues -- not cyclical issues; they cannot be tackled primarily through monetary policy,'' Mr. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech at a Midtown Manhattan hotel. ''Instead, monetary policy is mainly a tool for stabilizing the macroeconomy and keeping inflation expectations well anchored.''
Both men emphasized that the Fed had played an important role in helping the economy to recover. And both defended the need for continuation of a series of extraordinary policies meant to encourage growth, including holding interest rates to near zero and maintaining a large portfolio of investments. But the speeches, together with remarks by other Fed officials, signaled that additional interventions were, for now, very unlikely.
The Fed will conclude the planned purchase of $600 billion in Treasury securities at the end of June.
Investors ready to celebrate any sign the Fed might pump more money into the economy sold equities as Mr. Bernanke spoke. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended down slightly after climbing almost 2 percent earlier in the day.
Mr. Benanke's speech followed related remarks by President Obama, who told reporters Tuesday that he was worried about the rate of growth, but saw no possibility of another recession.
''I am concerned about the fact that the recovery that we're on is not producing jobs as fast as I want it to happen,'' Mr. Obama said. The economy has moved in recent months like a car in heavy traffic, gaining and then slowing, faster again and then suddenly hitting the brakes.
Despite those fluctuations, Mr. Bernanke said Tuesday that he remained confident that the pace of growth was likely to increase during the second half of the year.
He also said that he continued to see no evidence of broad and enduring inflation despite increases earlier this year in the prices of oil and other commodities.
''Over all, the economic recovery appears to be continuing at a moderate pace, albeit at a rate that is both uneven across sectors and frustratingly slow from the perspective of millions of unemployed and underemployed workers,'' Mr. Bernanke told the International Monetary Conference, a gathering of bank executives.
Mr. Bernanke made clear that recent data had shaken his confidence in the strength of the recovery, which continues to depend on extensive federal support. Mr. Bernanke has said he wants to see evidence of strong and sustained hiring by private firms before deciding that the economy can withstand the loss of that support. On Tuesday, he said that ''until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established.''
The economy has expanded much more slowly this year than the Fed had predicted. Last month private employers added only 83,000 jobs, reducing the average so far this year to about 180,000 jobs a month -- barely enough to cut into the numbers of the jobless.
Mr. Bernanke noted that after two years of economic recovery, the net decline in one important measure, aggregate hours worked, remained greater than the peak decline in the same measure during the deep recession in 1981-82.
The Fed has invested more than $2 trillion in a range of unprecedented programs, first to restore the financial system and then to encourage economic expansion. Mr. Bernanke has argued that the policies achieved worthwhile but limited objectives. Internal and external critics, however, describe the results as lackluster and warn that the policies could make it more difficult for the Fed to control inflation.
Those critics have taken a toll. So has internal debate about the efficacy of additional stimulus, which already seems to be yielding diminishing returns. So the Fed's focus has turned to advocating for broader solutions to broader problems.
''Policy makers urgently need to put the federal governments' finances on a sustainable trajectory,'' Mr. Bernanke said. Such a plan should not impose large spending cuts immediately, he cautioned, but it could produce immediate benefits ''by leading to lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence.''

HEADLINE: One-Party Rule in 2 States Sends Them Off in Opposite Directions: Connecticut Shifts Left

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
HARTFORD -- In a year when conservative politics have dominated even traditionally Democratic states like New Jersey and New York, Connecticut is closing out its most activist, liberal legislative session in memory.
Lawmakers over the last several weeks have enacted the largest tax increase in Connecticut history and approved the nation's first law to mandate paid sick leave for some workers. They voted to extend protections for transgender people, to charge in-state college tuition rates to illegal immigrants, to extend an early-release program for prisoners and to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana.
As legislators wrap up the first session in 20 years with a Democratic governor, who is working with two chambers in the Legislature under Democratic control, it is clear that either they did not receive or they decided to tear up the antitax, budget-slashing, confront-the-unions script that has characterized state legislative sessions elsewhere. 
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and legislative Democrats characterize the session that is scheduled to end at midnight Wednesday as one in which tough and balanced decisions were made on fiscal and job-creation issues while social issues that had lingered for many years were addressed. Republicans say the last five months of lawmaking have been a liberal joy ride and a capitulation to the state's powerful unions.
The session provides a glimpse into the politics of a state that largely avoided the Republican tide that swept the country last year. And the way that voters respond could say a lot, not just about Connecticut's future, but also about national politics as the fevers of the 2010 elections begin to cool.
The Senate president, Donald E. Williams Jr., a Democrat from Brooklyn, Conn., said the legislation passed on social issues was forward-looking and relatively modest, and he insisted Connecticut had made difficult but smart economic choices that would benefit the state over the long run.
''We're not interested in burning the bridges leading to our economic future,'' Mr. Williams said in an interview. ''Governor Malloy and the Democratic Legislature have decided to dig in and not do what other states are doing: using a flamethrower when it comes to municipal aid, state support for education, state support for pathways that lead to opportunity.''
But Republicans, for the most part, have been sharply critical.
''Their solution is to tax the wealthy in Fairfield County, redistribute income and hope people in Greenwich and Darien don't move to Florida,'' said Christopher Healy, the state Republican Party chairman.
An editorial on Monday in The Republican-American of Waterbury, considered the state's most conservative daily newspaper, was more blunt: ''It now is fair to say the state of Connecticut has left the gravitational pull of planet Earth. Just when you thought state government's policies couldn't get any more absurd, they move to a new level of, well, absurdity.''
The session has run on two parallel tracks -- social and economic -- with the end result still unclear.
On finances, the Legislature adopted a $40.1 billion budget that relies on $1.4 billion in tax increases, about $800 million in cuts and a projected $1.6 billion in union concessions on pay and benefits over two years. The concessions are subject to ratification by state employee unions by June 24. Reaction from union members so far has been wildly mixed, and a failure to approve the givebacks would leave the budget in tatters.
Republicans, who question the accuracy of the budget numbers, say that, under one-party rule, Democrats seem oblivious to the economic forces buffeting states around the nation.
''You have Democrats who get elected by doing a masterful job of behaving like middle-of-the-road, moderate people,'' Mr. Healy said, ''and when they gather together in Hartford, it's like they're overtaken by some kind of zombielike spirit.''
The social and public policy agenda has been a grab bag of liberal issues, many of them stagnant in the pipeline for years either because of division in the Democratic ranks or because of threats of vetoes by Republican governors.
The most conspicuous Democratic victory was the passage of a bill last weekend that will make Connecticut the nation's first state to require employers to provide paid sick days to workers. It applies only to businesses in service industries with 50 or more employees, and exempts nationally chartered nonprofit organizations, day laborers, independent contractors and temporary workers, providing the benefit to an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 workers, including waiters and nursing home aides. The bill was significantly watered down, but its passage was hailed by worker advocates as a landmark effort that would add momentum to similar measures proposed in other cities and states.
Some of the bills, like the protections for transgender people and the decriminalization of marijuana in small quantities, are forms of legislation already enacted in other states. Mr. Malloy said the marijuana measure simply put Connecticut in line with the laws in neighboring New York and Massachusetts, and would make it one of 13 states with such statutes.
''Final approval of this legislation accepts the reality that the current law does more harm than good -- both in the impact it has on people's lives and the burden it places on police, prosecutors and probation officers of the criminal justice system,'' the governor said in a statement.
Still, Republicans said the cumulative impact of the session constituted the kind of social engineering that had gotten Democrats in trouble in the past.
Mr. Healy said, ''What the Democrats in Hartford are doing is very similar to what the Democrats in Washington did in 2009, which was to pass a radical agenda without any Republican support.''
Some politicians suggest that Mr. Malloy, who was elected governor last fall, had decided to tackle the most controversial budgetary and policy issues early in his term, with the hope that an improved economy would take the edge off any early-term grievances. And Thomas D'Amore, an independent political consultant who was chief of staff for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., an independent, in 1990, said that for all the partisan atmospherics, the session and Mr. Malloy's approach stood out primarily because of the contrast with other states.
''If you get beyond the headlines and look at the details, most of what you'll find is pretty moderate and full of compromises,'' Mr. D'Amore said. ''I think at the end of the day, voters understand common sense and respect the argument that it was necessary to share the pain. But if things don't turn around, then the outcome is going to be beyond the control of this governor.''

HEADLINE: Hovnanian's Revenue Falls 20%, A Worse Loss Than Expected

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Hovnanian Enterprises, the home builder, reported a wider quarterly loss on Tuesday as revenue fell 20 percent amid slumping demand for new houses. 
The net loss was $72.7 million, or 69 cents a share, compared with a loss of $28.6 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier, the company said. The result was worse than the loss of 55 cents a share expected by analysts.
Hovnanian, which specializes in building single-family homes, is buying land at distressed prices in an effort to raise margins as the housing market languishes. Home builders in the United States are struggling with weak demand as unemployment hovers around 9 percent and foreclosures drag down prices of previously owned houses.
Revenue in the period, which ended April 30 and was the second quarter of Hovnanian's fiscal year, fell to $255.1 million, from $318.6 million a year earlier. Net orders dropped 17 percent to 1,166 homes.
The loss was Hovnanian's 18th out of the last 19 quarters. Its one profit, in the three months ended January 2010, was the result of a federal tax break.
The company expects narrower losses in the next two quarters, its chief executive, Ara Hovnanian, said in a statement disclosing the results.
''We remain confident that we have the liquidity to weather the remainder of this downturn, and will continue to position ourselves in preparation for the inevitable housing recovery,'' he said.
The report was released after the close of regular market trading. Hovnanian rose 1 cent to $2.34 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

HEADLINE: On Global Charm Offensive, Lagarde Promises Support to Developing Countries

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS; Nida Najar contributed reporting.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde promised Tuesday to support emerging markets so wholeheartedly that a little part of her ''would turn Indian'' if she were elected head of the International Monetary Fund.
Ms. Lagarde appeared in India's capital as part of a global campaign to win support from developing nations for her candidacy. In late May she visited Brazil, and on Wednesday she is slated to meet officials in Beijing. 
The IMF ''does not belong to anybody,'' but to all 187 member nations, she told reporters at the French Embassy in New Delhi.
Developing nations have been agitating for one of their own to fill the top slot at the International Monetary Fund since the post became vacant in May, when France's Dominique Strauss-Kahn stepped down amid accusations of sexual assault.
If elected, Ms. Lagarde said Tuesday, she would ''stand on my feet as a woman,'' adding that she would stand ''with a level of testosterone that would be lower.''
She also said she would continue reforms that have given emerging markets more weight in the fund's decision-making process.
Ms. Lagarde met earlier Tuesday with the prime minister of India, Manmohan Singh, and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee. Mr. Mukherjee told reporters after the meeting that India had not yet decided to back Ms. Lagarde, and that India would like to be part of a consensus of nations that chooses a new managing director for the fund.
During the press conference Tuesday evening, Ms. Lagarde said she was not in town to ask for Indian officials' backing because that would be premature. Instead, she said, she was in India to present her candidacy and listen to concerns.
Indian officials expressed the ''unanimous view'' on Tuesday that ''nationality is not the criteria -- the criteria should be the merit of the candidate on its own rights,'' she said.
Developing countries, which emerged relatively unscathed from the financial crises in recent years, are seeking a larger voice in international institutions as Europe and America continue to struggle with debt, unemployment and uncertain economic futures.
Ms. Lagarde said Tuesday that her experience dealing with the financial crisis was ''an experience I would never forget'' and one that taught her the value of coordination with other I.M.F. members.
Since the I.M.F. was created after World War II to promote global economic stability, it has always had a European as its elected managing director.
Mexico's central bank governor, Agustin Carstens, is so far Ms. Lagarde's only real challenger, but he has yet to win the open support of the largest developing nations. He will visit India later this week and China and Japan next week.
A lack of unity among emerging markets may mean their chance to head the fund this time is slipping away, some experts said.
''There is consensus on the principle that their candidates should be given a fair chance but no consensus on a particular candidate,'' said Eswar Prasad, Cornell University's senior professor of trade policy and the former head of research in the IMF's financial studies division. ''This effectively seals the deal in favor of Lagarde.''
Although nominations for the managing director slot do not close until Friday, some economists say the battle is already lost.
''Emerging countries have no chance and clearly are now backing Ms. Lagarde so that they can get some benefit out of the European powers during her term,'' said Surendra L. Rao, an economist based in Bangalore.
Europe and the United States retain 45 percent of the voting rights in the IMF, but emerging market countries' shares have been increasing as their economies grow. India carries a 2.35 percent voting share, the third largest of the major emerging market countries, after China's 3.82 percent stake and just behind Russia's 2.4 percent stake. Brazil trails with a 1.72 percent vote.
On May 24, the world's leading emerging market nations voiced their desire for a more authority to choose a leader for the fund. In a joint statement, Brazil, Russia, India and China advocated ''abandoning the obsolete unwritten convention that requires that the head of the IMF be necessarily from Europe.''
In India's case, top officials stopped short of endorsing Lagarde but still indicated they consider her an ally.
On May 27, India's minister of commerce and industry, Anand Sharma, met with Ms. Lagarde on the sidelines of an international trade meeting in Paris. ''India has high regard for her record as chair of the G-20 and sees her as a friend,'' Mr. Sharma's office said in a statement about their discussion.
Rather than rallying behind an emerging market candidate during this election, ''each of the key emerging markets is using the opportunity to position itself better for the next round and extract what it can from this round,'' Mr. Prasad said.
Ms. Lagarde should demonstrate that ''she is well aware that the world has changed, and that India, China, Brazil, South America or one of the other economies could provide the next president,'' Mr. Prasad said.

HEADLINE: Obama and Merkel Tell Qaddafi to Go

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Tuesday ramped up his calls for the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, to step down, as NATO warplanes repeatedly dropped bombs on Tripoli in an intensifying campaign. 
Promising an increase in the punishing NATO effort against the Libyan leader's regime until he is removed from office, Mr. Obama said that Colonel Qaddafi's four-decade-long rule is coming to an end. ''I think it is just a matter of time before Qaddafi goes,'' Mr. Obama said. ''What you're seeing across the country is an inexorable trend of the regime forces being pushed back, being incapacitated.''
Mr. Obama's comments, delivered in a side-by-side news conference in the White House East Room with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, came as Ms. Merkel herself joined the growing chorus calling for the Libyan leader to step down. While Germany is not taking part in the NATO air campaign in Libya, Ms. Merkel said that her country would try to help once Colonel Qaddafi leaves.
''Qaddafi needs to step down and he will step down,'' Ms. Merkel said. ''I'm convinced of that, because we have made great progress.''
The comments came as what appeared to be bunker-busting bombs pounded the regime's main compound in Tripoli. NATO officials have promised a more intense campaign in recent days.
Colonel Qaddafi, however, has remained defiant. He told Libyan state television in a phone call on Tuesday that he would not surrender and ''martyrdom is a million times better.''
Despite Colonel Qaddafi's words, Mr. Obama pointed to defections among high-profile members of the Qaddafi regime as a sign that the NATO campaign is working.
Ms. Merkel was in Washington to receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom. She will also be the guest of honor at a rare state dinner at the White House Tuesday evening, as the United States and Germany try to reinforce a relationship that has been troubled by differences over the Libya mission and over how to respond to global economic problems.
Mr. Obama urged European leaders to resolve the continent's debt crisis quickly to avoid endangering the global economy.
''We in the Euro zone are aware of our responsibilities for the global economy,'' Ms. Merkel said. ''The stability of the Euro zone is an important factor in the stability of the global economy.''

HEADLINE: Ambitious Goals For Ford's Chief

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE and PETER THAL LARSEN

 BODY:
Ford Motor's punchy global ambitions are not as worrying as they look. The Motor City automaker expects to sell eight million vehicles a year by the middle of the decade, according to the plan unveiled on Tuesday by Alan R. Mulally, the chief executive. That is 50 percent higher than Ford's showing in 2010 and more bullish than the one-third sales pickup he sees for the industry.
Such optimism from Detroit usually falls flat. But there's less to fear from failure than in the past. 
Such rosy predictions no longer need to come true for Ford to remain profitable. Last year, for example, the company's automotive division cranked out a 6.1 percent pretax margin even though car sales remained weak. Success with its latest plan would raise that to around 9 percent, Mr. Mulally reckons. Missing the targets would crimp that performance. While hardly ideal, it's still better than racking up billions in losses as Ford and its rivals Chrysler and General Motors used to do.
What's more, Ford remains focused on keeping its balance sheet under control. It is paying off an additional $3 billion in debt this quarter, bringing the total reduction since the end of 2009 to almost $20 billion. Mr. Mulally aims to cap auto debt at $10 billion by 2015 and to reclaim the company's investment-grade credit rating.
Existing margins translate into $9 billion in cash each year for Ford, more than triple the increase in annual capital expenditure earmarked to improve sales. That should give investors comfort that Ford has both the wherewithal to pay a dividend soon and enough cushion should sales goals exceed the company's reach.
It is a tall order. The chief executive predicts most of the extra sales will come in Asia, which is indeed a growth market, but Ford lags rivals in the region. While failure will not push the company into the red as it once might have, it could spur the return of another of its past follies: a reckless buying spree.
It sounds as though acquisitions are far from Mr. Mulally's mind. But he is 65, and his successor could have other ideas. The sooner Ford shows healthy progress on its new goals, the better.
Bottom Up Regulation
Timothy F. Geithner is worried about a regulatory race to the bottom. The Treasury secretary has warned other countries against taking advantage of tough financial-sector rules introduced in the United States. He has a point. But the quest for a level global playing field in financial regulation is futile -- and confusing.
Policy makers joined forces rapidly to agree to new global rules in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. The Basel III system for setting bank capital levels was completed less than two years after Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, a fraction of the time it took regulators to arrive at the previous iteration of the accord.
But as the crisis has faded, so has the consensus. It is still far from certain that regulators will be able to strike a global deal to force the biggest banks to hold extra capital. Asian governments are showing few signs of following the approach of the United States and Europe to regulating derivatives. Meanwhile, private disputes are spilling into public view: witness Monday's attack by Jochen Sanio, president of the German market regulator BaFin, on the European Banking Authority, which is overseeing Europe's bank stress tests.
Some global minimum standards are desirable and necessary. But there is no reason to prevent national regulators from adopting tougher local standards. Small countries with big banking systems, like Switzerland, should be allowed to impose tougher capital requirements on their lenders. Likewise, new regulators like the Britain's Financial Policy Committee, which is charged with keeping an eye on potential asset price bubbles, must have the tools to rein in financial excess. But that will not be possible if the European Commission insists on a strict and uniform interpretation of the standards imposed by Basel III.
Besides, adopting global minimum standards is already a big challenge. Despite Mr. Geithner's promises, many still believe that Washington will wriggle out of fully adhering to Basel III. Remember that the United States was one of the first countries to propose a levy on banks' balance sheets, only for the plan to be blocked by Congress. All this suggests regulators should concentrate their efforts on achieving global minimum rules. A completely level playing field is an unworthy extra goal.

HEADLINE: Punish Weiner? Or Advise Therapy?

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com; Twitter: @jimdwyernyt

 BODY:
The matter of Anthony D. Weiner, unclothed congressman, is being lodged by Democratic Party elders with the House ethics committee, a holding room where it will remain until either it, or he, goes away.
Those elders must be hoping to heaven that Mr. Weiner departs before the machinery of investigation is gassed up and rumbles toward the Internet Protocol addresses where he composed his epistles.
By some schools of thought, if he wrote these personal messages on government equipment, this could be seen as unethical behavior. 
Still, ethics hardly seems the right discipline for this affair.
Psychiatry might help.
Any reckoning of the craziness of his behavior must take account of his role among Congressional Democrats.
Mr. Weiner was his party's id.
He spoke brazenly against Republican plans and icons, taking swings at people like Paul Ryan and Michele Bachmann.
Less than a month ago, he told a reporter for The New York Times that he knew that his own behavior was bound to be scrutinized.
In fact, conservative bloggers, led by an individual identified as @PatriotUSA76, were tracking his Twitter account so carefully that they sent warnings to women who were being followed online by Mr. Weiner to be wary of him.
Mr. Weiner was copied into those warnings.
Even so, knowing that he was being watched, he kept up his stream of lewd communications with strangers, people who identified themselves as women.
A longstanding political friend of Mr. Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, said on Tuesday that he was trying to come to grips with the congressman's recklessness.
''If you look at the sin -- is it public or is it private -- it's private,'' said the friend, who did not want to be identified. ''But you go beyond sin, this is mental illness. It's strange.''
The friend said he worried about the toll on Mr. Weiner, who has worked only in politics as an adult. In 2000, Mr. Weiner's eldest brother, facing financial pressure and struggling with alcohol, was killed by a car as he crossed a busy divided highway in Alexandria, Va.
Asked about the congressman's emotional state, Mr. Weiner's spokesman referred to his comments at the news conference on Monday, when the congressman, weeping, said that he could not explain his behavior, but that he intended to keep his seat in Congress.
No one can say where the Weiner case will wind up -- lying to Wolf Blitzer about Twitter is not a known federal crime -- but history shows that where there is a will, someone can find a way to prosecute.
YOU might think this is a matter for his household to decide, in the first instance, and for his constituents to figure out for themselves come the next election.
Nevertheless, the fact is that dishonesty about sexual behavior has been criminalized.
Henry Cisneros, a member of President Bill Clinton's cabinet, lied to the F.B.I. about money that he gave to a mistress; he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and the investigation went on for most of a decade and cost $22 million.
Mr. Clinton, who testified falsely in a civil suit about sexual encounters with an intern, was investigated for perjury and obstruction of justice at a cost of $12.5 million.
John Edwards was recently indicted for arranging payments to a mistress with whom he had fathered a child. (Interestingly, one of Mr. Clinton's old defense lawyers, Lanny Breuer, is among those leading the prosecution of Mr. Edwards.)
Who could bear the thought that we are about to begin months of inquiries over whether Mr. Weiner sent seminaked pictures of himself to strangers from his personal BlackBerry or from a government-issued computer?
Or whether he brought discredit on the House of Representatives? Having abetted nearly a decade of wars, and permitting fat cats to bring the economy to a state of collapse, Congress ought to be able to tolerate a few embarrassing and crude messages sent by one foolish man in Queens.

HEADLINE: After Bernanke Speech, Fifth Day of Losses

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stock indexes closed lower Tuesday, giving up earlier gains, after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the economic recovery remained uneven. Mr. Bernanke offered no new steps to stimulate growth. 
The Dow Jones industrial average had been up as many as 89 points but turned lower in the late afternoon as Mr. Bernanke's speech started. The Dow's loss of 19 points was the fifth consecutive decline for the index, the longest string of losses since August.
Mr. Bernanke said the nation's economy had not grown as quickly as had been expected so far this year. He said growth had been held back by disruptions of industrial supplies from Japan after the tsunami and nuclear disaster there and by higher gas prices.
Mr. Bernanke said he expected the economy to pick up in the second half of the year, but he acknowledged that the rate of the growth remained ''frustratingly slow from the perspective of millions of unemployed and underemployed workers.''
Some investors had been hoping Mr. Bernanke would announce additional measures to support the economy. Major indexes fell after it became clear that Mr. Bernanke was not wavering from his view that the United States economy was growing gradually and did not need more stimulus. The Fed's $600 billion bond-buying program, which is aimed at keeping interest rates low, is ending at the end of June.
''People are getting skittish,'' said Brian Wenzinger, a portfolio manager at Aronson Johnson Ortiz in Philadelphia. ''Housing is getting worse, and they're rethinking a possible double-dip recession.'' But, Mr. Wenzinger added, the relatively small drop in the stock market was a positive sign after several days of steep losses.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 19.15 points, or 0.16 percent, to close at 12,070.81. The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index dipped 1.23 points, or 0.10 percent, to 1,284.94. The Nasdaq composite shed 1 point, or 0.04 percent, to 2,701.56.
Stocks have fallen since late April because of concerns that the United States economy is stalling from a combination of high gas prices, weaker-than-expected hiring and a slowdown in manufacturing. The Dow has fallen nearly 500 points over the last five days. The S.& P. closed at its lowest level in two and a half months.
The Labor Department reported that businesses had fewer job openings in April. The government said that employers posted three million ads for jobs in April, down from 3.1 million in March.
In corporate news, a contentious acquisition proposal ratcheted up the stock price of all companies involved. International Paper rose 0.4 percent after its smaller rival, Temple-Inland, fought back against International Paper's hostile takeover bid for $3.3 billion in cash. Temple-Inland soared 40 percent on the news. Weyerhaeuser rose 5 percent on suspicion it was another takeover candidate for International Paper.
The Treasury's 10-year note was unchanged at 101 3/32, and the yield stayed at 2.99 percent.

HEADLINE: The German Example

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Germany has been a frequent cudgel in recent fights over the American economy. When Germany has grown faster than the United States, stimulus skeptics like to point across the Atlantic Ocean and say that austerity works. When it has grown more slowly, people who think the American stimulus made a big difference -- including me -- return the favor.
But the full story is more interesting than any caricature. In the last decade, Germany has succeeded in some important ways that the United States has not. The lessons aren't simply liberal or conservative. They are both.
With our economy weakening once again -- and with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany visiting the White House this week -- now seems to be a good time to take a closer look. 
The brief story is that, despite its reputation for austerity, Germany has been far more willing than the United States to use the power of government to help its economy. Yet it has also been more ruthless about cutting wasteful parts of government.
The results are intriguing. After performing worse than the American economy for years, the Germany economy has grown faster since the middle of last decade. (It did better than our economy before the crisis and has endured the crisis about equally). Just as important, most Germans have fared much better than most Americans, because the bounty of their growth has not been concentrated among a small slice of the affluent.
Inflation-adjusted average hourly pay has risen almost 30 percent since 1985 in Germany, the kind of gains American workers have not enjoyed since the '50s and '60s. In this country, hourly pay has risen a scant 6 percent since 1985.
Germany also managed to avoid a housing bubble, unlike the United States, Britain, Ireland, Spain and other countries. German children have stronger math and science skills than ours. Its medium-term budget deficit is smaller. Its unemployment rate is like a mirror image of ours: 6.1 percent, well below where it was when the financial crisis began in 2007. Our rate has risen to 9.1 percent.
I'm not saying that the United States should want to become Germany. Americans remain considerably richer. We have the innovative companies -- Wal-Mart, Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter -- that make other countries swoon. We remain the world's immigration Mecca.
Yet for all the strengths of the United States, almost nobody claims that the economy is in especially good shape. It so happens that our current out-of-town guests could teach us a few things.
The first lesson is that it's really possible to make government more efficient. Like much of Western Europe, Germany long had a unemployment benefits system that discouraged work. But almost a decade ago, it began to make some changes.
It cut many benefits, in both duration and level, and it reduced the incentives to retire early. It also began trying to move the long-term unemployed into the labor force.
Specifically, the government took a fresh look at people who had not worked in years to determine who could and couldn't work. The able and healthy were matched with potential employers. If they took a low-paying job, which was often the case, they would still receive a small portion of their benefits for a time. If they refused to work, their benefits were reduced anyway.
''The incentives to take up work were strengthened,'' says Felix Hufner of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, ''and also the sanctions were strengthened.'' Sure enough, the reforms have nudged more people back into the labor force -- and work tends to beget more work, as people develop skills and have more money to spend.
In the United States, short-term jobless benefits are not generous enough to be a major problem. But the Social Security disability program, which is one reason nearly 20 percent of working-age American men are not working, would benefit from some German-like reforms. So would those public sector pensions that encourage people to retire at 55 or 60.
Beyond the job market, Germany has also made a big effort to improve its education system. Eric Hanushek, a Stanford University economist, notes that Germany's performance on the main international math, reading and science tests have become such a matter of national concern that the name of the tests -- Pisa -- is now a household word. ''In the U.S.,'' he says, ''Pisa is still a bell tower in Italy.''
The math scores of German students have risen significantly since 2000, extending their existing lead over American students. Germany's national average is now higher than the average in Massachusetts, this country's top-performing state. And there is obviously a connection between strong technical skills and a strong manufacturing sector.
But the German story is not merely about making government more efficient. It's also about understanding the unique role that government must play in a market economy.
That role starts with serious regulation. American regulators stood idle as the housing bubble inflated. German banks often required a down payment of 40 percent.
Unlike what happened here, German laws and regulators have also prevented the decimation of their labor unions. The clout of German unions, at individual companies and in the political system, is one reason the middle class there has fared decently in recent decades. In fact, middle-class pay has risen at roughly the same rate as top incomes.
The top 1 percent of German households earns about 11 percent of all income, virtually unchanged relative to 1970, according to recent estimates. In the United States, the top 1 percent makes more than 20 percent of all income, up from 9 percent in 1970. That's right: only 40 years ago, Germany was more unequal than this country.
Finally, there are taxes. Germany does not have a smaller budget deficit because it spends less. Germany, you'll recall, is the original welfare state. It has a smaller deficit because it is more willing to match the benefits it wants with the needed taxes. The current deficit-reduction plan includes about 60 percent spending cuts and 40 percent tax increases, Mr. Hufner says. It's like trying to lose weight by both eating less and exercising more.
As I suggested before, the American economy's strengths may still be greater than the German economy's. But Germany sure does seem more serious about dealing with its weaknesses.
And us? Well, lobbyists for the mortgage bankers and the N.A.A.C.P. have recently started pushing for less stringent standards for down payments. Wall Street is trying to water down other financial regulation, too.
Some Democrats say Social Security and Medicare must remain unchanged. Most Republicans refuse to consider returning tax rates even to their 1990s levels. Republican leaders also want to make deep cuts in the sort of antipoverty programs that have helped Germany withstand the recession even in the absence of big new stimulus legislation.
There is no getting around the fact that financial crises wreak terrible damage. It's too late for us to prevent that damage, and it will take a long time to recover fully. It is not too late to learn from our mistakes.

HEADLINE: Pawlenty Calls for Greater Tax and Spending Cuts Than G.O.P. Rivals

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Former Gov. Tim Pawlenty called on Tuesday for more than $2 trillion in tax cuts for individuals and businesses over the next decade and two to three times as much in federal spending reductions and loophole closings, saying that such policies would drive rapid economic growth.
In the first major policy speech of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Mr. Pawlenty intensified his criticism of President Obama's economic policies, accusing the Democratic president of being satisfied with a ''second-rate American economy'' and ignoring the country's fiscal problems. 
But Mr. Pawlenty, of Minnesota, also used the speech to lay down an economic marker for his Republican rivals, essentially daring them to go further in calling for large tax and spending cuts to appeal to conservative voters during next year's primaries.
''The United States is still home to the most dynamic and entrepreneurial people in the world,'' Mr. Pawlenty said during a speech at the University of Chicago. ''They've been discouraged and weighed down by President Obama's big government and heavy-handed regulations. They deserve a better deal. I'll give them one.''
Mr. Pawlenty's proposed tax and spending cuts go well beyond anything being sought at this point by the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, and were dismissed by Democrats and their allies as fiscally unworkable and skewed to the wealthy and big corporations at the expense of working people.
Under his proposal, the corporate income tax rate would be reduced to 15 percent from 35 percent. Individual federal income tax rates, which currently go as high as 35 percent, would be flattened to just two rates: 10 percent for the first $50,000 of income and 25 percent for income above that.
He also called for elimination of all taxes on capital gains, interest income and dividends. And he proposed eliminating the federal estate tax.
Mr. Pawlenty suggested that the government would recapture much of the lost revenue through higher levels of economic growth.
A spokesman for Mr. Pawlenty said after the speech that the former governor opposed any changes to individual tax deductions or credits, suggesting that he would leave intact the mortgage interest deduction and other tax breaks.
Instead, the spokesman, Alex Conant, said Mr. Pawlenty would get rid of business tax breaks. As an example, he pointed to Mr. Pawlenty's recent calls for the elimination of subsidies for energy companies, including ethanol producers.
Mr. Pawlenty said his goal would be an economic growth rate of 5 percent a year, a level well beyond what the United States had been able to sustain for more than brief periods in recent decades.
The American economy is currently growing at a rate of about 1.8 percent.
Isabel V. Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in the Clinton administration, said it would take extremely deep cuts in federal spending and the elimination of individual tax deductions to offset tax cuts of the size that Mr. Pawlenty is proposing.
''We need that money to reduce the deficit,'' Ms. Sawhill said. ''If we use up all of these loopholes and all of these spending cuts to pay for very large, new tax cuts, we will have nothing left over to deal with what is a huge, gaping hole between revenue.''
Ms. Sawhill also said Mr. Pawlenty's assumption of 5 percent growth over a decade was ''highly unlikely.'' She said that ''long term growth has rarely been more than in the 3-percent range. That would be near the upper bound of anything that's realistic.''
In addition to broad tax cuts, Mr. Pawlenty said that as president he would seek temporary authority to freeze government spending and to impound up to 5 percent of the federal budget until the nation's budget is balanced. And he called for cuts in programs that are better done by private companies.
''We can start by applying what I call the Google test,'' Mr. Pawlenty said. ''If you can find a good or service on the Internet, then the federal government probably doesn't need to be doing it.'' As examples he cited the Postal Service, Amtrak and federal home-mortgage agencies.
He also said he would overhaul the tax code, calling it a ''9,000-page monstrosity'' that is ''chock full of special deals for special interests.''
Chris Chocola, the president of the Club for Growth, a conservative antitax group, called Mr. Pawlenty's proposals ''outstanding,'' and said he ''is exactly right in calling for cleaning up the tax code by instituting flatter tax rates and eliminating tax loopholes and giveaways.''
But Michael Linden, the director of tax and budget policy for the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group, called the plan ''sheer fantasy.''
Mr. Linden said the drastically lower tax rates would cause ''huge, massive deficits'' by reducing federal revenues to historically low levels. And he said that Mr. Pawlenty's promise to reduce federal spending to only 18.5 percent of America's gross domestic product would force huge cuts in programs and services.

HEADLINE: Labor Supply Always Matters

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: It is supply -- the huge number of students seeking full-time work -- that drives the labor markets in the summer, rather than demand, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago.
As it has for the last three summers, the economy's regular seasonal cycle will accumulate yet more evidence against Keynesian models of recession labor markets.
Two important seasons in the labor market are Christmas and summer. The Christmas season is an obvious time of high demand - people want to spend more in November and December. Basic economics says that Christmastime demand, while it lasts, raises wages, employment and hours, while it reduces unemployment.
Employment and work hours are also high during the summer, and as you are reading this, employment is likely to be surging well above what it was a month ago (the Census Bureau employment data for June is not due out until July 8, and the July data not until a month after that).
In the past, a few readers of this blog have given demand the credit for the summer job surge. In my view, demand contributes a little to the summer job surge (after all, agriculture, construction and other industries are expected to be more active when the weather is warmer), but supply is the primary reason that jobs are created during the summer.One basis for my opinion is that people in vast numbers become available for work when school lets out for the summer, and about the same number are no longer available when school resumes. For example, about 20 million people 16 and older are attending school during the academic year, and very few of them are working full time. Nobody knows the students' intentions for sure, but certainly millions of them would like to work during the summer.
I don't know of any change in demand occurring over the summer that would number in the millions (even doubling the size of our military overnight would not create much more than a million jobs).
It's easy to tell the summer supply stories and demand stories apart. The demand story is a lot like Christmas - customers demand, employers want to satisfy customers, so they hire more workers. If the demand story applied to summer, then we should see summer employment and work hours surge, and wages increase, too, while unemployment should dip.
If I'm right that the summer job surge comes from supply - the increased availability of workers - then summer wages and unemployment should follow patterns opposite to Christmas: wages should fall and unemployment surge. 
The charts below display three labor market indicators - weekly hours worked, hourly pay for full-time jobs and unemployment - for the two seasons. (I use data from the Current Population SurveyMerged Outgoing Rotation Group from January 2000 through December 2009).
The charts show seasonal spikes: the level of the indicator during the Christmas season (November and December) or the summer (June through August), relative to the indicator during the four months near the season. Wages and unemployment are represented as a proportional change from their off-season values, and spikes in hours are expressed as a proportion of a group's average hours for the entire season and adjacent months.
(A person not at work counts as zero. To create this particular chart - other charts and tables are also available - I focus on people less than 35 years old, because their job turnover rates are greater and thus more visibly display the effects of short-term fluctuations like Christmas or summer. Please note that I have truncated the green hours bar and indicated its actual value with text, because the teenage summer hours spike is 0.295, which far exceeds the scale needed to display the other figures.)
Each group's hours spike is positive on Christmas. During the summer, the hours spikes are positive only for the two younger age groups, which we expect because those are the groups attending school during the academic year and becoming suddenly available to work in June. All three Christmas wage spikes (middle panel) are positive, while all three summer wage spikes are negative.
It's hard to believe that summer involves the kind of demand surge we see over Christmas; summer wages and unemployment go in exactly the opposite direction that they do during Christmas.
Thus, the summer job surge is nothing like Christmas. The economy creates jobs in the summer - even during the last several years, when our economy supposedly suffered from a lack of demand - because millions of people become willing and available to work. This is not to say that everything is working well in the labor market - employment is much lower than it should be - it's just that greater labor supply remains one route to higher employment.
As noted by Greg Mankiw, the Harvard economist, and Gauti Eggertsson of the New York Fed, the fact that, even now, jobs are created when people are willing to work is a big challenge to the Keynesian economic model that assumes that labor supply is irrelevant during recessions, liquidity traps and other labor-market crises.
As Paul Krugman put it: "What's limiting employment now is lack of demand for the things workers produce. Their incentives to seek work are, for now, irrelevant." 
That's why Keynesians contend that expanding unemployment insurance can increase employment, even while they know that it erodes work incentives. Yes, unemployment is too high and employment is too low, and I applaud Keynesian economists for trying to understand that. 
But they have gone too far and have ultimately given the wrong advice, in assuming without proof that labor supply is irrelevant. The labor market's seasonal cycle shows pretty clearly that they're wrong.

HEADLINE: Economic Winner in 2010: North Dakota

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: New York was No. 2, while the biggest decline was in Wyoming, according to a report by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. 

 BODY:
Of all the states, North Dakota's economy grew fastest in 2010. The biggest decline was in Wyoming, according to a reportreleased Tuesday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
Click the interactive map below to see trends across the country:
As for North Dakota and Wyoming, how can two states so similar in shape and population density have such different fates?
The key seems to be mining.
In North Dakota, almost every sector grew at least a little. The biggest contribution to growth, though, was in mining.
In Wyoming, about equal numbers of sectors grew as shrank, but the biggest drag on the state economy was mining. 
After North Dakota, the state with the second-strongest economic improvement in 2010 was New York. The rebounding finance and insurance sector was New York's biggest source of growth, although most of the state's other industries also grew.

HEADLINE: The Real Reasons a Retailer Can't Get a Loan

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The owner of Kopp's Cycle responds to suggestions that his inability to get a loan is indicative of larger problems with his business. 

 BODY:
Our case study last week examined the efforts of a bicycle shop owner in Princeton, N.J., to secure a loan. Charles Kuhn, who runs Kopp's Cycle, had sought $1 million to refinance the mortgage on the shop, pay down debt, and obtain working capital. Unfortunately for Mr. Kuhn, the recession has hurt both his business and, apparently, the value of his real estate, undermining its potential as loan collateral.
But the lenders and other advisers we consulted suggested that Mr. Kuhn's inability to get a loan has more to do with how he has managed his business than the economic climate or the reluctance of bankers to make loans. "The first impression is we are trying to treat the symptom and not the cause," said Lorraine Allen, regional director of the Small Business Development Center at the College of New Jersey in nearby Ewing. "If the banks tell us we have a problem with cash flow, we have to trace through the lines of operation to see where the challenges are and address them, and not just for the sake of the loan." You're The Boss readers agreed.
Some commenters took issue with Mr. Kuhn's seeming disdain for the S.B.A.'s reporting requirements, while others faulted him for adjusting his salary to control profits. But many more readers had constructive advice for Mr. Kuhn, as did the other experts we consulted.
One commenter, Michael, of Spencer, Iowa, urged Mr. Kuhn not to cut prices on the accessories he sells. "The average consumer looks at the big thing -- in this case the bike -- and shops that hard," Michael wrote, recommending that Mr. Kuhn benchmark his bicycle prices against the Web sites his customers are shopping. "Accessories, on the other hand, are where he and most retailers -- including me -- make more money."
Barry Sloane, president and chief executive of Newtek Business Services in New York, agreed. "Cutting margin on all the accessories was suicide for the year. Margin pays bills," he said. "Instead, for anyone coming in his store with a PDA or ad with a lower price he should match the price. You can accommodate break price on a case-by-case basis just for the discriminating price-sensitive shopper without changing your regular prices or margin."
Michael suggested that Mr. Kuhn emphasize repairs - and that "his service rates should be high margin" - and other readers recommend he specifically target the customers of his online or big-box competitors, where new bikes come unassembled and often without warranties. "He should charge a fee to build a bike somebody buys on line, and offer a service package too," wrote DD, of Los Angeles. And "if someone comes into the store with a bike that needs servicing that wasn't bought there, then our guy should fleece the customer."
Several readers thought that Kopp's should become more engaged in the local community, sponsoring rides and a racing team, holding workshops and allying with livability organizations and other businesses. Ms. Allen, of the S.B.D.C., echoed this point: community groups "are like small arteries, marketing to their membership instead of in onesies or twosies," she said. "Maybe they host the weekly ride and partner with a bank or restaurant afterwards to sponsor discounts or water or something for the ride or the experience. The partner or sponsor will also be marketing the program as well as part of their participation in the community."
All of our outside experts thought the shop's Web site could be improved. Ms. Allen and Jay Townley, a bicycle store consultant based in Lyndon Station, Wis., both thought the site could use more social media elements, such as videos on bicycle repair and safety. "Social media, like the Web site, can be a pain to keep current," said Mr. Townley, "but Kopp's has the advantage of already working with a Web service that can provide content and assistance in integrating social media into the stores Web site and marketing." According to Mr. Townley, the Kopp's Web site is supplied by a company that tailors Web services to independent bike stores.
Ms. Allen thought the site needs more "local flavor - pictures of local events featuring bicycles, local bike news, etc. It looks like strictly a sales catalog, but people aren't buying that way now. They buy value, which equals price plus a sense of belonging and support, which often trumps just price." But Mr. Sloane felt that even as a sales mechanism, the site falls short. "The pictures of all bikes are small and look the same," he said. "There are no key words set up for organic search. The site should be arranged with an attractive catalog, call-to-action specials and a shopping cart that stands out and is easy to find."
In an e-mail message, Mr. Kuhn, who said he was attending to his sick mother, said that he was "overwhelmed" by all of the feedback to his story: "My plan is to take all of the responses to the article and use everything I can."
Mr. Kuhn did not address comments from some readers that he was not committed to building a business, though he did say he intended to develop a three-year plan, as Mr. Townley and several readers advised. He did, however, take exception to suggestions that he is not committed to cycling. "I have been working very hard for over 35 years full time and to question my love of bikes makes me upset," he wrote. "My father and I worked side by side from the day I could walk until he died. We traveled to Europe and coached riders together as well as the day to day at the shop."
As for Mr. Kopp's immediate financing concern, several readers suggested S.B.A. loans to refinance the present debt. (One suggested breaking the refinancing into several different S.B.A. component loans for the different types of debt.) But the most common suggestion was that Mr. Kuhn simply sell the building and relocate, or lease the space back. If the building is really worth as much as he thinks, they said, he could pay off his debt and plow the rest into his retirement or back into the business -- and find a bigger space for less elsewhere.
But Mr. Kuhn said that selling the building would be a last resort. And, in fact, he reported that sales have improved dramatically of late -- so much so that refinancing has become less pressing. He said the shop is "increasing turnover and focusing on our most profitable areas and dropping some that are not." Business, Mr. Kuhn concluded, is "the best in years."

HEADLINE: Answering Questions About the World's Food Supply

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: Responding to an article on the world's future food security, readers pose questions about the potential for future grain shortages, price spikes, the use of water, chemicals, and energy to produce meat and dairy products, and overpopulation. Justin Gillis replies. 

 BODY:
Many thanks to the dozens of readers who offered comments, criticisms and questions about my article in Sunday's paper about the world's food system. Below, I respond to a few questions that represent concerns raised by more than one reader.
Q. How can you dismiss the environmental effects that the Green Revolution has had? The chemical and seed technology companies have a lot at stake in you believing that this is the only way to feed the world. Why aren't people involved with farming without chemicals and biotechnology part of this conversation? There is certainly proof that organic can feed the world. Intensive agriculture depletes the soil, and do remember that there are as many obese people in the world as there are hungry, so we are obviously doing something wrong. In America we currently produce double the calories that each person needs. Hunger is not only about production, it is about distribution and politics.Rachel Berger
A.I do not dismiss the environmental effects. I take them seriously, and outlined them at some length in this blog post. It is beyond question that producing food for seven billion people has done massive damage to the planet, and that creating a more sustainable agriculture, even as we ramp up food production to meet rising demand, is one of the urgent challenges of our time. As you say, how food is distributed and how people eat -- too much in some places, too little in others -- are major issues, although they were beyond the scope of my recent article. I also agree with those readers who point out that food waste is a big issue. 
But my reporting has not turned up "proof that organic can feed the world" -- quite the contrary. Experts point out that organic production standards rule out the use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer, and without added nitrogen, it would be mathematically impossible to feed the current world population, much less a future population of 10 billion. Vaclav Smil outlines the situation in this piece. Agronomists told me that the crucial task for them is to take as many good ideas as they can from organic agriculture and related movements and transfer those into the conventional food system. In my Sunday blog post, I discussed one attempt to do this, through a technique called conservation agriculture, but clearly more efforts are needed in this direction.
Q.Perhaps the most significant unnamed driver of our looming food crisis is the massive use of grain, water, chemicals, and energy to produce meat and dairy products. For a start, please read the executive summary from the F.A.O.'s stunning report, "Livestock's Long Shadow."Shams, Kensington, Calif.
A.Thanks for the link to what is indeed an interesting report. Several readers have raised the question of why I didn't discuss the meat issue in my article. The point is well taken, in that rising meat consumption is a massive driver of demand in the food system. It is the reason China has a become a big importer of Brazilian soybeans, to cite just one among many examples of the environmental cost of meat. I dodged the subject in my piece partly because we have written so much about it in the Times over the years. But I avoided it for another reason, too. So far as I can determine, no one has come up with any public policy that would substantially lower the demand for meat and, at the same time, has a realistic prospect of being adopted. 
My analysis of this was influenced some years ago by a speech given in Des Moines by Sir Gordon Conway, then a senior scientific adviser to the British government. He started by acknowledging that lowering meat demand would ease many of the world's food problems, but then he said, "I just don't think it's going to happen." He pointed out that the world's governments are likely to let consumer sovereignty prevail on this, as they have already for many decades, and the world's consumers are not abandoning meat -- they are moving in the other direction.
It's easy to see why politicians stay away from this topic. If they proposed policies that might actually reduce demand, such as high taxes on meat, they would probably get run out of town with pitchforks. Assuming the trend lines do not change, rising consumption of meat represents a demand on the food system that is going to have to be met, at least in the coming few decades. One can raise interesting speculations about the distant future; it really is hard to envision a planet of 10 billion people in the year 2100 eating the way that Americans eat today. I don't really have a clue what happens between now and then; but take a look at Michael Specter's recent New Yorker piece suggesting that we could wind up growing our meat in test tubes. In the meantime, if anybody has ideas for a public policy that can actually pass and would drastically curtail meat-eating, the floor is open for nominations. 
Q. I wonder if we, as a nation, have any sort of plan or strategy for how to deal with either the possibility of grain shortages here or the certainty of price spikes to come. Is anyone in Washington even thinking about this, or will we be left to what is euphemistically referred to as "market-based solutions," i.e. price gouging, profiteering by speculators and growing domestic hunger?Keith, Portland, Ore.
A.Keith, the experts I interviewed tend to agree with you that people in Washington need to be thinking not only about the national interest, but also about what constitutes ethical behavior in times of shortage. We are seeing the beginnings of this kind of thinking, but only the beginnings. During the price crisis in 2008, governments imposed export bans, essentially engaging in national hoarding that subsequent reports found had only worsened the situation. The year 2010 was not as bad, despite renewed price spikes, because the World Bank and other agencies leaned on governments to stay calm and not try to cut themselves off from the world market. 
Nowadays, many people are asking whether the world requires an emergency food stockpile beyond those that already exist in some countries, and how that would be managed and controlled. And how could the United States safeguard its interests -- while recognizing that its grain exports are critical to food security for millions of people abroad?
Q.India's wheat production this year has been largest to date. This fact doesn't fit with your theory. How do you explain this?Jagga, Chicago
A.Your argument reminds me of those who say, "A big snowstorm fell in my town last winter, therefore global warming must not be real." Scientists say that what matters is the long-term trends for the planet as a whole, not what happened in a given location in a given year. Q.What assurances do we have that the results of this work [on drought-resistant plants] will be freely available and remain in the public domain for all? For example it is not very hard to envision the more-than-likely scenario of a Monsanto or Bayer patenting a DNA sequence required to make a plant hardier to drought, applying the patent to both [genetically engineered and hybrid seeds] and demanding outrageous profit from a starving people.RichWa, Banks, Ore.
A.There is indeed a possibility that patented innovations, like new drought-resistant seed varieties, will fail to reach many of the poor farmers who need them most because distribution to those farmers is unprofitable for companies. Yet much of the world's most important crop-breeding research is still done in public institutions like the research centers on rice, wheat and corn that I mentioned in my article, and they make their work freely available to the world's poor farmers. Also, interesting collaborations are starting to occur between public-spirited institutions like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and private entities like Monsanto, as I discussed in this blog post. 
As part of a Gates-financed project, Monsanto has donated a genetically engineered drought-tolerant corn for use by farmers in Africa, and many expect that this sort of thing will become more common in the future. A good comparison here might be the drug companies' initial reluctance to make AIDS drugs available at low prices in poor countries. That eventually changed, as a result of activism by watchdog groups.
Q. Tooooooooooooo many people. Family planning is the only answer.Scientella, Northern California
A.You and many other readers wrote in to point out that the population explosion receives relatively little discussion. How far could the population growth curve be bent if the global community put more energy and money into family-planning programs and education for girls? Many policy experts believe it could be bent quite a lot. To all those readers who wonder why I didn't discuss this in the food piece, it was simply beyond the scope of that article, which was meant to focus tightly on climate change and the future food supply.
I was not saying that the population issue is unimportant. In fact, my colleague Celia W. Dugger and I collaborated on a front-page article about the population problem in the newspaper a few weeks ago, and we discussed the potential role of family-planning programs in some detail in a subsequent blog post. Other coverage on this issue is planned in The Times in coming weeks and months.

HEADLINE: Last Days, Perhaps, for Group That Sued for Poor School Districts

BYLINE: SHARON OTTERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Campaign for Fiscal Equity, whose lawsuit brought billions of additional dollars to poor school districts in New York, may have to close its doors or merge with a similar New Jersey-based group. 

 BODY:
After a series of setbacks, the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the advocacy organization whose victory in a historic lawsuit brought billions of additional dollars to poor school districts in New York State, has run out of money to sustain itself, the organization said.
The organization's last remaining employee, Helaine K. Doran, will leave the group's Lower Manhattan office this month and, essentially, lock the door behind her. 
While its future is not yet certain, the president of its board of directors, Luis Miranda, said on Tuesday that the group was in talks to merge with the New Jersey-based Education Law Center, which two weeks ago won a $500 million judgment in its own long-standing school-financing litigation, known as the Abbott case.
The differing trajectory of the two organizations, which share the same mission, may be a result of the different ways their cases were handled by their state's courts, both of which found that students in poor districts were being deprived of their constitutional right to a sound basic education.
It also reflects a changed climate for education philanthropy, as donors flock to newer ideas, like research into teacher effectiveness and charter schools, instead of the decades-old legal struggle for equality in school financing among rich and poor districts.
When the Campaign for Fiscal Equity won its case in 2006 after 13 years of litigation, the New York State Court of Appeals largely left it to the Legislature to decide how much additional state aid should flow to poor districts. In 2007, Gov. Eliot Spitzer pledged to phase in $7 billion in additional funding over five years, with $5.4 billion to New York City alone. 
But two years later, when the state was hit by the economic downturn, the Legislature froze the additional aid at the prior year's levels. And this year, the Legislature's overall $1.3 billion cut in education aid brings financing levels roughly back to pre-lawsuit levels, said Billy Easton, the executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, another education advocacy organization.
New York City, for example, will get $643 million in Campaign for Fiscal Equity funds next year from the state, but the overall cut in state aid is $812 million, translating into a net decrease, according to the city's Department of Education.
 "There is a huge sense of disappointment that the gains that were gotten in the compromise have been pushed to the future rather than the present, and that education continues to be cut, and the goal of having a sound basic education for every child is unfulfilled," Mr. Miranda said.
Under Geri D. Palast, who became the campaign's executive director in 2006, the group kept reminding donors that the struggle for resources was not over, and conducted research to show where inequities remain. 
But it was tough work to do what Mr. Miranda called "the constant re-education that yes, policing of the decision needs to continue." Eventually, he said, there was "funding fatigue." "We realized that it would be impossible to financially sustain an agency standing by itself," Mr. Miranda said of the organization's internal discussions for the last year and a half. Ms. Palast resigned in March and became the managing director of the Israel Action Network, an initiative to defend publicly Israel's right to exist. She also joined the board for the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, which concluded that the best way to sustain the group's main legacy would be to find a way to return to its core strength of litigation. 
That prompted the group to begin talks with the Education Law Center, whose victory was proving more robust. Unlike in New York, the New Jersey Supreme Court has issued a series of follow-up rulings since 1990 ordering millions to poor districts for specific programs, from preschool to curriculum reform.
One idea would to be for the Education Law Center to have a New York advisory board or advisory component that would retain the Campaign for Fiscal Equity name, Mr. Miranda said.
David Sciarra, the executive director of the Education Law Center wrote in an e-mail: "We've been asked to explore how the center can continue the C.F.E. legal effort to secure adequate funding for New York's school children." 
Ms. Doran, whose last day at the campaign is June 15, said that even though the organization was "in transition," that should not be interpreted as a defeat. She stressed that the campaign as a whole had helped change attitudes about the need for equitable funding for poor districts, even though overcrowding and large class sizes remain an issue.
"There's fight left in a lot of people," she said. "I get invited to sometimes go talk to kids about C.F.E., and there was this one student who said, 'shouldn't we just give up?' And I said, 'No, I've been doing this for 20 years, we can't give up. This is too important.' "

HEADLINE: A Voice From the Past Advises Cuomo on the Future

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: A 1919 report has inspired Governor Cuomo to create a panel to reorganize a government apparatus that has grown to number what he says are more than 1,000 state agencies, authorities and commissions. 

 BODY:
Chances are it's not going to be on the average New Yorker's summer reading list, but Andrew M. Cuomo took it along in 2010, the year before he became governor, on an Alaskan cruise with his two daughters. 
And despite its off-putting title - "Report of Reconstruction Commission to Gov. Alfred E. Smith on Retrenchment and Reorganization in the State Government" - the 1919 report is peppered with the caustic wit and wisdom of the commission's chief of staff, Robert Moses. And it has already inspired Mr. Cuomo to name a new panel to revamp the bureaucracy that has grown up again since the 1920s to number what he says are more than 1,000 state agencies, authorities and commissions.
"For example," Mr. Cuomo said earlier this year, "the Department of Health alone has at least 87 statutorily created administrative units, including 46 councils, 17 boards, 6 institutes, 6 committees, 5 facilities, 2 task forces, 2 offices, 2 advisory panels and a work group." The number of state employees has swelled to about 200,000 today, from about 29,000 under Governor Smith. 
Mr. Cuomo's Spending and Government Efficiency Commission is expected to deliver its first report this month and will reportedly recommend consolidation of the State Thruway Authority with the state's Transportation Department, merging the state health and alcohol abuse agencies and paring back-office administrative services that are duplicated by many departments. A final report is due June 1, 2012.
Mr. Moses, recruited by Belle Moskowitz, Governor Smith's right-hand woman, completed the report in his Manhattan apartment on West 87th Street. But proposing reform was a far cry from enacting it. The 419-page proposal to establish 18 departments was approved twice by the Legislature and then by the voters in 1925 but would take until 1932 to be fully implemented. (It saved about $6 million annually in a roughly $140 million budget.)
The result was to transform an organization chart that Robert A. Caro, Mr. Moses' biographer, likened to "a web spun by a drunken spider" into what the columnist Walter Lippmann called "one of the greatest achievements in modern American politics."
Accompanied by detailed fold-out charts, the 1919 report confronted what it described as "a miscellaneous collection of 187 offices, boards, commissions and other agencies" that are "nearly all independent of one another and most of them are subject to no direct and effective supervision by a superior authority."
 "No governor can be held responsible for the policies and conduct of high officers whom he does not appoint and whom he cannot remove," the report said. 
"Every agency of the government is jealous of its own prerogatives," it continued. "It resists orders and inspections; it tends to develop its own practices for keeping records and accounting for public funds. The more spigots there are in the barrel, the more difficult it is to keep watch on them." "There are too many streams and rivulets running out of New York's treasury," the commission concluded.
Mr. Caro, who possesses Governor Smith's own copy of the report, described it as "a remarkable blueprint of how government, through reorganization can be made more efficient and economical." He attributed that largely to Mr. Moses.
"It was done by Robert Moses in the days before he was 'The Power Broker,' when he was an idealistic young reformer," Mr. Caro said. "It was a brilliant document, sort of revolutionary. It remade the whole machinery of state government and, for a time, under the governorships of Al Smith, Franklin Roosevelt, Herbert Lehman it really worked to make government more responsible to the initiatives of the governor. Smith realized that he couldn't get things through because of the machinery of government."
And now, 80 years later?
"I think it's as dysfunctional as it was then," Mr. Caro said.

HEADLINE: Reader Q. and A.: In India, Dynamism Wrestles With Dysfunction

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Jim Yardley is answering readers' questions about India's extraordinarily rapid, yet messy, development. 

 BODY:
India, with one-sixth of all humanity, is expected to become the world's fastest-growing economy as soon as next year thanks to aggressive, free-wheeling businesses that in many cases are becoming the behemoths that state-run goliaths are in China. 
In the first of several articles looking at the indiosyncrasies of India's extraordinary economic growth, Jim Yardley reports on the developing sprawl of Gurgaon, an affluent suburb of New Delhi where gleaming skyscrapers, technology businesses and shopping malls coexist with raw sewage and a basic lack of government services. It manages to be a mess and a success at the same time, an example of what is happening in much of the country. 
Mr. Yardley writes: 
With its shiny buildings and galloping economy, Gurgaon is often portrayed as a symbol of a rising "new" India, yet it also represents a riddle at the heart of India's rapid growth: How can a new city become an international economic engine without basic public services? How can a huge country flirt with double-digit growth despite widespread corruption, inefficiency and governmental dysfunction?
In Gurgaon and elsewhere in India, the answer is that growth usually occurs despite the government rather than because of it. India and China are often considered to be the world's rising economic powers, yet if China's growth has been led by the state, India's growth is often impeded by the state. China's authoritarian leaders have built world-class infrastructure; India's infrastructure and the country's bureaucracy are both considered woefully outdated. ... "You could call it the United States of Gurgaon," said Sanjay Kaul, a civic activist critical of the city's lack of planning who argues that Gurgaon is a patchwork of private islands more than an interconnected city. "You are on your own." 
Mr. Yardley will answer readers' questions about the ongoing series and Gurgaon as an illustration of how private development has outpaced public services in many of India's economic hubs. Post a question in the comments box below. We will publish Mr. Yardley's responses in a subsequent Lede post.

HEADLINE: Economic Winner in 2010: North Dakota

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: New York was No. 2, while the biggest decline was in Wyoming, according to a report by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. 

 BODY:
Of all the states, North Dakota's economy grew fastest in 2010. The biggest decline was in Wyoming, according to a reportreleased Tuesday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
Click the interactive map below (requires Java plug-in) to see trends across the country:
As for North Dakota and Wyoming, how can two states so similar in shape and population density have such different fates?
The key seems to be mining.
In North Dakota, almost every sector grew at least a little. The biggest contribution to growth, though, was in mining.
In Wyoming, about equal numbers of sectors grew as shrank, but the biggest drag on the state economy was mining. 
After North Dakota, the state with the second-strongest economic improvement in 2010 was New York. The rebounding finance and insurance sector was New York's biggest source of growth, although most of the state's other industries also grew.

HEADLINE: Reimagining Auto Retail for Electric Cars

BYLINE: JOSIE GARTHWAITE


HIGHLIGHT: Tesla, Coda, Amp and Fisker all propose significant changes to the conventional dealership model. 

 BODY:
For independent electric car companies, it's so long, automobile row.
Some electric vehicle manufacturers have jettisoned the old model of franchise auto dealerships in an effort to change not only how we drive, but also how we buy cars.
"Because we're ushering in a new powertrain, it's an opportunity to say, 'Should we shake up everything?' " Steve Burns, president of Amp Electric Vehicles, wondered in a telephone interview. 
The conventional retail model took a PR beating last week, as some Chevrolet dealers were found to be selling the plug-in hybrid Volt to other dealers and claiming a federal green-vehicle tax credit for themselves, rather than making it available to consumers.
Some start-up E.V. manufacturers reject the old franchise model in favor of Internet sales or running their own stores directly, which can give the new companies a much-needed dose of consumer confidence.
In conceiving its showrooms, Tesla Motors looked to leaders in consumer electronics, particularly Apple. The company intends its stores to be places where people "spend time when they're not looking to buy a car," said George Blankenship, the former Apple and Gap retail chief who now heads Tesla's retail strategy. The goal is to provide an enjoyable, educational and low-pressure customer experience, so that when a prospective buyer is ready to buy, "they'll remember," he said.
Coda Automotive, based in Santa Monica, Calif., plans to sell its Coda Sedan, priced at $44,900 before applicable tax credits, directly to customers through the Internet. But the company also intends to build showrooms staffed by representatives working without commission. Like Tesla, Coda is looking at high-traffic areas close to core markets, like the Westfield Century City mall in Los Angeles, where Coda is scheduled to open its first showroom next month.
That said, Bill Beasley, head of automotive sales at Coda, is not ruling out more conventional retail strategies, seeing "traditional dealership arrangements and big-box partnerships" as a way to increase the company's retail footprint, he wrote in an e-mail.
Forging a new path is not without risk. As Tesla has noted in regulatory filings, some state laws intended to protect franchise dealers could prohibit or interfere with sales and marketing plans. And those high-traffic storefronts in affluent neighborhoods do not come cheap.
"To educate people on just your product, that's really an expensive route to go," said Mr. Burns. So far Amp has sold its vehicles through a distributor or directly to customers, and is still devising a plan for higher volume sales.
The old franchise dealership model does retain points of appeal, however. "A hundred years of car- making in the United States has produced this," Mr. Burns said. "We don't necessarily want to change it."
Fisker Automotive, a California-based E.V. brand assembling its Karma plug-in hybrid luxury sedan in Finland, is taking a more conventional retail approach. After several delays, Fisker plans to begin selling its flagship sedan in July through a network of 45 dealers in the United States, with more in Europe and China.
There's room to innovate even within the franchise dealership model, according to Jack Nerad, executive market analyst and editorial director for Kelley Blue Book. For example, Saturn, despite its later financial troubles, was able to create a "customer-friendly approach" to selling cars through dealerships that may appeal to cash-strapped start-ups, he said.
For the moment, Mr. Burns noted that both his company and other independent E.V. producers were "all living off the enthusiasts," the early adopters who pay a little more to own new technology before their neighbor. By the time these early adopters enter Amp's Cincinnati showroom, he said, they know what they want and what is available from other brands.
Mr. Burns expects a new generation of dealers to emerge that is versed in the pros and cons of different electric models as well as issues like charge-point availability. But the business of buying and selling E.V.'s, he said, would still require "somebody you trust shaking your hand," whether virtually or in the flesh.

HEADLINE: Fervor for Tech I.P.O.'s Doesn't Reach Other Sectors

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: While investors clamor for technology companies, other companies have been forced to cut the size of their offerings or even pull their market debuts altogether. 

 BODY:
While a handful of initial public offerings are hitting the market with a pop, many are landing with a thud.
Following the frenzied debuts of LinkedIn, Yandex and other new Internet shares, it's easy to forget that dozens of other I.P.O.'s this year are falling below size expectations or not producing double-digit price gains. Investors just don't have the same fervor for nontechnology offerings, which in the United States have raised $22 billion so far this year, or roughly 80 percent of the total I.P.O. volume.
Given lackluster demand, some companies have been forced to cut the size of their offerings, watch their shares suffer or even withdraw their offerings altogether. In early June, Resourcehouse, the Australian mining company, shelved its plans for a listing in Hong Kong, citing unfavorable market conditions. Russian Helicopters, a state-owned aerospace group, and the payment company Skrill postponed their London debuts for similar reasons.
"Investors are eager for specific sectors, not I.P.O.'s in general," said Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida.
It's a two-tiered I.P.O. market.
Investors are clamoring for technology companies, attracted by strong growth expectations and a swelling number of users. LinkedIn, which more than doubled on its first day of trading, is up 85 percent from its debut. Yandex shares have risen 37 percent.
The double-digit gains have helped propel the industry's overall returns. In 2011, American technology offerings are up 26 percent on average, versus 12 percent for the rest of the market, according to the data provider Dealogic.
The strong returns for technology stocks reflect, in part, the lack of comparable public companies. With few publicly traded stocks in the social networking space, investors are more willing to pay sky-high valuations, even for untested business plans. Groupon, the daily deals site that is still unprofitable, filed for an I.P.O. in early June, an offering that could value the company at $30 billion, more than the search giant Google at its debut in 2004.
"A lack of valuation models is driving up the price of social media I.P.O.'s," said Julie Teigland, strategic growth markets leader at Ernst & Young for Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa.
Offerings in more established industries like commodities, manufacturing and retail have a long list of publicly traded rivals, allowing investors to more easily judge potential performance and valuation. With ready comparisons, the offerings in these sectors aren't likely to experience large first-day trading pops or enjoy multibillion-dollar debuts. The flip side is that these stocks, priced at more appropriate levels, may prove less volatile and offer better potential long-term returns for investors - and not just those that get in at the I.P.O.
For nontechnology offerings, demand and pricing largely depend on the company's underlying business model, growth prospects and financial health. For example, Spirit Airlines, a low-cost carrier that flies from Florida to the Caribbean and Latin America, had to cut the size of its offering by 35 percent, on concerns that rising fuel costs would crimp earnings. Shares of the airline lost 4 percent on their first day of trading in late May.
"Spirit has a tough case to make convincing investors they'll beat the history of failed airline I.P.O.'s," Professor Ritter said.
Timing also matters. Investors gobbled up private equity-backed companies earlier in the year when I.P.O. volume was still relatively low. The hospital operator HCA raised a $3.8 billion, the most on record for a private equity-owned company. It also topped the debuts of the energy company Kinder Morgan and Nielsen, the consumer research company.
But as focus has shifted to social networking, an offering for Freescale Semiconductor Holdings - a chip maker that was taken private in 2006 in what was called "one of the ugliest buyouts ever" - did not excite investors. The company, which has struggled to maintain profitability under its $7 billion debt load, raised just $783 million, down from initial estimates of $1 billion. The stock is up 1 percent since going public in late May.
With few debuts for technology companies, the I.P.O. market in Europe has fared particularly poorly. The sovereign debt crisis, which has crippled economic growth and left unemployment stubbornly high, has weighed on the market, especially newly minted stocks. The 19 European offerings this year, which have raised more than $100 million, are down 2.6 percent on average, based on Dealogic data. A broader index of stocks on the Continent is off a little more than 1 percent.
"Europe is lagging behind the U.S. and Asia," said Richard Weaver, a capital markets partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. "Concerns about the weak economy are unsettling the markets."
Even Glencore International, the commodities giant that had one the most highly anticipated offerings of the year, has struggled. It made a splashy $10 billion debut in May, the largest offering so far this year. But its shares quickly slipped over fears of a slowdown in Asia. Adding to the pressure, the European Investment Bank, a publicly owned financial institution, said a few weeks later that it had found tax irregularities at a Glencore subsidiary in Zambia and was investigating the matter. The company denies the allegations.
The company's chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, attributed the stock slump to a weakness in broad commodities prices. He told reporters after the listing ceremony in Hong Kong that the shares were just "following the rest of the markets." Since its I.P.O., the stock has dropped 2.5 percent.
Despite the market disparity, the global I.P.O. pipeline is still filling up with companies of all types. The Spanish savings bank Bankia is expected to go public this summer. Samsonite, the private equity-owned luggage maker, is planning a listing in Hong Kong. And in the United States, Dunkin' Brands Group, the owner of Dunkin' Donuts, filed in early May to go public.
In April and May, 36 companies set a price range for their offerings, up from 32 in the first three months of the year. It's the strongest activity since 2007, according to the data provider Renaissance Capital.
"Investor optimism is on the rise," said Lee Simmons, an industry specialist at Hoover's, which tracks I.P.O.'s. "We're coming out of the recession, and people have money to spend."

HEADLINE: Bank Said No? Hedge Funds Fill a Void in Lending

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The funds are lending to customers who have been rejected by traditional banks, but there are risks for those involved and to the broader economy. 

 BODY:
Hedge fund managers have been called plenty of names.
Now, they can add another: local banker.
When Rentech, a clean energy business in Los Angeles, was rejected by its long-time banker last year, it asked a hedge fund for money instead. "You have to take what's available at the time," said D. Hunt Ramsbottom, chief executive of Rentech, which has since borrowed $100 million in this unconventional way.
With traditional lenders still avoiding risky borrowers in the wake of the financial crisis, hedge funds and other opportunistic investors are stepping into the void. They are going after midsize businesses that cannot easily raise money in the bond markets like their bigger brethren.
The support is critical in a recovery characterized by high unemployment and anemic growth. These middle-market companies, which generate $6 trillion in revenue a year and employ 32 million people in the United States, are borrowing billions of dollars from the hedge funds for product development, strategic acquisitions and even day-to-day operations like payroll and utilities.
But the lending force also poses a significant risk to the companies and the broader economy, given the unregulated nature of this shadow banking system.
These lenders of last resort typically charge interest rates that are several percentage points higher than banks. Loaded up with high-cost loans, borrowers could find themselves falling deeper into debt or worse, into bankruptcy. Over the last year, Rentech has borrowed from a group of funds, led by Highbridge Capital Management and Goldman Sachs, at an interest rate of 12.5 percent.
"On the one hand, the cost of money is more expensive than what some businesses might be used to," Mr. Ramsbottom said. "On the other, if the money is not available, the cost is infinite."
The lending activity is also stoking fears that speculative activities - like those that contributed to the crisis - are shifting from banks to loosely regulated firms that play by their own rules. While policy makers are moving to increase capital and other standards for banks to prevent another disaster, hedge funds and the like are not subject to the same oversight.
If firms load up on debt and the market goes into a tailspin again, the shadow banking system could implode and threaten the entire economy.
"These institutions are essentially servicing a part of the market where banks are not lending," said Debarshi Nandy, a professor at York University's business school in Toronto. "The million-dollar question is, Are we benefiting?"
Hedge funds offered a crucial lifeline for Rentech. The company is hoping to build a facility about 60 miles east of Los Angeles to transform yard clippings into fuel, enough for 75,000 cars. If it works, the project would represent Rentech's first commercial success in its nearly 30-year history.
Unprofitable for decades, Rentech is a risky proposition for a traditional lender. While large corporations with healthy balance sheets can easily tap into the bond markets or borrow from banks, their smaller counterparts with shakier credit have fewer options.
Middle-market companies, with revenue of $25 million to $1 billion, do not typically sell bonds. And their main financing sources, specialty lenders like CIT Group and regional banks, have not fully recovered. Last year, debt securities focused on this segment stood at $12 billion, down from $35 billion in 2005, according Standard & Poor's Leveraged Commentary and Data. 
Hedge funds and other investors are flush with capital. Last year, Highbridge, which is owned by JPMorgan Chase, started a $1.6 billion fund that lends money to midsize companies. The private equity firm Blackstone Group started a $3 billion fund. Even FrontPoint, the firm hobbled by an insider trading investigation, has raised $1 billion for a lending fund and plans to double the size, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. 
The concern is that hedge funds are looking for quick payoffs rather than long-term opportunities - and will bolt if there is trouble. A previous wave of money managers that jumped into lending after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 saw their loans sour. The firms, mainly smaller, fringe players, have since disappeared.
"The new funds rushing into direct lending now will learn the hard way that it is easy to make what appear to be sound loans as the economy is improving, but it becomes brutal to either collect the loans or foreclose when the downturn comes," said Max Holmes, the founder of Plainfield Asset Management, whose lending-focused fund, once as large as $5 billion, is winding down.
Unlike their predecessors, players today say they are operating like community bankers, focusing on multiyear deals backed by significant collateral and capital. They are also locking up investors' money for years rather than quarters. This can alleviate some short-term pressures.
"The people who last are those with a relationship-oriented business, not those who view it as a trade," said Rob Ladd of D. E. Shaw, which manages $1.7 billion in lending strategies.
Stephen J. Czech of FrontPoint spent weeks researching Emerald Performance Materials. He scoured the chemical manufacturer's financials, visited several facilities, and met with executives - all of which gave him the confidence to lend the company money.
Emerald used the loan to buy a European rival. "All types of financing were considered," said Candace Wagner, Emerald's president, but the company preferred the "flexibility and certainty" of FrontPoint.
Some who borrowed from hedge funds have not been so satisfied. Hedge funds have been lumped with payday lenders that charge usury rates. Plainfield has been accused of predatory lending in civil suits, and local and federal authorities have looked into the firm's practices. Plainfield said it won or settled all of the suits and investigators closed their inquiries without taking action.
The creditors of Radnor Holdings, a disposable-cup company that defaulted on a roughly $100 million loan, claimed Tennenbaum Capital Partners charged excessively high rates as a takeover tactic, a strategy referred to as "loan to own." After a protracted legal battle, the fund took control of Radnor in 2006, renaming it WinCup.
Tennenbaum did not return calls for comment.
Another worry is that funds will trade on nonpublic information they receive as lenders. A March study in The Journal of Financial Economics found a spike in investors betting against the shares of companies that took hedge fund loans. Businesses that borrow from banks did not experience the same activity, according to the authors, including Professor Nandy.
For Mr. Ramsbottom of Rentech, the benefits outweighed the risks. While the company could end up losing the profitable fertilizer plant it put up as collateral on the loan, Rentech can continue to pursue the clean energy venture.
"An entrepreneur will pay whatever," he said, "to keep his business alive."
An article on Thursday about business lending by hedge funds misstated in one instance the surname of the chief executive of Rentech, a clean energy business in California that borrowed $100 million from a group of hedge funds. As noted elsewhere in the article, he is D. Hunt Ramsbottom, not Huntsbottom.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, around the Web and happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times
 Tim Pawlenty delivered the first major policy speech of his presidential campaign on Tuesday, calling out the competition no matter which team they play for. He intensified criticism of President Obama's economic policies, accusing the president of being satisfied with a "second-rate American economy" and of ignoring the country's fiscal problems. Mr. Pawlenty then took aim at his Republican rivals, essentially daring them to go further than he did Tuesday in calling for large tax and spending cuts, The Times's Michael D. Shear reports. 
 Representative Anthony D. Weiner had a bad day Monday as he went public with the admission of his salacious online behavior. And Tuesday wasn't any better. The Times's Michael Barbaro and David W.

The gears of government tend to grind slowly, except in Wisconsin where the pace has become turbocharged. The Times's Monica Davey reports on the marathon round of legislation being advanced in the Republican-dominated State Senate as lawmakers risk losing their newly won majority as early as next month when special elections are held. The Pentagon Papers that were leaked four decades ago have been formally declassified, and will be released in their entirety next month. Forty years after the documents unofficially became public record, some were surprised to learn that the nation's worst-kept secret was still a secret, The Times's Michael Cooper and Sam Roberts report. As the American media continue to embrace social networking as the next frontier in news, government broadcasting abroad has been slow to take the leap. When the Voice of America pushed to shut down its shortwave radio broadcasts to China and invest instead in the Internet, cellphones and other forms of digital media, some in Congress condemned the move, saying it would deprive Chinese listeners of unfiltered news. With the Obama administration embarking on a sweeping overhaul of the Voice of America and other official broadcasters - one that seeks to adapt their traditional diplomatic mission to the era of Facebook and Twitter - the criticism could be a preview of the political hurdles to come, The Times's Mark Landler reports.Around the Web Two prominent House chairmen are against a proposal to shift financing in the Patent and Trademark Office from annual appropriations approved by Congress to a system of collecting and spending authorized fees, Politico reports.Happenings around Washington The Auburn University football team won the 2010 B.C.S.

HEADLINE: Pawlenty Challenges Romney on the Economy

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Tim Pawlenty's economic policy speech on Tuesday took direct aim at President Obama. But the intended target may have been someone else entirely. 

 BODY:
Tim Pawlenty's economic policy speech on Tuesday took direct aim at President Obama. But the intended target may have been someone else entirely.
By offering a dramatic tax-cut proposal, the former Republican governor of Minnesota was sending a message to the party's front-runner, Mitt Romney, that he does not intend to cede the economic issues as the two men battle for the Republican party's presidential nomination.
"We can fix our economy," Mr. Pawlenty pledged during a speech at the University of Chicago. "Our people are ready to get back to work. We just need to give them tools to get there. And get the government out of the way."
Mr. Pawlenty did not mention Mr. Romney in the speech. But the rivalry between the two ex-governors is clearly heating up, and the challenge from Mr. Pawlenty on Tuesday was clear: beat this.
It is Mr. Romney, after all, who has staked a claim as the candidate best positioned to challenge Mr. Obama's handling of the recession and its aftermath. In his announcement speech last week, Mr. Romney said he will run on his record as an ex-businessman and economic turnaround specialist.
"The American ideals of economic freedom and opportunity need a clear and unapologetic defense, and I intend to make it-because I have lived it," Mr. Romney declared in New Hampshire.
But Mr. Romney has not yet offered many specifics about his plans for the economy. He promised to cap federal spending at 20 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. And he said that as president he would make taxes competitive, create jobs, modernize regulations and reduce bureaucracy.
That vagueness has opened the door for Mr. Pawlenty, who vowed on Tuesday to keep federal spending at 18 percent of G.D.P. - lower than Mr. Romney promised - and proposed large and specific tax cuts that would slash business and individual rates to their lowest levels in decades.
Mr. Pawlenty promised to do away with taxes on dividends and capital gains, cut spending by trillions of dollars and rev up America's engine to create 5 percent annual growth for a decade.
Democratic critics of Mr. Pawlenty's plan quickly derided it as a disaster for the nation's budget deficit that would lower taxes for the wealthy and increase the burdens on the middle class. But with Republican voters, the plan will probably serve as an opening bid in the emerging competition with Mr. Romney.
For Mr. Pawlenty, who remains relatively unknown and is trailing in most political surveys, the plan has potential pitfalls.
As Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin discovered when he unveiled his budget and Medicare plans recently, being definitive and bold can backfire by creating a target for rivals, critics and adversaries.
Mr. Pawlenty could find his plan picked apart for months by Mr. Romney and his other Republican rivals. The first opportunity for a face-to-face engagement will take place Monday when both men are scheduled to participate in New Hampshire's first Republican presidential debate.
But Mr. Pawlenty stands to benefit, politically, if he manages to present himself as a credible alternative to Mr. Romney when it comes to the economic issues that surveys suggest are at the top of most voters' minds this year.
He may not even have to come out on top in that comparison. By simply contesting the issue with Mr. Romney, the former Minnesota governor could invite voters to focus on other differences between the two men - differences that some may conclude favor him.
On health care, for example, Mr. Romney continues to struggle to explain how his state health care plan differs from Mr. Obama's federal one. And Mr. Pawlenty may have closer ties to some conservatives in the party who have long remained distrustful of Mr. Romney. 
In some ways, the speeches by the two men were remarkably similar. Both appeared eager to lash out at Mr. Obama, portraying him as singlehandedly responsible for the country's job losses and economic distress.
"Barack Obama has failed America," Mr. Romney said. "When he took office, the economy was in recession. He made it worse. And he made it last longer."
Mr. Pawlenty said that Mr. Obama is "satisfied with a second-rate American economy produced by his third-rate policies. I'm not."
On those points, they agree. But don't expect the kumbaya feeling to last much longer.

HEADLINE: Obama Talks Up Job Training

BYLINE: HELENE C. COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama visits a community college to talk about training people for jobs in manufacturing. 

 BODY:
President Obama came to a community college near Washington on Wednesday to talk up a $2 billion program aimed at tailoring lessons in community colleges across the country to match the needs of manufacturing companies.
The program, "Skills for America's Future," is part of the administration's response to the unemployment rate, which rose to 9.1 percent in May, heightening fears of a slowdown in the economic recovery.
"Obviously we're slowly recovering from a very painful recession," Mr. Obama said at Northern Virginia Community College. "But there are too many people out there still out of work."
Mr. Obama's is battling a loss of confidence in his handling of the economy. A Washington Post poll this week showed him in an almost dead heat with Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, among likely voters, and Mr. Obama's political backers are increasingly worried that the lagging economy will hurt Mr. Obama's re-election hopes.
"Right now there are people all across America with talent waiting to be tapped," Mr. Obama said. "Sparks waiting to be lit. Our job is to light them."
The point of the program is to train half a million community college students for manufacturing jobs over the next five years, who would help offset the gap left by the 2.7 million older works who will be retiring in the next decade or so, White House officials said.
Obama administration officials said that the National Association of Manufacturers is now backing the program.

HEADLINE: Hour by Hour, a Measure of Economic Stress

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The decline in production workers' hours makes clear the depth of the economic downturn. 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, highlighted a relatively obscure measure of economic health, "aggregate hours of production workers," to make the important point that our economy is not very healthy at all.
The name pretty much explains the statistic: It measures the total number of hours that Americans are paid to work in production jobs, which make up 80 percent of all jobs.
Why not take the measure of all jobs? Well, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has done just that since 2006, and the numbers show a similar decline, but it has tracked production hours since 1964, allowing comparisons with other recessions.
The comparisons, as Mr. Bernanke noted Tuesday, are not good.Paid hours "fell, remarkably, by nearly 10 percent from the beginning of the recent recession through October 2009," he said. Moreover, after two years of renewed growth, paid hours remain about 6.5 percent below the prerecession peak.
"For comparison," Mr. Bernanke continued, "the maximum decline in aggregate hours worked during the deep 1981-82 recession was less than 6 percent."
No other recession since 1964 has produced a comparable decline in hours worked.
The hours-worked data also highlights a shortcoming of the work-force statistics that garner more public attention, in particular the unemployment rate.
Those statistics basically treat all jobs as equal. But some people are working part-time or a few hours less each week or their employer has stopped authorizing overtime. They have a job but they are working fewer hours and making less money.
A recent article by Steven Kroll, an economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, charts the distinction.
In some parts of the labor market, like professional and business services, job cuts almost entirely explain the decline in hours worked. In that area, 9.9 percent of employees lost their jobs, while the number of hours worked fell 10.1 percent.
In other areas, however, job losses significantly understate the decline in paid work. Construction jobs fell 21.5 percent; hours worked fell 24.5 percent. Manufacturing jobs fell 17.3 percent, while the number of hours worked fell 20.3 percent.
The data, Mr. Kroll wrote, "illustrates employers' tendency to cut payroll employment rather than hours." In other words, American companies generally choose to lay off one person rather than reducing two people to half-time work.
Because this is Germany week in the blogosphere, I'll just close by noting that the plentiful body of research noting that German companies generally do the opposite, with the result that a deeper recession produced fewer job losses in that country.

HEADLINE: When Culture, Power and Sex Collide

BYLINE: LINDA MARTN ALCOFF


HIGHLIGHT: How cultural attitudes toward sex, in France or anywhere else, can distort our perceptions of sexual violence. 

 BODY:
The recent events swirling about the ex-next-president of France, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, have revived old tropes about how culture affects sex, including sexual violence. Before this scandal, many continued to believe that Americans are still infected by their Puritan past in matters sexuel, while the French are just chauds lapins: hot rabbits. The supposed difference consisted of not only a heightened sexual activity but an altered set of conventions about where to draw the line between benign sexual interaction and harassment. The French, many believed, drew that line differently.
The number of women speaking out in France post-scandal calls into question this easy embrace of relativism. French women, it appears, don't appreciate groping any more than anyone else, at least not unwanted groping. A French journalist, Tristane Banon, who alleged that she was assaulted by Strauss-Kahn in 2002, described him as a "chimpanzee in rut," which draws a much less sympathetic picture than anything to do with rabbits. Still, some continue to hold that the French have a higher level of tolerance for extramarital affairs and a greater respect for a politician's right to privacy. But neither of these factors provide an excuse for harassment and rape.
Conventions of workplace interaction do vary by culture. In Latin America and parts of Europe, kissing is the normal mode of greeting, and to refuse a kiss may well appear cold. Kissing co-workers in New York, however, can elicit mixed signals, at least outside of the fashion district. One does need to know the relevant cultural conventions to be able to communicate with effective ease. In other words, one needs to be a cultural relativist to know when one is being hit upon.
The more thorny question is whether relativism is relevant to those domains we generally want to put in the non-benign category: harassment, sexual coercion, even sexual violence. Could it be that offensiveness is relative to the perspective of the recipient, based on her own cultural sensibilities? More troubling, could it be that our very experience of an encounter might be significantly affected by our background, upbringing, culture, ethnicity, in short, by what Michel Foucault called our discourse?
Violent and brutal encounters, even for sado-masochists, are unlikely candidates as culturally relative experiences. But much harassment and even rape is cloudier than this: date rapes, statutory rapes, and many instances of harassment can be subject to multiple interpretations, which has given rise to the new term popular on college campuses - "gray" rape. The writer Mary Gaitskill famously argued some years back that the binary categories of rape/not-rape were simply insufficient to classify the thick complexity of her own experience. In this netherworld of ambiguous experiences, can understanding cultural relativism be useful?
Feminist theory, some might be surprised to learn, has been exploring this possibility for some years. There is a great deal of work on the realm of fantasy, and desires approached through fantasy, as a means to understand the different ways women can experience varied sexual practices. Women's sexual responsiveness varies, and feminism has endeavored to honor the variation rather than move too quickly toward moral and political hierarchies of legitimate practice.
Fantasies can vary by culture and context, and they operate to create an overlay of meaningfulness on top of actual experience. The result is that fantasies provide projections of meanings that seem to control the determination of events, affecting the way we narrate and name our experience, and even the sensations we feel. This suggests a picture of an idea-body encountering another idea-body, with the fantasy projections rather than any physical characteristics of the encounter, controlling the production of experience.
Such an approach, however, can lead one to discount experience altogether. Whether workplace pornography is experienced as threatening or a reminder of the sexual power of women is simply relative to one's expectations and prior predilections, some might say. Those who take offense are simply operating with the "wrong paradigm." This has the danger of returning us to pre-feminist days when women's own first person reports and interpretations of their experiences were routinely set aside in favor of more "objective" analyses given by doctors, psychiatrists, and social scientists, inevitably male.
The slide toward a complete relativism on these matters can be halted on two counts. First, there is the question of the physical body. Sex, as Lenin correctly argued, is not akin to having a glass of water. It involves uniquely sensitive parts of the body around which every culture has devised elaborate meanings, from adulation to abomination. The genitals are simply unique in the role they play for reproduction and physical ecstasy, and no discourse can operate as if this is not true. A light touch on the shoulder and a light touch on the genitals elicit distinct sensations. The body is not infinitely alterable by discourse.
Second, there is the question of power. Differences in status and the capacity for economic self-sufficiency - not to mention the capacity for self-regard - compromise the integrity of consent, no matter the culture. Status differences can occur along the lines of age, class, race, nationality, citizenship and gender (all of which apply to the alleged attempted rape by Strauss-Kahn of an immigrant housekeeper). Power differences alone cannot determine whether something is benign or harmful, but they do signal danger. It cannot be the case that cultural context can render power differences completely meaningless. Obvious power differences in sexual relations should raise a red flag, no matter which color one's culture uses to signal danger.
While cultural conventions on power and sex may vary, the impact of sexual violence does not. Sexual violations should be universally defined, and universally enforced.

HEADLINE: Weiner's Seat Could Be Scrambled in Redistricting

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: New York is due to lose 2 of its 29 seats in 2012, and for reasons of geography and demographics as well as partisan politics, Mr. Weiner's 9th District would seem to be a prime candidate. 

 BODY:
There is much speculation about whether Representative Anthony D. Weiner will remain in Congress or resign his seat. But there is a politically expedient solution for Democrats if they want to show him the door: Neuter his district in the redistricting process, which will require New York to lose 2 of its 29 seats in the House of Representatives.
No discussion of redistricting is simple, especially in New York, so some background is in order.
Mr. Weiner's seat, the 9th Congressional District, is the second most conservative in New York City, after the 13th (Staten Island and part of Brooklyn). Conservative, of course, has a relative meaning in the context of New York - the 9th District remains Democratic-leaning - but it has become much more competitive than might have been expected.
In 2000, the 9th District, which takes in a number of middle-class white ethnic communities in southern Brooklyn and central Queens, gave Al Gore 67 percent of its vote. John Kerry, however, drew just 56 percent of the vote four years later, a shift that was initially seen as an anomaly caused by the political after-effects of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. There was no rebound in 2008, though: Barack Obama drew just 55 percent in the district, barely better than his national average of 53 percent. The 12-point decline from Mr. Gore's performance to Mr. Obama's reflects one of the largest shifts against Democrats in the country; the only comparable examples are in the South or in Appalachia:
Surrounding districts remain staunchly Democratic, though, giving Barack Obama between 63 and 91 percent of their votes in 2008. The 2010 census dictates that New York State's Congressional districts include a population of 717,707 on average, and the 9th's current borders encompass only 660,306 residents. There is almost no way to add the necessary 57,000 residents - roughly 9 percent of its current population - from neighboring districts without also making the 9th more Democratic than it is now. So while the district could be competitive if an election were held using the current boundary lines (for example, in the case of a special election later this year), it is less likely to be competitive in 2012 after the boundaries are redrawn.
Of course, the present 9th District could itself be carved up and its population used to beef up neighboring districts. That would be fairly sure to cost the Democrats a seat. But with the two parties sharing power in Albany and each holding a veto over the redistricting process, it is probably inevitable that one of the two seats the state loses will be a Democratic-held one. 
If they must lose a seat, the 9th might be an attractive option for Democrats, both because it is the only one they now hold in Brooklyn or Queens that would be vulnerable with a poor Democratic candidate or in a strong Republican year, and because it is centered in an area with relatively slow population growth.
In the chart below, I've detailed the population shifts in different regions of New York State, as well as the attendant changes in the number of congressional districts that they require. Although New York City grew at the same rate, 2.1 percent, as the rest of the state between 2000 and 2010, the number of congressional districts it can support has declined from 12.2 to 11.4 because of the overall reduction in the state's allotment. The slowest growth in New York City has been in Brooklyn and Queens, which together added just 0.9 percent to their populations over the past decade.
In other words, it Mr. Weiner's seat isn't dissolved, that of another Brooklyn or Queens Democrat might have to be broken up instead. Plausible candidates include the 5th District in northeastern Queens and northwestern Nassau County on Long Island (Gary Ackerman's seat), and the 11th District in central Brooklyn (Yvette Clarke's seat), which is significantly underpopulated. Some analysts have suggested that Carolyn McCarthy's seat, the 4th District in Nassau County, might be carved up instead, but that is a less natural division, since Long Island's suburban population has grown enough to still warrant four full districts.
Another alternative, suggested by Aaron Blake of The Washington Post, would be to reverse New York State's usual polarity, and eliminate an upstate Democrat and a downstate Republican. The problem would lie in finding the appropriate victims - particularly the downstate Republican.
Only one Republican, Michael Grimm of the 13th District, represents any part of New York City in Congress. But there only limited scope to tinker with his district. Staten Island, which has enough residents for about two-thirds of a seat, has a strong local identity, and any new map that sought to divide it among several districts would be likely to spark both popular anger and legal challenges. 
Pairing conservative-leaning Staten Island with some particularly Democratic-leaning portions of Brooklyn - say, a majority-minority neighborhood like Sunset Park - could potentially tip the district's party leaning from slightly Republican to slightly Democratic. But it would be hard to make the district sufficiently more Democratic to deny Mr. Grimm a chance of holding the seat as a Republican incumbent.
Long Island's only Republican representative is the bombastic Peter T. King, whose 3rd District is underpopulated and will need to add more than 70,000 constituents. But its surroundings are merely Democratic-leaning, rather than solidly Democratic, and Mr. King has a long history of overperforming at the polls. So a similar problem emerges: Democrats could make Mr. King's re-election bid more difficult with new boundaries, but probably not deny him a seat -- there are too many Republicans living there to create four strongly Democratic districts. 
The next-closest thing to a "downstate" Republican is Nan Hayworth, a freshman representing the 19th District in the lower Hudson Valley. But that seat's population has grown at a healthy clip, and it is not close enough to New York City or Long Island to serve the goal of reducing the number of seats in those regions.
Finding an upstate Democrat's seat to sacrifice would be less challenging, particularly in the western part of the state, which is badly underpopulated now. But perhaps the most natural target - the 26th District, won by Kathy Hochul in a special election last month - might draw objections from both parties: from Democrats because they think she's a rising star after her upset victory, and from Republicans because they expect to have a reasonable chance of reclaiming the seat anyway. 
Unless Mr. Weiner resigns immediately and a Republican wins the resulting special election - in which case Ms. Hochul and the newly minted Republican might be a natural trade - the pressure therefore remains on the Democrats of Brooklyn and Queens.
That is not to say that eliminating Mr. Weiner's seat would be easy; redistricting never is. 
"I suspect there would be a lot of people in various Brooklyn and Queens Jewish communities who would howl at eliminating the 9th," I was told by David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report, perhaps the nation's foremost redistricting expert. And Mr. Weiner himself, of course, will also raise objections, if he survives his scandal. 
Even a neighboring district is broken up to preserve the 9th, though, that still would leave an unemployed Democrat who could challenge Mr. Weiner in a primary. Such a challenge is not sure to succeed: Rep. Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, who had deeper ethical problems than Mr. Weiner, managed to survive a multi-way primary challenge with surprising ease last year. 
But it is precisely because Democratic seats in New York City are hard to lose that they are such valuable commodities. The likelihood that there will be one fewer of them next year makes them scarce commodities, too - and Mr. Weiner is unlikely to get a free pass, however the new boundaries are drawn.

HEADLINE: The Problem With Obama's Re-Election Pitch

BYLINE: MATT BAI


HIGHLIGHT: The president's advisers say they are planning to ask voters not to change horses in midstream, but as they should know from the last election, Americans like change. 

 BODY:
As you might have seen, my colleagues Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg did a nice job of previewing President Obama's re-election campaign in a front page article on Sunday. One line in particular jumped out at me: "With their hopes dashed of substantial improvement in unemployment anytime soon, aides indicated that the theme was likely to be less 'morning in America' and more 'don't change horses in midstream.'" I'm certainly no political strategist, let alone one who's gotten a president elected. But that said, am I the only one who wonders if this might be kind of a boneheaded construct? I mean, we all get why the Reaganesque theme of "morning in America" doesn't apply here. Morning only looks this dark in Alaska, and only at certain times of year. 
But the problem with this not-changing-horses business is that this is 2011, not 1948, and we live in a digital society. Changing horses in midstream is just about all we do. It's the new national pastime. 
There's nothing we won't trade in, thoughtlessly, for a slightly better deal or just for the sake of variety - cellphone carriers, cable companies, houses, cars, spouses. I just dumped AT&T for Verizon. Why? I had a bad cellphone day. A year from now, I'll probably switch back.
The president's team might want to reconsider electoral trends over the past 16 years. For the first time in American history, we've just seen three straight presidents lose control of the House (and Mr. Obama probably would have lost control of the Senate, too, like Bill Clinton and George W. Bush did, had it not been for the Tea Party's intervention in 2010). All that party-switching has very little to do with ideology. It's about impatience with the status quo. It's about changing horses in midstream, just because you can.
I'm guessing whoever said that to Jeff and Jim was just reaching for an available cliche, short-handing the notion that Mr. Obama has put the right policies in place and the country should see them through. O.K. But to the extent that it reflects a deeper mindset inside the president's inner circle, then it also would seem to reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the moment. 
Continuity isn't much of an argument anymore, the way it was when people stayed with an insurance agent for 40 years, even when lower premiums might have been available someplace else. What matters now is a better value. We want the deal that new customers are getting to sign up, not the same one we already have.
What this means, in political terms, is that a president probably has to think about a second term as a new chapter. Sure, you've got to defend the record and answer for conditions in the country. But you would think the central question is going to be about what you have that's new to offer, rather than whatever is already in place. 
There is no more "midstream" in American life. There are only options, vast and tempting and endlessly renewing. The sooner you appreciate that cultural shift, the less your chances of getting kicked to the rocks.

HEADLINE: Poll: Most Say Palin Shouldn't Run for President

BYLINE: MEGAN THEE-BRENAN


HIGHLIGHT: Two-thirds of all voters and 54 percent of Republican voters say they do not want to see Mrs. Palin run for president. 

 BODY:
As Sarah Palin continues to ponder a run for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, a new poll finds that most Americans, including a majority of Republicans and half of Tea Party supporters, do not think she should run. 
Two-thirds of all voters and 54 percent of Republican voters say they do not want to see Mrs. Palin run for president, the CBS News poll found. Nearly 6 in 10 voters over all hold an unfavorable opinion of Ms. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, while Republican voters are evenly divided in their opinion of her. 
The poll also found that Americans were still not engaged in the race for the Republican nomination. Most of the Republicans who have declared their intention to run remain largely unknown to voters in their own party, with opinions on candidates little changed from a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted about two months ago. Of the candidates who are officially in the race, Mitt Romney has the highest favorability rating, at 37 percent, yet 51 percent of Republican voters do not yet have an opinion of him. 
While they may not know much about the candidates themselves, Republican voters have firm opinions about what they want from the eventual nominee. Seventy-one percent say they would like their party's nominee to support repealing the recent health care law, and 52 percent prefer a candidate who will make changes to Medicare. Nearly three-quarters say it doesn't matter to them whether or not the Republican nominee is affiliated with the Tea Party movement. 
The CBS News poll had some disheartening news for President Obama as the bounce he enjoyed after the killing of Osama Bin Laden has dissolved. Mr. Obama's overall job approval among all Americans has slipped back to 48 percent. The public's approval of Mr. Obama's handling of the economy (37 percent) and the federal budget deficit (30 percent) remain low, while his ratings on Afghanistan (51 percent) and terrorism (63 percent) are above 50 percent. 
The nationwide telephone survey, conducted June 3-7 with 1,024 adults, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all adults.

HEADLINE: Gang of Six, Minus One, Finds Cuts

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Leaders say the Senate Gang of Six, now down to five members, has indentified more than $4.7 trillion in deficit reductions. 

 BODY:
A bipartisan group of senators working on a proposal to rein in the national debt has identified more than $4.7 trillion in deficit reductions over a decade, more than the separate proposals put forth by President Obama or House Republicans. The two leaders of the so-called Gang of Six said the savings could grow to $6 trillion if the economy improved.
The leaders, Senators Mark R. Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, said they could not say when their group would present a finished proposal.
In contrast to the senators' plan, the House measure would cut deficits by $4.4 trillion over 10 years. The president's plan would trim $4 trillion over 12 years.
Mr. Warner called the other plans "one-party solutions" and said they would not work. "I still think the best hope, the best chance, is the bipartisan effort that starts in the Senate," he said.
The panel has been working since December to follow up a report by Mr. Obama's debt commission but faced a major setback when Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and an influential deficit hawk, walked away from the negotiations last month over a stalemate on entitlements.
To achieve the savings, the Senate group is working on a framework that does not include raising tax rates. Instead, the approach would eliminate or reduce tax breaks to raise revenue and cut projected spending across the board, including on third-rail issues like entitlement benefit programs and military spending.
"Certainly it's been more difficult, because Tom was a very valuable member," Mr. Chambliss said. "He has great ideas and really knows the issues well, particularly having served on the deficit commission. So it's important that at the end of the day we have a strong bipartisan group. And I hope that Tom Coburn is a member of that when we conclude and make a presentation."
Mr. Chambliss described Mr. Coburn's absence as a "sabbatical," and said the two planned to have dinner together. Mr. Warner said that more than 64 senators had signed a letter encouraging the lawmakers to keep working on the deficit plan.
Mr. Warner and Mr. Chambliss spoke at a meeting of the Economic Club in downtown Washington that was attended by business leaders and by ambassadors to the United States from India and Switzerland.
Another bipartisan group, led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.,is working on a deficit proposal aimed at persuading Republicans to allow the debt ceiling to be raised by August to keep the federal government from defaulting on its credit obligations. But as a compromise, any deal the group agrees to is likely to reduce deficits by less than $4 trillion over 10 years, perhaps by $1 trillion to $2 trillion.
Mr. Warner said he was concerned that the lowered savings would punt the deficit problem down the road and unnerve the capital markets. But a default, he said, would move the likelihood of a double-dip recession from a concern to a "high probability."

HEADLINE: What Dimon Told Bernanke

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: The JPMorgan Chase chief questions whether banking regulation has gone too far and is now hurting the economy 

 BODY:
You have probably heard that Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, on Tuesday questioned Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, over whether banking regulation had gone too far and was hurting the economy. Business Insider proclaims Mr. Dimon as "Wall Street's new hero." 
Mr. Bernanke was speaking before an audience of bankers, including Mr. Dimon, in Atlanta. So what was the exchange? Here is an excerpt:
Mr. Dimon: Y'know, I have this, totally, I completely agree that we had a crisis and that it entailed doing a lot of things to fix and reduce risk. I have this great fear that someone's going to write a book in 10 or 20 years, and the book is going to talk about all the things that we did in the middle of a crisis that actually slowed down recovery. ...
Now we're told there could be even higher capital requirements, so-called SIFI and G-SIFI charges [global systemically important financial institutions ], etc., and we know there are 300 rules coming. Has anyone bothered to study the cumulative effect of all these things, and do you have a fear like I do that when we will look back and look at them all, that they will be the reason it took so long that our banks, our credit and our businesses -- most importantly, job creation isn't going again. is this holding us back?
Mr. Bernanke: This is certainly the most comprehensive reform since the 1930s and we're trying to execute it and trying to address all of the problems, and you didn't mention three or four others I could think of. So, yes. it was a big problem. It has a huge impact. ... So there are many, many things to fix. We're working on them and making, I hope, a lot of progress.
Has anybody done a comprehensive analysis of the impact on credit? i can't pretend that anybody really has. You know, it's just too complicated. We don't really have the quantitative tools to do that. ...
We are trying to develop rules that make sense, that are consistent with good practice, but which do not unnecessarily impose costs, or unnecessarily constrict credit.
A video is available on CNBC.com

HIGHLIGHT: Halfway to a lost decade already. 

 BODY:
An interesting juxtaposition: Bill Gross defending his bet on rising rates, which isn't looking too good right now:
Bill Gross, founder of PIMCO, says the differences between the U.S. and Japanese economies show why interest rates here have nowhere to go but up.
Speaking at the Morningstar Investor Conference, Gross noted that U.S. Treasuries are yielding 1.55%. "Compare it to the Japanese market which we know is a moribund, dead, lost-decade kind of economy," Gross said, "and the Japanese bond yields .8%. Here we have the US with a dynamic economy, with respect to their Treasury departments, the U.S. and Japan are just 80 or 90 basis points apart."
"Unless we cataclysmically black-hole our economy and drive it far into further recession, it's hard to see how we could drive [domestic] interest rates much lower."
Meanwhile, via Mark Thoma, we have Justin Wolfers pointing to GDP as estimated from the income side -- which looks significantly worse -- and saying
Focus on the red line, and you'll see that the recession began in the final quarter of 2006, not the end of 2007. The red line also fell by more, and over a longer period. And today, GDP remains below its levels nearly five years ago. The economy had already run out of steam halfway through Bush's second term. That's why I say we are halfway to a lost decade.
But hey, we're a dynamic economy, nothing like Japan.

HEADLINE: On Limits and Leaps

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: How resource limits vanish in the face of innovations. 

 BODY:
Tom Friedman's column today focused on Paul Gilding's new book, "The Great Disruption: Why the Climate Crisis Will Bring on the End of Shopping and the Birth of a New World." The column and the cited comments from Gilding gave the impression of planetary overload, but a critical clause from Gilding was easy to miss and is worth highlighting here (my italics):
[W]e have reached some kind of limit, given current technologies.
What's hidden is that throughout human history this has been periodically true. For example, there was a point at the end of the 19th century when Manhattan had reached its horse manure limit. Then Henry Ford got busy.
The bottom line? Building the human capacity to learn and innovate matters, a lot.
My early morning haiku on Twitter echoed Gilder's overarching theme: "Max out innodaptive capacity, foster love of planet, hold on for ride"
A Dot Earth sampler on related themes: "Can Humans Move from Tweaks to Leaps?" "Which Comes First, Peak Everything or Peak Us?" and "Pedal to the Metal."

HEADLINE: Remembering Waitz, a Champion and Companion

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Jack Waitz keeps learning about his wife, Grete Waitz, since she died April 19 at the age of 57. People tell him about their one meeting, stories that glow with kindness and generosity.
''She met one guy in New York, in a hotel, and he had a boyfriend who was running the marathon, and Grete talked to the boyfriend and he was so surprised, and Grete sent him a note with a little training program,'' Waitz recalled the other day. ''There's a lot of people like that, just people that she met on the way.''
Grete Waitz was always on the way, with that lithe body that was built to travel long distances economically, gracefully. And when she paused, people discovered a shy person who nevertheless had time for others.
No doubt Jack Waitz will hear more stories this weekend when he and Grete's brother, Jan Andersen, fly to New York for a tribute to one of the great champions of the city, of the world. On Friday there will be a private memorial, and on Saturday morning in Central Park, Jack and Jan and a cluster of male friends will be the first men to run in the Mini, the landmark 10-kilometer race for women, which Grete won five times. 
For Jack Waitz, the time of mourning has been so short that he still mixes up the singular and the plural. Asked in English if ''you'' still own the winter getaway in Gainesville, Fla., Waitz said, ''Yes, we do,'' and then he gave a little laugh and said, ''I shouldn't say we anymore.
''Yes,'' he continued, ''I have a place in Gainesville. She liked the atmosphere in Gainesville; it was her safe haven. She was a very well-known person in Norway, so in Gainesville she was left by herself and she really enjoyed that. I like to play golf, and she had her routines. She liked to go to out for coffee in the morning and read a book. She had a low-key life.''
A nine-time New York City Marathon champion could sit and read a book out in public in Gainesville?
''Oh, yeah, in Gainesville, it's only the Gators that mean anything,'' Waitz said with a chuckle, alluding to the iconic stature of the football and basketball teams at the University of Florida. ''They are the champions.''
His wife was also a champion, who owned New York and every other place she ran, but acted from the innate understanding that long-distance running is a communal effort, that five-hour plodders are in the same race, the same sport, as the whippets who finish in very close to two hours.
Waitz has been preparing for this time since the first diagnosis of cancer in 2005, yet he still has trouble separating his wife as champion and life companion.
''I can't recall when I met her the first time because I am six years older and we were members of the same track team,'' Waitz said in a telephone conversation from Oslo. ''You know, she was 11 and I was almost 17. She has always been there.''
Jack Waitz was a decent runner in Norway, and Grete Andersen was perhaps 16 or 17 when she sent word that she would like to do some long-distance training with the older guys in the club.
''We were a little macho and we didn't think any girl could run with us,'' Waitz said. ''She ran with us and she had no problem keeping up with us. We were very impressed.''
They started dating in 1972 and married in 1975. They had no children. Waitz was an accountant and part-time coach who suggested his wife try the New York City Marathon. The story is often told that she hated her first marathon so much that she threw her shoes at her husband, even though she had set a world record. A star was born.
Waitz soon understood that she belonged to the roaring wall of humanity on First Avenue and the characters that resided within Ego City, including Fred Lebow, the impresario of the marathon.
''She kept to herself,'' said Dr. Louis S. Galli, a podiatrist who had to rule her out of the 1981 Marathon because of injuries, and became a close friend. He watched her balance her privacy and her love of her sport. Early on, he escorted her into Central Park for a predawn jog, and watched her vanish down the pathways, and guessed she could handle herself in this town.
Since his wife's death, Jack Waitz has been receiving e-mails from elite runners like Laurie Gordon of Stillwater, N.J., who sent Grete a quilt when she heard about the cancer, and received a phone call from Oslo. There was another from Andrew Eddins, who ran the New York City Marathon twice.
''I tell the story to this day of Grete at that cocktail party offering to get me a number and coach me,'' Eddins wrote to Jack. ''I always compare it to something like Mozart showing up and offering to teach one to play the piano. Who would say no?!!''
In 1992, Waitz agreed to run in a 10-kilometer race in Shelter Island, N.Y., as a favor to David Katz, a racing official. Steve Klemes, now 47, recalls the middle of the race when Waitz beckoned for him to run alongside her.
''I pointed at myself as if to say, 'You can't mean me,' '' Klemes said the other day, interpreting her gesture as saying, ''All right, you'll do,'' meaning he was not a showoff and could pace her to the finish line. Klemes had heard Waitz was planning a 40-minute pace, but he soon found his lungs and legs to be under duress, and in the final kilometer he ostentatiously checked his watch, as if his master plan was to slow down, immediately.
''She told me, 'You can do that tomorrow,' '' Klemes recalled. They crossed the line in something like 38 minutes and were separated into male and female chutes. But then Waitz returned, bearing two cups of water, and they chatted about the race for a long time. He never met her again.
There are many stories about her modesty. Norman Goluskin, a mainstay of the New York Road Runners' youth program, recalls escorting Waitz to a city school, and how the children wanted to know about her life. Could she cook? Could she keep house? Did she have another occupation? No, no, no, Waitz said. The only thing she could do is run.
There was, it turned out, something else she could do. She could fight cancer.
''Grete wound up having a whole second life after the cancer,'' Mary Wittenberg, the president of the New York Road Runners, said the other day.
Wittenberg went to Bislett Stadium in Oslo last month for the celebration of her friend, in the company of two champions, Joan Benoit Samuelson and Rosa Mota.
''Joanie and Rosa and I -- this is going to make me cry -- were sitting at the field, and all of a sudden, one woman came over with a bandanna on her head, obviously she was bald, and asked for a picture,'' Wittenberg said. ''And of course, we made her be in the picture, and all of a sudden I began to realize we were seeing all these volunteers with bandannas on their heads.''
The three marathon people began to understand that Grete and Jack Waitz had been involved with Aktiv Mot Kreft -- Active Against Cancer -- and had helped upgrade the facilities for patients.
''She was all about telling people, you can feel better if you can keep going,'' Wittenberg said. ''I don't know if you know this, but she set up a room without mirrors so you wouldn't feel self-conscious.''
Jack Waitz said that was Grete's idea, for a patient to get on a treadmill and work out, without a mirror in the room.
They had a large home in the Oslo suburbs, with one modest showcase containing a few medals and trophies, recalled Barbara Paddock, a senior vice president of JPMorgan Chase, who has been active in the New York City Marathon over the years.
''When she got sick four, five years ago, she began downsizing,'' Paddock said. ''She was preparing for the worst. She got an apartment down by the water in Oslo, so Jack would be set.''
This week Jack Waitz will leave his new apartment for a trip to New York, to run with all his friends, in the city that adored his wife.

HEADLINE: Fervor for Tech I.P.O.'s Does Not Extend to Other Sectors

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
While a handful of initial public offerings are hitting the market with a pop, many are landing with a thud.
Following the frenzied debuts of LinkedIn, Yandex and other new Internet shares, it's easy to forget that dozens of other I.P.O.'s this year are falling below size expectations or not producing double-digit price gains. Investors just don't have the same fervor for nontechnology offerings, which in the United States have raised $22 billion so far this year, or roughly 80 percent of the total I.P.O. volume.
Given lackluster demand, some companies have been forced to cut the size of their offerings, watch their shares suffer or even withdraw their offerings altogether. In early June, Resourcehouse, the Australian mining company, shelved its plans for a listing in Hong Kong, citing unfavorable market conditions. Russian Helicopters, a state-owned aerospace group, and the payment company Skrill postponed their London debuts for similar reasons. 
''Investors are eager for specific sectors, not I.P.O.'s in general,'' said Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida.
It's a two-tiered I.P.O. market.
Investors are clamoring for technology companies, attracted by strong growth expectations and a swelling number of users. LinkedIn, which more than doubled on its first day of trading, is up 85 percent from its debut. Yandex shares have risen 37 percent.
The double-digit gains have helped propel the industry's overall returns. In 2011, American technology offerings are up 26 percent on average, versus 12 percent for the rest of the market, according to the data provider Dealogic.
The strong returns for technology stocks reflect, in part, the lack of comparable public companies. With few publicly traded stocks in the social networking space, investors are more willing to pay sky-high valuations, even for untested business plans. Groupon, the daily deals site that is still unprofitable, filed for an I.P.O. in early June, an offering that could value the company at $30 billion, more than the search giant Google at its debut in 2004.
''A lack of valuation models is driving up the price of social media I.P.O.'s,'' said Julie Teigland, strategic growth markets leader at Ernst & Young for Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa.
Offerings in more established industries like commodities, manufacturing and retail have a long list of publicly traded rivals, allowing investors to more easily judge potential performance and valuation. With ready comparisons, the offerings in these sectors aren't likely to experience large first-day trading pops or enjoy multibillion-dollar debuts. The flip side is that these stocks, priced at more appropriate levels, may prove less volatile and offer better potential long-term returns for investors - and not just those that get in at the I.P.O.
For nontechnology offerings, demand and pricing largely depend on the company's underlying business model, growth prospects and financial health. For example, Spirit Airlines, a low-cost carrier that flies from Florida to the Caribbean and Latin America, had to cut the size of its offering by 35 percent, on concerns that rising fuel costs would crimp earnings. Shares of the airline lost 4 percent on their first day of trading in late May.
''Spirit has a tough case to make convincing investors they'll beat the history of failed airline I.P.O.'s,'' Professor Ritter said.
Timing also matters. Investors gobbled up private equity-backed companies earlier in the year when I.P.O. volume was still relatively low. The hospital operator HCA raised a $3.8 billion, the most on record for a private equity-owned company. It also topped the debuts of the energy company Kinder Morgan and Nielsen, the consumer research company.
But as focus has shifted to social networking, an offering for Freescale Semiconductor Holdings - a chip maker that was taken private in 2006 in what was called ''one of the ugliest buyouts ever'' - did not excite investors. The company, which has struggled to maintain profitability under its $7 billion debt load, raised just $783 million, down from initial estimates of $1 billion. The stock is up 1 percent since going public in late May.
With few debuts for technology companies, the I.P.O. market in Europe has fared particularly poorly. The sovereign debt crisis, which has crippled economic growth and left unemployment stubbornly high, has weighed on the market, especially newly minted stocks. The 19 European offerings this year, which have raised more than $100 million, are down 2.6 percent on average, based on Dealogic data. A broader index of stocks on the Continent is off a little more than 1 percent.
''Europe is lagging behind the U.S. and Asia,'' said Richard Weaver, a capital markets partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''Concerns about the weak economy are unsettling the markets.''
Even Glencore International, the commodities giant that had one the most highly anticipated offerings of the year, has struggled. It made a splashy $10 billion debut in May, the largest offering so far this year. But its shares quickly slipped over fears of a slowdown in Asia. Adding to the pressure, the European Investment Bank, a publicly owned financial institution, said a few weeks later that it had found tax irregularities at a Glencore subsidiary in Zambia and was investigating the matter. The company denies the allegations.
The company's chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, attributed the stock slump to a weakness in broad commodities prices. He told reporters after the listing ceremony in Hong Kong that the shares were just ''following the rest of the markets.'' Since its I.P.O., the stock has dropped 2.5 percent.
Despite the market disparity, the global I.P.O. pipeline is still filling up with companies of all types. The Spanish savings bank Bankia is expected to go public this summer. Samsonite, the private equity-owned luggage maker, is planning a listing in Hong Kong. And in the United States, Dunkin' Brands Group, the owner of Dunkin' Donuts, filed in early May to go public.
In April and May, 36 companies set a price range for their offerings, up from 32 in the first three months of the year. It's the strongest activity since 2007, according to the data provider Renaissance Capital.
''Investor optimism is on the rise,'' said Lee Simmons, an industry specialist at Hoover's, which tracks I.P.O.'s. ''We're coming out of the recession, and people have money to spend.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bank Said No? Hedge Funds Fill Loan Void

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
Hedge fund managers have been called plenty of names.
Now, they can add another: local banker.
When Rentech, a clean energy business in Los Angeles, was rejected by its long-time banker last year, it asked a hedge fund for money instead. ''You have to take what's available at the time,'' said D. Hunt Ramsbottom, chief executive of Rentech, which has since borrowed $100 million in this unconventional way.
With traditional lenders still avoiding risky borrowers in the wake of the financial crisis, hedge funds and other opportunistic investors are stepping into the void. They are going after midsize businesses that cannot easily raise money in the bond markets like their bigger brethren.
The support is critical in a recovery characterized by high unemployment and anemic growth. These middle-market companies, which generate $6 trillion in revenue a year and employ 32 million people in the United States, are borrowing billions of dollars from the hedge funds for product development, strategic acquisitions and even day-to-day operations like payroll and utilities. 
But the lending force also poses a significant risk to the companies and the broader economy, given the unregulated nature of this shadow banking system.
These lenders of last resort typically charge interest rates that are several percentage points higher than banks. Loaded up with high-cost loans, borrowers could find themselves falling deeper into debt or worse, into bankruptcy. Over the last year, Rentech has borrowed from a group of funds, led by Highbridge Capital Management and Goldman Sachs, at an interest rate of 12.5 percent.
''On the one hand, the cost of money is more expensive than what some businesses might be used to,'' Mr. Ramsbottom said. ''On the other, if the money is not available, the cost is infinite.''
The lending activity is also stoking fears that speculative activities - like those that contributed to the crisis - are shifting from banks to loosely regulated firms that play by their own rules. While policy makers are moving to increase capital and other standards for banks to prevent another disaster, hedge funds and the like are not subject to the same oversight.
If firms load up on debt and the market goes into a tailspin again, the shadow banking system could implode and threaten the entire economy.
''These institutions are essentially servicing a part of the market where banks are not lending,'' said Debarshi Nandy, a professor at York University's business school in Toronto. ''The million-dollar question is, Are we benefiting?''
Hedge funds offered a crucial lifeline for Rentech. The company is hoping to build a facility about 60 miles east of Los Angeles to transform yard clippings into fuel, enough for 75,000 cars. If it works, the project would represent Rentech's first commercial success in its nearly 30-year history.
Unprofitable for decades, Rentech is a risky proposition for a traditional lender. While large corporations with healthy balance sheets can easily tap into the bond markets or borrow from banks, their smaller counterparts with shakier credit have fewer options.
Middle-market companies, with revenue of $25 million to $1 billion, do not typically sell bonds. And their main financing sources, specialty lenders like CIT Group and regional banks, have not fully recovered. Last year, debt securities focused on this segment stood at $12 billion, down from $35 billion in 2005, according Standard & Poor's Leveraged Commentary and Data.
Hedge funds and other investors are flush with capital. Last year, Highbridge, which is owned by JPMorgan Chase, started a $1.6 billion fund that lends money to midsize companies. The private equity firm Blackstone Group started a $3 billion fund. Even FrontPoint, the firm hobbled by an insider trading investigation, has raised $1 billion for a lending fund and plans to double the size, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
The concern is that hedge funds are looking for quick payoffs rather than long-term opportunities - and will bolt if there is trouble. A previous wave of money managers that jumped into lending after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 saw their loans sour. The firms, mainly smaller, fringe players, have since disappeared.
''The new funds rushing into direct lending now will learn the hard way that it is easy to make what appear to be sound loans as the economy is improving, but it becomes brutal to either collect the loans or foreclose when the downturn comes,'' said Max Holmes, the founder of Plainfield Asset Management, whose lending-focused fund, once as large as $5 billion, is winding down.
Unlike their predecessors, players today say they are operating like community bankers, focusing on multiyear deals backed by significant collateral and capital. They are also locking up investors' money for years rather than quarters. This can alleviate some short-term pressures.
''The people who last are those with a relationship-oriented business, not those who view it as a trade,'' said Rob Ladd of D. E. Shaw, which manages $1.7 billion in lending strategies.
Stephen J. Czech of FrontPoint spent weeks researching Emerald Performance Materials. He scoured the chemical manufacturer's financials, visited several facilities, and met with executives - all of which gave him the confidence to lend the company money.
Emerald used the loan to buy a European rival. ''All types of financing were considered,'' said Candace Wagner, Emerald's president, but the company preferred the ''flexibility and certainty'' of FrontPoint.
Some who borrowed from hedge funds have not been so satisfied. Hedge funds have been lumped with payday lenders that charge usury rates. Plainfield has been accused of predatory lending in civil suits, and local and federal authorities have looked into the firm's practices. Plainfield said it won or settled all of the suits and investigators closed their inquiries without taking action.
The creditors of Radnor Holdings, a disposable-cup company that defaulted on a roughly $100 million loan, claimed Tennenbaum Capital Partners charged excessively high rates as a takeover tactic, a strategy referred to as ''loan to own.'' After a protracted legal battle, the fund took control of Radnor in 2006, renaming it WinCup.
Tennenbaum did not return calls for comment.
Another worry is that funds will trade on nonpublic information they receive as lenders. A March study in The Journal of Financial Economics found a spike in investors betting against the shares of companies that took hedge fund loans. Businesses that borrow from banks did not experience the same activity, according to the authors, including Professor Nandy.
For Mr. Ramsbottom of Rentech, the benefits outweighed the risks. While the company could end up losing the profitable fertilizer plant it put up as collateral on the loan, Rentech can continue to pursue the clean energy venture.
''An entrepreneur will pay whatever,'' he said, ''to keep his business alive.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 10, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about business lending by hedge funds misstated in one instance the surname of the chief executive of Rentech, a clean energy business in California that borrowed $100 million from a group of hedge funds. As noted elsewhere in the article, he is D. Hunt Ramsbottom, not Huntsbottom.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Market Must Be Balanced

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and RICHARD BEALES

 BODY:
Regulators and financiers could be focused on the wrong mortgage market. They are right that healthy American home lending hinges on the private sector's ability to finance all or most of it, rather than relying on government-run Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or their equivalents. But architects of the postcrisis home loan market may be assuming it needs to be larger than it really does. It could be scarcely half as big as the current $10.5 trillion and therefore much easier to finance.
Size matters because important constituencies are sweating the details of mandated reforms, including setting a new gold standard for mortgages. Making home lending less risky and housing boom-and-bust cycles less severe would probably reduce the supply of loans. If authorities and investors choose the wrong market size, they could strike the wrong balance. 
Outstanding mortgages are still only 6 percent below the precrisis peak, while home prices are down a third. That's one hint the market hasn't bled out the excesses. Once foreclosures, sharply lower home values and the swelling ranks of renters are baked in, the market should shrink. Today's mortgage market is more than twice as big as in less-frothy 2000. If home prices had appreciated in lock step with inflation since 1996 and loan-to-value ratios stayed the same, there would now be roughly $5.3 trillion in outstanding home loans, just over half the current level.
Or consider a simple calculation starting with the latest figures. First, assume that 4.3 million dud loans, as estimated by Barclays Capital, are repaid or written off once the relevant homes are foreclosed and resold. That could lop nearly $1 trillion from the market. Then, suppose the home ownership rate drops a couple more percentage points to the 64.5 percent average over the three decades leading up to 1999. That could knock off nearly $300 billion more. Overlay the drop in home prices from the 2006 peak, and a fully deleveraged mortgage market might be around $6.6 trillion in size.
Downsizing baby boomers also should translate to smaller mortgages. The whole market may not quite be cut in half. But policy makers shouldn't ignore the possibility.
Default Fantasies
Fitch Ratings is the latest credit watchdog to warn about the consequences of a missed interest payment by the United States. Yet there's a faction in Washington that seems increasingly inclined to push the nation's debt fight that far.
There's a false choice on offer, however. Republicans who say they're willing to risk a brief, technical default by the federal government mostly think any earlier deal to raise the statutory debt cap would encourage further tax-and-spend profligacy by Democrats. They reckon a temporary default would be worthwhile to reach a long-term deal on spiraling health care and retirement obligations.
Action to reduce federal deficits is needed or one day the government really will run out of money. But the struggle in Washington to coalesce on anything suggests another half-baked and temporary budget agreement is the most likely result of the current fight. And if a technical default followed, it could be far worse than gung-ho Republicans imagine. Peru got away, more or less, with a missed payment in 2000, but had a clear rationale and was a known risky and peripheral debtor. America, by contrast, is the world's credit benchmark and issuer of its reserve currency, suggesting a scarier outcome.
The credit rating and borrowing cost impact could be severe. But Fitch also points to repo markets -- crucial plumbing for the global financial system -- where an estimated $4 trillion of United States Treasuries are used as collateral. There are implications for the stability of money market funds, too.
Trouble in either place would echo the 2008 crisis. JPMorgan analysts further note the 40 percent decline in foreign holdings of the debt of government-sponsored housing enterprises in the year after they were bailed out, despite federal backing of their credit.
Even if a technical default wasn't disastrous in the short term, it would damage trust in American debt and the dollar for the long term. The markets, which have turned perhaps too benign an eye so far, could start delivering a harsher verdict sooner than the putative August debt cap deadline. Reaching that date doesn't mean Uncle Sam will inevitably miss a payment. But a loss of confidence would not be easily reversed.

HEADLINE: Russian Banks Build A.T.M. With an Ear for the Truth

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russia's biggest retail bank is testing a machine that the old K.G.B. might have loved, an A.T.M. with a built-in lie detector intended to prevent consumer credit fraud.
Consumers with no previous relationship with the bank could talk to the machine to apply for a credit card, with no human intervention required on the bank's end.
The machine scans a passport, records fingerprints and takes a three-dimensional scan for facial recognition. And it uses voice-analysis software to help assess whether the person is truthfully answering questions that include ''Are you employed?'' and ''At this moment, do you have any other outstanding loans?''
The voice-analysis system was developed by the Speech Technology Center, a company whose other big clients include the Federal Security Service -- the Russian domestic intelligence agency descended from the Soviet K.G.B. 
Dmitri V. Dyrmovsky, director of the center's Moscow offices, said the new system was designed in part by sampling Russian law enforcement databases of recorded voices of people found to be lying during police interrogations.
The big bank involved, Sberbank, whose majority owner is the Russian government, said it intended to install the new machines in malls and bank branches around the country eventually, but had not yet scheduled the rollout. Technology consultants say the machines, if they go into commercial use, would be the banking world's first use of voice analysis in A.T.M.'s.
While Sberbank's technology might strike Westerners as too intrusive, many Russians already assume the government can watch or listen to them when it chooses to. Sberbank executives said the new A.T.M.'s would adhere to Russian privacy laws.
It was the global financial crisis, partly prompted by loans that people could not or would not repay, that prompted Sberbank to tap Russia's national security experts as it set out to automate most banking activities, said Victor M. Orlovsky, a senior vice president for technology at the bank.
The software detects nervousness or emotional distress, possible indications that a credit applicant is dissembling. That information, Mr. Orlovsky said, would be used in combination with other data, including credit history.
Sberbank is hardly alone in looking over the horizon at new types of banking automation.
Deutsche Bank and Citigroup, for example, are testing futuristic technologies in a handful of bank branches in Berlin, New York and Tokyo. Those banks say their efforts focus on new types of interactive displays and touch-screen terminals, such as a table top made by Microsoft that senses documents and other items placed on it.
And credit approvals by A.T.M. are already a fact of financial life in Turkey, for one, where the bank machines are helping fuel a consumer credit boom that some analysts fear could spiral into a debt crisis.
But Sberbank may be unique so far in trying to turn A.T.M.'s into truth machines.
''We don't know of any major U.S. financial institutions doing things along those lines, such as trying to gauge whether somebody is lying,'' Daniel Wiegand, a senior analyst at Corporate Insight, a company that consults with banks on consumer technology, said in a telephone interview.
A prototype of the machine is on display at Sberbank's Branch of the Future laboratory in a nondescript office building above a Moscow subway station.
The lab bristles with biometric surveillance technology. When a person walks in, a facial-recognition camera takes note, and an artificial voice cheerily greets known customers. Or, more often, it utters a glum, ''Hello, you are not registered,'' because only a few of the lab's staff members have had their faces scanned so far.
Sberbank says that to comply with the part of the privacy law that would prohibit a company from keeping a database of customers' voice signatures, the bank plans to store customers' voice prints on chips contained in their credit cards.
Mr. Orlovsky, the Sberbank vice president, said that to address privacy concerns the bank also planned to make consumers aware of the types of information, including biometrics, that the A.T.M. would be collecting.
But the Speech Technology Center says even people who know about the voice-stress program would have trouble fooling it, because it measures involuntary nervous responses, the way a polygraph test does.
The center's director, Mr. Dyrmovsky, said the voice-stress system analyzed vibrations as shaped by the contours of an individual's throat, larynx and other tissue involved in speech. When a person becomes agitated, he said, involuntary nervous reactions alter these shapes, changing the tone and pacing of speech.
One of the center's other products measures anger. It is already installed at the telephone call center of the Russian national railways. Within seconds, the computer can sort incoming calls into red, yellow, green and blue categories, based on the emotional state of the speaker. Red calls typically prompt a supervisor to listen in.
In a demonstration, technicians played a recording of an actual call that caused the program to illuminate a red dot next to a phone number displayed on the screen. It was the voice of a passenger who had just learned she could not take her small dog onto a first-class car.
''Do you know how much a ticket costs? Yes, it's big money, and you are telling me I cannot bring a dog?'' the woman said. ''The dog, it's no bigger than, I don't know, a pack of cigarettes! What should I do, throw it out the window?''
The system the center is developing for Sberbank is a variation of that same software, intended to identify nervousness.
''Of course, we don't believe this technology 100 percent,'' said Mr. Orlovsky, the Sberbank executive. A client might be nervous for reasons unrelated to a credit application, for example. He said it was merely a statistical guide.
And he said the voice analysis was no more invasive than checking a credit history.
''We are not violating a client's privacy,'' he said. ''We are not climbing into the client's brain. We aren't invading their personal lives. We are just trying to find out if they are telling the truth. I don't see any reason to be alarmed.''

HEADLINE: IN SAUDI ARABIA, ROYAL FUNDS BUY PEACE, FOR NOW

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- As one nation after another has battled uprisings across the Arab world, the one major country spared is also its richest -- Saudi Arabia, where a fresh infusion of money has so far bought order.
The kingdom is spending $130 billion to pump up salaries, build housing and finance religious organizations, among other outlays, effectively neutralizing most opposition. King Abdullah began wielding his checkbook right after leaders in Tunisia and Egypt fell, seeking to placate the public and reward a loyal religious establishment. The king's reserves, swollen by more than $214 billion in oil revenue last year, have insulated the royal family from widespread demands for change even while some discontent simmers. 
Saudi Arabia has also relied on its unusually close alliance with the religious establishment that has long helped preserve the power of the royal family. The grand mufti, the highest religious official in the kingdom, rolled out a fatwa saying Islam forbade street protests, and clerics hammered at that message in their Friday sermons.
But the first line of defense in this case was the public aid package. King Abdullah paid an extra two months' salary to government employees and spent $70 billion alone for 500,000 units of low-income housing. As a reward to the religious establishment, he allocated about $200 million to their organizations, including the religious police. Clerics opposed to democratic changes crowed that they had won a great victory over liberal intellectuals.
''They don't care about the security of the country, all they care about is the mingling of genders -- they want girls to drive cars, they want to go the beaches to see girls in bathing suits!'' roared Mohamed al-Areefy, a popular young cleric, in a recent Friday sermon.
Financial support to organizations that intellectuals dislike ''was a way to cut out their tongues,'' he said.
Saudi Arabia, a close ally of the United States, has struggled to preserve what remains of a regional dynamic upended by the Arab Spring -- buttressing monarchies and blocking Iran from gaining influence.
While the United States has pressed other Arab nations to embrace democratic changes, it has remained largely silent on Saudi Arabia and the kingdom's efforts to squelch popular revolts in neighboring Bahrain and Oman.
Saudi Arabia's efforts have succeeded in the short run, at home and in its Persian Gulf backyard. But some critics call its strategy of effectively buying off public opinion unsustainable because it fails to address underlying problems.
''The problem is that some leaders do not understand what is going on and do not learn the lessons while these things are unfolding in front of their eyes; they do not learn the lessons of history,'' said Prince Talal bin Abdul Aziz, 79, a brother of the king.
The prince, whose 14 living children include the billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, said: ''These people want to preserve their power, their money and their prestige, so they want to keep the status quo. They are afraid of the word change. This is a problem because they are shortsighted, but the difficulty is I don't know how to change their way of thinking.''
The monarchy has not completely escaped calls for change. There have been at least three petitions, with a group of youths and even some members of the Sahwa, the staunchly conservative religious movement, calling for an elected consultative council.
The only major street protest scheduled for March 11 largely fizzled -- its organizers were anonymous, and its stated goal of toppling the government lacked broad appeal. In the largely Shiite eastern provinces, though, police officers arrested scores of protesters.
The ruling princes have also moved against dissent in other ways, like imposing a new press law with punishments including a roughly $140,000 fine for vaguely defined crimes like threatening national security.
Saudis of all stripes say that they are less concerned about democratic elections than about fixing chronic problems, including the lack of housing, unemployment that is officially 10 percent but likely 20 percent or more, corruption, bureaucratic incompetence and transparency on oil revenues.
The demand for change in the kingdom long ago evolved into a struggle between puritans and progressives over the country's future. So the debate prompted by the Arab uprisings is coursing through familiar battle lines here that pit Saudi against Saudi rather than Saudis against their government.
The ruling Saud clan has maintained absolute power by ensuring it remains the sole referee in that tussle, so change must emerge from the top.
But even senior princes doubt that the very top is interested. The four or five senior royals with real power have also been slowed by illness.
''Unfortunately, there is a minority in the royal family who doesn't want to change; they are a minority, but they are influential,'' said Prince Talal, long the family gadfly, nicknamed the ''Red Prince'' in the 1960s.
King Abdullah, 87, is personally widely popular as a kind of national grandfather. His government has put in place what Saudi activists describe as random acts of reform -- like improving elementary school education to include English and better science.
Elections for more than 200 municipal councils, postponed since 2009, have been rescheduled for Sept. 29. The councils have little power and half their members are appointed, so many Saudis consider them an empty democratic facade.
Women who organized a campaign starting more than year ago to win the right to vote were particularly incensed when the government rolled out an old excuse to ban their participation -- the difficulty of separating polling stations by gender, as custom dictates.
But other groups hope to capitalize on the opening the election could provide. A group called Jidda Youth to the Municipal Council, designed to win a youth seat, has spread to other cities. Some 7,000 young people in Jidda turned out spontaneously as volunteers when floods devastated the city in January, killing 13 people. Fouad al-Farhan, a founder of Jidda Youth and a well-known blogger, said grass-roots action like that is the taproot of change, although forming public organizations remains illegal.
''We want to say that we are a third voice; we are so bored of this game of liberals versus conservatives,'' he said.
The open question is what kind of impact they will have. Among a group of former political prisoners who gather regularly, there is a measure of bitterness that years of confronting the monarchy has not changed much.
''They are frustrated and disappointed,'' Mohammad F. Qahtani, a human rights activist, said of the men. ''They feel that they made one sacrifice after another. They went to jail multiple times, and there has been no response from the public.''

HEADLINE: Fed Says Economy Is Growing, but at Uneven Pace

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Economic activity in the United States continued to grow in April and May, but higher food and energy prices, severe weather conditions and supply disruptions caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan put pressure on consumers, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve released on Wednesday.
The central bank's district-by-district report, called the beige book, said that economic activity ''generally continued to expand,'' although at different rates across the country. The pace of growth slowed, for example, in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Chicago districts. The Dallas district accelerated, while other areas showed growth continuing at a steady pace, the survey said. 
The beige book also noted that manufacturing in general expanded, and that activity in the nonfinancial service sectors grew steadily, led by the information technology and business and professional services industries.
The report is intended to get beyond the financial statistics to offer economists and market watchers insights into the regional factors affecting the nation's economy. The report covered a two-month period when the government's economic indicators were growing progressively weaker.
The survey, issued eight times a year, seemed to support remarks made a day earlier by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who described the country's economic growth as slow and uneven.
Compared with the previous beige book, which raised questions about the impact of the March disaster in Japan, this survey suggested that some of the economic headwinds could be receding.
''What we are seeing is that the business community and the banking community out on the ground see this as a transitory thing,'' John Canally, an economist for LPL Financial, said. ''Businesses in general are seeing through the soft spot.''
The report said that the supply disruptions caused by the events in Japan had resulted in a reduction in the flow of new cars to dealer inventories, which in turn had held down sales. In addition, bad weather and high gas prices hurt casino, retail and agricultural activity in several regions.
Those factors affected growth in consumer spending, with most districts indicating steady to modestly increasing activity, the survey said. ''Elevated food and energy prices, as well as unfavorable weather in some parts of the country, were said to be weighing on consumers' propensity to spend,'' the report said.
The Cleveland district noted a sharp drop in auto production, while businesses in the Chicago area said contingency plans were put into play to deal with supply disruptions. High-tech companies in the Boston and Dallas districts reported a lack of parts that had adverse effects on business, according to the survey.
Business activity related to the agriculture sector was varied because of extreme weather. Cool temperatures delayed crops in the San Francisco Fed district; flooding on the Mississippi River slowed activity for farmers in the St. Louis and Atlanta districts. In the Dallas district, severe drought was expected to hurt the wheat crop, while wildfires led to ''significant'' agricultural losses, the survey said.
Residential construction and real estate continued to show widespread weakness, the survey said. Labor market conditions improved gradually across most of the country, but some districts said there was a dearth of workers with specialized technical skills. Wage growth was modest, the report said, even though highly skilled workers commanded steeper increases.
In a speech to bankers Tuesday in Atlanta, Mr. Bernanke said he was confident that the pace of growth would increase during the second half of the year, and that he continued to see no signs of broad and enduring inflation despite the recent price rises.
''Over all, the economic recovery appears to be continuing at a moderate pace, albeit at a rate that is both uneven across sectors and frustratingly slow from the perspective of millions of unemployed and underemployed workers,'' Mr. Bernanke said in his speech.
The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee next meets on June 21 and 22.

HEADLINE: Group That Sued to Aid Poor Schools Is Out of Money

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
After a series of setbacks, the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the advocacy organization whose victory in a historic lawsuit brought billions of additional dollars to poor school districts in New York State, has run out of money to sustain itself, the organization said.
The organization's last remaining employee, Helaine K. Doran, will leave the group's Lower Manhattan office this month and, essentially, lock the door behind her. 
While its future is not yet certain, the president of its board of directors, Luis Miranda, said on Tuesday that the group was in talks to merge with the New Jersey-based Education Law Center, which two weeks ago won a $500 million judgment in its own long-standing school-financing litigation, known as the Abbott case.
The differing trajectory of the two organizations, which share the same mission, may be a result of the different ways their cases were handled by their state's courts, both of which found that students in poor districts were being deprived of their constitutional right to a sound basic education.
It also reflects a changed climate for education philanthropy, as donors flock to newer ideas, like research into teacher effectiveness and charter schools, instead of the decades-old legal struggle for equality in school financing among rich and poor districts.
When the Campaign for Fiscal Equity won its case in 2006 after 13 years of litigation, the New York State Court of Appeals largely left it to the Legislature to decide how much additional state aid should flow to poor districts. In 2007, Gov. Eliot Spitzer pledged to phase in $7 billion in additional funding over five years, with $5.4 billion to New York City alone.
But two years later, when the state was hit by the economic downturn, the Legislature froze the additional aid at the prior year's levels. And this year, the Legislature's overall $1.3 billion cut in education aid brings financing levels roughly back to pre-lawsuit levels, said Billy Easton, the executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, another education advocacy organization.
New York City, for example, will get $643 million in Campaign for Fiscal Equity funds next year from the state, but the overall cut in state aid is $812 million, translating into a net decrease, according to the city's Department of Education.
''There is a huge sense of disappointment that the gains that were gotten in the compromise have been pushed to the future rather than the present, and that education continues to be cut, and the goal of having a sound basic education for every child is unfulfilled,'' Mr. Miranda said.
Under Geri D. Palast, who became the campaign's executive director in 2006, the group kept reminding donors that the struggle for resources was not over, and conducted research to show where inequities remain.
But it was tough work to do what Mr. Miranda called ''the constant re-education that yes, policing of the decision needs to continue.'' Eventually, he said, there was ''funding fatigue.'' ''We realized that it would be impossible to financially sustain an agency standing by itself,'' Mr. Miranda said of the organization's internal discussions for the last year and a half. Ms. Palast resigned in March and became the managing director of the Israel Action Network, an initiative to defend publicly Israel's right to exist. She also joined the board for the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, which concluded that the best way to sustain the group's main legacy would be to find a way to return to its core strength of litigation.
That prompted the group to begin talks with the Education Law Center, whose victory was proving more robust. Unlike in New York, the New Jersey Supreme Court has issued a series of follow-up rulings since 1990 ordering millions to poor districts for specific programs, from preschool to curriculum reform.
One idea would to be for the Education Law Center to have a New York advisory board or advisory component that would retain the Campaign for Fiscal Equity name, Mr. Miranda said.
David Sciarra, the executive director of the Education Law Center wrote in an e-mail: ''We've been asked to explore how the center can continue the C.F.E. legal effort to secure adequate funding for New York's school children.''
Ms. Doran, whose last day at the campaign is June 15, said that even though the organization was ''in transition,'' that should not be interpreted as a defeat. She stressed that the campaign as a whole had helped change attitudes about the need for equitable funding for poor districts, even though overcrowding and large class sizes remain an issue.
''There's fight left in a lot of people,'' she said. ''I get invited to sometimes go talk to kids about C.F.E., and there was this one student who said, 'shouldn't we just give up?' And I said, 'No, I've been doing this for 20 years, we can't give up. This is too important.' ''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Conversation About Scandal Turns a Tad Scandalous

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR; With C. J. Hughes.

 BODY:
Former Mayor Edward I. Koch asked Nocturnalist a question so salty that had we been less concerned about keeping our job, we might have exacted Zsa Zsa Gabor-style retribution on his cheek.
At a party for the Tenement Museum, held in Chelsea on Monday night, we asked Mr. Koch about his thoughts on Anthony D. Weiner, the scandal-embroiled congressman. In response, he flung an unprintable personal question back at us. Since we were surrounded by several shocked guests, including former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, we stayed our hand, and instead replied, ''No comment.''
Mr. Koch was pleased. Turns out the probing question was just to prove a point: Private life can remain private. ''I wasn't intending to be fresh,'' he said. ''I was simply conveying that people can do the right thing, like you.'' Mr. Weiner ''brought this on himself, because he revealed, in effect, his personal life in a bizarre way,'' said Mr. Koch, whose own personal life is a closed book. 
The museum was celebrating its 23rd anniversary with a ''Taste of New York.'' Thankfully it was not literal. More than a dozen restaurants from across the boroughs dished out their specialties. There were tortillas made from corn soaked in lye by Tortilleria Nixtamal in Queens, spoons full of raw Long Island fluke from Ma Peche in Manhattan, and enough choux pastry puffs, pickles, pancakes and pasta to make Nocturnalist swear off bathing suits this summer.
After dinner, we sat with Mr. Koch and others as they grinned and bore a performance of a musical with a singing Statue of Liberty and a crooning Joseph Pulitzer.
The former mayor had put Nocturnalist on the spot, so we responded in kind. Had he ever dallied with a political fan? There was a twinkle in the octogenarian's eye. If he had, he said, ''I wouldn't tell you.''
'Icky'? It's Just Science
Parents can be so embarrassing. Especially ones who star in a series of short films about how animals copulate called ''Green Porno.'' But Isabella Rossellini's daughter, Elettra Wiedemann, 27, a model who has gotten into green herself -- as an environmentalist -- told us she doesn't cringe.
''I think what she's doing is so cool,'' Ms. Wiedemann said Tuesday night. ''My mom really hated school when she was a kid. What she's trying to do with Green Pornos is make education fun and funny.'' She was at a fund-raiser for the education programs of Solar One, an environmental advocacy group, held at Sotheby's auction house on the Upper East Side.
''My mom has always been so open about sex; she's very science-brained,'' Ms. Wiedemann said. (It seems to run in the family. Ms. Wiedemann just completed a degree in biomedicine from the London School of Economics, she said.) ''I'm able to disengage the icky stuff from the science stuff.''
But other famous progeny at the party had more intense ''ick'' to deal with, like Kathleen Kennedy, who is known as Kick. Her environmentalist father, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., she said, has a penchant for bringing home road kill for his backyard ''vulture-feeding stand.''
''It was kind of embarrassing when I'd be in the car with my friends and suddenly a dead deer would be on our laps,'' she said. ''You find charm in it at a certain point.''
A Mystery in the Park
''Thwack!'' We were on a boat ride through the lake in Prospect Park at a fund-raiser for the park's playgrounds on Friday evening when our vessel thudded into something underwater. ''Was that a body?'' one passenger asked, to nervous laughter.
''It was a log,'' said Morgan Fiddler, the pond's new ferryman. The guests, many in nonseaworthy heels and clutching Champagne flutes, righted themselves. ''A little bit of Champagne, when it rubs into the wood,'' Mr. Fiddler said, ''is a good thing.''
The party was held to raise money to solve the case of the disappearing sand. Emily Lloyd, president of the Prospect Park Alliance, said sand in the park's seven playgrounds was spirited away over time and needed to be replenished. The organization raised $60,000.
Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, said, ''I would look at a sandbox and I was like, 'There's a sandbox,' '' referring to his life before he had children. ''Once I became a parent, I realized that the sandbox was the center of our world.''
What exactly happens to the stuff? The sand scampers off on socks, or with the breeze, said Ms. Lloyd. But she flatly denied rumors of it being bagged by cat lovers. ''There's no big conspiracy involving people who don't want to buy kitty litter,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Falling Behind in the Business of 'Green'

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
LEICESTER, England -- The Mark Group started hunting for a new untapped market when it realized that its core business -- insulating old homes using innovative technology -- would drop off in coming years. Based in this rust-belt city, the company had grown rapidly over the last decade largely because of generous and mandatory government subsidies for energy conservation that impelled the British to treat their homes.
But as a result of those incentives, market saturation was nearly complete -- more than 80 percent of the country's older homes had been at least partly retrofitted by 2010, the company estimated. So the Mark Group recently opened its newest office in another country, one with a relative paucity of expertise in the company's specialty of cutting home energy bills and greenhouse gas emissions.
The office is in Philadelphia. 
''The United States was a nearly untouched market with 120 million homes, most of them very energy-inefficient -- it was a massive opportunity,'' said Bill Rumble, the company's commercial director, who had recently returned from its new American headquarters.
Many European countries -- along with China, Japan and South Korea -- have pushed commercial development of carbon-reducing technologies with a robust policy mix of direct government investment, tax breaks, loans, regulation and laws that cap or tax emissions. Incentives have fostered rapid entrepreneurial growth in new industries like solar and wind power, as well as in traditional fields like home building and food processing, with a focus on energy efficiency.
But with Congress deeply divided over whether climate change is real or if the country should use less fossil fuel, efforts in the United States have paled in comparison. That slow start is ceding job growth and profits to companies overseas that now profitably export their goods and expertise to the United States.
A recent report by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that while the clean technology sector was booming in Europe, Asia and Latin America, its competitive position was ''at risk'' in the United States because of ''uncertainties surrounding key policies and incentives.''
''This is a $5 trillion business and if we fail to be serious players in the new energy economy, the costs will be staggering to this country,'' said Hal Harvey, a Stanford engineer who was an adviser to both the Clinton and the first Bush administration and is now chief executive of the San Francisco-based energy and environment nonprofit organization Climate Works. Although the 2009 stimulus bill provided a burst of funding -- $45 billion -- that has now tapered off, he said, ''We've let energy policy succumb to partisan politics.''
The aggressive entry of Britain into the field over the last few years shows the power of government inducements to redesign a nation's energy economy away from traditional fuel. The country's Green Deal, as it is called, is currently being spearheaded by the Conservative-led coalition government. In Britain, reducing carbon dioxide emissions was one of the few policies supported by political parties of both the right and left, which both accepted that climate change was a serious problem and saw clean technology investment as a growth opportunity rather than an onerous obligation.
''We are determined to harness the industrial benefits of the low-carbon economy ahead of the rest of the pack -- we see it as a competitive advantage,'' said Gregory Barker, Britain's minister of state for energy and climate change. Last month, Mr. Barker led the first British green trade delegation to the United States; it included a wind energy company and a battery maker, but also Adnams Southwold, a famed brewery that now makes beer using less energy and water, and the Mark Group.
President Obama has vowed a switch to cleaner energy, and some states, like California, have taken aggressive measures. But the current patchwork of government inducements remains generally insufficient as a draw for American companies and investors to jump into new fields like wind power, energy-efficient appliances or even mass-market insulation, because upfront costs are large and profits uncertain.
Energy Department officials express frustration that they cannot do more at a crucial juncture without the support of Congress. Dr. Arun Majumdar, senior adviser to Energy Secretary Steven Chu, said that the department's $5 billion budget for research should be tripled as it currently financed less than 5 percent of proposed projects. He said the country needed better low-cost financing methods to bring companies into the market, as well as stricter energy-efficiency standards to stimulate customer demand.
''We want this ecosystem to grow and thrive like I.T. and biotechnology,'' he said, adding he was ''concerned'' it would not. While he agreed the United States remained a hotbed of good ideas, he said, ''in actual downstream deployment we are at risk of falling behind -- we are falling behind already.''
Of the three largest operators of wind farms doing business in the United States, only one, NextEra, is American. Iberdrola is Spanish and Horizon Wind Energy is a subsidiary of Energias de Portugal. Among manufacturers making components for the industry, just one American company, General Electric, is in the top 10. The others include Suzlon (India), Vestas (Denmark), Goldwind (China) and Enercon (Germany).
Tighter energy-efficiency standards for machinery and appliances established in Europe, Japan and China have ''primed the demand pump'' for companies in those countries to develop innovative designs that use less energy than United States products, said Stefan Heck, head of McKinsey's global clean technology practice. California is the only American state to adopt similarly high standards.
With less ambitious targets for things like emissions reductions and far lower financial incentives than are common elsewhere, United States policies have had a lackluster incubator effect. The United States' Energy Star Program, for example, offers homeowners who buy energy-efficient appliances or add insulation to their homes a tax credit equal to 10 percent of the cost -- with a cap of $500.
When David Slap recently hired the Mark Group to insulate his four-bedroom house in Penn Valley, Pa. -- motivated by drafts and a fear of rising fuel prices -- he paid over $5,000, all of it out of pocket.
Contrast that to the subsidy program offered in Britain. Power companies in Britain have been required to progressively reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and this year 68 percent of that reduction had to come from subsidizing professionally installed insulation in customers' homes. Low-income and elderly customers got the home improvements free. Others paid less than $1,000 to insulate a four-bedroom home, the full cost subsidized 40 to 60 percent. Residents recouped their investment in 12 to 18 months as fuel bills after insulation typically decreased 20 to 30 percent.
''This policy framework allowed the industry to mature -- we became cheaper, the quality improved,'' Mr. Rumble said. The company developed a mobile infrared scanner operated from a van that could screen 1,000 homes an hour for heat loss as it cruised by.
Other British initiatives included money for new offshore wind farms, payments to homeowners who generated electricity and heat with renewable power, and loans for installing rooftop solar panels that could be progressively repaid from savings on home energy bills.
With its extensive experience in retrofitting homes in Britain, the Mark Group is expecting success in United States markets like Philadelphia, where the business is largely the province of small local contractors.
Some federal incentives may be on the horizon, though many will require Congressional approval. The Energy Department has pressed hard for a new home energy score program that would rate homes for energy efficiency just as cars are rated for gas mileage; that rating would be available to potential buyers.
Will United States companies be able to compete on the world market in the future?
Not unless the country invests more in basic research in renewable energy and energy efficiency, said Emily Carter, a professor of energy and the environment at Princeton University. ''If we don't invest in ways to efficiently produce sustainable energy, then I worry that once we stop importing from the Middle East, we'll simply find ourselves importing from China.''

HEADLINE: After Leaving City, Big Bank Mulls a Return

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; Matt Flegenheimer and Adriane Quinlan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Fifteen years ago, New York City's reputation as an international financial center was called into question when the giant Swiss bank UBS moved its North American headquarters to the Connecticut suburbs, where it built the largest trading floor in the world.
Now, though, UBS is having buyer's remorse. It turns out that a suburban location has become a liability in recruiting the best and brightest young bankers, who want to live in Manhattan or Brooklyn, not in Stamford, Conn., which is about 35 miles northeast of Midtown. The firm has also discovered that it would be better to be closer to major clients in the city. 
As a result, UBS is seriously considering a reverse migration that would bring its investment banking division and up to 2,000 bankers and traders back to Wall Street and a new skyscraper at the rebuilt World Trade Center, according to real estate executives and city officials.
''They just can't hire the bankers and traders they need,'' said one landlord who has spoken with UBS but requested anonymity so as not to alienate a potential tenant.
The bank is also looking at several Midtown locations, and Connecticut is sure to wage a fierce battle to keep UBS in Stamford, where it is the largest private employer and the biggest taxpayer.
A final decision is perhaps months away, and any move would not take place until 2015.
But over the last week, UBS has engaged in negotiations with the developer Larry Silverstein over the terms of a potential financial deal at 3 World Trade Center, an 80-story office tower that he plans to build at 175 Greenwich Street. The return of UBS would be a boon to New York, which in past decades often suffered from corporate defections that were fueled by a sense that computers and telecommunications had made a Manhattan location more of a luxury than a necessity.
The move would be the latest sign that New York has regained its allure as a caldron for the young and creative. Six months ago, Google paid nearly $2 billion for a large building just north of the meatpacking district, in the same Manhattan neighborhood where many of its employees live.
''A key piece of the mayor's economic strategy has been to make New York City a place people want to be,'' Deputy Mayor Robert K. Steel said, ''and more than ever the city is the ideal location for any company, like UBS, that succeeds by attracting a talented, motivated work force.''
A UBS trader in his 20s said that like many of his peers at the firm, he would have preferred a job in New York City, where he lives.
''I mean, it's annoying,'' said the trader, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak about the possible relocation. ''I take Metro-North. I live pretty close to Grand Central, so it's not a terrible commute. But it's not ideal.'' The trip takes about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on how many stops the train makes.
He added that ''the bank's plan is to move to New York, but it's mostly to be closer to clients.''
UBS has hired the real estate brokerage firm CB Richard Ellis to explore new space. A UBS deal would also be a vindication of a multibillion-dollar effort to rebuild the World Trade Center complex. After the terrorist attack on the trade center, there was widespread debate over the future of the city's financial center downtown. Since then, the residential population there has swelled.
Last month, Conde Nast, publisher of Glamour, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, signed a deal to be the anchor tenant of 1 World Trade Center, the signature skyscraper at the northwest corner of the site.
Mr. Silverstein has the right to build three towers along Greenwich Street. The first one is already under construction, and the city has pledged to take space in it. But he has long sought a large financial tenant for what is known as Tower 3, which features five trading floors at the base, and will be built before Tower 2. A possible UBS relocation, which was first reported by Bloomberg News last week, would be a major blow to Stamford, where a quarter of the office space is vacant.
Mayor Michael Pavia of Stamford said UBS executives had been noncommittal, saying they had ''no firm plans, nothing that they can report at this time.''
Mr. Pavia said he and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a former Stamford mayor, were ''committed to keeping UBS here.''
Connecticut's economic development commissioner, Catherine Smith, said: ''We just want to make sure that Connecticut has a fair shot. We love having them in the state and hope they'll stay. But you don't always win these competitive battles.''
Mr. Pavia said UBS had about 3,000 employees in Stamford, down from more than 4,000 a couple of years ago. The bank, which leases but does not own any space in Stamford, is not expected to move all its employees out of town.
UBS issued a statement saying that ''we routinely evaluate our space allocation as these leases expire and/or space becomes available.''
In wooing UBS, New York City landlords have tried to capitalize on Connecticut's recent decision to raise taxes to help balance the state budget, which has been criticized by some business groups. But it did not appear that UBS's interest in moving stemmed from the tax increases. The firm's review of its real estate needs began many months ago.
UBS had already considered and rejected two Manhattan locations, 4 Times Square in Midtown and the World Financial Center downtown, before it started talks with Mr. Silverstein about the World Trade Center.
UBS, then known as Swiss Bank, touched off cross-border recriminations and municipal hand-wringing in 1994, when it announced plans to move from its two Manhattan locations, one in Midtown and the other in the financial district, to Stamford. City officials and real estate executives feared that New York was about to endure another wave of corporate departures to the suburbs. Some experts suggested that financial firms no longer needed to be in Manhattan and close to Wall Street because of the spectacular growth of computerized trading and telecommunications.
Connecticut sweetened the pot for UBS by dangling what was supposed to be a $120 million package of tax breaks and interest-free loans, although the actual value of the incentives turned out to be substantially less. The bank erected a trading floor the size of two football fields, packed with more than 5,000 computer monitors.

HEADLINE: Opening Day Attack Has Dodger Fans Seeing Blue All Over

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Baseball in Los Angeles: Dodger Dogs and views of the San Gabriel Mountains from the stands. Perfect California days for the Boys in Blue. A storied franchise playing in one of America's vintage stadiums.
But these days, the boys in blue refer to a different uniformed team. Dodger Stadium is teeming with Los Angeles Police Department officers -- on foot, on scooters, in patrol cars and in helicopters, on the lookout for fights and ugly rowdiness during and after games, in a stadium awash in empty seats. 
As a result, the Dodgers, rich in history and victories and a source of civic pride since Walter O'Malley brought them here from New York in 1958, have become a source of embarrassment for the city this spring, with a parade of indignities testing the loyalty of their anguished fans.
The police presence -- ''Oh my God, it's like an armed camp in there,'' said David Hamlin, a communications consultant who attended a Chicago Cubs game last month -- comes in response to an opening-day attack on a San Francisco Giants fan who is still in a coma.
The episode was unsettling for its brutality, but it was not entirely a shock, considering that the stadium has become a source of growing complaints about drunken and menacing crowds in the stands and in the streets.
The team has other problems, too. The long divorce drama involving its owners, Frank and Jamie McCourt, has threatened the team's financial viability and led Bud Selig, the Major League Baseball commissioner, to step in and take over to prevent the team from collapsing.
The owners, who are already derided here for spending money on luxury homes rather than on new players or security, were in danger of not meeting their payroll; indeed, it was considered something of a milestone when Mr. McCourt was able to meet his payroll at the end of May.
A team that used to be associated with championships was mired in the middle of the National League West on Wednesday, struggling to get to a .500 record. Attendance has slipped so much that The Los Angeles Times ran a front-page article last week showing a picture of empty bleachers, with the headline ''Dodgers' fans are going, going ...''
Can you blame Dodger fans for thinking that it's time to send the bums back to Brooklyn?
''We go to games two or three times a year because of my affection for baseball,'' Mr. Hamlin said. ''I'd be very surprised if I go back this year. Very surprised. There are police officers on the field. There are police officers in the stands. The parking lot after the game made it look like watching the Mideast on television.''
Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa sighed when asked about the team he grew up with, attending the first games at Dodger Stadium and seeing players like Sandy Koufax pitch. ''I think the entire city wants to get out of this purgatory,'' he said. ''I think everyone is frustrated.''
Attendance this year is down sharply; through 31 home games to date, it has averaged 35,787, compared with 43,489 last season -- the biggest drop in the major leagues, according to ESPN.com. And those numbers may be somewhat overstated, given that many season-ticket holders appear to be leaving their tickets in the drawer and staying home.
Asked about all the empty seats, Josh Rawitch, a spokesman for the Dodgers, said, ''We believe it is a number of factors.'' He declined to elaborate.
Many of them, though, are self-evident. The financial turmoil surrounding the McCourts means that the team is essentially bereft of the big-name stars who attract fans even to teams with losing records, which the Washington Nationals were able to do with the pitcher Stephen Strasburg (at least until he hurt his arm last year). And it is tough being a losing team in any city.
More than anything, though, the opening day attack and the police presence in the stadium since then have made baseball here seem like anything but a family pastime. Dodger fans say the days when the biggest hassle of going to a ballgame was plotting ways to avoid the traffic, no small challenge for a stadium on the edge of downtown, now seem almost quaint.
Fans are beginning to draw unwelcome comparisons to the rough and threatening crowds that used to attend Raider football games before the team decamped to Oakland, Calif., in 1994, many of whom would sport gang colors and tattoos.
''When I got here, Dodger fans were unbelievably different than the fans I knew from New York,'' said Woody Studenmund, a season-ticket holder and an economics professor at Occidental College who was born in Cooperstown, N.Y. -- home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame -- and moved here 30 years ago.
''They were polite, upbeat and seemed to make an effort to cheer even when good plays didn't work,'' Professor Studenmund said. ''Until this sea of blue arrived, it was not surprising to see fights in the left field bleachers or other parts of the stadium. The whole crowd has become tougher.''
There seems little reason for hope on this season's horizon. The McCourts will probably be dislodged as owners, though no one knows when that might happen. No one knows, either, how long it will take the team to repair its bond with the city.
''I think the damage is so severe that it will take many years to get past this,'' said David Carter, the executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California. ''They didn't create the damage and ill will overnight. You have to go back and look at how amazing the Dodger brand once was. It will bounce back.''
''But it won't bounce back overnight,'' he added. ''I think fans are interested in just getting past this era and to the point where you can go to a Dodger game and just think about and talk about baseball.''

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Puts New Limits on Cholesterol Drug

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday announced new safety restrictions on high-dose simvastatin, also known as Zocor, a cholesterol-lowering drug taken by an estimated 2.1 million Americans. 
The agency said the 80-milligram dose caused a potentially severe muscle disease, called myopathy, especially in the first year of taking the medication.
No new patients should be put on the high dosage, the F.D.A. said, recommending that existing patients should continue only if they have used the drug for more than a year without experiencing muscle pains. Alternative statins may be safer, the agency said.
The drug's manufacturer, Merck, advised patients on Wednesday to talk to their doctors if they wanted to change their statin drug or dosage. The company said many patients would not be affected by the F.D.A. action because they were taking lower dosages or had not felt muscle pain.
The F.D.A. approved 80-milligram Zocor in 1998, seven years after it approved lower dosages of the drug. It was once Merck's top-selling product. Since the patent expired in 2006, simvastatin has mostly been sold as a generic drug.
The new restriction also applies to Vytorin, a combination drug sold by Merck and Schering-Plough that has some formulations in the 80-milligram dose.
And the restriction applies to Simcor, a combination pill sold by Abbott Laboratories. Simcor has lower levels of simvastatin, but may cause higher levels in the body interacting with other drugs, like blood pressure medicines amlodipine and diltiazem.
''I think this is overdue,'' said Dr. Steven E. Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. ''Most experts in the field have known for many years that these high doses of Zocor were not safe compared with the other statins.''
Two other statins are more potent and can accomplish the same cholesterol targets at lower doses, he said, citing Pfizer's Lipitor and AstraZeneca's Crestor.
Some doctors have prescribed simvastatin because it is cheaper in generic form. Lipitor goes off patent in November.
Muscle aches have long been known as a possible side effect of statins. The F.D.A. issued a safety warning on high-dose simvastatin in March 2010. On Wednesday, it said a seven-year study and patient reports prove that patients taking the higher dosage have a higher risk of muscle injury than those taking a lower dose of the drug or taking other statins.
The high doses accounted for 11.7 percent of 94 million simvastatin prescriptions in the United States last year and 15.5 percent of 8.6 million Vytorin prescriptions, the industry research firm IMS Health said.
Dr. Michael Rosenblatt, chief medical officer for Merck, said the higher dose was developed to address medical thinking that the lower a patient's cholesterol level, the better. ''Whatever we did was good enough for the F.D.A., and this is a very important concept in the field,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.
''Many people who take simvastatin will not be affected by these label updates,'' Dr. Rosenblatt added in a statement. ''We encourage those who think these changes might affect them to talk to their doctor.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Where Growth and Dysfunction Have No Boundaries

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY; Hari Kumar contributed reporting.

 BODY:
GURGAON, India -- In this city that barely existed two decades ago, there are 26 shopping malls, seven golf courses and luxury shops selling Chanel and Louis Vuitton. Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs shimmer in automobile showrooms. Apartment towers are sprouting like concrete weeds, and a futuristic commercial hub called Cyber City houses many of the world's most respected corporations.
Gurgaon, located about 15 miles south of the national capital, New Delhi, would seem to have everything, except consider what it does not have: a functioning citywide sewer or drainage system; reliable electricity or water; and public sidewalks, adequate parking, decent roads or any citywide system of public transportation. Garbage is still regularly tossed in empty lots by the side of the road.
With its shiny buildings and galloping economy, Gurgaon is often portrayed as a symbol of a rising ''new'' India, yet it also represents a riddle at the heart of India's rapid growth: how can a new city become an international economic engine without basic public services? How can a huge country flirt with double-digit growth despite widespread corruption, inefficiency and governmental dysfunction? 
In Gurgaon and elsewhere in India, the answer is that growth usually occurs despite the government rather than because of it. India and China are often considered to be the world's rising economic powers, yet if China's growth has been led by the state, India's growth is often impeded by the state. China's authoritarian leaders have built world-class infrastructure; India's infrastructure and bureaucracy are both considered woefully outdated.
Yet over the past decade, India has emerged as one of the world's most important new engines of growth, despite itself. Even now, with its economy feeling the pressure from global inflation and higher interest rates, some economists predict that India will become the world's third largest economy within 15 years and could much sooner supplant China as the fastest-growing major economy.
Moreover, India's unorthodox path illustrates, on a grand scale, the struggles of many smaller developing countries to deliver growth despite weak, ineffective governments. Many have tried to emulate China's top-down economic model, but most are stuck with the Indian reality. In India, Gurgaon epitomizes that reality, managing to be both a complete mess and an economic powerhouse, a microcosm of Indian dynamism and dysfunction.
In Gurgaon, economic growth is often the product of a private sector improvising to overcome the inadequacies of the government.
To compensate for electricity blackouts, Gurgaon's companies and real estate developers operate massive diesel generators capable of powering small towns. No water? Drill private borewells. No public transportation? Companies employ hundreds of private buses and taxis. Worried about crime? Gurgaon has almost four times as many private security guards as police officers.
''You could call it the United States of Gurgaon,'' said Sanjay Kaul, an activist critical of the city's lack of planning who argues that Gurgaon is a patchwork of private islands more than an interconnected city. ''You are on your own.''
Gurgaon is an extreme example, but it is not an exception. In Bangalore, outsourcing companies like Infosys and Wipro transport workers with fleets of buses and use their own power generators to compensate for the weak local infrastructure. Many apartment buildings in Mumbai, the nation's financial hub, rely on private water tankers. And more than half of urban Indian families pay to send their children to private schools rather than the free government schools, where teachers often do not show up for work.
With 1.2 billion people, India is the largest democracy in the world, a laboratory among developing countries for testing how well democracy is able to accommodate and improve the lives of a huge population. India is richer than ever before, with rising global influence. Yet its development is divisive at home. It is experiencing a Gilded Age of nouveau billionaires while it is cleaved by inequality and plagued in some states by poverty and malnutrition levels rivaling sub-Saharan Africa.
The volatile contradictions of rapid economic growth ricochet daily through Indian life. Middle-class rage over mounting corruption is visceral. Frustration with the government is widespread. Leftists and other critics blame India's landmark 1991 market reforms for failing to lift the rural poor out of poverty; business leaders warn that India risks slower growth or even stagnation unless those economic changes deepen and governing improves.
Today, Gurgaon is one of India's fastest-growing districts, having expanded more than 70 percent during the past decade to more than 1.5 million people, larger than most American cities. It accounts for almost half of all revenues for its state, Haryana, and added 50,000 vehicles to the roads last year alone. Real estate values have risen sharply in a city that has become a roaring engine of growth, if also a colossal headache as a place to live and work.
The Birth of a Boom
Before it had malls, a theme park and fancy housing compounds, Gurgaon had blue cows. Or so Kushal Pal Singh was told during the 1970s when he began describing his development vision for Gurgaon. It was a farming village whose name, derived from the Hindu epic the Mahabharata, means ''village of the gurus.'' It also had wild animals, similar to cows, known for their strangely bluish tint.
''Most people told me I was mad,'' Mr. Singh recalled. ''People said: 'Who is going to go there? There are blue cows roaming around.' ''
Gurgaon was widely regarded as an economic wasteland. In 1979, the state of Haryana created Gurgaon by dividing a longstanding political district on the outskirts of New Delhi. One half would revolve around the city of Faridabad, which had an active municipal government, direct rail access to the capital, fertile farmland and a strong industrial base. The other half, Gurgaon, had rocky soil, no local government, no railway link and almost no industrial base.
As an economic competition, it seemed an unfair fight. And it has been: Gurgaon has won, easily. Faridabad has struggled to catch India's modernization wave, while Gurgaon's disadvantages turned out to be advantages, none more important, initially, than the absence of a districtwide government, which meant less red tape capable of choking development.
By 1979, Mr. Singh had taken control of his father-in-law's real estate company, now known as DLF, at a moment when urban development in India was largely overseen by government agencies. In most states, private developers had little space to operate, but Haryana was an exception. Slowly, Mr. Singh began accumulating 3,500 acres in Gurgaon that he divided into plots and began selling to people unable to afford prices in New Delhi.
Still, growth was slow until after 1991, when the government barely staved off default on foreign debts and began introducing market economic reforms. Demand for housing steadily increased, followed by demand for commercial space as multinational corporations began arriving to take advantage of India's emerging outsourcing industry.
Outsourcing required workspaces for thousands of white-collar employees. In New Delhi, rents were exorbitant and space was limited, and Mr. Singh began pitching Gurgaon as an alternative. It did have advantages: it was close to the New Delhi airport and a Maruti-Suzuki automobile plant had opened in the 1980s. But Gurgaon still seemed remote and DLF needed a major company to take a risk to locate there.
The answer would be General Electric. Mr. Singh had become the company's India representative after befriending Jack Welch, then the G.E. chairman. When Mr. Welch decided to outsource some business operations to India, he eventually opened a G.E. office inside a corporate park in Gurgaon in 1997.
''When G.E. came in,'' Mr. Singh said, ''others followed.''
With other Indian cities also competing for outsourcing business, DLF and other developers raced to capture the market with a helter-skelter building spree. Today, Gurgaon has 30 million square feet of commercial space, a tenfold increase from 2001, even surpassing the total in New Delhi.
''If the buildings were not there,'' Mr. Singh said of multinational companies, ''they would have gone somewhere else.''
Ordinarily, such a wild building boom would have had to hew to a local government master plan. But Gurgaon did not yet have such a plan, nor did it yet have a districtwide municipal government. Instead, Gurgaon was mostly under state control. Developers built the infrastructure inside their projects, while a state agency, the Haryana Urban Development Authority, or HUDA, was supposed to build the infrastructure binding together the city.
And that is where the problems arose. HUDA and other state agencies could not keep up with the pace of construction. The absence of a local government had helped Gurgaon become a leader of India's growth boom. But that absence had also created a dysfunctional city. No one was planning at a macro level; every developer pursued his own agenda as more islands sprouted and state agencies struggled to keep pace with growth.
''We have to keep up,'' said Nitin Kumar Yadav, the local HUDA administrator. ''That is our pressure.''
Gurgaon had been marketed as Millennium City, yet it had become an unmanageable city. For companies that had come to India in search of business efficiencies, the inefficiencies of Gurgaon presented a new challenge they would have to overcome on their own.
Self-Contained Islands
It is 8 p.m. on a recent Tuesday, time for the shift change at Genpact, a descendant of G.E. and one of Gurgaon's biggest outsourcing companies. Two long rows of white sport utility vehicles, vans and cars are waiting in the parking lot, yellow emergency lights flickering in the early darkness, as employees trickle out of call centers for their ride home. These contracted vehicles represent Genpact's private fleet, a necessity given the absence of a public transportation system in Gurgaon.
From computerized control rooms, Genpact employees manage 350 private drivers, who travel roughly 60,000 miles every day transporting 10,000 employees. Employees book daily online reservations and receive e-mail or text message ''tickets'' for their assigned car. In the parking lot, a large L.E.D. screen is posted with rolling lists of cars and their assigned passengers.
And the cars are only the beginning. Faced with regular power failures, Genpact has backup diesel generators capable of producing enough electricity to run the complex for five days (or enough electricity for about 2,000 Indian homes). It has a sewage treatment plant and a post office, which uses only private couriers, since the local postal service is understaffed and unreliable. It has a medical clinic, with a private ambulance, and more than 200 private security guards and five vehicles patrolling the region. It has A.T.M.'s, a cellphone kiosk, a cafeteria and a gym.
''It is a fully finished small city,'' said Naveen Puri, a Genpact administrator.
Actually, it is a private island, one of many inside Gurgaon. The city's residential compounds, especially the luxury developments along golf courses, exist as similarly self-contained entities. Nearly every major outsourcing company in the city depends on private infrastructure, as do the commercial towers filled with other companies.
''We pretty much carry the entire weight of what you would expect many states to do,'' said Pramod Bhasin, who this spring stepped down as Genpact's chief executive. ''The problem -- a very big problem -- is our public services are always lagging a few years behind, but sometimes a decade behind. Our planning processes sometimes exist only on paper.''
For many years, even Gurgaon's commercial centerpiece, Cyber City, was off the public grid. ''They were not connected to any city service,'' said Jyoti Sagar, a lawyer and civic activist. ''They were like a spaceship. You had these shiny buildings, and underneath you had a huge pit where everybody's waste was going.''
Not all of the city's islands are affluent, either. Gurgaon has an estimated 200,000 migrant workers, the so-called floating population, who work on construction sites or as domestic help. Sheikh Hafizuddin, 38, lives in a slum with a few hundred other migrants less than two miles from Cyber City. No more than half the children in the slum attend school, with the rest spending their days playing on the hard-packed dirt of the settlement, where pigs wallow in an open pit of sewage and garbage. Mr. Hafizuddin pays $30 a month for a tiny room. His landlord runs a power line into the slum for electricity and draws water from a borehole on the property.
''Sometimes it works,'' Mr. Hafizuddin said. ''Sometimes it doesn't work.''
Even at the fringes of Gurgaon's affluent areas, large pools of black sewage water are easy to spot. The water supply is vastly inadequate, leaving private companies, developers and residents dependent on borewells that are draining the underground aquifer. Local activists say the water table is falling as much as 10 feet every year.
Meanwhile, with Gurgaon's understaffed police force outmatched by such a rapidly growing population, some law-and-order responsibilities have been delegated to the private sector. Nearly 12,000 private security guards work in Gurgaon, and many are pressed into directing traffic on major streets.
When an outsourcing employee was sexually assaulted after being dropped near her home in New Delhi, politicians placed the onus on the companies, even though the attack occurred on a New Delhi street. Outsourcing companies now must install GPS devices inside every private car and hire more security guards to escort female employees to their home at night.
The politicians ''are basically telling me that the Delhi roads are my responsibility, which is not the case,'' said Vidya Srinivasan, who oversees logistics for Genpact.
Yet outsourcing is thriving in Gurgaon, anyway. Last year, a leading Indian industrial association determined that outsourcing was directly and indirectly responsible for about 500,000 jobs in Gurgaon. Companies still gravitate to Gurgaon because the city's commercial space is more modern, more abundant and far cheaper than that in New Delhi, while Gurgaon is also a magnet for India's best-educated, English-speaking young professionals, the essential raw material in the outsourcing business. And there is the benefit of a concentration of expertise: in the past decade, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Motorola, Ericsson, Nestle India and other foreign and Indian companies have opened offices in Gurgaon.
Still, Ms. Srinivasan said, the lack of government support is frustrating. She recently returned from a new Genpact operation in the port city of Dalian, China. There, she said, local officials ''are doing everything to keep companies like ours.'' Asked if the government in Gurgaon was equally responsive, she shook her head.
''In India, it is not because of the government,'' she said, explaining how things get done. ''It is in spite of the government.''
Playing Catch-Up
Sudhir Rajpal, the wiry, mustachioed commissioner of the new Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon, has a long to-do list: fix the roads, the sewers, the electrical grid, the drainage, the lack of public buses, the lack of water and the lack of planning. The Municipal Corporation was formed in 2008, and Mr. Rajpal, having assumed the city's top administrative position a few months ago, has been conducting a listening tour to convince people that government can solve their problems.
It is not an easy sell.
One recent morning, his audience was a few dozen farmers in Badshahpur, one of the villages absorbed into the sprawling new territory of the Municipal Corporation. Most are actually former farmers, having sold their land to the developers constructing the office parks and apartment towers now ringing the village. Many of them had bought new cars or new plots of land or invested in the new developments. They were now richer. Their frustration was their village. It was becoming an urban slum.
''The drains are broken and accidents are happening,'' shouted one man. ''Yet no one is answerable! There are problems and problems. Whatever water we get is dirty, but we have nowhere to complain.''
When India's public and private sectors are compared, the contrast is usually stark: the private sector is praised for its efficiency, linear command structure and task-oriented ethos; the public sector is condemned for its opacity, lack of accountability and the fact that often no single agency seems in charge. Even as many Gurgaon residents hope that the Municipal Corporation can improve services, others worry that its authority is too limited, given that state agencies will maintain authority over licenses and infrastructure.
In Haryana, developers make campaign donations to politicians and exercise enormous power. Critics say graft and corruption are widespread. Many developers have disregarded promises to construct parks and other amenities. Meanwhile, state agencies like HUDA operate with little accountability. Civic leaders say more than $2 billion in infrastructure fees collected from Gurgaon have gone into HUDA's general budget without any benefit to the city.
''They used that money somewhere else,'' said Sanjeev Ahuja, a veteran journalist in Gurgaon. ''The government thinks the private sector will take care of the city: 'People are rich. If they need water, they can buy water.' ''
Some people hope Gurgaon's new municipal council, which was elected on May 13 to oversee the Municipal Corporation, will create a political voice for the city capable of forcing action. Eventually, the Municipal Corporation is expected to assume responsibility for providing services in all of Gurgaon, yet some residents are leery of the change.
Santosh Khosla, an information technology consultant whose family moved to Gurgaon in 1993, has services provided by his developer, DLF. He said DLF had broken numerous promises and did only an adequate job of delivering water and power. Still, adequate is tolerable.
''I'm certain that if it goes to the government,'' he said, ''it will be worse.''
Citizens Speak Up
Col. Ratan Singh, his military beret placed neatly atop his head, has arrived at a busy intersection in the midday sun for what he calls ''an agitation.'' He is 82, an Indian Army veteran who has decided that private citizens need to incite a little conflict in Gurgaon. Demonstrations are common in Gurgaon, and he is leading a protest against shoddy work by a contractor.
''Every day some agitation is taking place,'' he said, shouting above the din of traffic. ''People are not satisfied.''
If people should be satisfied anywhere in India, Gurgaon should be the place. Average incomes rank among the highest in the country. Property values have jumped sharply since the 1990s. Gurgaon's malls offer many of the country's best shops and restaurants, while the city's most exclusive housing enclaves are among the finest in India.
Yet the economic power that growth has delivered to Gurgaon has not been matched by political power. The celebrated middle class created by India's boom has far less clout at the ballot box than the hundreds of millions of rural peasants struggling to live on $2 a day, given the far larger rural vote, and thus are courted far less by Indian politicians. This has made it harder to accrue the political power needed to correct Gurgaon's problems. When middle-class civic groups in Gurgaon pushed state leaders to create a single government authority overseeing the city, they were flicked away.
Faced with so many urban headaches, though, civic activists like Colonel Singh are pushing the government for change, or simply making change on their own. Colonel Singh leads an umbrella group of residents' associations that have started volunteer vigilance groups as watchdogs against crime.
Another civic activist, Latika Thukral, a former Citigroup employee, is involved in creating a biodiversity park. Ms. Thukral led efforts to clean up an illegal garbage dump and is organizing a campaign to plant a million trees this summer.
''If people like us don't stand up for our rights, our country will not change,'' she said. ''The tipping point has come in India.''
Across India, Gurgaon is both a model and a cautionary tale. Other cities want to emulate Gurgaon's growth and dynamism but avoid the dysfunction and lack of planning. Meanwhile, Gurgaon is trying to address its infrastructure woes; last year, the city was connected to the New Delhi rapid transit system, while a public-private project is under way to construct a link to Cyber City. Yet the state and local governments are still struggling to keep up, especially since Gurgaon is already building a industrial district and planning to create more commercial space.
''If Gurgaon had not happened, the rest of India's development would not have happened, either,'' contended Mr. Singh, the chairman of DLF. ''Gurgaon became a pacesetter.''

HEADLINE: The Wake-Up Call

BYLINE: By BARBARA TAYLOR

 BODY:
I remember the day I reached my limit with the retail coffee and espresso business that my husband and I started in 2003. When we started our little food service venture, it was supposed to be a fun project that would eventually run itself and act as an additional source of income for our household. But after three years, two locations and countless hours, it became evident that our plan was easier said than done.
I had felt the day coming. There are some things you just know about your business. We were fast asleep one cold, February morning in 2005 when Chris's cellphone rang at 4:15. It was the lead barista at our north location calling to say she wouldn't be able to work her shift. That gave one of us 15 minutes to jump out of bed, get dressed and fly into Bentonville, Ark., to open our flagship store in time for the morning rush. This was not the first time this had happened, but it ended up being a wake-up call in more ways than one. In my business-owner bones, I knew things had to change. I also knew that there was something fundamentally wrong with my business: me. 
Many owners reach a point in the life of their businesses where they hit a wall, a point beyond which they are either unable or unwilling to go. ''Somewhere around $3 million dollars of revenue, I went from being the driver of my business to the bottleneck,'' John Warrillow, author of ''Built to Sell: Creating a Business That Can Thrive Without You,'' wrote in a recent blog post. ''Each year we stood still, I grew more frustrated. I felt like I was trying to swim in a pair of jeans.''
Mr. Warrillow calls this phenomenon the Ceiling of Control, and he describes his book as a field guide to getting beyond it. ''I had reached a ceiling beyond which I would never grow until I gave up control of our product and how we sold it,'' he wrote in the blog post. ''Intellectually I knew I needed to revamp my business model, but emotionally I was tired. Part of me just wanted to lock the doors one night and walk away. In the end, I decided eight years of my life was too important to throw away, so I committed to putting in a few more years to scaling up and getting out.''
Richard Trottier -- author of ''Middle Market Strategies'' and president of Sundial Partners, an investment bank boutique in Sarasota, Fla. -- has done extensive research on the landscape of privately held businesses, grouping them by size and determining what prevents them from moving forward. Working with the University of South Florida's Center for Economic Development and using census data from 2007, Mr. Trottier found the following: There are roughly 27 million businesses in the United States but only about five million have employees. Of those five million, only about 300,000 have annual revenue in excess of $5 million.
''There's something stopping most businesses from growing,'' said Mr. Trottier, who has identified five walls that he says business owners must overcome to grow: 1) motivational, 2) operational, 3) capital, 4) market and 5) transfer. If you're a business owner and think you may have hit a wall, take heart. You're not alone. ''Fully 95 percent of businesses never grow into the next category,'' Mr. Trottier said in a recent interview with The Deal. His advice to business owners who have hit a wall is first to identify which wall it is.
In my case, I felt like a pinball bouncing off three of the walls Mr. Trottier describes. I was managing 16 food-service employees, which felt like more than enough for me. My least favorite management tasks - human resources -- were consuming the bulk of my time (operational wall). I knew I needed to scale the business, adding at least one more location to support hiring a full-time manager to take the burden off my husband and me. In short, growth was the answer to our problem, but it would require more money, most likely in the form of a Small Business Administration loan (capital wall), and I didn't want to take on either the headache of expanding the business or the worry of incurring debt (motivational wall). Like Mr. Warrillow, my husband and I chose to switch gears and devote the next year to selling our business.
According to Mr. Trottier, the motivational walls tend to be the toughest for business owners. ''The cold hard fact is that most private business owners are not interested in growing their business,'' Mr. Trottier writes in his book. ''Standing pat may appear attractive,'' he adds, ''but being content with mere survival is a losing strategy.''
Barbara Taylor is co-owner of a business brokerage, Synergy Business Services, in Bentonville, Ark. Here is her guide to selling a business.

HEADLINE: Why a Retailer Can't Get a Loan

BYLINE: By ROBB MANDELBAUM

 BODY:
Our case study last week examined the efforts of a bicycle shop owner in Princeton, N.J., to secure a loan. Charles Kuhn, who runs Kopp's Cycle, had sought $1 million to refinance the mortgage on the shop, pay down debt, and obtain working capital. Unfortunately for Mr. Kuhn, the recession has hurt both his business and, apparently, the value of his real estate, undermining its potential as loan collateral.
But the lenders and other advisers we consulted suggested that Mr. Kuhn's inability to get a loan has more to do with how he has managed his business than the economic climate or the reluctance of bankers to make loans. ''The first impression is we are trying to treat the symptom and not the cause,'' said Lorraine Allen, regional director of the Small Business Development Center at the College of New Jersey in nearby Ewing. ''If the banks tell us we have a problem with cash flow, we have to trace through the lines of operation to see where the challenges are and address them, and not just for the sake of the loan.'' You're The Boss readers agreed. 
Some commenters took issue with Mr. Kuhn's seeming disdain for the S.B.A.'s reporting requirements, while others faulted him for adjusting his salary to control profits. But many more readers had constructive advice for Mr. Kuhn, as did the other experts we consulted.
One commenter, Michael, of Spencer, Iowa, urged Mr. Kuhn not to cut prices on the accessories he sells. ''The average consumer looks at the big thing -- in this case the bike -- and shops that hard,'' Michael wrote, recommending that Mr. Kuhn benchmark his bicycle prices against the Web sites his customers are shopping. ''Accessories, on the other hand, are where he and most retailers -- including me -- make more money.''
Barry Sloane, president and chief executive of Newtek Business Services in New York, agreed. ''Cutting margin on all the accessories was suicide for the year. Margin pays bills,'' he said. ''Instead, for anyone coming in his store with a PDA or ad with a lower price he should match the price. You can accommodate break price on a case-by-case basis just for the discriminating price-sensitive shopper without changing your regular prices or margin.''
Michael suggested that Mr. Kuhn emphasize repairs - and that ''his service rates should be high margin'' - and other readers recommend he specifically target the customers of his online or big-box competitors, where new bikes come unassembled and often without warranties. ''He should charge a fee to build a bike somebody buys on line, and offer a service package too,'' wrote DD, of Los Angeles. And ''if someone comes into the store with a bike that needs servicing that wasn't bought there, then our guy should fleece the customer.''
Several readers thought that Kopp's should become more engaged in the local community, sponsoring rides and a racing team, holding workshops and allying with livability organizations and other businesses. Ms. Allen, of the S.B.D.C., echoed this point: community groups ''are like small arteries, marketing to their membership instead of in onesies or twosies,'' she said. ''Maybe they host the weekly ride and partner with a bank or restaurant afterwards to sponsor discounts or water or something for the ride or the experience. The partner or sponsor will also be marketing the program as well as part of their participation in the community.''
All of our outside experts thought the shop's Web site could be improved. Ms. Allen and Jay Townley, a bicycle store consultant based in Lyndon Station, Wis., both thought the site could use more social media elements, such as videos on bicycle repair and safety. ''Social media, like the Web site, can be a pain to keep current,'' said Mr. Townley, ''but Kopp's has the advantage of already working with a Web service that can provide content and assistance in integrating social media into the stores Web site and marketing.'' According to Mr. Townley, the Kopp's Web site is supplied by a company that tailors Web services to independent bike stores.
Ms. Allen thought the site needs more ''local flavor - pictures of local events featuring bicycles, local bike news, etc. It looks like strictly a sales catalog, but people aren't buying that way now. They buy value, which equals price plus a sense of belonging and support, which often trumps just price.'' But Mr. Sloane felt that even as a sales mechanism, the site falls short. ''The pictures of all bikes are small and look the same,'' he said. ''There are no key words set up for organic search. The site should be arranged with an attractive catalog, call-to-action specials and a shopping cart that stands out and is easy to find.''
In an e-mail message, Mr. Kuhn, who said he was attending to his sick mother, said that he was ''overwhelmed'' by all of the feedback to his story: ''My plan is to take all of the responses to the article and use everything I can.''
Mr. Kuhn did not address comments from some readers that he was not committed to building a business, though he did say he intended to develop a three-year plan, as Mr. Townley and several readers advised. He did, however, take exception to suggestions that he is not committed to cycling. ''I have been working very hard for over 35 years full time and to question my love of bikes makes me upset,'' he wrote. ''My father and I worked side by side from the day I could walk until he died. We traveled to Europe and coached riders together as well as the day to day at the shop.''
As for Mr. Kopp's immediate financing concern, several readers suggested S.B.A. loans to refinance the present debt. (One suggested breaking the refinancing into several different S.B.A. component loans for the different types of debt.) But the most common suggestion was that Mr. Kuhn simply sell the building and relocate, or lease the space back. If the building is really worth as much as he thinks, they said, he could pay off his debt and plow the rest into his retirement or back into the business -- and find a bigger space for less elsewhere.
But Mr. Kuhn said that selling the building would be a last resort. And, in fact, he reported that sales have improved dramatically of late -- so much so that refinancing has become less pressing. He said the shop is ''increasing turnover and focusing on our most profitable areas and dropping some that are not.'' Business, Mr. Kuhn concluded, is ''the best in years.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

WASHINGTON -- Recent signs that the economic recovery is flagging have introduced a new tension into the bipartisan budget negotiations, giving rise to calls especially from liberals to limit the size of immediate spending cuts or even to provide an additional fiscal stimulus.
On Thursday, for the first time in two weeks, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and six Congressional leaders will meet with a new urgency to take up negotiations toward reaching a deficit-reduction deal in July. Democrats will make the case for additional tax revenues to balance spending cuts, an approach Republicans have rejected.
More broadly, however, the signs of an economic slowdown in past weeks -- not least Friday's report showing weak job growth in May -- have altered the climate for those talks. Amid the emphasis in Washington on significant deficit reductions, including new plans for spending cuts from more than 100 of the most conservative House Republicans and from Tim Pawlenty, one of the Republican presidential aspirants, some Democrats, economists and financial market analysts are raising concerns that too much fiscal restraint this year and next could further undermine the recovery. 
''On the one hand the markets want a deal,'' said Howard Gleckman, an editor and analyst at the Tax Policy Center, a joint effort of two centrist research organizations, the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. ''On the other they don't want a deal that's going to send the economy back into recession.''
While the Biden group, which includes Congressional leaders from both parties, is focused on ways to reduce projected annual deficits over the next 10 years, many Democrats say the immediate issue of what to do about a weak economy now looms for the negotiators should they reach a deal. They have taken their concerns to the White House.
The administration is already intent on limiting the proposed spending cuts for the 2012 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1; Republicans prefer larger cuts up front.
''We are working toward a balanced approach to deficit reduction that will be phased in so it wouldn't interfere with an economy that over the next two years will continue to be strengthening,'' said Jason Furman, the deputy director of the White House National Economic Council.
Beyond that, however, Democrats and more liberal economists are suggesting that any long-term deficit reduction be paired with short-term spending increases or tax cuts to spur the economy, should it continue to weaken -- perhaps by extending for 2012 the payroll tax cuts, business write-offs for equipment and other investments and extended federal unemployment benefits that President Obama and Republican Congressional leaders agreed to in December for this year.
Mr. Obama stoked such speculation on Tuesday at a press conference alongside Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, when he was asked what he might do to avert a double-dip recession.
''One of the things that I'm going to be interested in exploring with the members of both parties in Congress is how do we continue some of these policies to make sure we get this recovery up and running in a robust way,'' he said.
Republicans would probably support extending the tax cuts, but not the unemployment aid. ''I don't know if throwing more money at the problem is going to solve anything,'' Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman, said Wednesday at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg News.
Mr. Obama and administration officials say they expect economic growth to pick up later in the year after what they call ''the headwinds'' of high oil prices and fallout from the earthquake in Japan, turmoil in the Middle East and the debt crises in Europe -- an assessment similar to views expressed this week by Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and many financial analysts.
Yet the setbacks have depressed Mr. Obama's poll ratings for his handling of the economy to their lowest levels, stoking concerns among his advisers as the 2012 election season gets under way.
''I think Obama himself is going to have to move or he's going to risk losing the next election,'' said Mark Weisbrot, a liberal economist and a co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ''He's going to have to say clearly that the federal government has to step in when the economy is so weak,'' regardless of whether his proposals can pass in the Republican-controlled House.
Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics, a macroeconomic consulting firm, who has advised members of both parties, said he was not ready to call for an additional stimulus. ''I think we can wait to the fall to determine whether that's necessary or not,'' he said.
But, he added, neither should the White House and Congress tighten fiscal policy too much right now as the economy sputters to emerge from the worst downturn since the Depression. The government is already contracting its role in the economy, Mr. Zandi noted, given both the spending cuts that Mr. Obama and Congress approved for the current fiscal year and the fact that stimulus measures enacted since 2009 are phasing out.
''The recent slowdown does reinforce a point, and that is that any additional fiscal restraint in the near term would be in error,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''There's a fair amount of fiscal restraint already in progress and that will gain momentum next year without any changes. So if you add to that, you are running the risk of undermining the expansion. It would be wrong to pile on at this juncture.''
But this week 103 House Republicans told party leaders, Speaker John A. Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a negotiator in the Biden group, that they want immediate spending cuts of at least $380 billion for 2012 to halve the projected deficit, as a condition of their support for raising the federal debt limit this summer.
Such cuts are far deeper than those proposed up front in the House-passed budget written by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, which has led to protests in Republican lawmakers' districts. Analysts across the spectrum dismissed the conservatives' plan; Mr. Zandi and Mr. Gleckman said it would provoke a recession, thereby increasing annual deficits in the near term.
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an adviser to Republicans, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the American Action Forum, a center-right research group, said he had no fear that the White House and Congress actually would cut too much. ''I live for the day when a Congress cuts spending so aggressively that it actually endangers near-term growth,'' he said. ''We've never seen that.''
But neither should they provide additional stimulus, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. ''It was appropriate when the economy was falling,'' he said, ''but it's been growing for a long time. We need better growth policies.''

HEADLINE: Suspicion and Disunity Impede Central America's Effort to Fight Drug Violence

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- The nations of Central America agree on one thing: They cannot by themselves combat the drug and organized crime violence that is making the region among the world's unsafest.
But whether they can overcome suspicions of one another's law enforcement and military and a general disdain for any whiff of political integration may be the key to success in their efforts to develop a unified approach.
The Organization of American States, concluding its annual assembly here Tuesday, proclaimed that it is making a strong effort to help the Central American members develop a coordinated strategy. 
At the same time, diplomats continue to lay the ground work for a regional summit in Guatemala later this month among Central American nations, Colombia, Mexico and the United States that is expected to generate cooperation agreements among several nations and develop a multimillion dollar investment from international donors. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to attend, State Department officials said.
That conference will include the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank, a reflection of business concerns over increasing drug violence and its economic costs.
Still, the record on getting governments in the region to share resources and information has been spotty and several diplomats said concrete action may rest with the United States jump-starting the process -- at a time when the Obama administration's priorities are elsewhere and its chief diplomat for Latin America is preparing to leave.
Nonetheless, the severity of the violence in Central America, which the United Nations has called among the worst outside of war zones, is pushing nations to negotiate in a way they had not before, said Ennio Rodriguez, the Central America specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank.
''We are not being romantic about it,'' he said. ''Building trust is not going to be easy for governments of different political standpoints. But a trusting platform is being developed.''
Central America has some of the highest homicide rates, partly because drug trafficking organizations are increasingly using the region and expanding into other crimes, including kidnapping, extortion and money laundering.
Last month, 27 people, farm workers and their families, were massacred in northern Guatemala near the Mexican border, an attack the authorities there blamed on one of Mexico's most notorious gangs, the Zetas.
Jose Miguel Insulza, the secretary general of the O.A.S., said in an interview that it will likely take years to reduce the crime problem because courts are so weak..
''The main problem is impunity,'' he said. ''There is no point in having police if the judge is going to let the guys go.''
Analysts said Central American governments must overcome mistrust of each others' law enforcement and militaries. It took the United States and Mexico years to reach a level of cooperation both sides now call unprecedented. And even now, American investigators only work with Mexican units they have vetted, and American diplomats have complained of a lack of coordination among Mexican agencies.
''Countries have enough problems within themselves coordinating various security agencies and sharing information,'' said Shannon K. O'Neil, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York who studies Latin America. ''Doing that across countries just adds to the complexity, and escalates the levels of mistrust.''
Kevin Casas-Zamora, a former vice president of Costa Rica and a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Central American nations have managed to work together on economic accords but not so much on political affairs.
''There are different levels of political and institutional development in the region,'' he said. ''The Costa Ricans are extremely suspicious of anything that smacks of political integration. They see their institutions as much better than those in Nicaragua or Honduras.''
Not much regional cooperation will happen unless the United States plays an active role, he said.
President Obama, in a visit here in March, promised $200 million to combat organized crime in Central America, but diplomats and government officials in the region complain it is insufficient.
''It's a drop in the bucket,'' Oscar Alvarez, the security minister of Honduras, told reporters here Monday.
Arturo Valenzuela, the United States assistant secretary of state overseeing Latin America, is leaving his post this summer, after less than two years, to return to teaching. He attended the assembly here and, in an interview, said the United States would press more coordination among the nations but that relying on the United States to deliver ever more aid was ''an outdated view.''

HEADLINE: Split by Infighting, OPEC Keeps a Cap on Oil

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- A meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ended on Wednesday in disarray, with ministers failing to reach a consensus to raise oil production levels. That left existing quotas in place, despite rising world prices and pressure from major oil-consuming countries to increase output.
In the short term, the stalemate, which is a rare public disagreement within the cartel, is unlikely to have more than symbolic importance. OPEC members are already pumping above their quota levels, and Saudi Arabia, the only OPEC country with the ability to increase production significantly, has promised to continue raising its output to satisfy world demand.
Oil traders were largely unruffled, with the price of the American benchmark crude rising less than 2 percent to settle at $100.74 a barrel. 
But the discord highlights the widening split between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are vying for influence in a Middle East that is being rapidly reshaped by populist uprisings throughout the region. The public disagreement also underscores that the 12 OPEC member countries are increasingly making their own decisions about production levels rather than bowing to the collective judgment of the group.
''This longstanding Iranian-Saudi competition is now being played out in OPEC,'' said David L. Goldwyn, until recently the State Department's coordinator for international energy affairs. ''Unfortunately for Iran, and fortunately for the rest of us, it's Saudi Arabia that has the spare capacity to give. So Iran can grab the headlines, but Saudi Arabia will follow its own judgment.''
At the meeting, Saudi Arabia, which has historically wielded the greatest clout within the group, argued for a change in production quotas that had been set nearly three years ago. But six other countries with quotas, led by Iran, the current leader of OPEC, refused to agree, arguing that the world's markets were already flush with oil and that high prices were merely the fault of speculators.
''It was one of the worst meetings we've ever had,'' the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, told reporters after the gathering. He promised that his country and all the Persian Gulf members with spare production capacity, including Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, would assure that the world is well supplied with oil.
It was the first time in two decades that OPEC delegates could not arrive at a public agreement at a formal meeting.
With oil exports from Libya and Yemen essentially frozen because of the violent conflicts there, OPEC has faced growing pressure to increase its production to make up the difference.
On Wednesday, the Obama administration expressed disappointment with OPEC's inaction.
''We believe that we are in a situation where supply does not meet demand,'' a White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said. He said President Obama would consider releasing oil from the nation's strategic reserves if necessary, although gasoline prices have eased a bit in the last month.
As a group, OPEC members are currently pumping about 1.5 million barrels a day above their quota levels anyway, and Saudi Arabia has been increasing output during the last several weeks by an estimated 200,000 barrels a day. Even Iran has been exceeding its allotment by about 50,000 barrels a day for more than a year to raise money to counter economic sanctions.
Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst and managing director of Oppenheimer & Company, said that OPEC's failure to adjust quotas made little difference.
''Everybody in OPEC is cheating and everyone knows that,'' he said. ''Don't listen to what they say, but watch what they do.''
In a short statement after OPEC ministers met behind closed doors in Vienna on Wednesday, the organization said, ''No formal decision was reached on a production agreement. However, the organization abides by its longstanding commitment to order and stability in the international oil market.''
OPEC ministers are likely to meet again within three months, possibly in Iran, to reconsider their decision.
The cartel's decision comes at a time when international oil markets are tightening, with stockpiles declining in much of the world despite sluggish economies in the United States and Europe. The Energy Department estimated this week that world oil consumption would grow by 1.7 million barrels a day in 2011 compared with last year, mostly because of increasing use of oil for electricity generation in China, Japan and the Middle East.
More worrisome to oil experts are the threats to supplies. The armed conflict in Libya has taken more than 1.3 million barrels a day off the world market, and the turmoil in Yemen and Syria have subtracted as much as 300,000 barrels a day. Unrest in a major producer like Algeria or Saudi Arabia would send oil prices soaring, energy experts say.
The breakdown of order in Yemen is viewed as a danger for neighboring Saudi oil facilities if terrorists can freely use Yemen as a base in the future. Yemen could also be used as a base for pirates to threaten the nearby Bab el Mandeb shipping lane, through which passes an estimated 3.7 million barrels a day of oil.
Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, never particularly warm, are tense these days over the sectarian turmoil in Bahrain. Saudi Arabia sent more than 1,000 troops into Bahrain in March to help put down predominantly Shiite protests against the Sunni monarchy. Saudi Arabia blames Iran for inciting the protests, and Iran has harshly criticized Saudi Arabia and Bahrain for repressive policies.
Ever since Libyan exports slowed around March, Saudi Arabia has assured importing countries that it would bolster production. With spare production capacity estimated at 2.5 million to 3 million barrels a day, Saudi Arabia is the only OPEC member that has the ability to substantially bolster supplies and curb price increases.
''In the end, it's all about how much extra oil Saudi Arabia can or is willing to put on the market,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, a Rice University energy analyst. ''Who cares what Iran says? It doesn't matter.''
Non-OPEC producers have also been increasing production. Although North Sea production is falling, Brazil, Canada, China and the United States are pumping more oil this year.
But none of that would be enough to keep prices down if unrest spread to more OPEC members, which together account for an estimated 40 percent of world supplies.
The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based organization that represents industrial countries, initially reacted to the OPEC inaction with concern. But late in the day, its executive director, Nobuo Tanaka, expressed relief.
''We are pleased to hear in the aftermath of the OPEC meeting that a number of key producers plan to make more oil available,'' Mr. Tanaka said. He singled out the Saudi oil minister for particular praise.
The current OPEC quotas were set in December 2008, when oil prices were plummeting at the outset of a global recession. The quotas put a floor on slumping prices and maintained moderate and stable prices for more than a year. But as prices began to rise, many OPEC members began to cheat, making the current quotas little more than a shadow benchmark.
With oil prices rising by more than 35 percent in the past year, a debate has emerged inside OPEC about what to do about them. Saudi Arabia has led members that want to help the economic recovery with moderate prices, while Iran and Venezuela have resisted.
''We don't see that it is necessary to increase production,'' said Venezuela's oil minister, Rafael Ramirez. ''We believe the market is in balance.''

HEADLINE: More Trade and More Aid

BYLINE: By MATTHEW J. SLAUGHTER and ROBERT Z. LAWRENCE. 
Matthew J. Slaughter, a professor of management at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, and Robert Z. Lawrence, a professor of international trade and investment at the Harvard Kennedy School, were economic advisers to Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, respectively.

 BODY:
A FEUD over trade has erupted in Washington, and American workers are caught in the middle. Congressional Republicans (and some Democrats) are threatening to hold up approval of free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama if President Obama keeps insisting on renewing expanded benefits under Trade Adjustment Assistance, the main aid program for American workers harmed by foreign trade.
Supporters say the program -- which offers retraining, relocation and other benefits to workers who lose their jobs due to competition from imports -- offers vital protection. Opponents label it an unaffordable boondoggle. If our country fails to resolve this dispute, our economic future will be bleak. 
As former advisers to presidents from different parties, we are coming together to urge a way out: rethinking how we help displaced workers in order to revive political support for the free trade our economy needs.
Three principles guide our proposal. First, trade is indeed worth it for America. Annual national income today is at least $1 trillion higher than it would have been absent decades of trade and investment liberalization. With unemployment at 9.1 percent and 24.6 million Americans unemployed or underemployed, we need to rebalance our economy away from the excessive consumption that helped bring about the global financial crisis, and create jobs linked to exports and international investment.
Second, trade is not worth it for every individual American. Trade creates unemployment for some and wage losses for others; its gains do not directly accrue to every worker and community. Indeed, there has been a steep drop in public support for trade; a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found that only 17 percent of respondents said free-trade deals have helped America.
Third, Trade Adjustment Assistance, created in 1962 to supplement unemployment insurance, cannot adequately help displaced workers. Workers today face continual adjustment as new technologies and competitors, both domestic and foreign, render their talents and skills obsolete. Indeed, the premise that job losses can be attributed to precise causes is archaic, given the linkages among international trade and investment and technological change.
In recent years, less than half of workers certified as eligible for T.A.A. benefits have actually used them. Petitions filed with the Labor Department for T.A.A. benefits in 2007 covered just 93,903 workers -- fewer than the number of jobs created or lost on an average day.
Our proposal to resolve the trade impasse: more trade and more aid. More trade means that President Obama should immediately submit, and Congress should immediately ratify, the pending free-trade agreements. Colombia and Panama already enjoy unfettered access to our market, and South Korea has negotiated free-trade deals with the European Union and India; we cannot afford to fall behind.
More aid means Congress and the president should replace T.A.A. with a broader safety net that helps workers regardless of why they lost their jobs. Unemployment insurance, introduced in the early 1930s, has not really changed since then; it should be merged with T.A.A. Today, unemployed workers face challenges far greater than T.A.A. or unemployment insurance alone can address: getting matched with a new employer, often in a new industry; upgrading or learning new skills, often at reduced wages; and coping with lost benefits, especially health coverage.
A new American Adjustment Program should combine the best elements of unemployment insurance, T.A.A., and training programs authorized by the Workforce Investment Act. This approach would include a wage-loss insurance program for workers 45 and older, to speed their rehiring by supplementing their income if they take work at lower pay; helping workers receiving unemployment insurance to pay for coverage under Cobra (which allows workers who lose their jobs to keep group health benefits for limited periods); and enabling unemployed workers to make penalty-free withdrawals from savings accounts like 401(k)'s and I.R.A.'s to finance costs like occupational retraining and relocation.
Our plan would cost about $20 billion per year. We would pay for this by scrapping the current unemployment insurance tax structure, which is extremely regressive, for a low flat tax on all worker earnings -- a change that would cut taxes for tens of millions of lower-wage workers. The costs of our plan would decline in the long run as the economy recovers. Moreover, the cost of not better supporting workers will be far greater if a skeptical public pushes America into economic isolation and the result is slower growth, fewer jobs and lower tax receipts.
Voter support for engagement with the world economy is strongly linked to labor-market performance. If American workers continue to fear change, their support for free trade will not return.

HEADLINE: Obama Tries to Focus on Economic Fears

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- President Obama, battling the public's loss of confidence in his handling of the economy, came to a community college here on Wednesday to talk up a $2 billion program aimed at tailoring classes to match the needs of manufacturing companies. 
Speaking at Northern Virginia Community College, Mr. Obama termed the country's current unemployment situation ''unacceptable'' and said financial pressures should not stop the United States from investing in more worker training.
''Obviously we're slowly recovering from a very painful recession,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But there are too many people out there who are still out of work.''
The president said the country needed to spend more on programs that would create manufacturing jobs.
''We could decide, in solving our fiscal problems, that we can't afford to make any of these investments, and those of us who've done very well don't have to pay any more taxes in order to fund these investments,'' Mr. Obama said, using one of his favorite rhetorical devices.
Then, he knocked down his straw man:
''But I want to make clear, that's not our history,'' he said. ''I don't accept that future for the United States of America.''
Mr. Obama is battling increased wariness about his performance regarding the economy. A Washington Post-ABC News poll published this week showed that about 60 percent of those surveyed by phone in a random national sample of 1,002 adults disapproved of Mr. Obama's handling of the economy and the deficit, and his political backers are increasingly worried that the lagging economy will hurt his re-election chances.
On top of that, the unemployment rate climbed last week to 9.1 percent in May, heightening fears of a slowdown in an economic recovery that was already sputtering.
Mr. Obama used his appearance in Alexandria, a suburb of Washington, to highlight a program called Skills for America's Future that is part of the administration's response to the high unemployment rate.
''Right now, there are people across America with talents just waiting to be tapped,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Sparks waiting to be lit. Our job is to light them.''
Before his remarks, the president visited a classroom where students were learning to repair hybrid cars, part of the college's automotive services program, headed by Ernest Packer, who worked at Ford for almost 30 years.
White House officials said the program was a model for the national effort, supported by the National Association of Manufacturers, to train half a million community college students for manufacturing jobs over the next five years, to help offset the retirement of 2.7 million older workers over the next decade or so.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall, Struggling After Bernanke's Talk

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Wall Street extended losses for the sixth consecutive day Wednesday as a bearish assessment of the economy from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, kept investors nervous.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 21.87 points, or 0.18 percent, to 12,048.94, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 5.38 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,279.56. The Nasdaq composite index fell 26.18 points, or 0.97 percent, to 2,675.38. 
The S.& P. was off about 5.7 percent from its 2011 intraday high hit on May 2. Stocks have come under pressure recently because of several weak economic reports, especially the labor market.
The weakness was highlighted by Mr. Bernanke's comments late Tuesday. He acknowledged that the recovery has slowed, but offered no hint that the Fed was considering any more stimulus to accelerate growth.
''Investors are repricing the slowdown after Bernanke crystallized it,'' said Jason L. Ware, senior equity research and trading analyst at the Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City. ''The market was hoping for an indication that there may be another round of stimulus, but clearly that's not what they got.''
The Fed's $600 billion second round of stimulus, expected to end this month, had been a catalyst for the stock market's advance.
Stocks in the health care and utility sectors rose, but financials and technology, sectors closely related to growth, kept up their losing streak.
''I think 1,250 is a key level and, if we get there, likely to provide support for the market, barring any further erosion in the underlying economic data,'' Mr. Ware said, referring to the S.& P. 500.
There were also signs of weakness from corporate America. Ciena, the communications networking equipment provider, forecast third-quarter revenue below expectations, driving down its stock and others in the sector.
Ciena fell 16.2 percent, to $20.29, while JDS Uniphase dropped 5.5 percent, to $17.40.
Limiting losses, the energy sector rose after talks at OPEC in Vienna broke down without an agreement on a production increase. The S.& P. 500 energy index rose 0.5 percent, and Exxon Mobil, which said it discovered two vast oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico, was up nearly 1 percent at $80.76.
Crude oil futures rose 1.7 percent to settle above $100 a barrel, at $100.74.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 14/32, to 101 17/32. The yield fell to 2.95 percent, from 3.00 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Message of Survival Won Denver Race for Mayor

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Dan Frosch contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DENVER -- Lots of politicians, when stumped on the stump, resort to talking about their own lives and the results are often about as exciting as your average greeting card.
Michael B. Hancock never had that problem.
In running for mayor of Denver, a position he won overwhelmingly on Tuesday, Mr. Hancock told a family story so powerful, almost Dickensian in its poverty and hope -- he and his twin sister were the youngest of 10 children raised by a single mother in Denver, part of that time in public housing -- that the theme of adversity overcome became the heart of the campaign.
''We've come from difficult situations, we've faced serious challenges, but yet we're still here,'' said Mr. Hancock, 41, in an interview on Wednesday, talking about his seven surviving siblings, all of whom, he said, got involved as volunteers on his behalf, along with their mother, Scharlyne Hancock, 72, who made calls to voters for weeks. 
The campaign's television commercials, in drawing out Mr. Hancock's story, used much the same language of perseverance in talking about Denver. The city, Mr. Hancock said again and again, had been punched by recession, staggering like so many other cities, but would be better for having taken a hit or two and would rise like never before.
People like Joseph Fox responded.
''His personal story was important,'' said Mr. Fox, 78, who was at the Hancock election night party. ''It connected him with people, and it was done well with the television commercials.''
In the runoff election, Mr. Hancock, a Democrat and member of the City Council, faced another Democrat, Chris Romer, a former state senator who had been considered the early front-runner. Mr. Romer came armed with more money, and beyond that a sterling political pedigree as the son of a former three-term governor of Colorado, Roy Romer.
But because Mr. Romer and Mr. Hancock had few policy disagreements, supporters in both camps said the race inevitably turned on style, likeability and the power of a compelling story.
Mr. Hancock, when inaugurated next month, will become Denver's second black mayor. The first was Wellington E. Webb, elected in 1991. Mr. Webb's pioneering role -- and perhaps the altered political landscape since President Obama's election in 2008 -- meant that race never came up as an issue in the campaign, Mr. Hancock said.
That Mr. Romer came from powerful roots and Mr. Hancock did not mean class, rather than race, was the dominant element of their divide, supporters on both sides said.
''He is a kid of privilege,'' said a Romer supporter, Ginnie Kontnik, who was at her candidate's gloomy election night party. ''But he has used his privilege his entire life to do the right things,'' she added. ''Their campaign did not tell that story.''
Mr. Romer also attacked Mr. Hancock in television ads, blasting him, for example, for voting to raise pay for city workers in 2007, while on the City Council.
Mr. Hancock said on Wednesday that the attacks had completely backfired and became the turning point of the election.
Taking a page from a former Denver mayor, and now governor, John Hickenlooper, Mr. Hancock had promised not to use negative campaign techniques, and he thinks voters judged Mr. Romer harshly for doing so.
Mr. Hancock said his winning coalition was largely made of Hispanic, black and middle class white voters, a group that he also described as very close to Mr. Hickenlooper's model coalitions.
''I think it's just clear that Denver doesn't like negative campaigning,'' Mr. Hancock said. ''Hickenlooper made the pledge and you see the margins of his victories going forward.''
But while Mr. Hickenlooper's often-told personal story revolved around the travails of a small businessman who stumbled into politics, Mr. Hancock told voters about much harder parts of the world. His brother, Robert, died of AIDS in 1996. A sister, Karen, was killed in a murder-suicide in 2002.
The family hit bottom, Mr. Hancock said, when he was about six or seven, shortly after his parents' divorce. They became homeless, living in a motel and, as he put it in the interview, ''trying to figure out what was next.''
But always the Hancock story came down to how adversity was overcome. In one church appearance during the campaign, for example, he talked about the sixth grade teacher who changed his life. He had been misbehaving in class, and Mr. Hancock described the day she took him aside and said that instead of punishing him, she would make him a student leader.
Then he introduced the teacher herself -- a member of that very church.
Mr. Hancock said that tough budget issues -- Denver faces a nearly $100 million projected deficit in 2012 -- would probably dominate his agenda.
But he said that optimism, inspired by his mother, who supported the family as a hospital medical technician, would be crucial.
''I think that played itself out during this campaign,'' he said. ''No matter how difficult and challenging it got, I continued to believe that everything was going to work out for the good. I think that's directly related to my upbringing.''

HEADLINE: Judges Weigh Limits Of Health Law's Powers

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- In perhaps the weightiest of the dozens of challenges to the Obama health care law, a panel of appellate judges grappled Wednesday with the essential quandary of the case: if the federal government can require Americans to buy medical insurance, what constitutional limit would prevent it from mandating all manner of purchases and activities?
The three judges, selected at random from among 10 members of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, sprayed lawyers Gatling-gun style with questions about where a limiting principle might be drawn, as it must if the sweeping law is to pass judicial review. After a nearly three-hour hearing, Chief Judge Joel F. Dubina called the litigation ''a very difficult case,'' but provided no clues as to when or how the court might rule. 
In the past five weeks, the health care litigation has taken on the feel of a traveling road show in wingtips, with similar hearings in appellate courts in Cincinnati, Richmond, Va., and now Atlanta. At each stop, the august courtrooms have been populated with many of the same lawyers and observers, and the same advocacy groups and commentators have held dueling news conferences outside each courthouse.
Lawyers involved in the cases have trouble forecasting which might ultimately be accepted for review by the Supreme Court.
But the 11th Circuit case, because of the political heft of the plaintiffs and the intellectual firepower of the lawyers, has garnered the most attention. Spectators and reporters began lining up before 6 a.m. for the 9:30 a.m. hearing, and some had to be seated in an overflow courtroom.
The plaintiffs include Republican governors and attorneys general from 26 states, and five of the attorneys general attended Wednesday. The hearing featured a clash of titans among three experienced litigators who claim 73 Supreme Court appearances among them: Acting Solicitor General Neal K. Katyal for the Obama administration; former Solicitor General Paul D. Clement for the states; and Michael A. Carvin for the National Federation of Independent Business, another plaintiff.
One of the Supreme Court cases that Mr. Clement won as solicitor general was Gonzales v. Raich in 2005, when the court held that Congress's authority over commerce was so broad that it could regulate even an individual's home cultivation of medical marijuana. That precedent is now central to the government's defense of the health care law that Mr. Clement is challenging.
The law, the Affordable Care Act, enacted in March 2010, aims to insure 32 million Americans by mandating that most people obtain health insurance, subsidizing policies for the poor and requiring that insurers accept even those with pre-existing health problems. Supporters of those provisions, which take effect in 2014, argue that insurers will be able to cover the sick only if healthier consumers are forced to pay into the insurance pool.
Among 31 separate legal challenges to the law, five cases have yielded decisions on the merits from lower-level district court judges. Three judges appointed by Democratic presidents upheld the law, while two Republican appointees rejected all or part of it.
The 11th Circuit panel includes Judge Frank M. Hull, who was named by President Bill Clinton; Judge Stanley Marcus, a Clinton appointee who had previously been placed on the District Court by Ronald Reagan; and Chief Judge Dubina, who was appointed by the first President Bush.
Judge Dubina's daughter, Representative Martha Roby, is a newly elected Republican from Alabama who voted with the majority in January to repeal the health care law. That measure failed in the Democrat-controlled Senate, leaving the law's future in the lap of the courts, at least until the 2012 election.
The decision at issue on Wednesday was handed down on Jan. 31 by Judge Roger Vinson of Federal District Court in Pensacola, Fla. Judge Vinson invalidated the insurance requirement, and then ruled that the mandate was so essential to the architecture of the law that the entire act must fall. He later stayed his ruling so the law would remain in effect pending appeals.
Judge Vinson wrote that while the Commerce Clause of the Constitution gave the government broad authority to regulate interstate commerce, it did not allow Congress to penalize people for the ''inactivity'' of declining to buy a commercial product. The health law imposes an income tax penalty on those who do not have coverage.
Mr. Clement, who was retained by the states for a fee of $250,000, argued that by requiring Americans to buy insurance, the act unconstitutionally conscripted citizens into the stream of commerce. He stressed that the insurance mandate constituted an unprecedented assertion of federal power that could leave virtually every human act -- and passive choice -- subject to Congress's whim.
It would be permissible, Mr. Clement acknowledged under questioning, for Congress to require insurance or other payment by those who are being treated in an emergency room, because they would already be in the stream of commerce. But he said it was a different matter to require them to pay prospectively for future care.
''It boils down to the question of whether the federal government can compel people into commerce to better regulate the individual,'' Mr. Clement said.
The judges repeatedly posed formulations of that question to Mr. Katyal. ''If they could compel this, what purchase could they not compel?'' Judge Marcus asked.
But Mr. Katyal urged the judges to see the law not as a mandate to buy an insurance policy, but as a regulation of the means of payment for care that individuals would inevitably consume. Americans would not be conscripted into the market, Mr. Katyal suggested, because the uniquely unpredictable demand for health care would have already placed them there.
''It's all about financing,'' Mr. Katyal asserted. ''It's about regulating whether people are paying cash or credit.''
Mr. Katyal said that the insurance mandate clearly had an economic rationale because governments, hospitals and the privately insured end up shouldering costs for uninsured patients who cannot pay. That rationale, he said, satisfies the test set by the Supreme Court in a string of prior decisions: that the Commerce Clause permits Congress to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.
What the Supreme Court has never considered is whether a choice to not buy a product can be considered an ''activity'' that can be regulated, as the government asserts.
Last week, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati considered a Michigan ruling that upheld the health law. Three weeks before that, the Fourth Circuit in Richmond heard arguments in two cases from different courts that yielded contradictory outcomes. Another hearing is scheduled for September in the District of Columbia.

HEADLINE: The Economics of Men Behaving Badly

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Why do powerful men with so much to lose do such stupid things? The risk-reward tradeoff doesn't seem to make sense. Some economic studies may shed some light on this question, though. 

 BODY:
Maureen Dowd, among others, observed in Tuesday's paper that many of the recent examples of men behaving badly were perpetrated by men married to powerful, independently successful wives, on whom some of the cheaters were financially dependent. And with so much political power and celebrity of their own at stake, there was even more reason to avoid boneheaded decisions like texting crotch-shots to strangers or impregnating the housekeeper.
In economic terms, the risk-reward trade-off just didn't make sense.
Traditional economics would argue that illegal or immoral behavior should be most attractive to people who have little to lose. And yet successful people who have very high opportunity costs are still engaging in royally dumb activities.
In fact, some researchers have argued that people with more to lose may be more likely to engage in risky, socially unacceptable and self-destructive behavior.
For example, Utpal Bhattacharya and Cassandra D. Marshall of Indiana University-Bloomington have looked into what kinds of people are more likely to engage in insider-trading. The answer? The best-paid executives. 
From the paper's abstract:Using a sample of all top management who were convicted of illegal insider trading in the United States for trades during the period 1989-2002, we explore the economic rationality of this white-collar crime. If this crime is an economically rational activity in the sense of Becker (1968), where a crime is committed if its expected benefits exceed its expected costs, "poorer" top management should be doing the most illegal insider trading. This is because the "poor" have more to gain (an extra dollar means more to them) and less to lose (loss of reputation and future compensation if caught is lower for them). We find in the data, however, that convictions are concentrated in the "richer" strata after we control for firm size, industry, firm growth opportunities, the opportunity to commit illegal insider trading, and the possibility that regulators target the "richer" strata. We thus cannot rule out psychological motives (like hubris) or sociological motives (like company culture) behind this white-collar crime.Maybe power breeds hubris rather than actuarially-calibrated caution. But relative powerlessness somehow seems to have the same effect.
One controversial study by Christin L. Munsch, a doctoral candidate in sociology at Cornell, found that men who are more financially dependent on their wives are more likely to cheat. Again, this goes against what economics would predict, but seems to indicate that a lower level of power and threatened masculinity may also tempt men to transgress.
In related work -- which we've blogged about before -- a study examined the popular trope of the "Oscar Curse," popularized by the revelation that Sandra Bullock's husband was caught cheating right after she won an Academy Award. Comparing the marital fates of female Oscar winners versus female Oscar nominees, the research found that Oscar winners were much more likely to have their marriages end in divorce. It did not determine whether those marriages were more likely to end because of infidelity, though.

HEADLINE: Have German Wages Really Risen?

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Not much in the last eight or nine years, but the German labor market has still outperformed the American labor market over this period. How? Jobs. 

 BODY:
Matthias Rumpf of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development wrote me the following response to my column on the Germany economy:
I really liked your piece. It gives a very nice comparison on the two countries. However, for someone who followed the German debate over the past years from a "domestic" perspective I found it surprising that you made a point on the higher wage increases in Germany. 
For most observers in Germany, wage moderation that took place over the past 10 years (and which was endorsed by the trade unions) was one of the key factors behind the increase in competitiveness and the higher growth rates you are seeing now.
That's a very good point. For space reasons, I did not delineate between two different time periods in the column, and it's worth doing so here.
From roughly 1985 to 1995, German workers enjoyed considerably larger real hourly wage increases than American workers. From 1995 through the present, wages in the two countries have grown at a similar pace - growing initially and then slowing down, to a pace more recently not much faster than inflation. (These trends are visible in the second chart in a recent blog post.)
Why did German wages grow faster in the first period? Some statistical quirks involving the reunification of the country played a role. But inequality also played an important role. In the United States, much of the benefit of economic growth went to a small slice of the population at the top of the income distribution. In Germany, the gains were more broadly shared.
And do the similar wage gains in the second period mean that workers in both countries have done equally well? No, German workers have still done better, because German job growth has been stronger. 
So the typical worker who remained employed in Germany from the mid-1990s through today has received a pay increase comparable to that of the typical worker who has remained employed in the United States. But the odds of an American worker's being unemployed have risen substantially over the last 15 years. The odds of a German worker's being unemployed have fallen. 
Bottom line: In Germany, the wage moderation of the last decade that Mr. Rumpf mentions has helped increase overall employment. In the United States, there has been no such silver lining. Wage growth for most workers and employment growth have both been muted.

HEADLINE: Dogonomics

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: One dog is laid off, and another dies wealthy. Such is the state of the economy. 

 BODY:
If this doesn't convince Congress that there's an unemployment crisis, I don't know what will.
Now even dogs are getting pink slips, Time reports:A harsh economic climate has negatively affected cities and municipal services across the country. But the downturn hit home for a five-year-old German Shepherd named Daro earlier this month.
Daro, a police dog for the East Haven Police Department in Connecticut, was forcibly retired after the town council cut his budget. As the only police dog in the E.H.P.D., Daro's early retirement has angered the town's police union and some citizens, according to The New Haven Register.
In other canine economic news, Leona Helmsley's Maltese, Trouble, to whom Ms. Helmsley bequeathed $12 million, has passed away. I made a crack on Twitter about how odd it was that The Daily News of New York repeatedly called Trouble "one of" the world's richest dogs. But a fellow Twitter poster responded that there are, apparently, even wealthier dogs. (You thought inequality among humans was bad.)
In any case, Trouble's inheritance has reverted to the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust.

HEADLINE: What I've Learned From Blogging

BYLINE: PAUL DOWNS


HIGHLIGHT: After a particularly bad day, I sent an e-mail to the editor of this blog, asking if the Times would be interested in a failing business -- and offering to document what I expected would be our company's imminent demise. 

 BODY:
It's been 13 months since I started writing about my business, and I'veposted 60 times since then. I've been asked by many people how I got involved with "You're the Boss." The short answer: good timing and luck.
I had been a regular reader of the blog since it was introduced. In December 2009, with my company weeks from running out of money, I started searching the Internet for blogs dealing with business failure -- and found nothing useful or compelling. All of the business journalism I came across had the same focus: stories about success, often after struggle but usually describing it as the inevitable reward for hard work and good ideas. There was nothing that described the experience of business failure in depth and at length, especially involving regular Main Street businesses.
After a particularly bad day, I sent an e-mail to the editor of this blog, asking if the Times would be interested in a failing business -- and offering to document what I expected would be our company's imminent demise. I heard nothing for two months, during which I laid off many of my people, continued to struggle with my partner and came very close to running out of money.
But in February 2010, I got an e-mail back from the Times, with an apology for the tardy reply. The e-mail said the idea was of interest and asked what exactly I intended to write about. The difficulty of keeping a business alive, I replied -- and I offered a list of subjects that had bedeviled me, including cash flow, employee problems, partner problems, the crumby economy, and plenty more. By chance, I had to be in New York the following week, so I arranged a meeting with the editor. 
I told him my story, and he thought it had potential. He had been thinking about adding a struggling business to the lineup, and we discussed how it might work. I offered to write the posts anonymously, because I wanted to be free to write candidly about my experiences. I also wanted to demonstrate that I wasn't trying to get publicity for my business. (I believed then -- and continue to believe -- that there is almost no intersection between this blog's readers and my clientele.) The Times wasn't interested in anonymous posts, but the editor did ask me to write some sample posts.
I went home and in seven days wrote 10 posts that wound up forming the basis of my blogging: the first group about the history of my company, followed by a series of posts on one harrowing week: My Week In Cash Flow. And then, in March and April last year, my business started to turn around, and my focus turned from the demise of my company to the many difficult issues I confront in running it.
I haven't found the writing to be difficult. Much of my day at work is spent composing, mostly e-mails to clients or my staff. I write the blog posts at home, generally after a stiff drink, usually starting about 9:30 at night. Some weeks the words flow without much effort, and other weeks it's like pulling teeth. The average post takes me two to three hours to write. They usually get a good reception from the editor.
Blogging has been useful for me. Describing my problems in writing, in a widely read forum, has forced me to identify the primary issues in each situation and to prioritize which are most important. Almost everything I write about is more complicated than a 1,000-word post can cover, so I first write down everything I can think of on a given subject, and then I whittle, whittle, and whittle some more. Problems and the factors that affect them fall into several categories, only some of which can be discussed publicly:
1. Things that are common to all businesses (accounting, taxes, health insurance).
2. Things that are different for different kinds of businesses (production, marketing, corporate structure, employees).
3. Things that are very risky to write about (problems that might affect a potential client's perception of the business).
4. Things which should not be made public (the particulars of individual employees personalities and actions).
My strategy has been to use the particulars of running a small factory to try to illustrate how I deal with problems common to all businesses. This is somewhat limiting, but in the wonderful new world of Internet journalism, the commenters can offer different perspectives on how these issues play out in different situations.
Surprisingly, writing the blog has had little effect on my life, other than adding an interesting line to my resume. There are no groupies, no speeches, no book deals and no income stream comparable to my regular salary. Most of the people I know read the blog occasionally or not at all. My new part-time gig did give me a boost in self-confidence at a rocky moment -- at the end of 2009, I was seriously contemplating what my life would be like if I had no job nor workplace to go to. At least I can write, I figured. But I'm glad I still have my day job.
From a business perspective, blogging has been an incredible education. I have exchanged e-mails with more than 100 readers, which has been interesting. And then there are the commenters, who have provided an enormous amount of useful, and sometimes distressing, feedback. Thank you all for taking the time to chime in. In a nutshell, here's what I've learned from commenters:
o Ask questions, and you will get answers. So if you are in a tight situation, the first thing to do is find a way to ask for help. Anyone with Internet access can find advice, fast, on almost any kind of issue. Industry-specific forums are extremely useful, but the important thing is to seek advice actively, as opposed to simply digesting what's already out there. As I said before, the act of writing a problem down will help you clarify it in your mind.
o A question's format affects the relevance of the answers. Ask general questions, and you get general advice. Ask specific questions, get specific answers.
o I can tell which commenters have been bosses, and which haven't. People who have never run a business are often ignorant of the type of problems that owners encounter.
o Getting advice is easy, executing it is hard. Particularly when you're stretched thin, it can be tough to implement change in a struggling organization.

HEADLINE: Actors Wade Into the Fracking Debate

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: Ethan Hawke, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana and others sing the praises of New York State's water supply while making tea, fly-fishing and, in the case of Mr. Hawke, taking a bath. 

 BODY:
Environmental groups seeking to mobilize opposition to the gas industry's plan to drill extensively in the Marcellus Shale in upstate New York have pulled out the big guns: celebrities, of course.
 In a new online video, a group of New York-based actors, including Ethan Hawke, Mark Ruffalo and Zoe Saldana, sing the praises of the state's water while making tea, fly-fishing and, in the case of Mr. Hawke, taking a bath. Referring to allegations of water contamination and other environmental and economic problems in parts of the country where fracking is already taking place, the video warns viewers that their drinking water is at stake.
"My family moved to our quiet farming town on the Delaware River so we could enjoy a simple, healthy life outside of the bustling city," Mr. Ruffalo said in a statement. "We want to enjoy that peace down the road, and know that the tap water we drink, and bathe our children in, is safe."
The video, also featuring the actors Amy Ryan, Josh Charles and Nadia Dajani, is the latest salvo in an advertising campaign organized by a coalition of major environmental groups that are trying to bring attention to the risks of the controversial method of natural gas drilling known as hydrofracking. The effort comes as New York officials write drilling regulations that are intended to ensure the safety of water supplies and the environment.Last April, the groups, including Riverkeeper, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Catskill Mountainkeeper, enlisted average citizens as "rangers" to help protect the safety of their water. asking them to don superhero costumes and have themselves photographed in front of a favorite body of water.
The gas industry is not amused. Jim Smith, a spokesman for the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York, said that natural gas exploration in the watershed that supplies drinking water to most of New York State is highly unlikely in the first place, given the government restrictions that have already been imposed on companies, and that the groups are therefore exaggerating potential dangers. 
"Basically, it means companies would have to jump too many hurdles to make drilling in the watershed viable," he said. 
More generally, the industry, which maintains a Web site on hydrofracking in the Marcellus Shale here, maintains that the hydrofracking technology has proven generally safe and provides not just an affordable source of energy but scores of jobs.
"Watching the video, I wondered how they heated the tub water," Mr. Smith said drily. "If Ethan Hawke was able to stay so calm in that cold tub water, then he's some actor."

HEADLINE: Answers About Abuse in State-Run Homes

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The Times's Danny Hakim is responding to readers' questions about instances of abuse in homes for the mentally disabled. 

 BODY:
On Monday, The New York Times published a second article in a series examining the treatment of the developmentally disabled in New York State. In his investigation, Danny Hakim of The Times reviewed thousands of state records and court documents and interviewed current and former employees at nine state-run institutions that house the developmentally disabled. He found that supervisors at these institutions have tolerated physical and psychological abuse, knowingly hired unqualified workers, ignored complaints by whistle-blowers and failed to investigate credibly cases of abuse and neglect.
We received more than 400 comments on the story and dozens of detailed questions from our readers about how the system works, and doesn't.
What follows are responses from Mr. Hakim.This article is heartbreaking. As others have noted, $1.4 million spent and only $30,000 on a worker's salary? What is the ratio of caregivers to patients? I'd like to see a breakdown of the costs vs. money spent/disappeared. Aside from the usual questions regarding the persistent existence of collusion and lack of oversight, I am left wondering why the only (apparent) applicants for these jobs were criminals or at least blatantly unqualified?
I hope the State of New York can do a thorough analysis of the facilities and put entirely new staff, new policies and new employees into place at, ideally, higher wages once the corruption and graft that surely exists is rooted out.
- Posted by AHIn some ways, the The Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, the agency that oversees state-run group homes and institutions, reminds me of General Motors, which I covered in the years leading up to its bankruptcy. It can be hard for large bureaucracies that have been doing things a certain way for decades to step back and see how far they have drifted from their mission - whether its making cars people want to drive or providing care to a vulnerable population.
To your point about why people with criminal convictions are hired, or people who are clearly unqualified, I have the same question. While the pay starts at under $30,000 for direct-care workers, it steps up as workers are promoted and have more years in the system, and given the benefits, the jobs can be attractive in some of the economically desolated upstate communities where these facilities are located.
Regarding your questions on a cost breakdown, I'll see if I can shed more light on that in future stories.A solution might be to install cameras in every room. The day care my son goes to has that. Why not at institutions prone to abuse?
- Posted by MarionLast year, Michael Carey, who was at the center of my latest story, backed a bill in the legislature that would require security cameras in group homes, transport vehicles, classrooms and institutions for the developmentally disabled - the bill was sponsored by his assemblyman at the time, Timothy P. Gordon, but didn't make much headway. Mr. Carey, who was an activist even before his son died in state care in 2007, is working with lawmakers right now to reintroduce that bill, among several others. He hopes to have some of his proposals acted on before the legislative session ends on Monday, June 20.Does anyone have recommendations of actions we can take? Is there a watchdog or advocacy organization we can join or contribute to? Reading isn't enough.
- Posted by queensmama There are relatively few independent advocacy organizations - that is, organizations that are not in some way beholden to the state - but there are in response to The Times series, which provides a public forum.
The Jonathan Carey Foundation, started by Michael Carey and his wife, Lisa, after their son was killed in state care, advocates for patients' and parents' rights.Where is the money going that should be caring for these children? Why are high school dropouts with criminal records in charge? Why aren't there people with backgrounds in education and health care, getting $100,000 a piece to be in charge of the welfare of each child. At the current budget, that would leave $900,000 a year to pay for "everything else." The system is completely and heartbreakingly corrupt.
- Posted by TalbotUnfortunately, there are problems at all levels of the state system. The institutions do employ a variety of professional clinicians who are paid more than direct-care workers, but institutions seem to be as prone to problems - some would say more so - than the smaller group homes that are staffed predominantly by direct-care workers.Why did Kate Bishop and Andrew Morgese keep their jobs after the agency found out that such damning tapes existed? Is that pending the conclusion of an internal investigation? Also, why was a policy analyst with experience managing only seven people put in charge of a 23,000 employee agency? Was Courtney Burke politically connected? Did more experienced candidates turn the job down?
- Posted by JRThere's a state watchdog agency that recently began a review of some of Mary Maioriello's claims, the Commission on Quality of Care. Ms. Maioriello is the former state employee who secretly recorded a meeting with two top state officials - Ms. Bishop and Mr. Morgese - during which she repeatedly asked why her reports of abuse were being swept aside.
It's possible that the state will take further action after that review is completed.
That said, it's unclear how robust the inquiry will be. The first story in our series on the developmentally disabled, "At State Run Homes, Abuse and Impunity," dealt at some length with the shortcomings of the Commission on Quality of Care. I pointed out in that story that the C.Q.C., as its known, investigated less than 2 percent of allegations of abuse or neglect and shunned publicity, but Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has replaced the C.Q.C.'s commissioner and it appears to be headed in a new direction.
As for Ms. Burke, the newly appointed commissioner of the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, right now anyone taking over the agency would face a major management challenge. It's still early in her tenure, so too soon to judge her performance.

HEADLINE: New Credit Card Rules Make Pricing Clearer, Study Says

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A study finds that the Credit Card Act of 2009 has also not made credit less available. 

 BODY:
New credit card rules meant to protect consumers have made pricing clearer, and haven't made credit less available, a new study says.
Despite concerns raised by the credit card industry about the Credit Card Act of 2009, direct mail offers keep arriving in consumer mailboxes at a pace "consistent with economic conditions," says a report from the Center for Responsible Lending. The act took effect in February.
Plus, the difference between the stated rate on credit card offers and the rate consumers actually pay narrowed markedly in the wake of the new law, the report found. From 2004 to 2008, that difference widened to "unprecedented" levels, the study said. But the gap has narrowed considerably since the CARD Act was passed. The current gap is about 0.2 percentage points, down from 2.3 percentage points at its peak.
The actual rates consumers have paid on credit card debt have remained level, once the economic downturn is taken into effect.
The study examined five sets of data, including rate information from the Federal Reserve, which tracks what consumers are actually charged on the average open account, not just what consumers are offered in the mail. It also examined bank call reports filed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
"Because price transparency fosters competition," the report said, "the long-term effect of the CARD Act is likely to be lower costs for consumers."
Have you noticed any change in the quantity of credit card offers you're getting in the mail?

HEADLINE: Tracy Reese Celebrates Five Years in the Meatpacking District

BYLINE: SIMONE S. OLIVER


HIGHLIGHT: A trendy crowd gathered to celebrate the five-year anniversary of Tracy Reese's first and only brick-and-mortar location. 

 BODY:
11:20 a.m. | Updated 
It was five years ago when Alex Kuczynski reviewed the Tracy Reese flagship store in New York City's Meatpacking District for the Styles section's Critical Shopper column. Wednesday evening, a trendy crowd celebrated the five-year anniversary of the designer's first and only brick-and-mortar location in the United States. There was cause for festivities, as five years in retail time during a recession might as well equate to ten years in real time. 
Anna Sui, a fellow New York-based designer, showed up, as did other of Ms. Reese's supporters, including Veronica Webb, the supermodel, Steven Kolb, the Executive Director at CFDA and Tinsley Mortimer. While guests browsed the spring merchandise, nibbled on mini cupcakes and tasted cucumber-flavored vodka, I asked Ms. Reese a few questions: How has the industry changed in the last five years?
The customer has become a little more discerning, but at the same time we've built a base of great customers who come back to us over and over again. Trends have come and gone and they're coming back my way so I'm super excited about that. So we'll take that and we're ready.
What do you mean by that? Well things got really of tough and edgy and that's not who I am. We love pretty, we like beautiful, flattering, color! That's what people come here for. There was a moment when big stores weren't into that but our customer always was, and she was coming here or going to Nordstrom or Anthropologie and other places that remain true to themselves. Now, I think things have opened up. It's not like there's just one look right now. It's the look that's best for you and that's really exciting. There are a lot more players in the industry now. There are tons and tons of contemporary resources. So that just keeps us on our toes. We have to stay sharp and protect our turf, so we're busy doing that. It keeps us motivated.
 Why did you choose this location?
We wanted to be downtown. The vibe is really good. We actually looked a lot on Bleecker Street but we couldn't find a space that was large enough to house our entire inventory. This space really worked out and we love our neighbors. The neighborhood has a great mix of people from the moms to the musicians, many who are customers. We appreciate them all.

HEADLINE: Our Wasteful Health Care System

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Millions for marketing -- and not to the patients. 

 BODY:
The Economist's "Democracy in America" blog has a very good illustration of the reasons our privatized, market-based system is so much more expensive, for no better results, than everyone else's:
A medical technology company is going public to generate the money it needs to advertise its products to hospital directors and insurance-company reimbursement officers. This entails significant extra expenditures for marketing, the new stocks issued to fund the marketing will ultimately have to pay dividends, banks will have to be paid to supervise the IPO that was needed to generate the funds to finance the marketing campaign (presumably charging the industry-cartel standard 7%)...and all this will have to be paid for by driving up the price the company charges to deliver its technologies. But beyond the added expense, why would anyone think that a system in which marketing plays such a large role is likely to be more effective, to lead to better treatment, than the kind of process of expert review that governs grant awards at NIH or publishing decisions at peer-reviewed journals? Why do we think that a system in which ads for Claritin are all over the subways will generate better overall health results than one where a national review board determines whether Claritin delivers treatment outcomes for some populations sufficiently superior to justify its added expense over similar generics? What do we expect from a system in which, as ProPublica reports today, body imaging companies hire telemarketers to sell random people CT scans over the phone?
Furthermore,
The other key thing to pay attention to is who this marketing campaign was targeted at: key decisionmakers at providers and insurance companies. Those are the people who decide whether medical procedures get ordered. It's not patients. Patients aren't going to experience a loss of freedom or satisfaction because an expert reviewer at the Independant Payment Advisory Board makes the call as to whether a procedure is medically beneficial, rather than the corresponding bureaucrat at their insurance provider or at the for-profit clinic they're attending. 
None of this is particularly new -- but it needs to be repeated, over and over again; maybe some of it will leak through the ideological armor of Very Serious People.

HEADLINE: The White House Believes in the Confidence Fairy

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Hopeless. 

 BODY:
Ryan Avent brings grim news from a White House forum on the economy:
The comments from Gene Sperling, Director of the National Economic Council and a key member of the team negotiating an agreement on an increase in the debt ceiling, were clearer still. The White House believes, he said, that deficit-cutting is an important component (the emphasis was his) of a growth strategy. And he repeatedly said that deficit-reduction was crucial in generating economic confidence. Confidence-he repeated this word many times.
Obama has operated under severe political constraints, and those of us who criticize the inadequacy of the stimulus and other policies have to be mindful of that. But the White House did not have to concede the economic argument the way it has -- especially when the confidence-fairy, invisible-bond-vigilante believers have been proved utterly wrong. I mean, how could you have a clearer test of liquidity preference versus loanable funds than having the US government borrow almost $3 trillion with zero, absolutely no, effect on interest rates?
And yet the WH buys into the doctrine that failed.

HEADLINE: An M.I.T. Plan for Natural Gas With Planet in Mind

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A team at M.I.T. lays out ways to get the most out of natural gas without the least environmental harm. 

 BODY:
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has released "The Future of Natural Gas," the latest in its valuable series of reports examining global energy choices. The report lays out a path for exploiting this abundant and relatively clean source of energy in ways that could limit environmental concerns and give the biggest near-term boost to efforts to trim emissions of carbon dioxide. 
One of the most important take-home points, to me, was the authors' endorsement of a rising role for natural gas as a feedstock for producing liquid transportation fuels. This resonated with discussions I had earlier this month with some senior people at Shell. They spoke at length about Shell's existing push to produce liquid fuels from gas, most notably at the huge new gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar:
Here are a few highlights from the new report, starting with the M.I.T. team's conclusion on hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking":
The environmental impacts of shale development are challenging but manageable. Research and regulation, both state and federal, are needed to minimize the environmental consequences.
On gas as a substitute for coal: 
...In the U.S. electricity supply sector, the cost benchmark for reducing carbon dioxide emissions lies with substitution of natural gas for coal, especially older, less efficient units. Substitution through increased utilization of existing combined cycle natural gas power plants provides a relatively low-cost, short-term opportunity to reduce U.S. power sector carbon dioxide emissions by up to 20 percent, while also reducing emissions of criteria pollutants and mercury. 
On gas to provide a flexible source of "fill in" power to complement expanded use of variable wind power:
Furthermore, additional gas-fired capacity will be needed as backup if variable and intermittent renewables, especially wind, are introduced on a large scale. Policy and regulatory steps are needed to facilitate adequate capacity investment for system reliability and efficiency. These increasingly important roles for natural gas in the electricity sector call for a detailed analysis of the interdependencies of the natural gas and power generation infrastructures.
Finally, on gas's potential as a transportation fuel and a substitute for liquid fuels:
Over the last decade or so, when oil prices have been high, the ratio of the oil price to the natural gas price has been consistently higher than any of the standard rules of thumb. If this trend is robust, use of natural gas in transportation, either through direct use or following conversion to a liquid fuel, could in time increase appreciably.
The evolution of global gas markets is unclear. A global "liquid" natural gas market is beneficial to U.S. and global economic interests and, at the same time, advances security interests through diversity of supply and resilience to disruption. The U.S. should pursue policies that encourage the development of such a market, integrate energy issues fully into the conduct of U.S. foreign policy and promote sharing of know-how for strategic global expansion of unconventional gas production.

HEADLINE: The Banking Emperor Has No Clothes

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner seems to be marching determinedly in the wrong direction on banking regulation, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, is the co-author of "13 Bankers."
In a major speech earlier this week to the American Bankers Association's international monetary conference, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner laid out his view of what went wrong in the financial sector before 2008, how the crisis was handled 2008-10 and what is needed to reform the system. As chairman of the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the only senior member of President Obama's original economic team remaining in place, Mr. Geithner's influence with regard to the banking system is second to none.
Unfortunately, Mr. Geithner's speech contained three major mistakes: his history is completely wrong, his logic is deeply flawed, and his interpretation of the Dodd-Frank reforms does not mesh with the legal facts regarding how the failure of a global megabank could be handled. Together, these mistakes suggest that one of our most powerful policy makers is headed very much in the wrong direction.
On history, Mr. Geithner places significant blame for the pre-2008 excesses on Britain and other countries that pursued light-touch regulation. This is reasonable - though surely he is aware that the United States has led the way in lightening the touch of regulation, at least since 1980. A senior British official retorted immediately, "Clearly he wasn't referring to derivatives regulation, because as far as I can recollect, there wasn't any in America at the time." 
More broadly, Mr. Geithner seems to have forgotten how big banks were saved -- by government intervention, at his urging. He should probably watch "Too Big to Fail," now playing on HBO, or peruse the book by Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times, on which it is based -- just look in the index for Geithner and trace the arguments that he made for repeated and unconditional bailouts of big banks and their creditors from mid-September 2008. (Mr. Sorkin's book ends in fall 2008, while Mr. Geithner was still head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; for more on what happened after he became Treasury secretary, see my book with James Kwak, "13 Bankers.")
On logic, Mr. Geithner's thinking includes a major non sequitur, as he continues to deny that the size of our largest banks poses a problem. "Some argue that the U.S. financial system is too concentrated, which could promote systemic risks," he said. "But the U.S. banking system today is less concentrated than that of any other major country."
But big banks in almost all other major countries have run into serious trouble, including those in Britain and Switzerland -- where policy makers are now open about the potential scope of further disasters. French and German banks made large amounts of reckless loans to peripheral Europe and have strongly resisted higher capital requirements, helping to create the current potential for contagion throughout the euro zone (and explaining why the Europeans are so keen to keep control of the International Monetary Fund). The Japanese banking system has been in terrible shape for two decades.
Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Geithner's former mentor, likes to point out that big banks in Canada were not in serious trouble during the global recession. But whatever your view of whether Canada has good regulation or was mostly lucky -- and put me in the skeptical camp, after my recent talks with their senior officials -- the simple point is that big banks in Canada are actually small in comparison with American and other global banks. The largest five Canadian banks have a combined head count roughly equal to that of Citigroup (just under 300,000 people) and even the biggest of them has only about one-third the assets of JPMorgan Chase. 
Mr. Geithner's thinking on bank size is completely flawed. The lesson should be: big banks have gotten themselves into trouble almost everywhere; banks in the United States are very big and have an incentive to become even bigger; one or more of these banks will reach the brink of failure soon.
Mr. Geithner's most serious mistake is to believe that we can handle the failure of a global megabank within the Dodd-Frank framework. He argues that expanded powers for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation mean that banks can be allowed to fund themselves with more debt relative to equity than would otherwise be the case, because the F.D.I.C. can supposedly impose losses on creditors in the "resolution" situation, in which it takes control of a troubled bank. Because the bank could actually default on its loans, management and lenders will be more careful.
"But given the other protections here, including our resolution authority, we do not need to impose on top of that requirement any of the three other proposed forms of additional capital," he said in the speech. (The italics are mine.)
I've talked repeatedly with senior officials in the United States and other countries about the resolution authority, and I've also discussed the issue directly with some of the top legal minds on Wall Street, people who work closely with big banks. Mr. Geithner's interpretation is simply wrong. (Disclosure: I'm a member of the F.D.I.C.'s newly established Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee, an unpaid group of 18 experts that meets for the first time on June 21, but my assessment here is purely personal.)
There is no cross-border resolution mechanism or other framework that will handle the failure of a bank like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs in an orderly manner. The only techniques available are those used by Mr. Geithner and his colleagues in September 2008 -- a mad scramble to find buyers for assets, backed by Federal Reserve and other government guarantees for creditors.
The right conclusion for Mr. Geithner should be: huge cross-border financial operations are immune from orderly resolution; such companies should therefore be run on a completely segmented basis, with separate capital requirements and no recourse to parent companies.
Consequently, capital requirements should be much higher than currently proposed by any official, for capital is the buffer that stands between bad management decisions and taxpayer bailouts when bank resolution is not possible. Real estate trusts that are not too big to fail routinely finance their assets with 30 percent equity and 70 percent debt. In a volatile world, this makes complete sense. We should move all our big banks, as well as the rest of our financial system, in that direction.

HEADLINE: Richard Bove Does an About-Face on Goldman

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: "Goldman Sachs is the scapegoat of our time," the stock analyst contends in his latest research note. 

 BODY:
Richard X. Bove, one of the most bearish stock analysts covering Goldman Sachs, has had an about-face on the firm's role in the credit crisis. "It is becoming increasingly apparent that a terrible wrong may have been done to Goldman Sachs," the Rochdale Research analyst wrote in a recently released report on the big Wall Street firm. "Evidence is now mounting that the company did not have a net short position at a crucial time under study and that the Senate Committee may have misread the numbers."
Nonetheless, Mr. Bove is keeping his "sell" rating on Goldman's stock. 
Mr. Bove's report is sure to stoke the debate on Goldman's role during the credit crisis. A recent 650-page Senate report from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations alleged that Goldman had a huge profitable short bet on the mortgage market and misled clients and Congress about its practices related to mortgage-linked securities. 
Goldman contends it wasn't short the mortgage market, but was simply trying to hedge its overall portfolio, which both lost and made money as the housing market went into a tailspin.
Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who led the Congressional inquiry, sent his findings to the Justice Department to investigate whether executives broke the law. The agency said it was reviewing the report. Goldman, meanwhile, last week received a subpoena from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, which is also investigating Goldman's role. In an interview, Mr. Bove said Mr. Levin's report was a big reason why in May he slashed his rating on Goldman to 'sell' from 'neutral'. He said at the time Goldman officials did not raise objections to the report, leaving him to conclude it must be right. 
"When I put the sell rating on the stock they were pretty unhappy but they didn't say the senate report is wrong," he said. But now, having gone through the report with Goldman and looked at the supporting documents, he doesn't believe the allegations that have been levied against the firm. He said he is "perplexed" why Goldman didn't come forward earlier with their objections to the report. 
"This is more than a little upsetting. But I have completely changed my attitude about whether they did something wrong." In fact, he compared Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd C. Blankfein to Andrew Mellon, the banker who was subjected to a tax investigation led by the Roosevelt administration in the 1930s. Mr. Mellon was exonerated, but Mr. Bove said it doesn't matter because the administration at time got its scapegoat. 
"Goldman Sachs is the scapegoat of our time," Mr. Bove said. "I do believe there is a bit of truth on each side," he said. "Goldman Sachs has played this game hard, has been self motivated to generate as much profit as possible and has done things perhaps not correct. I don't believe we are dealing with fallen angels. However I don't believe whatever they have done wrong anyone has discovered it." Mr. Bove's report carries more sway than other analysts as he has been a vocal bear on the stock in recent months. In May he lowered his rating on the stock saying "the pressure on the Justice Department to bring a criminal lawsuit against Goldman is building to a high pitch. The new Matt Taibbi article in Rolling Stone magazine is another all-out attack on the company. However this time the attack is backed by a 650 page Senate report signed by both a Democrat and a Republican." While Mr. Bove now seems swayed that a wrong may have been done to the firm he has no immediate plans to change his sell rating, saying the company is facing a bleak second quarter, which ends in just a few weeks. "Thus, as Goldman emerges from its government problems, it now faces economic issues that may cause difficulty with the stock," he wrote in his report. 
He believes other analysts have overestimated Goldman's earnings power in the quarter and need to reduce their outlooks by as much as $1 a share.

HEADLINE: Tim Pawlenty's Supply-Side Time Warp

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: His big economic speech reads as if the Bush years never happened. 

 BODY:
Earlier this week, Ramesh Ponnuru had an excellent column on the Republican Party's struggle to come up with an economic agenda that doesn't just feel like "half-remembered bits of Reaganism." Here's how it ended:... Asked how his bill would improve wages, [Senator Rob] Portman told me that "wage growth has always accompanied economic growth." That used to be true, but it wasn't true during the middle of the past decade. During what some called "the Bush boom," even as the size of the economy increased, the rise in health-care costs kept middle- income workers from getting raises.
... the supply-side revolution was politically successful in the first place because it offered [middle class] voters the chance to keep money in their pockets. Reagan in 1980 promised to cut tax rates for everyone and stop inflation from pushing middle-class voters into higher tax brackets. He won re-election, and his vice president won the election to succeed him, in part by promising to keep these voters' taxes low. In 1994 and 2000, Republicans again made big wins in part by promising to cut taxes for middle-class parents.
In recent years, though, Republicans have tried to cut taxes for corporations and high earners without doing anything for the middle class. (Anything direct, that is: The middle class was told it would benefit from higher growth.) It's not surprising, then, that the Republican advantage on taxes has declined -- or that in recent elections, most voters haven't told pollsters that Republicans are "in touch" with people like them.
... The country's fiscal straits may make it difficult for Republicans to devise conservative ways of responding to the economic challenges that middle-class Americans now face.
But it must be said that they don't appear to be trying very hard.Read the whole thing - and then read Tim Pawlenty's big economic speech this week, which exemplifies the problem Ponnuru is diagnosing. Somewhere, buried in the middle of the address, there's a line that speaks directly to the middle class: Pawlenty is talking about his plan for a rate-lowering, base-broadening tax reform, and he pitches this as a "one-third cut in the bottom rate ... to allow younger - middle - and lower-income families to save and build wealth." But you'll search the rest of the speech in vain for anything else that's addressed so explicitly to middle class concerns. Instead, most of Pawlenty's agenda is a mix of "half-remembered bits of Reaganism," transparent gimmicks (a balanced-budget amendment that caps spending at 18 percent of G.D.P.) and straightforward magical thinking, in which cutting taxes on business, investment and high-earners leads to 5 percent growth every year for a decade - something that neither the Reagan nor the Clinton booms came close to achieving - which in turn goes a long way toward closing the budget deficit, happily, before we have to start in on painful cuts. (I recommend reading Kevin Williamson on the folly of this kind of "just assume more growth!" approach to deficit cutting.) The speech has some of the Ryan budget's political vulnerabilities, in a sense, without the Ryan's budget's guts: Whereas Ryan actually took the entitlement bull by the horns, Pawlenty seems to use his supply-side growth projections as a substitute for Medicare reform instead of adding them on as gravy. Reading it, you would think that the Bush economy was a huge, roaring success, since Pawlenty has little to say about the pocketbook issues that helped elect Barack Obama in the first place (wage stagnation, health care costs, etc.). And reading the excited reception that the speech is getting from movement organs, it's clear that a great many conservatives have learned next to nothing from the trends that turned them out of office just a few short years ago.

HEADLINE: Weiner Scandal Is a Case of Bad Timing for Democrats

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: For President Obama and his Democratic allies, the latest sex scandal involving a congressman from New York is a politically damaging moment that has come at an inopportune time. 

 BODY:
President Obama was trying hard to get his economic message out on Wednesday. But thanks to Anthony D. Weiner, he really had no chance.
Even as Mr. Obama was talking about his efforts to "rebuild the middle class," more graphic pictures of Mr. Weiner were popping up online. Cable news channels picked apart the scandal throughout the day, virtually ignoring Mr. Obama's remarks at Northern Virginia Community College. 
And if there was any doubt about what would dominate the evening talk shows it was swept away with the late-afternoon news that Mr. Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, is pregnant.
For Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies, the latest sex scandal involving a congressman from New York is a politically damaging moment that has come at an inopportune time.
It has helped to stop cold the successful Medicare attacks that Democrats had been flinging at Republicans. And it has prevented Mr. Obama and his Capitol Hill allies from responding effectively to the very bad economic reports that came out at the end of last week.
The frustration was evident on Wednesday as a growing number of Democratic lawmakers and officials began urging Mr. Weiner to step down, if only, they seemed to suggest, to clear the way for a discussion about something else - anything else.
"Lying is unforgivable," said Tim Kaine, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and now a United States Senate candidate in Virginia. "Lying publicly about something like this is unforgivable, and he should resign."
Representative Allyson Schwartz of Pennsylvania, a top official at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, issued a statement saying: "Having the respect of your constituents is fundamental for a member of Congress. In light of Anthony Weiner's offensive behavior online, he should resign."
At the White House, Jay Carney, the press secretary, gamely stuck to his script as a reporter asked about the biggest news of the day.
"We have no comment on that story," Mr. Carney said, moving quickly to a reporter with a question about oil production.
But when you are president, even news that has nothing to do with you can affect your ability to set the agenda. And Mr. Obama has had a string of bad luck when it comes to the timing of his message as president. 
The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico; the Florida pastor who threatened to burn a Koran; the controversy over the comments of a worker at the Agriculture Department; the Virginia couple who sneaked into Mr. Obama's first state dinner - all were distractions that at least briefly knocked the White House off message.
The scandal involving Mr. Weiner could have a direct impact on New York politics. It seems that the congressman's dreams of running for mayor of New York City are likely to be dashed.
And there are, of course, the inevitable attempts by Republicans to taint Democrats for their association with Mr. Weiner. Several e-mails by Republican operatives this week pointed out the Democratic officials who had not rushed to condemn Mr. Weiner's actions. 
But Republicans have had, if anything, more sex scandals recently than Democrats, so those attempts may have little lasting impact. Instead, the broader damage may be to the Democratic efforts to build some positive election momentum in a year when the economic situation seems likely to continue to be grim.
Mr. Obama's approval numbers, which had been boosted for a time by the killing of Osama bin Laden, have crashed back to where they were before the military action - hovering just under 50 percent.
And the Democratic attacks on Republicans for wanting to "end Medicare as we know it" - from, among others, Mr. Weiner himself - have been replaced by Republican demands that Democrats distance themselves from Mr. Weiner and return campaign funds they received from him.
How much has what some in the media have inevitably dubbed Weinergate affected the political conversation in Washington? A phone call this week with a Democratic operative was focused primarily on Mr. Weiner and whether or not he could survive the building scandal.
As the conversation was about to end, the operative blurted the word "Medicare" out of the blue.
It was an attempt, he explained to the confused reporter, to be able to sleep well at night knowing that he had at least tried to get a reporter to write about what he considers the best issue for Democratic candidates. Given the news about Mr. Weiner, he admitted that he knew that it would not work. 
"I still gotta try," he said.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, around the Web and happenings in Washington 

 BODY:
In The Times: Discouraging economic reports have brought heightened urgency to bipartisan efforts to reach an agreement on reducing the deficit and raising the debt ceiling, Jackie Calmes writes. Some Democrats are calling for smaller spending cuts and even some fiscal stimulus. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is scheduled to meet Thursday with six Congressional leaders for debt talks aimed at reaching a deal by July. A new survey by the Federal Reserve shows that the economy grew unevenly in April and May, Christine Hauser reports. She writes that economic activity in the United States continued to grow during that time, but higher food and energy prices, severe weather conditions and supply disruptions caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan put pressure on consumers. House Democratic leaders began an orchestrated effort on Wednesday to force Representative Anthony D. Weiner of New York to resign his seat, Raymond Hernandez reports. Other Democrats say that Mr. Weiner's sexually explicit Internet messages and subsequent lies about them were making him, and the party, the subject of ridicule. Helene Cooper writes that President Obama is on a mission to shore up the public's waning confidence in his ability to revive the economy. On Wednesday, he visited Northern Virginia Community College in Alexandria, Va., which has an automotive services program that is a model for training programs developed through partnerships between schools and manufacturers. On Capitol Hill, merchants won out over banks on Wednesday in a legislative dispute over how much consumers should pay to use debit cards. Ed Wyatt explains that the Senate rejected a measure to delay new rules that would sharply cut the fees that banks can charge retailers to process debit card transactions. Elisabeth Bumiller and Brian Knowlton report that lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have taken up Ryan C. Crocker's nomination to serve as the ambassador to Afghanistan. On the Hill on Wednesday, Mr. Crocker, a veteran diplomat who served most recently as President George W. Bush's ambassador to Iraq, warned lawmakers against a hasty pullout from Afghanistan. While acknowledging the excruciating difficulty and high costs of the American mission there, Mr. Crocker said the situation was not hopeless. The fight over Democrats' health care overhaul has moved to a federal appeals court in Atlanta, where lawyers representing the 26 states challenging the law are joining forces to take on the Obama administration. Kevin Sack describes the opening arguments on Wednesday, as a three-judge panel considered whether the federal government could legally require individuals to purchase medical insurance.Around the Web: Fitch Ratings has threatened to downgrade the credit rating of the United States if Congress does not raise the federal borrowing limit, The Wall Street Journal reports. The move follows similar threats by the ratings agencies Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has so far resisted entreaties to jump into the Republican race for the White House, but people close to him tell The Washington Post that he's warming to the idea.Happening in Washington: The Senate Armed Services Committee meets at 9:30 a.m. to consider the nomination of Leon Panetta to be Secretary of Defense. Mr. Panetta is currently the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Half an hour later, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will receive a top-secret briefing on the mission in Libya. President Obama is expected to meet at 4:45 p.m. with President Ali Bongo of Gabon.

HEADLINE: Budget Talks Heat Up as Deadline Nears

BYLINE: CARL HULSE


HIGHLIGHT: Lawmakers and White House officials involved in budget talks tied to the debt limit said on Thursday that they would meet at least three times next week to try to close in on an agreement. 

 BODY:
With time growing shorter, lawmakers and White House officials involved in budget talks tied to the debt limit said on Thursday that they would meet at least three times next week to try to close in on an agreement.
"There's a commitment for next week that we will be engaging, once again, in a robust series of meetings to see if we can achieve a result," said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader and one of two Republican lawmakers taking parting in the talks.
With the Senate and House schedules out of synch in recent weeks, the meetings have been sporadic despite an Aug. 2 deadline set by the Treasury Department for raising the $14.3 trillion federal debt limit or face the prospect of the government defaulting on its financial obligations for the first time. 
Last week, Speaker John A. Boehner said that while modest progress has been made in the talks presided over by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., he would like to see negotiations moving faster, with the aim of reaching a deal in the next month.
The bad economic news of recent days has also provided motivation to press ahead with the talks in order to find an agreement that could calm the unsettled markets. "The news economically on the jobs front in the last several days underscored the importance of this meeting that we just came out of," Mr. Cantor told reporters.
In their two-hour meeting at the Capitol Thursday, lawmakers, White House representatives and Treasury officials explored potential sources of new revenue that Democrats say will be essential to winning Democratic support for any deal in the House and Senate. Officials close to the talks said the participants have at least a few more weeks of work to do.

HEADLINE: Wi-Fi Set to Expand to 19 More City Parks

BYLINE: MATT FLEGENHEIMER


HIGHLIGHT: In a partnership with AT&#038;T, the city plans to expand Internet access. The Wi-Fi began Thursday in Thomas Jefferson Park, Battery Bosque in Battery Park, and Joyce Kilmer Park in the Bronx. 

 BODY:
Free Wi-Fi service will be made available in 19 more city parks, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced on Thursday in East Harlem, which would more than double the number of parks with Wi-Fi.
"It works," the mayor declared in Thomas Jefferson Park, raising his iPad with both hands. "This is technology."
Internet service, accessible through and paid for by AT&T Wi-Fi, started in three city parks Thursday: Thomas Jefferson Park, Battery Bosque in Battery Park, and the north-end playground in Joyce Kilmer Park in the Bronx.
Arrangements for Wi-Fi in the additional 16 parks, including multiple "hot spots" in Central Park, would be finalized by the end of the summer, the mayor said. (For a complete list, see below.) 
"More New Yorkers will now be able to take their office outdoors," he added. "This is central for economic growth." 
All park goers will be able to connect via AT&T's network - not just those who are already customers. Mr. Bloomberg also assured the public that there would be "no ads from AT&T filling up your browser window." AT&T did not disclose the estimated costs of the five-year agreement.
For nearly a decade, the city has attempted to spread Internet access in public spaces, with varying success. Some private initiatives, like the Bryant Park Corporation's wireless access plan, which began in 2002, continue to operate smoothly. 
For the city, though, forging partnerships with private wireless companies has proved challenging. In 2004, Verizon was selected to build and maintain Wi-Fi networks in parks across all five boroughs. The company backed out a month later. An arrangement with Wi-Fi Salon, the contractor that replaced Verizon, collapsed in 2008 after the company failed to attract corporate sponsors.
"This is better-invested, much better equipment," said Robert Garafola, the Parks Department's deputy commissioner for management and budget. "Also, the technology has matured."
Before Thursday, there were 13 parks equipped with Wi-Fi, the parks department said.
Many local residents said they believed the project was a worthy one, despite the past hiccups.
"Starbucks, McDonald's - they all have it," said Lloyd Stewart, 59, an electrician from the Bronx who was just outside the park. "A park should definitely have it. Kids just stay in the house all day. Now they can come outside for their projects."
Assemblyman Robert J. Rodriguez, flanking Mayor Bloomberg and AT&T's chief executive, Randall Stephenson, in Thomas Jefferson Park, lauded the measure for "closing the technology gap" in low-income neighborhoods.
Asif Awan, a limo driver who was sitting on a bench in the park, said he saw particular benefits for working parents.
"I'm a businessman," he said. "If I can bring my son to the park and also work, that makes a big difference."
The 19 parks where Wi-Fi will be added are: Bronx: Joyce Kilmer Park, Bronx River Park and Devoe Park. Brooklyn: Fort Greene Park, Herbert Von King Park, McCarren Park and Prospect Park. Coverage will also be expanded in Brooklyn Bridge Park. Manhattan: Battery Park, Thomas Jefferson Park, Central Park (multiple locations), the High Line, Holcombe Rucker Park, Marcus Garvey Park and Tompkins Square Park. Queens: Astoria Park, Flushing Meadows Corona Park and MacDonald Park. Staten Island: Clove Lake Park and South Beach.The 13 parks that already have Wi-Fi are: Brooklyn: Brooklyn Bridge Park, Classon Playground, Columbus Park. Manhattan: Bowling Green, British Memorial Garden, Bryant Park, City Hall Park, Jackson Square Park, Madison Square Park, Times Square, Union Square, Vietnam Veterans Plaza. Queens: Rufus King Park.

HEADLINE: Tilling the Tourist Magnet

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
SANTA MARGARITA, Calif. -- For all the talk about sustainable agriculture, most small farms are not self-sustaining in a very basic sense: they can't make ends meet financially without relying on income from jobs off the farm.
But increasingly farmers are eking more money out of the land in ways beyond the traditional route of planting crops and raising livestock. Some have opened bed-and-breakfasts, often known as farm stays, that draw guests eager to get a taste of rural living. Others operate corn mazes -- now jazzed up with modern fillips like maps on cellphones -- that often turn into seasonal amusements, with rope courses and zip lines. Ranchers open their land to hunters or bring in guests to ride horses, dude ranch style.
Known as agritourism, such activities are becoming an important economic boost for many farmers.
Early each morning, Jim Maguire milks the sheep and goats and feeds the pigs on his small dairy farm here before heading off to his day job as a public defender in San Luis Obispo County. His wife, Christine, makes cheese and tends the animals. 
But in recent years, Ms. Maguire has added some new chores: changing linens and serving food to the guests who stay at Rinconada Dairy's two bed-and-breakfast units, one in a private wing of the farmhouse and the other in a remodeled corner of a barn. Money from the paying guests is now enough to pay for the animals' feed, one of the farm's biggest expenditures.
''The whole idea is to get the farm in a productive state so that it carries itself, so that it pays its own way,'' Mr. Maguire said early on a recent morning as he watched sheep file onto the raised stainless steel platform of an automatic milking machine. ''The farm stay is an important economic portion of that.''
The United States Department of Agriculture predicts that this year the average farm household will get only about 13 percent of its income from farm sources. Agritourism is appealing because it increases the family's income from the farm, potentially reducing the need for off-farm jobs.
The U.S.D.A.'s census of agriculture, which is conducted every five years, estimated that 23,000 farms offered agritourism activities in 2007, bringing in an average of $24,300 each in additional income. The number of farms taking part fell from the previous census, in 2002, but at that time the average agritourism income per farm was just $7,200.
California, the nation's largest farm state, was among the leaders in agritourism, according to the census, with nearly 700 farms averaging more than $50,000 in agritourism income.
The agritourism movement is fueled by city dwellers who want to understand where their food comes from or who feel an urge to embrace the country life.
Scottie Jones, who raises sheep and runs a farm stay in Alsea, Ore., received $42,000 in U.S.D.A. grants to start a Web site, Farm Stay U.S., which maintains a listing of farm stays around the country. The site began last June and now includes more than 900 farms and ranches, with about 20 listings added each month.
World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms acts as an online clearinghouse for people who want to trade labor for lodging on a farm, with stays ranging from days to months. Ryan Goldsmith, who manages the group's branch in the United States, said that interest had grown strongly. Currently more than 11,600 people are registered as members of the American branch, with access to a database of about 1,300 farms, in all 50 states.
Even the corn maze, a staple of rural tourism for decades, is becoming more popular.
Brett Herbst, the owner of The Maize, a Utah company that designs and creates corn mazes, estimated there were more than 1,000 mazes around the country each year, from simple versions to complex behemoths that include games for visitors, with clues delivered by text message. His company expects to build about 220 mazes in the United States this year, about 20 more than last year. Ten years ago he created about 130 mazes.
''It's virtually impossible to make a living just off traditional farming on a small farm,'' said Mr. Herbst. ''This really provides an opportunity to keep the land, keep a family farm existent, even amongst urbanization, and allows someone to depend less on an outside job for their income.''
Still, there are hurdles. For example, many farmers complained about insurance costs, which rise with the number of farm visitors.
For years, Christine Cole has charged for tours of her farm, in Sebastopol, Calif., where she keeps horses, raises vegetables and chickens and has three farm stay units.
At the end of April, her insurance carrier dropped her, although she said she had made no major claims. She began looking for new insurance, she said, but was repeatedly turned down. She said insurers seemed unwilling to cover the broad range of activities on her farm. Finally, she found a policy that cost her almost $9,000 a year, about triple the cost of her previous coverage.
''That is more than 10 percent of my income,'' Ms. Cole said. ''I broke down and cried.''
Some states have acted to make it easier for farmers. Next month, a new law will go into effect in Indiana to limit the liability of farmers when someone is injured on their property while participating in agritourism activities.
Although many farmers said they enjoyed the city-country interaction at the heart of agritourism, it takes a particular type to pull it off.
''If you're not a people person, forget it,'' said Vince Gizdich, who runs Gizdich Ranch, in Watsonville, which includes a ''Pik-Yor-Self'' operation with berries and apples. The ranch also has a farm stand and a pie shop. As Mr. Gizdich talked with a reporter on a recent afternoon, he was interrupted repeatedly by people popping into the shop or customers calling to ask when his boysenberries and olallieberries would be ripe.
Bonnie Swank, of Hollister, Calif., runs a corn maze and haunted house each fall on land that grows vegetables the rest of the year. At a recent agritourism workshop for farmers sponsored by the university extension service, she explained the extensive planning that goes into the annual six-week extravaganza, which can draw up to 30,000 people and brings in about a quarter of the farm's annual revenue.
''People look at what we're doing and they say, 'We could do that and make a lot of money,''' she said. ''It's not that easy.''
Kim A. Rogers understands the hard work. For seven years, she and her husband ran a farm and orchard in Templeton, Calif., along with a busy bed and breakfast.
Finally she had an epiphany: farming was exhausting work and the bed-and-breakfast was providing an increasing portion of their income. So last year she and her husband pulled up their 700 fruit trees and became full-time innkeepers, with a cottage and a bungalow that rent for $150 to $285 a night.
They still have a few sheep, hens and a large vegetable garden -- enough to maintain the farm feel.
''A lot of people just want that rural farm experience,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Praise for a Sick Day Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Connecticut officials should be commended for passing the country's first statewide mandatory paid sick days law, which will be a boost for public health, working families and the economy (''In Connecticut, Paid Sick Leave for Service Workers Is Approved,'' news article, June 5). 
Hundreds of thousands of workers in Connecticut will no longer have to choose between their financial security and their health or the health of a child or loved one, but across the country more than 40 million workers, including 1.3 million in New York, are still forced to make this choice.
Fortunately, leaders around the country are getting behind this legislation. Here in New York City, 35 members of the City Council and a growing coalition of supporters understand that in our crowded and bustling city, paid sick days are critical.
We want workers to be healthy for their own sake and that of their families, but also because we eat in our great restaurants and travel on our public transportation and attend our public schools, and we don't want to get sick from someone who is ill because he or she cannot take a day off from work to go to the doctor.
And paid sick days are good for our economy. Economists have identified paid sick days as a job retention policy that can help reduce the unemployment rate, and six out of seven business owners in San Francisco say the law there has had no negative impact on profitability.

HEADLINE: In Harlem Buildings, Reminders of Easy Money and the Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; Juliet Linderman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
At Riverton Houses, a middle- and working-class apartment complex in Harlem, residents noticed a few changes after new owners came in. Lobbies were renovated. New elevators were installed. A decorative fence went up around the entire property.
Nearby, the new owners of another complex, Delano Village, were doing similar work with the same goal, to replace rent-stabilized tenants with ones paying market rates.
But while they were making improvements -- some of which they would eventually charge to tenants -- the new owners were piling on debt that their rental income could not support. Yet in each case, they have not exactly suffered: despite plunging the buildings into financial despair, each has been able to take tens of millions of dollars in cash out of the properties.
What the owners did was legal, and in the microcosm of a few square blocks of Manhattan, it tells a story of the nation's real estate bubble and collapse. As millions of homeowners did, but on a much larger scale, the owners refinanced their properties, finding lenders willing to give them far more money than the buildings turned out to be worth. 
When they refinanced, the owners of Riverton took out as much as $60 million in cash, and the owners of Delano Village, which they renamed Savoy Park, initially took out as much as $105 million, according to loan documents, credit analysts and lenders.
It is difficult to say exactly how much of that turned into profit because their books are not in the public record. James H. Simmons, a partner at AREA Property Partners, which bought Delano Village in a partnership with Vantage Properties, said they had put millions of dollars back into the property to cover shortfalls since running into financial problems at the end of 2009, although he declined to divulge any numbers.
Mr. Simmons said they were negotiating with the lenders to restructure the loans. If the talks were successful, he said, they would put a ''substantial'' sum of money toward retiring some of the debt.
''We are very close to a solution that works for the lenders and for us,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''We continue to maintain the property for the benefit of the tenants.''
Riverton's owners, Stellar Management and Rockpoint, declined to comment. They tried to restructure their loans by reinvesting as much as $40 million, said real estate executives who work with Laurence Gluck, Stellar's chief executive. But after one of the lenders refused to go along with the deal, the senior lenders foreclosed last year, with the property's value estimated to be less than half the $250 million debt.
Harold Shultz, a senior fellow at the Citizens Housing and Planning Council and a former city housing official, said that both deals emerged in an era when investors stopped looking at complexes like Savoy Park and Riverton ''as housing and started looking at them as commodities.'' Mr. Shultz and others estimate that there are as many as 100,000 overleveraged apartments in the city's working-class neighborhoods.
''They mistook Harlem for Fifth Avenue and 79th Street,'' Mr. Shultz said of the banks. ''The only surprise is that it took this long.''
Riverton, seven buildings with 1,232 units and a grassy courtyard, between 135th and 138th Streets, from Fifth Avenue to the Harlem River, was built in the late 1940s by Metropolitan Life Insurance as part of a ''slum clearance'' program led by Robert Moses. At the same time, MetLife built the larger Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village complexes north of 14th Street, but refused to rent those apartments to blacks and Hispanics. (The new owners of those complexes, Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock, defaulted on their loans in 2010 and relinquished control to lenders; they had not refinanced.)
Despite its bitter roots, Riverton developed a cachet within Harlem and was home to tenants like Samuel R. Pierce Jr., a former secretary of housing and urban development; the jazz pianist Billy Taylor; and former Mayor David N. Dinkins. ''It was the creme de la creme,'' said Nellie Hester Bailey, director of the Harlem Tenants Council.
Stellar and Rockpoint bought Riverton in 2005 for $132 million, with a $105 million mortgage. A year later, the partners refinanced Riverton, more than doubling the debt with $250 million in new loans.
The new financing enabled the partners to repay the original loan, recoup their investment and establish $53 million in reserve money to cover renovations and any shortfalls in revenue, leaving them with an additional $60 million. But the rental income covered less than half of the debt service, and turnover was slow. They converted 10 percent of the apartments to market rates -- not the 50 percent the owners had projected in loan documents. The complex's default served as a warning bell on Wall Street for dozens of overleveraged apartment building deals.
The main lender on the refinancing, Deutsche Bank, eventually packaged the loan with other mortgages as a commercial mortgage-backed security and sold it to investors. The use of mortgage-backed securities, many of them filled with bad loans, was a major contributor to the most recent financial collapse.
CW Capital, which represents investors in the Riverton debt, took control of the complex last year. The company declined to discuss Riverton's financial history.
Delano Village, seven buildings with 1,800 apartments built in the late 1950s just to the north of Riverton, was bought by Vantage and AREA in 2006 for $175 million, including a $128.7 million mortgage. A year later, the new owners refinanced, nearly tripling the debt on the property to $367.5 million.
The new financing allowed the partners to recoup their investment, repay the original mortgage and establish $87 million in reserve funds. That left the partners with about $100 million.
Vantage, with AREA and other partners, was in the midst of buying more than $2 billion worth of apartments in Harlem, Washington Heights and Queens. It set about making improvements like a new security system, a new boiler and fixed-up brick work, and won state approval to recoup some of those costs over a seven-year period by raising tenants' rents, as Riverton's owners also did.
Vantage, which was the operating partner at Savoy Park, also sent lease termination notices to roughly a fifth of its tenants, claiming that they were not entitled to rent-regulated apartments because it was not their primary residence, their name was not on the lease or they were in arrears on the rent.
Tenants at Savoy Park and other Vantage properties complained to the attorney general's office that Vantage was harassing them with false eviction claims. About 115 tenants who were sent eviction notices left Savoy before the cases got to housing court. Of the 158 cases that did go to court, Vantage was successful in evicting 44 tenants. The attorney general's office, then headed by Andrew M. Cuomo, reached a settlement in 2010 with Vantage over the 9,500 apartments controlled by the company in which Vantage promised to change its policies and pay $1 million to tenants who had suffered harassment and to finance nonprofit organizations that provide free legal advice to tenants.
As at Riverton and Stuyvesant Town, lenders extended large loans for Savoy Park based not on actual rental income but on income projections that turned out to be significantly overstated. According to Realpoint, a credit rating agency, the net cash flow at Savoy Park never rose much higher than $7 million, about a third of the annual loan payments. Realpoint estimates that the value of the complex has fallen to $98 million, and one executive familiar with the property suggested that it was now worth about $120 million -- either way, far less than the $367.5 million in loans.
Several tenants of rent-regulated apartments interviewed at the complex last month said that the owners were slow to make repairs and that carpets laid in the hallways by the landlord were infested with bedbugs. ''Things are not good here,'' said Valerie M. Orridge, a retired nurse who has lived there since 1959. She pays $870 a month for her two-bedroom apartment, and will pay $910 come August. ''It's just impossible to get repairs done.''
But a newcomer, Mike Brown, had a different impression of Savoy Park. He moved into a one-bedroom, 600-square-foot apartment with two roommates two months ago and is thrilled with the place, especially when compared with the dingy apartment he had in Newark. The market-rate rent is $1,500 a month, and the newly renovated apartment has a laminated parquet floor, new GE kitchen appliances and a new bathroom.
''I like the location,'' Mr. Brown, 28, said. ''Everything is clean. It has a nice vibe to it.''
Mr. Simmons, one of the owners, said Savoy Park would not follow Riverton into foreclosure, and Neil Rubler, his partner, said that ''deregulating apartments has never been a key component of our business plan.''
But David Hershey-Webb, a lawyer who represents tenants at Savoy Park, scoffed.
''Tripling the debt and deregulating go hand in hand,'' he said. ''That's what sparked the speculation.''

Valerie M. Orridge, a retired nurse who has lived for decades in what was once Delano Village and is now called Savoy Park, said it was hard to get repairs done in a timely manner.
 The value of the Savoy Park complex is thought to be far smaller than the loans it was given several years ago. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY MARCUS YAM FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) MAPS: Complexes that tell a story of a bubble and a collapse.

HEADLINE: Captured: A New York Minute, or One in Havana

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
In a photograph by Elliott Erwitt, ''New York City, 1949,'' we behold, from behind, Augustus Saint-Gaudens's bronze sculpture of a nude Diana. Drawing her bow, she seems to be aiming at the silhouetted figure of a man far away down a long hallway. In this, like so many of Mr. Erwitt's images, the light humor thinly veils poetic profundity. A modern cipher of a man is about to get his comeuppance from a mythical divinity: Diana, the virginal huntress, the sight of whom makes men fall prey to the hounds of their own lust. As the sex scandals reported almost daily in the news media attest, many powerful men have suffered, metaphorically, the fate of that unlucky voyeur Actaeon.
Like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Mr. Erwitt has been a seeker of the ''decisive moment,'' an instant in real time when people, animals or objects appear before the camera in surprising and illuminating ways. What distinguishes Mr. Erwitt's work has been his keen eye for the comedy in everyday life. He is the Henny Youngman of photographic one-liners. I mean that as high praise. Mr. Erwitt, now 82, delivers his visual gags with such economy and sweet-tempered lack of pretension that it is easy to overlook just how good he is at what he does. 
With one qualification, ''Elliott Erwitt: Personal Best,'' at the International Center of Photography, affords a fine occasion to appreciate his excellence and, not incidentally, have a laugh-out-loud time doing so. The problem is that most of the more than 100 images are in the form of recently produced, poster-size prints. Many are almost four feet wide or tall. The large format enhances graininess and sacrifices the pellucid intimacy of the formerly standard 8-by-10-inch print. (Brian Wallis, the center's chief curator, organized the exhibition, which celebrates the presentation of a Lifetime Achievement prize to Mr. Erwitt at the center's 2011 Infinity Awards on May 10.)
Format aside, the images still speak for themselves with wry, understated eloquence, and they do so almost always by juxtaposing oddly disparate yet similar objects. In ''Florida Keys, 1968,'' a long-necked, large-beaked white bird stands near a vertical pipe capped by a horizontal faucet and spout. The one thing is inanimate, the other animate, and yet they seem somehow, surrealistically, kindred.
In many of the most compelling images, second and third takes are needed to get the whole picture. In ''New York City, 1974,'' the first element you notice is the Chihuahua to the right, sporting a ridiculous little knit beret and gazing back at the camera with a look of goggle-eyed bewilderment. The dog is so little that the black boots of its owner, to the dog's right, seem like those of a giantess. And then, finally, you notice, to the left, the big punch line: the enormous paws and legs like tree trunks of a Great Dane or a dog of a related breed.
Born in Paris in 1928, Mr. Erwitt moved with his family to the United States in 1939. He went to Hollywood High School in Los Angeles, worked in a commercial darkroom and studied filmmaking at the New School for Social Research in New York in 1949 and 1950. After military service, he returned to New York, where, mentored by Edward Steichen and Robert Capa, he embarked on a long and distinguished career as a commercial photographer and photojournalist.
He made documentary films too. Three eminently watchable examples are running as part of this show. One from 1968 called ''Little Big Man'' profiles Dustin Hoffman during the time he worked on the film of that title; ''Beauty Knows No Pain,'' from 1971, examines the Kilgore College Rangerettes, an all-female dancing and marching team; and, best of all, ''Red, White and Bluegrass,'' from 1973, is a captivating study of musicians performing in rural North Carolina settings.
Mr. Erwitt's news photography is, naturally, more conventional than his personal work, but his pictures of the famous 1959 Kitchen Debate between the Soviet premier Nikita S. Khrushchev and Vice President Richard M. Nixon straddle the categories. With Nixon vigorously expostulating and pointing his finger into the chest of the impassive Khrushchev, the contestants look like bickering clowns.
In images of other famous people Mr. Erwitt got past the veils of myth and celebrity. Figures as different as Marilyn Monroe and Fidel Castro become real, sympathetic human beings. The image of Jacqueline Kennedy, caught momentarily alone in the crowd at the funeral of President John F. Kennedy, her face transformed by grief and worry, is heartbreaking.
But it is ordinary life to which Mr. Erwitt has been most acutely attuned and where he finds moments of allegorical epiphany. In a picture from 1963, two women stand on either side of a park bench, looking in different directions. A third sits between them with an unusually large baby sprawled on her lap. A sign posted high on the wire fence behind them announces ''Lost Persons Area.'' Obviously, it is a place at a fair or concert where people can go to find friends or family members from whom they've been temporarily separated.
But there is a funny, paradoxical multiplication of meaning. Do these ladies not know where they are? Are they suffering from a purgatorial spiritual condition? Are they hoping to be found, as in the song ''Amazing Grace?'' Well, Mr. Erwitt found them, and that is what counts.
''Elliott Erwitt: Personal Best'' continues through Aug. 28 at the International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street; (212) 857- 0000, icp.org.

 BODY:
DREAMS OF JOY
By Lisa See
354 pages. Random House. $26.
''You don't say much,'' says the man who flirtatiously sidles up to Joy, the young heroine of Lisa See's latest novel. He has a smile that's ''warm and embracing.'' He leaves Joy ''dumb with wonder and astonishment.'' And he has a question for Joy's father: ''How many more pretty daughters have you left across China?'' Perhaps the question is impertinent, but this is a man who can say whatever he wants to: Joy is fielding a come-on from Chairman Mao. 
Ms. See's formula for best-selling fiction steeped in Chinese culture and history has usually involved longer and more glamorous leaps through time. ''Peony in Love'' went back to the 17th century (and into the afterlife). ''Snow Flower and the Secret Fan'' was a 19th-century story. Even ''Shanghai Girls,'' to which ''Dreams of Joy'' is a sequel, went back to reasonably carefree pre-World War II Shanghai. Ms. See's heroines (and readers) are allowed to enjoy lavish period detail before being forced through the melodramatic misery that her novels also feature.
But her latest book is set during a more recent and forbidding era: that of Mao's Great Leap Forward, which began in 1958 and mandated the collectivization of Chinese agriculture and led to catastrophic famine in the early 1960s. Since Ms. See presents these events through the eyes of Joy, a headstrong young woman who grew up in Los Angeles but rejects her family and the United States to find out what China is like, ''Dreams of Joy'' might have been called ''We Told You So.''
In ''Shanghai Girls,'' which is a necessary prelude to this new book, two sisters, May and Pearl, were in love with the same man, the artist Z. G. Li. At the start of ''Dreams of Joy'' it is revealed to Joy that Z. G. is her father, and that even though Pearl reared her, May is her real mother. This is enough to make Joy decide that everything she thought she knew about herself is ''a big fat lie'' and send her fleeing across the Pacific. ''Maybe China is my new home,'' she tells herself. But the doubts begin when she gets there and is forced to give up -- here's a book club talking point, for sure -- her decadent, reactionary bra.
Little emotional resonance is attached to Joy's finding Z. G. and telling him that he is her father. Z. G. seems less interested in family ties than in teaching Joy about the new, Mao-sanctioned forms of art. ''Together we will find redness in our work,'' he tells his group of art students, which now includes Joy. But she has no redness and not much color of any kind. As is the case with many of Ms. See's characters, she has been put on the page to relay well-researched details about life in China. (''I want to love China,'' she says with typical acuity, ''but everything is just so strange.'') She is also there to suffer.
Joy quickly and for no good reason falls in love with Feng Tao, a boy at the farming commune to which Z. G. brings her. ''It was fated that you would come to my village,'' he says. The village is Green Dragon Village, now known as Dandelion Number Eight People's Commune.
Joy has not been there long before Tao asks for her hand in marriage, Maoist style. ''You're the right age,'' he tells Joy. ''I'm the right age. We aren't blood relatives up to the third degree of relationship. Neither of us has any diseases. Let's go to the Party secretary and his wife to ask permission to marry.''
Does this sound like a good idea to you? It doesn't sound like a good idea to Pearl, who has followed Joy to China and fallen into her own set of adventures. Though these two characters are nominally very different, with Joy naive and Pearl a middle-aged martyr, their voices sound similar; it's their circumstances that differ. But each of them goes through the book illuminating readers about how this harsh new China works. For anyone who ever wondered how menstruating women living the no-frills Chinese commune life could make handy use of leaves, grass or sand when ''the visit from the little red sister'' arrives, Ms. See will provide details.
Of course ''Dreams of Joy'' is about much bigger matters. The dreams are not only Joy's personal dreams, you see, but also the Chinese government's broad, sweeping claims that the Great Leap Forward will turn China into a paradise. Joy and Pearl can attest: These dreams are not coming true.
And at the risk of losing her books' usual picturesque allure, Ms. See explains how peasants are encouraged to melt all scraps of metal when resources become scarce; how the fields are so ambitiously overplanted that crops cannot thrive; how crushed glass is plowed into the earth because it is a government-recommended nutrient. More than one scene in ''Dreams of Joy'' is set at the Chinese Export Commodities Fair in Canton, which has become a thriving international trade event. At the time of the novel it is a less scintillating exhibition, where many glorious Chinese tractors are on view.
The real and terrible consequences of the government's miscalculations are also part of Ms. See's story. Her estimate that the ensuing famine killed 45 million people may be high (no precise count of casualties exists), but the suffering and deprivation she describes are real. So are officials' saber-rattling claims that some day China's economy will thrive enough to threaten that of the United States.
Dwarfed by matters of such historical magnitude, Joy seems less and less consequential as ''Dreams of Joy'' moves toward its ending. And the reader is dragged through the last stages of the plot, the ones that force Joy to come to her senses. ''I thought I could use idealism to solve my inner conflicts,'' she ultimately realizes, ''but in healing my inner conflicts I destroyed my idealism.'' ''Dreams of Joy'' takes a very slow boat to China to arrive at this destination.

HEADLINE: Buried in Anonymity, and Ignominy, Too

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
EL DORADO HILLS, Calif. -- Wedged between a strawberry patch and an encroaching swath of suburbia, the men and women who lie in the Mormon Island Relocation Cemetery are a long-dead, little-noted lot: a Mr. Outen, for example, who died in December 1862, or Elizabeth, the wife of James, who died in April some two decades later.
But for the better part of five decades, the most notable tombstones at Mormon Island were those without names: 36 anonymous decedents whose grave markers shared a single, shocking label: ''Moved from Nigger Hill Cemetery.''
Perhaps more jarring were the words that followed, saying that the headstones were placed ''by U.S. Government'' in 1954. 
''This is something you wouldn't believe, not in this day and time,'' said Ralph L. White, an African-American businessman and former city councilman in Stockton, in nearby San Joaquin County. ''When I went up to that gravesite, I feel like I could feel the presence of those people crying to get those things off of them.''
That pleading -- and that of a group of living activists, including a Boy Scout -- was answered this week when crews from El Dorado County removed the 36 headstones. Their removal came after a unanimous decision last month from an embarrassed board of supervisors, as well as the theft of two of the offensive markers earlier this week.
''There's no acceptable explanation,'' said John Knight, a county supervisor who said he had learned of the markers only this year. ''It's not indicative of the county. It's just one of those oversights that a lot of people didn't know about it.''
There is an explanation, albeit a tortured one. In the early 1950s, the United States Army Corps of Engineers was charged with relocating hundreds of graves from cemeteries due to be submerged by the creation of Folsom Lake, which was formed by a dam about 25 miles northeast of Sacramento. And one of those was a Gold Rush-era town known as Negro Hill.
But somewhere during the process of moving the buried, the name of the town's cemetery was changed on the grave markers. And while no one knows exactly who made the switch, the recent effort to replace the headstones left current members of the corps red-faced over the actions of their cold war counterparts.
''The overwhelming reaction was one of shock and embarrassment,'' said Dede Cordell, a spokeswoman for the corps district in Sacramento, the state capital. ''There was a lot of 'Oh my gosh, how did this happen?' and 'How can we fix this?' ''
Like many issues involving race and remembrance, the Mormon Island markers had also led to questions over who should be in charge of correcting the historical record. And like all things in California -- where budget woes affect every level of government -- the solution was also bound up with economic reality.
Last month, the county supervisors decided to accept a bid from the California Prison Industry Authority to replace the tombstones with a new group of markers. The authority, which is a semiautonomous state agency that takes no financing from California's coffers, said it would use private donations instead of public money to cover the project's $18,000 cost.
And that irked Mr. White.
''The government is the one who did it,'' he said. ''So the government is the one who should have to pay for it.''
Ms. Cordell says the corps could not get directly involved despite its desire to do something, because it ceded control of the cemetery plot to the county in 1961.
''I've had people here say, 'Let me know when, and I will go out there personally and dig,' '' she said. ''We all feel dirty about this. It feels wrong. But we can only do it as individuals.''
The corps did attempt to answer questions about how the change from Negro Hill occurred by recently releasing more than a dozen documents, dating from 1951 to 1961. Several clearly refer to the cemetery by the more offensive name, something Lt. Col. Andrew B. Kiger, deputy commander of the corps district, said was ''reflective of a shameful period in American history when racial intolerance was commonplace.''
Sue Silver, former president of the El Dorado County Pioneer Cemeteries Commission, a volunteer nonprofit group, said the pejorative name had come into usage in some quarters in the 1920s. But she roundly objected to its appearing on anything official.
''The proper name was Negro Hill,'' Ms. Silver said in an e-mail. ''And that is what it should be on the markers.''
Oddly enough, Ms. Silver said, most of those three dozen unidentified dead were probably white, as many prospectors were.
But the fact that no one knows for sure bothers Michael Harris, the director of the Negro Hill Burial Ground Project, who would like to see a bigger effort made to identify them, or at least their races and ages. This could be done, he suggests, with ground-penetrating radar.
Such research, Mr. Harris said, might give a fuller picture of the black community's contribution to the Gold Rush, something he feels is underrepresented. ''It's an inclusive history you must tell,'' he said.
Mr. Harris says he first encountered the gravestones in 1998, and he has been trying to build support for changing them ever since. He is not alone; Ms. Silver said she also discovered the markers in the 1990s.
Still, momentum for switching the stones really began to build only in 2009, when Josh Michael, a local Boy Scout, drafted an elaborate proposal to replace the markers to fulfill his community service obligation for becoming an Eagle Scout. Josh, now 15, was unavailable for comment because he was -- no kidding -- climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.
''We just wanted to right a wrong,'' said Tamera Michael, his mother. ''We don't care who gets credit for it. We just want them to rest in peace.''
Which, it seems, may actually happen. Eric Reslock, a spokesman for the California Prison Industry Authority, said on Thursday that he expected the new stones to be placed in July. About $3,000 has been raised thus far, Mr. Reslock said, and the prison has offered the inmates' labor free. Mr. Knight said he would ask the county for the money if donations fell short.
In the meantime, the old, offensive markers have been moved to a county storage yard, said Mike Applegarth, an El Dorado spokesman. They are likely to be destroyed, he said Thursday.
''We figured it was better to get it done,'' he said. ''Sooner rather than later.''

HEADLINE: Governor Seeks Sharp Tuition Increase in Five-Year Plan for SUNY

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, suggesting that what he sees as rock-bottom tuition rates could be holding back the ambitions of the state's public universities, introduced legislation on Thursday that would sharply increase what students pay to attend the State University of New York.
Mr. Cuomo's proposal would raise in-state undergraduate tuition, now $4,970, by up to 5 percent annually for the next five years, and by as much as 8 percent annually at SUNY's research universities in Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo and Stony Brook. The increase would affect 175,000 students on the 29 four-year campuses SUNY operates. 
The legislation appealed to university presidents, who have long sought modest, automatic annual increases, rather than having to plead their case every few years for often-sharper tuition increases.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, described his proposal as an economic development initiative for the state, arguing that the added revenue would allow campus administrators to bolster research programs.
''The current tuition system does not serve our students, schools or state,'' the governor said in a statement. ''This bill brings rationality to the SUNY tuition system by allowing students and parents to reasonably plan for college expenses, instead of being subject to dramatic tuition increases and uncertainty.''
Lawmakers have expressed interest in a multiyear plan, but they have disagreed on how to put it into effect. Measures similar to Mr. Cuomo's are under consideration in both houses of the Legislature, and lawmakers have been trying to work out a compromise before the scheduled end of the legislative session, on June 20.
Senate Republicans have been open to increasing tuition as Mr. Cuomo suggested, and they responded positively to his proposal.
''We believe it's essential that SUNY be given the flexibility it needs to continue to grow, create jobs and help revitalize our local and regional economies,'' said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican.
But Democrats have been less enthusiastic, arguing that higher tuition could make some SUNY campuses unaffordable for low-income New Yorkers.
A bill introduced by Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, a Manhattan Democrat and chairwoman of the Assembly Higher Education Committee, proposed a $500 tuition increase over three years. By contrast, Mr. Cuomo's plan would raise tuition by as much as $783 over three years at SUNY's nonresearch campuses. Over five years, his proposal would increase tuition by as much as 28 percent at the nonresearch campuses, and by as much as 47 percent at the research campuses.
''That is a failing,'' said Senator Toby Ann Stavisky of Queens, who is the senior Democrat on the Senate Higher Education Committee. ''We're making higher education less affordable and less accessible.''
Ms. Stavisky also lamented that the governor's proposal did not include the separate City University of New York, which is also seeking state approval to raise tuition.
In announcing his proposal, the governor argued that a 5-percent annual tuition increase would be a bargain for students, because, he said, the periodic increases over the past two decades had averaged out to an annual increase of 6.7 percent.
Mr. Cuomo has pledged that new tuition revenue would be used only to support SUNY, but Assembly Democrats were unhappy that his proposal would not make that pledge law. A spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who has said such a guarantee would be crucial to the passage of a tuition increase, declined to comment on the governor's legislation.
Mr. Cuomo's proposal restarts a longstanding debate in Albany: whether the SUNY system has sacrificed, or should sacrifice, some of its academic and research aspirations to maximize affordability.
''We're wrestling with balance,'' Mr. Cuomo said last week at a meeting with officials from Stony Brook University. ''We'll keep tuition as low as possible, yes. But at one point you may degrade the institution that the students are attending, and that's a reality point that I think we have to come to terms with.''
In his proposal, the governor offered several forms of assistance to low-income students. Most notably, students who are eligible for the maximum grant from the state's Tuition Assistance Program -- which, at $4,995, covers the full cost of undergraduate tuition at SUNY -- would not be subject to the tuition increase.
That satisfied SUNY's student government, the Student Assembly. ''We applaud the governor's effort to end the harsh tuition spikes that have been detrimental to SUNY's accessibility,'' the Student Assembly president, Kaitlyn Beachner, said in a statement.
The larger increases at the research universities would be contingent on the approval of plans to expand the campuses' academic and research programs. Those expansions would be paid for in part by a $140 million grant program that Mr. Cuomo unveiled last month.

HEADLINE: China Appears to Be Moving to Halt Grass-Roots Candidates

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The Chinese authorities appear to be restricting attempts by a handful of citizens to run in local legislative elections as self-proclaimed independent candidates, stating that such candidacies are illegal and that no one can run for office without first clearing a series of procedural hurdles.
The decision, published Wednesday by the news agency Xinhua and Thursday in the People's Daily, a Communist Party newspaper, appeared to some to reflect official concern about the Communist Party's grip on the election process in a society whose members are increasingly linked by the Internet. Dozens of people recently had signaled on microblogs that they intended to mount their own campaigns for seats in local versions of the National People's Congress, China's quasi legislature. 
Some candidates suggested, however, that the ruling did little to formally outlaw grass-roots campaigns by candidates who lack the party's official blessing.
''Over all, I think the official response is a little more positive than negative,'' said Xu Zhiyong, a prominent civil rights lawyer elected in 2003 to the People's Congress in central Beijing's Haidian district as an upstart candidate. ''Legally, there's nothing wrong with what was said.''
At the same time, citizens still have a right to proclaim themselves ''independent candidates,'' Mr. Xu maintained, ''just as they have a right to choose their own names.''
The local legislatures choose members every five years in elections that the government hails as an exercise in grass-roots democracy. Xinhua reports that up to 900 million voters would choose two million legislators for offices that roughly correspond to American city councils.
In practice, candidates are largely handpicked by Communist Party officials and committees, and outsiders are frequently discouraged from seeking office. Candidates have run their own campaigns and won office in the past, but victories have been exceedingly rare and re-election even more difficult.
The statement in People's Daily, which quoted an unnamed National People's Congress official, said that election rules permitted only ''official deputy candidates'' who have negotiated a series of procedures to run for office. ''There are no so-called 'independent candidates,' '' the statement said, ''and 'independent candidates' have no legal basis.''
The article also hinted that grass-roots campaigning of the sort spawned on microblogs this year might run afoul of the rules. Xinhua quoted the unnamed National People's Congress official as stating, ''Introductions of candidates must be arranged by electoral committees in strict accordance with the law.''
Under the rules, candidates for county and township offices first must register and be deemed qualified to run for office, then secure support from at least 10 local voters, a political party or a citizens' organization. The list of candidates is then winnowed by ''the majority of opinions in the constituency,'' the official was quoted as saying, and all subsequent campaigning is regulated by official electoral committees.
Candidates who lack official favor frequently find their route to office blocked, even if they meet legal qualifications.
The investigative business magazine Caixin on Tuesday detailed the efforts of one woman, Liu Ping, who sought to run in a Jiangxi Province district election in April. Ms. Liu was not allowed to pick up nomination forms for her supporters to sign, the magazine reported. Some supporters were warned by telephone to stop backing her.
In the end, she was barred from seeking office ''according to the party constitution and your previous behavior,'' a comment that appeared to be a reference to an earlier attempt to petition Beijing officials about workers' grievances.
Mr. Xu said that popular enthusiasm for this round of national grass-roots elections appeared to be considerably greater than the last round in 2006, calling it ''the result of progress in society as a whole, socially, economically and in the overall amount of freedom on the Internet.'' Despite official ''conservatism'' within the government, he added, ''it's clear that citizens are actively trying to participate in elections.''
It remained to be seen, though, whether these self-proclaimed candidates might have success in the electoral process, he said. ''To some extent, it will depend on the attitudes in the electoral districts, and on the candidates' own efforts,'' he said.
Mr. Xu, who founded a noted nonprofit advocacy group, was detained for more than three weeks on suspicion of tax evasion in 2009, and he has been subject to tight surveillance and frequent harassment from the authorities, even as he completes his own term as a district ''people's deputy'' in Beijing.
One self-proclaimed independent, Li Chengpeng, wrote on his microblog on Thursday that ''it is probably more appropriate to call independent candidates 'jointly recommended candidates.' ''
''If my understanding is correct,'' he added, ''the above statement by People's Congress actually implies that citizens can run for local elections if jointly recommended by the public.''

HEADLINE: Supporters of Casino Bill Turn Their Lobbying to Quinn

BYLINE: By KRISTEN McQUEARY. 
Kristen McQueary covers state politics for The Chicago News Cooperative and Chicago Public Media. kmcqueary@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
For months, as a gambling bill moved through the state legislature, swarms of lobbyists alternately charmed lawmakers and twisted arms.
Now, they are working on Gov. Pat Quinn, who controls the fate of the bill.
Cities including Rockford and Danville are organizing letter-writing campaigns and hosting rallies to pressure Mr. Quinn to sign the legislation. Chambers of commerce, restaurant owners and even farmers who supply horse hay are imploring him to keep the bill intact.
The legislation would authorize five new casinos, including one for Chicago, and slot machines at Chicago airports and at horse racing tracks. The bill would allow for a new racing facility at the Illinois State Fairgrounds and permit the state's existing 10 casinos to expand. 
It is a 400-page anthology of political horse trades that supporters, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel, said could unravel with any swipe of Mr. Quinn's veto pen. The governor has called the bill ''excessive.''
That worries stakeholders in Illinois horse racing, who are counting on the bill to save their industry. ''If you eliminate any parts of that bill, you would lose support and the whole thing could go down in flames,'' said Tony Somone, executive director of the Illinois Harness Horsemen's Association, ''Quite frankly, it scares the hell out of me.''
If Mr. Quinn amends the bill, the legislature would have to approve his changes. But removing any of the proposed casino sites, in Chicago, Rockford, Danville, the south suburbs or Park City, or scaling back the slot machine allowances, would result in the loss of much-needed votes. The bill barely made it out of the Senate and received only four extra votes in the House.
''I'm the only one who can call the bill, and I'm the only one who moves the bill,'' said Senator Terry Link, Democrat of Waukegan, whose district includes Park City. ''Do you really think I would allow the bill to move forward without mine being in it?''
Multiply Mr. Link's stance by 95 -- the number of lawmakers who voted for the bill because there was something in it for their districts -- and you can see how fragile it is.
Mr. Link said he planned to meet with Mr. Quinn to discuss follow-up legislation to address the governor's concerns. The goal would be to persuade him to sign the bill on the condition that a follow-up measure would reduce its scope. ''Like any other negotiation, I'm not going to play it out in the media, but we will sit down and talk about it,'' he said.
Some opponents of the bill said it was too ambitious.
''I would consider supporting a casino in Chicago, but I don't see the need for a 50 percent increase in casinos statewide,'' Senator Susan Garrett, Democrat of Lake Forest, said.
The decision before Mr. Quinn is a tough one. Cities like Rockford represent some of the state's hardest-hit economies. That's why Rockford's mayor, Lawrence J. Morrissey, traveled to Springfield last month to meet with power brokers.
''As mayor,'' Mr. Morrissey said, ''one of the things I've learned since I was elected in 2005 is that if you want to get anything done in Springfield, you have to be there. Economic development doesn't happen with magic.''

Museums
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Quilts: Masterworks from the American Folk Art Museum' (Through Oct. 16.) This exhibition celebrating quilts from the museum's collection reveals the optical vitality of these eminently pictorial textiles. Ranging across a variety of patterns and techniques and nearly two centuries, the examples here effortlessly combine personal and national histories with rigorous down-home formalism, all the while making brilliant use of available, often humble, fabrics. The various geometric ins and outs, color contrasts and boldly scaled compositions confirm that quilts, like Navajo blankets, are among the earliest abstract art in post-conquest North America. 45 West 53rd Street , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20110609
American Folk Art Museum: 'Super Stars: Quilts From the American Folk Art Museum' (Through Sept. 25.) In conjunction with the exhibition of quilts at the main museum, its branch is featuring 20 quilts in which stars figure in some way, whether as pieced-together geometric forms or as little tufts of thread that suggest a distant galaxy. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street , (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Smith)20110609 
American Folk Art Museum: 'Eugene Von Bruenchenhein: Freelance Artist -- Poet and Sculptor -- Inovator -- Arrow maker and Plant man -- Bone artifacts constructor -- Photographer and Architect -- Philosopher' (Through Oct. 9.) Whether photographing his wife as a sweetly chaste pinup girl; fashioning plant forms from scrounged clay or little thrones from salvaged turkey bones; or making delicate ballpoint-pen drawings or hallucinatory paintings rife with intimations of exotic undersea or sci-fi worlds, this self-taught, self-proclaimed multitasker (as made clear in the show's subtitle) never wavered in his sense of his own greatness. Mounted 27 years after his death, his first American museum survey doesn't quite do him justice and especially shortchanges the paintings, but it presents the fruits of his ceaseless labors with a clarity that makes them feel of a piece, and like a gift. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Smith)20110609
- Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum: 'Color Moves: Art and Fashion by Sonia Delaunay' (Through June 19.) Examining the more practical side of Delaunay's pioneering achievement, this beautiful, enlightening exhibition offers some alluring artworks, garments and accessories, especially a passel of radiant scarves. But it bets most of the house on fabric swatches -- Delaunay's textile designs -- and succeeds with a display of some 90 gouache studies for textiles and their equally vibrant commercial results: more than 120 hand-printed silks, velvets and cottons laid out in large vitrines. Patterns ranging from geometric to floral variously revisit, amplify and presage much of the history of modern painting and may even deserve a place in that history. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Smith)20110609
Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum: 'Set in Style: The Jewelry of Van Cleef & Arpels' (Through July 4.) Van Cleef & Arpels, the century-old French jewelry firm, is the primary sponsor of this show and has supplied much of its mega-carat menu: some 350 lavish pieces worn by royals, screen sirens and social swans. Although extravagance doesn't seem out of place in this former Carnegie mansion, the show often looks as if it were put together by the company's creative directors and merchandisers. The visitors lining up around the block don't seem to care, as long as they can linger over pieces like a maharani's carved-emerald necklace and large sapphire-and-diamond pendant earrings worn by Elizabeth Taylor. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20110609
Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2010: Hans-Peter Feldmann' (Through Nov. 2.) Mr. Feldmann, the septuagenarian German artist who was the surprise pick for the Boss Prize honors, has decided to exhibit his prize money -- in the form of 100,000 $1 bills, pinned to the wall of one of the Guggenheim's Tower galleries. What sounds on paper like a conceptual stunt or a riff on Warholian materialism becomes overpoweringly physical in person, thanks to the smell of the used bills and the traces of their circulation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)20110609
Jewish Museum: 'Collecting Matisse and Modern Masters: The Cone Sisters of Baltimore' (Through Sept. 25.) At the Jewish Museum, this exhibition samples the extraordinary trove of European art amassed by two American spinsters in the first half of the 20th century, work now owned by the Baltimore Museum of Art. Although some major collection highlights are absent, the pieces here -- presented in the order of acquisition -- generate a compelling portrait of the Cones as collectors. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110609
Jewish Museum: 'Maira Kalman: Various Illuminations (of a Crazy World)' (Through July 31.) Like her fellow New Yorker magazine contributors Ed Koren and Roz Chast, Ms. Kalman offers gently humorous cartoon commentary on the trials and tribulations of modern metropolitan life. Ranging in style from faux-naive eccentricity to suave realism, the more than two decades worth of drawings and paintings on paper in this career survey make for an entertaining if not deeply provocative experience. With a flea market-like installation of nondescript objects from her personal collection, however, she tries too hard to be amazingly original. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20110609
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Andean Tunic, 400 B.C.E.-1800 C.E.' (Through Sept. 18.) This small show celebrates the festive yet functional garments woven south of the equator. To the modern eye, they're wearable paintings; lovers of Keith Haring and Elizabeth Murray will find much to admire. So will anyone interested in the complex relationships among art, clothing, ritual and power. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110609
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Anthony Caro on the Roof' (Through Oct. 30.) No one in the 1960s produced groovier abstract sculpture than the British artist Anthony Caro, five of whose heavy metal assemblages grace the Met's Rooftop Garden. But only one of these works has that startling, newborn feeling. Sporting a brand-new coat of shiny, taxicab yellow paint, ''Midday'' (1960) has the look of a jaunty, industrial dinosaur. The others, dating from 1968 to 2010, show a development toward an increasingly conservative, ponderous monumentality. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20110609
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Guitar Heroes: Legendary Craftsmen from Italy to New York' (Through July 4.) The heroes of this exceptionally interesting show are three craftsmen known for producing some of the most sought-after jazz guitars of the 20th century. Part I surveys a history of Italian luthiers from 17th-century Naples to Italian immigrants producing string instruments in New York in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Part II presents lovingly made archtop guitars and mandolins dating from 1923 to 2008 by inheritors of that tradition: John D'Angelico, James D'Aquisto and John Monteleone. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110609
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty' (Through Aug. 7.) A triumph for this British fashion designer -- who died at 40, by his own hand, last year -- and for the curator Andrew Bolton of the Met's Costume Institute, this career retrospective is ethereal and gross, graceful and manipulative, and poised on a line where fashion turns into something else. The operatic spectacle is pushed along by soundtrack of wind, Handel and orgiastic moans, and has a holographic image of Kate Moss spinning like a moth in a flame at the center. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20110609
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Night Vision: Photography After Dark' (Through Sept. 18.) It wasn't until the gelatin dry-plate process was introduced in the late 1880s that exposure time was lowered enough for photographs to be taken regularly after dark. Alfred Stieglitz was among the first to photograph New York at night. His work is shown alongside Berenice Abbott's spectral ''Nightview, New York'' from 1932, taken from the window of a skyscraper; Brassai's nocturnal views of Paris; and Weegee's high-contrast picture of a crime scene. Diane Arbus, Bill Brandt, Robert Frank, Garry Winogrand and Kohei Yoshiyuki are among the other artists included in this modest, lovely show of 40 black-and-white photographs drawn from the museum's collection, which stops a couple of decades short of the present. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)20110609
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Poetry in Clay: Korean Buncheong Ceramics from Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art' (Through Aug. 14.) This beautiful exhibition presents bottles, vases, bowls and dishes made by 15th- and 16th-century Korean artisans. In shades of gray, from creamy and opalescent off-whites to deep, warm blacks, the anonymous craftsmen covered vessels with loosely rendered images of flora and fauna and fine-grained patterns of dots and tiny blossoms. These infectiously lively works look as if they'd been made not centuries but only decades ago. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110609
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rooms with a View: The Open Window in the 19th Century' (Through July 4.) This compact, quietly splendid exhibition explores the window as luminous light source, as semi-abstract compositional element and as the focal point for a certain poignant, implicitly Romantic yearning. The images -- mostly by German, French and Scandinavian artists before 1830 -- depict both domestic settings and artists' studios and are passively subversive in their avoidance of large-scale, historic themes and formal portraiture. They show us a world on the verge of electricity, photography and industrialization, a moment of irretrievable, partly fictive calm that incites some yearning of its own. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20110609
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective' (Through Aug. 28.) Few artists have pushed drawing to such sculptural and even architectural extremes as Mr. Serra, so it makes sense that his adamantine pursuit of the medium, surveyed in an installation that he largely designed himself, is not quite like anything seen at the Met before. There are moments of off-putting starkness on Mr. Serra's side and some of the usual architectural infelicities on the Met's, but as a demonstration of this august institution's willingness to engage with genuinely radical, physically unsettling art of recent vintage, the show is cause for hope. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20110609
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Tibetan Arms and Armor From the Permanent Collection' (Through fall.) The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Met's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Later Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, created this follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including five acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense; examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110609
MoMA P.S. 1: 'Laurel Nakadate: Only the Lonely' (Through Aug. 8.) Laurel Nakadate might be on the cusp of a great new career. She is known for disconcerting, sad and sexually provocative videos that she enlisted older, worse-for-wear men to participate in, but in the past three years she has made two feature-length films. Included in this enthralling survey of her 10-year career, they focus with lingering, heart-aching care on adolescent girls, lost souls looking for love and only getting into trouble. MoMA P.S. 1, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20110609
Morgan Library & Museum: 'The Age of Elegance: The Joan Taub Ades Collection' (Through Aug. 28.) This small but engrossing exhibition presents about three dozen works dating from the mid 17th to the late 19th centuries by European artists, each in his own way a draftsman of consummate skill. Some names, like Boucher and Millais, are familiar; most will be known only to art historical specialists. Ranging from postcard to laptop size, including portraiture, still-life and mythological scenes, they exemplify the fine but now endangered art of drawing at its best. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Johnson)20110609
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Illuminating Fashion: Dress in the Art of Medieval France and the Netherlands' (Through Sept. 4.) Medieval illuminations -- so rich in narrative, embellishment and religious expression -- can display sartorial trends that can help experts date manuscripts and discern the subtleties of a figure's status or character. There are many examples here, as well as mannequins in full-scale model attire -- say, a splendid hunting ensemble of gold-embroidered blue velvet and lilac wool felt for the men, and for the women, a princessy gown of yellow silk trimmed in black crushed velvet, accessorized by a turret. This lively show will teach you to scrutinize centuries-old manuscripts as you would a style magazine. 225 Madison, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)20110609
Museum of Modern Art: 'Access to Tools: Publications From the Whole Earth Catalog, 1968-1974' (Through July 26.) Brainchild of the visionary techno-hippie artist Steward Brand, the Whole Earth Catalog did for counterculture youth in the '60s what the Sears catalog did for children of the Great Depression and what Google does for people of the Internet age: provide a way for ordinary citizens to connect with and make use of the global economy. This modest but stirring time capsule of an exhibition presents various editions of the catalog, along with a mind-expanding array of books, magazines and ephemera that influenced or exemplified its holistic mission. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20110609
Museum of Modern Art: 'Francis Als: A Story of Deception' (Through Aug. 1.) This possibly premature, hit-and-miss survey of the quixotic, politically aware, yet obstinately poetic art of this Belgian artist, who has lived in Mexico since 1986, whipsaws a visitor between engagement and boredom, serious consideration and dismissal. In the show, at MoMA and its P.S. 1 site in Queens (closes Sept. 12), the best works are videos, but the split exhibition is garnished, you might say, with sometimes appealing paintings and sculptures and also dulled with extensive backup materials: studies, notes, texts and newspaper clippings pertaining to most of the works on view. Too often the result confirms this museum's blind faith in the wan, cerebral machinations of late-late-late Conceptualism. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20110609
- Museum of Modern Art: 'German Expressionism: The Graphic Impulse' (Through July 11.) MoMA's largest ever survey of Germany's first Modern art movement is infused with an urgent, crackling energy, by turns joyful, satiric, grim and tragic. Presenting some 250 works -- most of them little-seen prints -- it celebrates one of the 20th century's most brutally effective, socially responsive unions of medium and message and shakes up the (understandable) conventional wisdom that the museum is almost terminally Francophile. While lavish, the show reveals but a fraction of the museum's 3,200 Expressionist works on paper, all of which are newly available for digital viewing at moma.org/explore/multimedia/interactives/161. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20110609
Museum of Modern Art: 'I Am Still Alive: Politics and Everyday Life in Contemporary Drawing' (Through Sept. 19.) This show of contemporary drawings (most acquired since 2005) is anchored by a group of telegrams sent by the Japanese artist On Kawara to friends and associates; each one bears the message ''I am still alive.'' The artists seem to be in a permanent state of wariness and suspicion, which is sometimes the result of political instability and at other times more innate. But their efforts to process matters of life and death in short bursts of creative activity feel very of the moment. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20110609
Museum of Modern Art: 'Boris Mikhailov: Case History' (Through Sept. 5.) This exhibition's visceral photographs of homeless people in Ukraine are not for the squeamish. The 19 photos, large-format examples from a series of more than 400 images produced in the late 1990s, portray people in grungy rooms or in wintery outdoor sites naked or pulling aside their clothes to expose parts of their bodies. Thus Mr. Mikhailov protests a society that allows people to fall into such substandard states and conditions. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20110609
Neue Galerie: 'Vienna 1900: Style and Identity' (Through June 27.) One of history's more fraught fin-de-siecle efflorescences of art and thought is recounted in a shifting kaleidoscope of paintings, drawings, architectural models, posters and several species of decorative arts. Among paintings by Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, there is also a re-creation of Freud's psychoanalytic couch, an eye-popping tribute to the Vienna Secession and a crowded face-off between the designer-theoreticians Josef Hoffmann and Adolf Loos. Over all, it resembles a tasting menu with enough rich and disparate flavors that the gaps and omissions can be overlooked. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.com. (Smith)20110609
- New Museum: 'Lynda Benglis' (Through June 19.) This startlingly excellent resurrection of the prescient Post-Minimalist renegade and her gaudy, multidexterous, often gender-bending segues among Process, Performance and Body Art is long overdue. Carefully chosen, it includes her notorious 1974 Artforum ad, but it gives pride of place to her equally flamboyant, if abstract, evocations of the body in pigmented wax, latex and polyurethane foam. Taking tips from Pollock, these works combine the dancer and the dance, unleash painting into real space and mock the less colorful efforts of her mostly masculine contemporaries. The through line: feminist intuition, formalist excess and a reckless disregard for art-world standards and practices. Bravo. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20110609
New Museum: 'Apichatpong Weerasethakul: Primitive' (Through July 3.) Focusing on teenage boys in rural Thailand, the celebrated Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul has produced an expansive, multiscreen video installation that is, by turns, beautiful, tedious, opaque and affectingly poetic. With the patience-testing style we've come to expect of avant-garde moviemaking, ''Primitive'' revolves around the playful construction of a time-traveling spaceship by village youths. The obliquely invoked background is a half-century of war and civil strife that has taken the lives of countless young men in Southeast Asia. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110609
- Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture: 'Soulful Stitching: Patchwork Quilts by Africans (Siddis) of India' (Through June 30.) The 15 brilliant contemporary quilts in this show were made by women of the Siddi ethnic group, descendants of early African migrants to South Asia, including slaves brought by Portuguese colonists in the 16th century. Strips and patches of recycled cloth -- solid-colored, patterned or shot through with glittery threads -- are the basic components. Together the results look like a spring garden in bloom. New York Public Library, 515 Lenox Avenue, at 135th Street, Hamilton Heights , nypl.org. (Cotter)20110609
Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian: 'A Song for the Horse Nation' (Through July 7.) Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing, beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navajo, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20110609
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Cory Arcangel: Pro Tools' (Through Sept. 11.) This solo turn from Mr. Arcangel, the digital wunderkind, artist-musician and inveterate hacker, seems a trifle scrubbed clean, sanitized and austere. Containing work almost entirely from 2011, it tells us little of his funkier early digital efforts or artistic development. A few pieces reflect his longstanding interest in television and video games; in others he tries too hard to establish his formalist bona fides with wry riffs on abstract painting and sculpture. Mr. Arcangel seems guided by a somewhat callow faith in the avant-garde, striving to perpetuate its tradition, dating from Duchamp, of laying claim to new areas of nonart for art's sake. Sometimes he succeeds, but not always. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20110609
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Breaking Ground: The Whitney's Founding Collection' (Through Sept. 18.) In anticipation of its move to a new home in 2015, the Whitney is cooking up a series of six back-to-back experimental permanent collection shows at its present location. The first of them is a sampler of the earliest work in the holdings, and as a summary of the institution's initial view of American Modernism, what a curious thing it is. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20110609
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Singular Visions' (Continuing.) With its ''one artwork per room'' rule, ''Singular Visions'' is a refreshing departure from the typical collection sampler. The show's work includes pieces by A A Bronson, Sarah Charlesworth, Robert Grosvenor, Eva Hesse, Edward Kienholz and Georgia O'Keeffe; some rooms are more intriguing than others, but on the whole the show feels like a necessary experiment. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20110609
Galleries: Uptown
- Eric Fischl: 'Early Paintings' (Through June 18.) Mr. Fischl produced some psychologically astounding paintings in the early 1980s. Made with a loose, expressionist touch on medium-large canvases, his emotionally raw, semi-photorealist images of adolescent Oedipal confusion still project a dreamy, penetrating acidity. ''Sleepwalker'' (1979) pictures a skinny, naked boy standing in the shin-deep water of an aqua plastic pool hunched over and masturbating in a suburban backyard. It is a classic. Skarstedt, 20 East 79th Street , (212) 737-2060, skarstedt.com. (Johnson)20110609
Sean Landers: 'A Midnight Modern Conversation' (Through June 18.) This 1996 series of canvases, never before exhibited in New York, show the artist abandoning his diaristic text paintings for the first time and pursuing his boys-will-be-boys ruminations by redoing William Hogarth's 1732 painting of debauched drinkers. His tributes have a wonderful gaucherie, but the real revelations here -- as paintings and as human drama -- are eight smaller, ancillary works featuring British Redcoats. In them, nature, women and death enter the picture, along with some wonderfully shimmering, slurry surfaces. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 118 East 64th Street , (212) 680-9889, marianneboeskygallery.com. (Smith)20110609
'Soutine/Bacon' (Through June 18.) This intense show pairs still lifes, landscapes and portraits by Chaim Soutine (1893-1943) and Francis Bacon (1909-92). The two shared an appetite for viscera and a zest for reinterpreting the masters, but Soutine is the stronger voice here; standouts include the Tate's ''Landscape at Ceret (The Storm),'' a crackling mass of thunderheads that anticipates Pollock and de Kooning, and a glistening ''Still Life With Ray Fish,'' made in homage to Chardin's ''Skate.'' Helly Nahmad Gallery, 975 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street , (212) 879-2075, hellynahmadgallery.com. (Rosenberg)20110609
'John Storrs' (Through June 30.) This exhibition, by emphasizing relatively realistic works, complements the illuminating survey of the American sculptor John Storrs (1885-1956) -- best known for his Deco-ish evocations of abstracted skyscrapers -- at New York University's Grey Art Gallery. The works here include figures, portrait busts and terra cotta reliefs, as well as an array of wood-cuts, drawings and a few paintings; they present a softer, more personal side of Storrs's sensibility. Meredith Ward Fine Art, 44 East 74th Street , (212) 744-7306, meredithwardfineart.com. (Smith)20110609
Galleries: 57th Street
'Decadence and Decay: Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, George Grosz' (Through June 24.) This seductively titled show of 65 works by these three Weimar-era luminaries complements the Museum of Modern Art's current show of German Expressionist prints. Dix is the standout, with Neue Sachlichkeit portrait drawings that make figures look both vulnerable and monstrous. Also here are prints from his 1924 cycle ''The War,'' which can be seen at MoMA in its terrifying entirety. Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 245-6734, gseart.com. (Rosenberg)20110609
Galleries: Chelsea
Cao Fei: 'Play Time' (Through June 25.) In the last couple of years the Beijing-based artist Cao Fei has been building eerie simulacrums of modern Chinese society within virtual-reality games. But in her latest show she works in real space, with all its complexities and restrictions, and engages older forms of entertainment and fantasy. Her photographs and videos are now populated by shadow puppets, skateboarders and children's television characters instead of avatars. In the context of China's crackdown on cultural expression, Ms. Cao's juvenilia seems to express a longing for some basic adult freedoms.

- John Chamberlain: 'New Sculpture' (Through July 8.) In some of the largest works of his career, this venerable American sculptor uses his signature materials -- crushed car bodies and fenders -- with tremendous compositional variety, verve and his usual unerring color sense. Variously comical, stately, architectural and gestural, these pieces erupt from the gallery's expansive concrete floors like unusually well-shaped mesas, creating an exhilarating indoor landscape. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street , (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Smith)20110609
John Divola: 'Trees for the Forest' (Through June 18.) This mini-survey of John Divola, a Los Angeles-based conceptual photographer, reveals the depth and diversity of that city's art scene. Early shots of artistic interventions in vandalized homes have an experimental, Man Ray-meets-Gordon Matta-Clark aesthetic; other works recall Bruce Nauman and Bas Jan Ader. Wallspace, 619 West 27th Street , (212) 594-9478, wallspacegallery.com. (Rosenberg)20110609
- Mark Grotjahn: 'Nine Faces' (Through June 25.) Full of thatches of thrashing, live-wire lines made with a surprisingly methodical palette-knife technique, Mr. Grotjahn's newest paintings are harsh, elegant things that enthrall the eye and splinter the mind. Ellipses and circles tumble about among the lines, intimating fractured features and calling attention to the nominal masklike faces of early Picasso and Matisse, Jawlensky and Brancusi. Altogether, they emphasize painting as a psychic and bodily process, fueled in part by the devouring and digesting of previous art to formulate a new synthesis. Anton Kern Gallery, 532 West 20th Street , (212) 367-9663, antonkerngallery.com. (Smith)20110609
- Jasper Johns: 'New Sculpture and Works on Paper' (Through July 1.) The centerpiece of this pleasantly miscellaneous show is a large cast-aluminum relief and six smaller two-sided ones in cast bronze and silver, which put grids of the numbers zero through nine through elaborate variations in texture, legibility and suggestion. Among the artist's first cast-metal objects in some years, they exemplify his trenchant recycling of motifs and clarify his tendency to conflate aspects of printing, painting and sculpture (and collage). Their mesmerizing combination of lapidary detail and casual process reveals the intensity of Mr. Johns's mind with unusual clarity. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street , (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Smith)20110609
- 'Donald Judd' (Through June 25.) Nine large silvery, seemingly identical floor boxes, all open at the top, turn out to have markedly different and expansive interiors, articulated by various vertical divisions and planes of colors. These wells of space and color exemplify Judd's frequent use of surprise to create suspense and clarity; they also reflect his origins in painting and his lifelong admiration for the simple forms and strong colors of painters like Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Josef Albers. David Zwirner, 525 and 533 West 19th Street , (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Smith)20110609
Sean Landers: 'Around the World Alone' (Through June 25.) Mr. Landers's latest paintings avoid both his confessional texts and art-historical style-mongering, opting for sea captains in full clown makeup (red noses, hair and beards) at the wheels of old sailing ships. A flinty, restrained realism and startling immediacy distinguishes both the figures and the expanses of rolling seas and dramatic skies. The lonely-clown-as-man-against-the-elements theme may amount to a double and thus self-canceling triteness. In any event, Mr. Landers's recurring theme -- the bane of maleness -- gains in maturity here, along with a marvelous sense of light and space. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 537 West 22nd Street , (212) 680-9467, petzel.com. (Smith)20110609
Sol LeWitt: 'Arcs and Lines' (Through July 1.) This extraordinary show features three gridded wall drawings by the eminent Conceptual-Minimalist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), most prominently the airy and ebullient ''Wall Drawing #122'' from 1972, a spare work in blue crayon that wraps almost perfectly around the gallery's large central space. Featuring combinations of two straight, wavy, curved or broken lines in each compartment of the grid, its vaulting composition evokes Matisse's blue nudes, brisk Alpine views and even the blinking sweep of a radar screen, exemplifying both the economy and rich suggestiveness of LeWitt's art. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street , (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)20110609
- Picasso and Marie-Therese: 'L'Amour Fou' (Through June 25.) While falling short of the exhibition of late Picasso paintings and prints that filled this space two years ago, the latest Gagosian exegesis into Picasso land is a wonderfully motley, almost scattershot affair, brilliantly installed. It presents works, in all mediums and several styles, that Picasso made during the late 1920s and '30s, when he was under the spell of the voluptuous, Roman-nosed, level-eyed, full-limbed Marie-Therese Walter, arguably the love of his life. Anchored by this single if perpetually mutating subject, the art on hand confirms that when Picasso told Walter she had saved his life, he meant that she had also saved his art. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street , (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)20110609
Tobias Putrih: 'When Language Goes on a Holiday' (Through June 25.) The latest from this Slovenian artist is a flexible system of thin, mostly hexagonal, perforated sheets of black aluminum that can be bolted together any number of ways. Here they yield abstract sculpture, partitions (some used for displaying chair designs by the early modern Swedish designer Erik Gunnar Asplund) and furniture. A mordant yet genuine utopianism results. Meulensteen, 511 West 22nd Street , (212) 633-6999, meulensteen.com. (Smith)20110609
- Jo Ractliffe: 'Terras do Fim do Mundo (The Lands of the End of the World)' (Through July 15.) At first glance, this South African photographer's black-and-white shots of sun-baked Angolan landscapes look random and bland: rocks, dirt, scrubby trees; some handwritten signs but no people. Only when you read some of the titles -- ''Mass Grave at Cassinga,'' ''Minefield Near Mupa''-- do you learn where people are, or once were, and the pictures snap into expressive focus. The Walther Collection Project Space, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 718 , (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)20110609
- Vladimir Tatlin: 'Monument to the Third InternAtional' (Through July 30.) Concocted by a founder of Russian Constructivism between 1915 and 1920, following close encounters with the Eiffel Tower and Picasso's guitar constructions in Paris, this tilting, spiraling, viaduct-like structure is one of early Modernism's most ambitious and best-known works of unrealized architecture, embodied by one of its biggest architectural models. Shown in the United States for the first time -- the oldest (1967) remake of the original model, which disappeared around 1932 -- it is dense with portents of 20th-century sculpture to come, from LeWitt's grids to Smithson's jetty. Tony Shafrazi, 544 West 26th Street , (212) 274-9300, tonyshafrazigallery.com. (Smith)20110609
Richard Tuttle: 'What's the Wind' (Through July 22.) Working quite a bit larger than usual, this Post-Minimalist master of seeming trifles presents a series of deftly cobbled-together thingamajigs that charm and challenge. Each presents a kind of stage-set-like open volume of sculptural events patched together from colorful, lightweight materials and objects. The result is a somewhat slovenly, art-supplies Constructivism that is characteristically light, ephemeral and full of joy. Pace Gallery, 510 West 25th Street , (212) 255-4044, thepacegallery.com. (Smith)20110609
- Gillian Wearing: 'People' (Through June 24.) This British artist's first New York show in eight years more than makes up for lost time. In three very different video works, she relentlessly tests the limits of what might be called narrated portraiture, coaxing forth unstated feelings and scarring experiences or, in one instance, reviewing several decades of snapshot styles to recast a demurely resentful life story. She also eerily re-enacts three famous portraits of famous photographers using her signature custom-made rubber masks and ventures into three dimensions with two small statues that pay tribute to everyday heroes. Life daunts, but the living persist. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street , (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com. (Smith)20110609
Galleries: SoHo
- Alvin Baltrop: 'Photographs 1965-2003' (Through June 18.) All but unknown in his lifetime, the photographer Alvin Baltrop (1948-2004) focused much of his energy on documenting the illicit erotic and aesthetic life on abandoned shipping piers along the West Side of Manhattan in the 1970s and '80s. Image by image the work is uneven, but there are wonderful things, and the cumulative impact is potent, not only as art produced by an exceptional eye but as a record of a turning-point moment in time, just before and after AIDS struck. Third Streaming, 10 Greene Street, second floor , (646) 370-3877, thirdstreaming.com. (Cotter)20110609
- 'Drawing and Its Double: Selections from the Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica' (Through June 24.) The drawings in this show take an unusual form: they are the designs etched by artists, using burins and acid, on metal plates from which prints (the ''double'' of the title) are made. The selection begins on a grand note with a set of 10 oddly shaped copper plates made for a 16th-century print version of Michelanglo's ''Last Judgment'' and concludes with expressionistic illustrations by the contemporary artist Paolo Canevari on the Ten Commandments. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street , (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Cotter)20110609
Galleries: Other
- 'David Adamo' (Through June 19.) This brilliant solo debut from a young New York artist now living in Berlin forms an expansive meditation on sculpture and its materials, evocations and traditional techniques, both additive and subtractive. A New England stone wall reads as a lumpy Carl Andre floor piece. An array of cedar beams evoke both Mr. Andre's early work and Brancusi's studio, but not too reverentially. Casualness alternates with bravura precision, like the trompe-l'oeil-painted plaster casts of partly eaten fruit that are strewn everywhere and form a dispersed vanitas. There's more, and the cumulative effect is refreshingly open-ended. Untitled, 30 Orchard Street, Lower East Side , (212) 608-6002, nyuntitled.com. (Smith)20110609
'Alchemy & Inquiry' (Through June 19.) Contemporary art always comes with a stunning botanical backdrop at Wave Hill, the Bronx garden and cultural center on the Hudson. And though the green-thumbed artists in this season's show -- Philip Taaffe, Fred Tomaselli and Terry Winters -- have made the rounds of Chelsea, the natural setting refreshes some of their familiar tropes. All three made work specifically for this exhibition, responding to different areas of the grounds. Wave Hill, Independence Avenue and West 249th Street, Riverdale, the Bronx , (718) 549-3200, wavehill.org. (Rosenberg)20110609
Elaine Cameron-Weir: 'without true bazaars' (Through June 18.) In this modest yet convincing debut, Minimalist simplicity, and several kinds of rectilinear form, are explored with wit, physical variety and an admirable economy of means. The works include a Persian rug dipped in indigo dye; a long, gracefully curved wood dowel covered in rolling tobacco; a scent-emitting wall piece; and best of all, ''Pedestal,'' a tall, narrow, stepped monolith tenderly worked in plaster that resembles an architectural model for a skyscraper. Ramiken Crucible, 389 Grand Street, Lower East Side , (917) 434-4245, ramikencrucible.com. (Smith)20110609
- 'Ethiopian Magic Scrolls: Talismanic Art of Ethiopia' (Through June 30.) In 2005, the London dealer Sam Fogg blew us away with an exhibition of Ethiopian Christian liturgical art. Now, in association with Milos Simovic of Elizabeth Street Fine Arts, he follows up with a show of 18th- and 19th-century painted and written scrolls that emerged from Ethiopian popular religion. And they are equally, if very differently, wondrous. Figures of warrior-saints and archangels rub shoulders with demons; talismanic designs mingle with New Testament quotations. They're all tucked away like a hidden trove in the back of a shop specializing mostly in Coney Island antiques. Elizabeth Street Fine Arts, 209 Elizabeth Street, Nolita , (212) 274-9400, elizabethstreetfinearts.com. (Cotter)20110609
- Tom Fairs: 'Drawings' (Through July 15.) You might mistake the small, town-and-country drawings in this lovely show for the works of an early 20th-century follower of Pierre Bonnard. The truth is that the British painter Tom Fairs (1925-2007) did not begin producing art full time until after his retirement from teaching at age 60. Working with soft pencils, he drew the outdoor world with an almost shocking avidity. This show, the first solo ever devoted to Fairs's work, is inspiring. KS Art, 73 Leonard Street, TriBeCa , (212) 219-9918, kerryschuss.com. (Johnson)20110609
'Hilary Harnischfeger' (Through June 19.) For her third gallery solo show in New York, this artist supplements her already robust combination of materials and mediums -- which include paper, plaster, paint and minerals -- with multicolored clay. This complicates things considerably in terms of surface, form and hue, yielding in particular a series of small, truculent, impacted, free-standing works that refuse easy categorization. Rachel Uffner Gallery, 47 Orchard Street, Lower East Side , (212) 274-0064, racheluffnergallery.com. (Smith)20110609
- David Shapiro: 'Money Is No Object' (Through June 19.) A year in the life of the artist David Shapiro is almost identical to a year in the life of a good many other striving, middle-class New York art-worldings. At least that's the conclusion to be drawn from his minutely detailed, virtuosically executed, personal inventory of a solo show. It consists of every bill and receipt he received during the calendar year 2010, but all presented in hand-drawn and painted form on 12 long paper scrolls. Sue Scott Gallery, 1 Rivington Street, Lower East Side , (212) 358-8767, suescottgallery.com. (Cotter)20110609
John Storrs: 'Machine-Age Modernist' (Through July 9.) The Chicago-born artist John Storrs (1885-1956) compacted utopian, machine-age dreaming into Cubist-Art Deco-style sculptures resembling pieces of architectural ornament and models of skyscrapers. There is nothing quite like his dense, carefully wrought stone and metal sculptures in early American -- or European, for that matter -- Modernism, and this finely tuned show gives a good account of his progress from the late '10s to the early '30s. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East , (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)20110609
Public Art
'Mark di Suvero at Governors Island: Presented by Storm King Art Center' (Through Sept. 25.) With 11 works spanning more than three decades, this show organized by Storm King Art Center, the 500-acre sculpture park in the Hudson Valley, is Mark di Suvero's biggest New York City survey since 1975. The all-outdoor exhibition works alongside the island's packed calendar of activities and festivals, offering bike riders and picnickers culture by osmosis. Plan to spend some time along the island's southern end, where four of Mr. di Suvero's best sculptures engage the waterfront and one another in invigorating ways. Governors Island , govisland.com. (Rosenberg)20110609
Eva Rothschild: 'Empire' (Through Aug. 28.) At the southeast entrance to Central Park stands a colorful, tubular structure resembling a swing-set frame designed by spiders on LSD. Touching ground at 10 points on the cobbled plaza, its red, green and black striped posts rise at different angles into an airy web over 18 feet at its highest point. A playful riff on the ancient form of the triumphal arch, ''Empire'' will be a required photo-op for tourists and other visitors. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Central Park, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, Public Art Fund , (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Cotter)20110609
Out of Town
- Anacostia Community Museum: 'Word, Shout, Song: Lorenzo Dow Turner, Connecting Communities Through Language' (Through July 24.) Housed in a converted movie theater in a predominantly African-American neighborhood that is a cab ride's distance from the National Mall, the Anacostia Community Museum is one of Washington's cultural secrets. Its exhibition on the scholar Lorenzo Dow Turner (1890-1972), who documented surviving traces of African languages and customs in modern African-American culture, is both an archival homage and a well-paced drama of ideas. Smithsonian Institution, 1901 Fort Place SE, Washington , (202) 633-4820, anacostia.si.edu. (Cotter)20110609
- Princeton University Art Museum: 'Kurt Schwitters: Color and Collage' (Through June 26.) The German artist Kurt Schwitters, who died in 1948, is one of Modernism's true delights, though seen far less often than he deserves to be. This smallish show, his first substantial survey since the 1985 Museum of Modern Art retrospective, is made up primarily of wonderful collages spanning his career, from garrulous early examples made from the odds and ends of urban life -- tram tickets, stamps, receipts -- to the light-and-shadow late ones, done when he was in wartime exile in England and living, as he loved to be, surrounded by nature. From very first to very last, he's golden, and worth the trip to see. Princeton, N.J. , (609) 258-3788, artmuseum.princeton.edu. (Cotter)20110609
Last Chance
- 'Along the Yangzi River: Regional Culture of the Bronze Age from Hunan' (Closes on Sunday.) You walk into exhibitions in China Institute's two small galleries and you can't quite believe what you're seeing: unfamiliar examples of ancient art of a kind and quality you would otherwise have to travel deep into China itself to find. And even in China you would be hard put to see work so lucidly presented, as in this display of 60 bronze ritual vessels from the collection of the Hunan Provincial Museum in Changsha. China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street , (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org. (Cotter)20110609
Jene Highstein: 'New Sculpture: Towers and Elliptical Forms' (Closes on Thursday.) The latest from this Post-Minimalist sculptor, long interested in tacitly organic monoliths, is a series of soaring spires and relatively earthbound orbs subtly shaped in matte sandblasted (and vaguely ceramic-like) stainless steel. Together they intimate a high desert landscape, abstracted. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, Chelsea , (212) 223-2227, danese.com. (Smith)20110609
Ryoji Ikeda: 'the transfinite' (Closes on Saturday.) This huge electronic light-and-sound installation by the internationally celebrated avant-garde composer Ryoji Ikeda is spectacular, trippy and fun. Projected onto one giant wall, optically dazzling stripes on one side and fields of mathematical data on the other scroll continuously to the aggressively percussive sounds of computer-generated music. It may be more slick entertainment than high art, but for a few moments it is totally captivating. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street , (212) 616-3930, armoryonpark.org. (Johnson)20110609
- Japan Society: 'Bye Bye Kitty!!! Between Heaven and Hell in Contemporary Japanese Art' (Closes on Sunday.) This piquant exhibition of dark-minded work was conceived as a sharp counterweight to the cult of cuteness that has been Japan's dominant aesthetic for decades. No one could have known that the show's images of material fragility and decay would end up being seen in the light of real-life disaster. But such is the case, and the mood of anxiety that pervades the work of the 16 artists is more evident than it might have been otherwise. 333 East 47th Street , (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Cotter)20110609
- 'Kota Ancestors' (Closes on Saturday.) Orchestrated by the Paris dealer Bernard Dulon, this ravishing show affords a rare opportunity to study the stylistic variations and variety of Kota reliquary figures, as exemplified by 15 outstanding examples. Their large concave faces, delicately stylized features, inventive metalwork surfaces and ineffably human geometries are among the cornerstones of European Modernism, starting with Picasso's ''Demoiselles d'Avignon.'' Friedman & Vallois, 27 East 67th Street , (212) 517-3820, vallois.com. (Smith)20110609
Louise Lawler: 'Fitting at Metro Pictures' (Closes on Saturday.) These canny photographs of art in situ at museums, auction houses, galleries and collectors' homes are similar to those in Ms. Lawler's last couple of shows, but here she has tweaked the pictures' dimensions to make them strictly proportional to the gallery walls. She has also printed the adjusted images on adhesive wall stickers, enhancing the illusion of a gallery-within-a-gallery. The distortions are cleverly deployed, as are changes in scale; Ms. Lawler turns Degas's ''Little Dancer'' into a Goliath and makes good on the ''giant-size'' promise of Warhol's Brillo-box packaging. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea , (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com. (Rosenberg)20110609
Carter Mull: 'The Day's Specific Dreams' (Closes on Saturday.) Carter Mull's first solo show is part newsroom, part darkroom. His subject is the life of print, from birth to its current death throes, though like most artists, he's not an objective biographer. In his photographs and drawings, blobs of prismatic color encroach on accounts of revolution in Egypt (from the Jan. 30 and 31 issues of The New York Times) and illustrations of printing presses and writing tools from Diderot's Encyclopedia. Taxter & Spengemann, 459 West 18th Street, Chelsea , (212) 924-0212, taxterandspengemann.com. (Rosenberg)20110609
Museum of Biblical Art: 'Passion in Venice: Crivelli to Tintoretto and Veronese' (Closes on Sunday.) This fascinating exhibition presents about 60 well-chosen paintings, sculptures and objects by famous artists and unidentified artisans, all representing a major iconic image of Christendom: Jesus as the Man of Sorrows, post-Crucifixion, pre-Resurrection. Michele Giambono's 15th-century painting pictures him in anguish with bleeding palms and blood dripping from the thorns of his crown. In a late 16th-century, classicizing painting by Paolo Veronose, he slumps in the arms of an angel like a defeated athlete. Don't miss the small, wooden head of Jesus with a tiny, spring-loaded, pop-up Man of Sorrows. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street , (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)20110609
'Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of Africa' (Closing on Sunday.) ''Nubia'' takes you deep into the history of a volatile part of Africa. The show occupies just two small galleries but spans a 500-mile stretch of the Nile River Valley (now northern Sudan and southern Egypt) and more than 2,250 years (from about 3000 B.C. through 750 B.C.). Pottery, statues and funerary objects chart the dizzying power swings between Egypt and Nubia, cultures that traded goods as well as blows. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University, 15 East 84th Street , (212) 992-7800, nyu.edu/isaw. (Rosenberg)20110609
- Andy Warhol: 'Colored Campbell's Soup Cans' (Closes on Saturday.) This might be the most beautiful Andy Warhol show you'll ever see. In 1965, three years after creating his first paintings of Campbell's tomato soup cans, Warhol produced a series of 20 in a ravishing range of tropical colors. This exhibition, the first ever to focus on the series, presents 12 of them, every one a delicious piece of eye candy. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street , (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com. (Johnson)20110609
- Stephen Westfall: 'Seraphim: Paintings and works on paper' (Closes on Saturday.) While this exhibition has several abstract canvases of interest, the centerpiece is a large wall painting felicitously framed by the gallery architecture and dominated by a tipped (diamond) square, whose bold concentric bands change color at every corner. The syncopated progression of hues, which is more intuitive than systematic, creates a wonderful, jangling destabilization, warping space and confirming scale (not size) as the living energy source that it is. You would think that related works by Frank Stella and Sol LeWitt would not have left Mr. Westfall much room to move, but he proves otherwise. Lennon Weinberg Inc., 514 West 25th Street , (212) 941-0012, lennonweinberg.com. (Smith)20110609

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: ERIC FISCHL: 'EARLY PAINTINGS': (Through June 18.) Mr. Fischl produced some psychologically astounding paintings in the early 1980s, like the 1982 ''Barbeque,'' above. Made with a loose, expressionist touch on medium-large canvases, his emotionally raw, semi-photorealist images of adolescent Oedipal confusion still project a dreamy, penetrating acidity. ''Sleepwalker'' (1979) pictures a skinny, naked boy standing in the shin-deep water of an aqua plastic pool, hunched over and masturbating in a suburban backyard. It is a classic. Skarstedt, 20 East 79th Street, Manhattan, (212) 737-2060, skarstedt.com. (Ken Johnson) (PHOTOGRAPH BY PRIVATE COLLECTION, SKARSTEDT GALLERY)

HEADLINE: U.S. Hit A Record For Exports In April

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The American trade deficit shrank unexpectedly in April after the United States sold $175.6 billion in goods and services overseas, the most exports on record, the government reported on Thursday.
The Commerce Department report said that exports of goods were $126.4 billion and services $49.1 billion, while total imports were $219.2 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $43.7 billion, the lowest since December. The deficit in March was revised down to $46.8 billion from $48.2 billion, the department said.
The gap had been forecast by some economists to widen to $48.8 billion. 
In recent months, a weaker dollar has made goods from the United States less expensive overseas, while exports have also climbed in price as demand rose in developing countries.
The department said the March-to-April increase in exports of goods reflected greater sales of industrial supplies and materials, capital goods and consumer goods. The decline in imports was caused, in part, by a decrease in automotive parts, vehicles and industrial supplies and materials, the department said.
The data was the first to reflect the impact of the supply chain disruptions from the natural disasters in Japan, as well as the impact of commodity prices in April, when the average price per barrel of crude oil was $103.18. That was the highest since September 2008, when it was $107.30.
The United States imported 8.41 million barrels of crude per day on average in April, the lowest amount since last October.
Imports from Japan dropped by $3 billion, shrinking the American trade deficit with that country to $3.5 billion in April from $6 billion the month before.
The data also showed that the United States trade deficit with China continued to widen, to $21.6 billion in April from $18 billion in March, but still below January's $23 billion. The trade deficit with China was $273 billion in 2010.
Meanwhile, the Labor Department said Thursday that the number of Americans who filed initial claims for unemployment edged higher in the week ending June 3, to 427,000, up by 1,000. Economists usually interpret any level above 400,000 to mean a lack of job growth.
Economists say that domestic demand in the United States is still weak. And while the rise in exports of goods was helping to offset that weakness, exports compose only about 9.6 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
Thursday's report was the first to reflect trade statistics for the second quarter, and economists gave a range of effects from the data on their estimates for gross domestic product.
Gregory Daco, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said the trade numbers helped raise the company's estimate for real gross domestic product growth to slightly above 2 percent.
''Over all, this report was a good one for the U.S. economy,'' he said.
Kevin Logan, the chief United States economist for HSBC, said forecasts should take into account that the deficit declined mostly because of a drop in oil imports of $3.7 billion, while the non-oil trade balance actually worsened.
''Normally, an improvement in the trade balance leads to an increase in estimates of G.D.P. growth in the quarter,'' he said in a research note. ''But if the trade balance is improving because of an across-the-board drop in demand for oil products, there should be little impact on G.D.P. growth.''
Economists from Capital Economics said that they expected little contribution to second-quarter growth.
''Pretty much all of the sharp fall in the trade deficit in April will eventually be reversed as the temporary effects caused by disruptions from Japan's earthquake fade,'' the economists said in a research note.
''Nonetheless, a modest positive contribution to second-quarter G.D.P. growth may at least offset part of the slowdown in other parts of the economy.''

HEADLINE: Report on U.S. Exports Sends Shares Sharply Higher

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A report that United States exports hit a record high in April sent stocks sharply higher Thursday as investors hoped the economic recovery might not be as sluggish as suggested by the grim economic reports issued over the last week. 
The increase in exports to $175.6 billion in April could add half a percentage point or more to the government's estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product, said Anthony Chan, chief economist for JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.42 points, or 0.63 percent, to close at 12,124.36. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.44 points, or 0.74 percent, to 1,289.00. The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.49 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,684.87.
The gains ended a six-day losing streak and were the first time stocks rose in June. Stocks had dropped after poor reports on manufacturing, home sales, hiring and consumer confidence.
It was the longest losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average in more than a year and the longest for the S.& P. since February 2009.
The market's weeklong slump also made stocks appear relatively cheap, Mr. Chan said. The S.& P. 500-stock index lost 6.2 percent over the previous six days of trading.
''Markets usually swing like a pendulum,'' Mr. Chan said. ''This decline has been strong enough that you can easily justify the market taking a breath.''
The narrower trade deficit is a sign that goods from manufacturers in the United States are becoming more competitive overseas. United States companies sold more computers, heavy machinery and telecommunications equipment abroad in April compared with March. Imports declined because fewer cars were bought from Japan after factories there were damaged by an earthquake and tsunami.
Companies that make farming machinery rose after the government reported that United States corn crops would be smaller this fall. That sent corn prices soaring and raised expectations that farm owners would buy more tractors and other agricultural equipment. Deere & Company and AGCO rose 2.5 percent.
A report on claims for unemployment benefits was in line with expectations that new applications would stay about the same. The Labor Department reported that new claims edged up 1,000 to 427,000. Economists had expected a slight decline. The high level of claims still suggests that the job market is slow.
The Interpublic Group of Companies, the advertising concern, rose 6.4 percent, the most of any company in the S.& P. 500-stock index, after Moody's raised its rating on the company.
A jump in oil prices sent energy stocks higher. Energy companies in the S.& P. 500-index rose 1.2 percent. Crude rose $1.19 to settle at $101.93.
Stocks have been slipping since mid-April on concern that the nation's economy has hit a soft patch. Oil prices, Japan's tsunami and nuclear disaster and the risk that Greece might default on debt have led investors to reduce forecasts for growth in the United States this year.
Interest rates were slightly higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 14/32, to 101 3/32, and the yield rose to 3.00 percent from 2.95 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Filling Classes With Learning, Not Fears

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA and TAIMOOR SHAH; Ray Rivera reported from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan. Sangar Rahimi and Sharifullah Sahak contributed reporting from Kabul, and an employee of The New York Times from Kunduz, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Taliban insurgents are attacking fewer schools, easing the way for boys and girls to attend in larger numbers, even in largely insecure areas of the country, Afghan education officials say.
Since March 21, the beginning the Afghan calendar year, education officials have recorded 20 school-related attacks, said Gul Agha Ahmadi, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education. Attacks can include the burning of schoolhouses, kidnappings, threats, forced school closings and the killing or injuring of students or teachers. One headmaster has been killed so far.
While still gloomy, the numbers are down to an average of about eight a month, less than half the monthly average recorded by the ministry the previous two years. A United Nations-led task force on children and armed conflict recorded an average of nearly 50 attacks a month the previous two years, reflecting starkly different methods of reporting. Task force officials could not verify the numbers reported by the ministry since March, but Unicef, a task force member, confirmed that attacks were down this year, without providing specific numbers. Interviews with school administrators in some of the most volatile parts of the country also indicate a considerable decline. 
Officials and aid groups say it is too soon to know whether the decrease is a signal of a permanent shift. But the drop is a hopeful sign as the United States and Afghanistan explore peace talks with the Taliban, and may show an effort on the part of the insurgents to portray a more moderate image as those talks continue, even as violence has escalated across the country.
What accounts for the decrease -- whether improved security, a shift in Taliban philosophy or some combination of factors -- is a matter of debate. Mullah Muhammad Omar, the spiritual leader of the Taliban, is believed to have issued a decree in March forbidding his fighters to attack schools and intimidate schoolchildren. Education Ministry officials and aid groups say they welcome the decree, though none of them have ever actually seen it.
Ghulam Farooq Wardak, the minister of education, credits efforts to convince communities, their elders and their religious leaders that education is vital to the country's future.
''These are arguments that have gained a lot of momentum within the communities,'' he said. ''And the communities are in a very strong position to argue with those who are behind the closing of the schools.''
A Taliban spokesman could not be reached for comment.
Mullah Omar has supposedly issued such edicts in the past, but they appear to have gone ignored, perhaps signaling a disconnect among the far-flung and loosely affiliated insurgent groups that commonly fall under the umbrella term of the Taliban.
Child protection advocates are reacting cautiously to the fall-off in attacks, because while the numbers may be down, the attacks have not stopped. Last month, a school principal was killed just outside of Kabul, apparently for spurning insurgent demands to stop teaching girls. Some 400 schools, meanwhile, remain closed for security reasons, mainly in the southern Pashtun belt stretching from Helmand Province through Kandahar and up to Paktika Province, according to the Education Ministry.
Peter Crowley, the country representative for Unicef, which monitors school attacks, said that while there were initial indications of a decrease, ''it is too early to describe this as a trend.''
About 8.3 million children -- nearly 40 percent of them girls -- were enrolled this year, up from 7.6 million last year, officials said. But various estimates show more than 4 million school-age children still not in classrooms for a variety of economic, social and security reasons.
Even before Mullah Omar was reported to have made his March decree, insurgents were singling out fewer schools and sending out fewer ''night letters,'' the threatening notices the Taliban often paste to school doors ordering the schools closed or dictating the curriculum, officials said.
''Since the inception of the school year we have not had any threats or attacks,'' said Muhammad Qasam Popal, provincial director of education in the southern province of Oruzgan. The school year begins in September. The apparent cease-fire on schools, if there is one, has allowed officials there to reopen schools in volatile districts like Shahid Ehsas, Gizab and Dehrawoot, Mr. Qasam said.
In Helmand Province, one of the most violent in the country, people are now donating land to build schools, buoyed by the belief that the Taliban will not object, said Muhammad Naseem Safai, director of the Helmand Education Department. ''We've opened 50 new schools across Helmand this school year, especially in those volatile districts,'' he said. Twenty of the schools were built on donated land, he added.
Parents are also worrying less.
''When I heard about this announcement I felt relieved, really relieved,'' said Khali Ahmad, who owns a stationery shop in Kandahar and has two sons and a daughter in school. ''The danger and threats I felt for my children in school were removed from my mind at once.''
Sayed Ruhullah Agha, provincial deputy for education for Kandahar Province, said that sentiment was felt across the province.
''It actually had a positive effect throughout the Kandahar population,'' Mr. Agha said. ''Since issuing the decree, we haven't experienced any attacks against schools, like burning them down or bombing them.''
The decrease in attacks is notable in Kandahar, which had become notorious for attacks on schools, and girls' schools in particular. One of the most horrific happened on Nov. 12, 2008, when men on motorcycles sprayed girls and teachers with acid as they walked to a girls' school. The men hit 11 girls and 4 teachers, sending 6 to the hospital and leaving many of them with lifelong scars.
Banning girls from school was one of the more infamous symbols of the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001. More recently, thousands of young men waving Taliban flags and shouting slogans honoring Mullah Omar rampaged through Kandahar. The protests, in early April, erupted after a Florida pastor burned a Koran, but among the buildings the rioters singled out was the Zarghona Ana High School For Girls, setting it ablaze while the students hid in the bathroom.
And on Wednesday, about 30 men claiming to be arbeki, a traditional form of a village defense force, stormed a school for girls in the northern city of Kunduz, assaulting the headmaster and the principal with the butts of their rifles, said Mohammad Zahir Nazam, head of the Kunduz Education Department. Both men were left in a coma, Mr. Nazam said. But neither this attack nor the Kandahar riot could be strictly attributed to the Taliban.
Mr. Nazam said the attackers in Kunduz were trying to collect taxes from residents when the headmaster and the principal objected, prompting the militia group to attack them.
Whether the Taliban has slowed its attacks out of consideration of the peace process or in an effort to fortify support among the population is an open question. Of one thing Mr. Ahmadi, the ministry spokesman, feels certain:
''If the Taliban wants to close a school in this country, they can do it,'' he said. ''But they are not doing it, and it proves they don't want to.''

HEADLINE: Ford Cancels Minivan Plan For Hybrids And Plug-Ins

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich. -- The Ford Motor Company has canceled plans to re-enter the minivan market in the United States. Instead, Ford said on Thursday that it would introduce a smaller, five-passenger hatchback version of the minivan that it was going to build and offer it only as either a hybrid or plug-in hybrid.
The car, called the C-Max, would be Ford's first hybrid-only model in North America, in the same way that the Toyota Prius is offered only as a hybrid. 
In addition, Ford said it intended to triple its production capacity for hybrid and electric cars in North America so that it could build more than 100,000 of them annually by 2013. The increase will add 220 jobs in Michigan, Ford said.
James D. Farley Jr., Ford's group vice president for global marketing, sales and service, said the carmaker was planning for a future in which fuel efficiency remained a high priority for consumers.
''Customers have really changed in the last 120 days,'' Mr. Farley told reporters at a transmission plant north of Detroit. ''People are so focused on fuel economy.''
Ford officials said the C-Max hatchback presented a stronger business case than the gasoline-powered, seven-passenger Grand C-Max that it planned to import from Europe. Ford now sells C-Max hatchbacks and minivans in Europe, in gasoline and diesel varieties, and said demand for the five-passenger version had doubled there this year.
The C-Max now scheduled to go on sale in the United States will be built in suburban Detroit, alongside the similarly sized Focus compact car, which is available now with a traditional engine and will be sold as a battery-powered car starting later this year.
Rather than fight for a share of the small but somewhat resurgent minivan market, Ford is using the C-Max to take aim at the Prius and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid built by General Motors.
Aaron Bragman, an analyst with the research firm IHS Automotive, said automakers were being forced to put more emphasis on hybrids by stricter federal mileage requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE.
''These powertrains are going to have to become ubiquitous in order to meet the new CAFE regulations,'' Mr. Bragman said.
Ford declined to provide detailed specifications about the C-Max, but Mr. Bragman said he expected the plug-in version, called the Energi, to compare favorably to the Volt, which G.M. introduced late last year. The C-Max Energi will operate in a similar fashion as the Volt by allowing users to connect it to an electrical outlet or high-voltage charging station. It will run first solely on battery power before using any gasoline.
Mr. Farley said the C-Max Energi would be ''fully competitive'' with the Volt and would travel 500 miles on a full charge and tank of gas. The Volt has a combined range of about 379 miles, including 35 miles on the battery alone, according to its Environmental Protection Agency label.
Mr. Farley would not give a battery-only range for the C-Max, which has space for three passengers in the back seat. The Volt can fit only two passengers because its battery protrudes where the middle seat would be.
Mr. Bragman said Ford was likely to sell the C-Max for considerably less than the Volt because it is using a lot of common parts. The Volt has a sticker price of about $41,000, before a $7,500 federal tax credit.

HEADLINE: Anxiety in Connecticut as Suburb Ponders the Loss of Its Biggest Employer

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH MAKER

 BODY:
STAMFORD, Conn. -- Dino Sakakini, owner of a restaurant here called Layla's Falafel, surveyed the dinner crowd on Wednesday night and sighed. Many of his patrons were still wearing security badges from the nearby headquarters of UBS, the Swiss banking giant, and Mr. Sakakini was contemplating what might happen to his business if, as now seems quite likely, UBS moves its sprawling trading floor to Manhattan.
''Stamford will be crushed,'' he said. ''Plain and simple. We'll become a ghost town.'' 
Merchants and government officials across this city expressed similar anxiety upon hearing the news that UBS, which settled here after abandoning Manhattan in the 1990s, was having misgivings and planned on returning to New York. UBS is Stamford's largest employer and taxpayer.
''It just doesn't make any sense,'' said Danny Ryan, a bartender and server at Morton's The Steakhouse, which is alongside the gleaming 700,000-square-foot UBS building. ''Why would they build this stunning building with the biggest trading floor in the world, and then leave?''
UBS employees seemed divided on the subject of the possible move, depending on its effect on their commutes.
''I live in Manhattan, so I do the reverse commute,'' said Jon Gimpel, an engineering director, who was lining up with his colleagues at The Cellar, a beer and wine store at the Stamford Transportation Center, before boarding the train with his bike.
''The train ride is like 45 minutes, then I ride my bike through Central Park to get home,'' Mr. Gimpel said. ''If UBS moves back to Manhattan, I'll save $300 a month in train fare and major aggravation. Awesome.''
Peter Charpentier, who says he sells ''a whole lot'' of brown-bagged bottles of liquor to UBS employees every evening, said: ''The State of Connecticut should be begging them to stay. I'm a man who believes in trickle-down economics. You take away UBS and it affects everything and everybody. What happens to all the restaurants? How about the window washers? The elevator operators? The janitors, the gardeners? It would be disastrous.''
UBS is currently negotiating for space at 3 World Trade Center, an 80-story office tower planned for Lower Manhattan, and Mr. Charpentier wondered why anyone would want to move there.
''You couldn't pay me to work at a World Trade Center tower,'' he said. ''Have they forgotten about 9/11?''
A UBS trader from nearby Ridgefield was also glum as he waited on his train. ''I moved up here from New York City 16 years ago because of UBS,'' said the trader, who would not give his name. ''They were relocating, so I said, O.K., here we go. I met my wife, we have a family; there's no way I'm moving them to the city.''
Real estate brokers who have spoken with UBS executives say the company is considering moving its trading floor, and thousands of employees, back to Manhattan in part because it has come to realize it is more difficult to recruit talented people in their 20s to work in the suburbs. Stamford is about 35 miles northeast of Midtown.
A UBS spokesman, Christiaan Brakman, said the company had already transferred some of its employees to Manhattan, though he emphasized that the firm would continue to have a presence in Stamford, though a smaller one. He said the number of employees in Stamford had already dropped to 3,000, from 4,000 two years ago.
''Even if we do move the headquarters, we could still be keeping a strong base in Stamford,'' he said. ''We just don't know yet.''
State and city officials have vowed to keep UBS in Connecticut, though they seemed bewildered by the recent turn of events.
''Frankly, it's hard to give an honest comment when we don't know what's going on,'' said Laure Aubuchon, the city's economic development director. ''Is UBS leaving altogether? Are they moving the headquarters and leaving some people here? Is this all just a fire drill, and at the end of the day, they're not only not leaving, but bringing in more employees? We're operating on the premise that they're going to stay, and we're making them feel as loved and important as they are.''
Back at Layla's Falafel, some UBS employees were taking the move in stride. One trader, who declined to give his full name, was sipping a beer at an outdoor table. ''What's the big deal?'' he said. ''So we move out, and a nice big Costco moves in. Life goes on.''

HEADLINE: During Rare Presidential Visit to Puerto Rico, Obama to Face Issues Other Than Statehood

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
SAN JUAN, P. R. -- When President Obama arrives here on Tuesday -- becoming the first American leader to visit officially since John F. Kennedy in 1961 -- his feet will be planted firmly in San Juan's historic district but his words will be aimed mostly at Puerto Ricans in Florida, New York and Pennsylvania.
Not that there is anything wrong with that, many Puerto Ricans say. After five decades of cold shoulders from a succession of presidents, most Puerto Ricans are primed for a presidential visit, even if it is brief and unlikely to sway the longstanding debate over Puerto Rico's identity as a United States territory.
Here the short-term benefits of the visit are already evident: Spanish colonial buildings, including the governor's residence, boast new paint, a major highway is pothole free (although not without causing major traffic jams and epic grousing), statues gleam after rounds of polish and rusty old signs have been dutifully replaced. 
On his whirlwind stop, the president is expected to meet with Puerto Rico's governor, Luis Fortuno, a Republican who supports statehood, attend a business round table, deliver a speech in Old San Juan and attend a quick fund-raising event. He will also encounter a throng of ''Obama Go Home'' protesters -- Puerto Ricans who want the island to break free of United States control.
Other presidents have visited since 1961 but only on business unrelated to Puerto Rico. President Gerald R. Ford visited the island in 1976 to address the Group of Seven economic summit, and President Lyndon B. Johnson stopped at a military base in Aguadilla in 1968.
''This is huge,'' said Pedro R. Pierluisi, a Democrat and Puerto Rico's nonvoting representative in Congress. ''No president has been here in 50 years. It tells the world that he cares about Puerto Rico.''
''Some say he is coming here with political motivations,'' said Mr. Pierluisi, who sat outside a local Starbucks. ''I say, 'So what?' Presidents should care about us and come down here and familiarize themselves with our issues. It should be so. We should be treated fairly and responsibly.''
Mr. Obama will arrive at a vulnerable time for this Caribbean island of 3.7 million people. Hit hard by a recession that began here in 2006, Puerto Rico has an unemployment rate that remains stubbornly high, 16.2 percent in April, compared with 9 percent on the mainland. The island has also been rocked by a sky-high murder rate, much of it related to the drug trade, which has led to widespread anxiety.
Being careful to keep expectations in check, Puerto Ricans say they are nevertheless hopeful that Mr. Obama will speak about the economy and crime and make mention of Puerto Rico's longstanding identity crisis regarding its political status. Few Puerto Ricans have forgotten that when Mr. Obama came here twice to campaign during the primary against Hillary Rodham Clinton (he lost), he promised to return to the island as president and to resolve Puerto Rico's status during his first term.
About half of Puerto Ricans here advocate statehood. The other half are satisfied, more or less, with Puerto Rico being a commonwealth, mostly because they are concerned about keeping its cultural identity intact. A minority would like independence.
As members of a commonwealth, Puerto Ricans hold American citizenship and can be drafted. But the territory has no voting representative in Congress. And while Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico can vote in a primary, they cannot do so in a general presidential election. That privilege is reserved for Puerto Ricans in the United States.
Mr. Obama has tried to hew to his pledge regarding the island's political status. The President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status issued a report in March recommending that the island hold another plebiscite, actually two plebiscites, by the end of 2012. The first would ask whether Puerto Rico should be independent or part of the United States; the second one would narrow the options further.
The hope is that one position will garner a majority of votes, which has not happened with the two previous referendums. Mr. Fortuno, in the midst of drafting the first plebiscite, already faces charges that he is purposely sidelining commonwealth supporters.
Traditionally, American presidents have been loath to immerse themselves in the treacherous question of Puerto Rican status and prefer to take a neutral, do-no-harm stance.
''But President Obama will have to include some ideas on what is going on in that matter because his task force addressed it,'' said Angel Rosa, a political science professor at the University of Puerto Rico's Mayaguez campus and a radio talk show host on WKAQ. ''If he doesn't do it, it will represent a departure from his own public policy and his own administration.''
Mr. Obama also must keep a close eye on Puerto Ricans living on the mainland. Puerto Rico's economic crisis has tilted the population away from the Caribbean island and toward the mainland, a reality that Mr. Obama will be keenly aware of as he arrives here. There are now more Puerto Ricans living in the United States than in Puerto Rico; 4.6 million reside in the United States and 3.7 million on the island, according to the 2010 census.
There was a particularly large population jump in Central Florida, especially in the Orlando and Tampa area. They now number 848,000, second only to the Puerto Rican population in New York. What's more, many of the Puerto Ricans who have settled in Florida in the past decade are from the well-educated or professional middle class, a departure from those who set down roots in New York decades ago.
Politically, many more of them favor statehood for Puerto Rico than in New York. And unlike Puerto Ricans in the Northeast, they are not avowed Democrats. This has turned them into pivotal swing voters in a crucial swing state.
Andres W. Lopez, a lawyer in Puerto Rico and a member of the finance committee of the Democratic National Committee who has helped arrange Mr. Obama's visits to Puerto Rico, said the president wanted to make good on his vow to return here and is well-versed on the island's current troubles.
He said Mr. Obama also understands the importance of the Puerto Rican vote. Puerto Ricans in the United States care deeply about matters on the island and a visit here reinforces the president's commitment.
''It's a clear political reality that Puerto Ricans as a group are becoming more and more of a burgeoning force on the mainland,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''For the first time you have more Puerto Ricans living outside of Puerto Rico, by a lot. It's at a tipping point. And the issues that matter to Puerto Ricans include, of course, Puerto Rico so Puerto Rico is going to take on heightened importance.''
As workers moved urgently to beautify patches of Old San Juan and the government completed plans for the visit, Puerto Ricans, who pushed for a day off of work on Tuesday but failed, are mostly optimistic about the visit. Some would love for the president to be a more forceful advocate for statehood.
''Our children have fought in these wars and died,'' said Miguel Angel Rivera, 65, a retired government worker who said he expects Mr. Obama to go home with a ''little suitcase of money'' for his re-election campaign. ''We want to be citizens but not second-class citizens. We want to feel complete.''
Just a few steps away on the Plaza de Armas in Old San Juan, Jorge Sierra, a 58-year-old publicist working on his laptop, wanted just the opposite.
''I don't want him to come,'' Mr. Sierra said. ''I don't agree with his politics or how he treats Puerto Rico as a colony. I'll be out there demonstrating.''
What most people here really want, though, is work, better schools and a sense of safety on the streets.
''What Puerto Ricans would like Obama to talk about is not political status; that is an issue for the political parties and the political class,'' Mr. Rosa said. ''Ordinary Puerto Ricans would like him to talk about jobs and crime. That is not different from the mainland. Basically, it's the same problems.''

HEADLINE: Cultivating a Prince To Coax an Ally to Change

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the Arab Spring grinds into summer, President Obama has turned on repressive Arab governments in different ways and at different speeds. He broke quickly with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and more reluctantly with Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He slapped sanctions on Bashar al-Assad of Syria and has encouraged a Saudi-led effort to ease Ali Abdullah Saleh out of Yemen.
Only in the case of Bahrain has Mr. Obama kept out the welcome mat -- prodding, cajoling and exhorting members of its royal family to ease a crackdown that crushed peaceful protesters demanding democratic change. In particular, the administration has cultivated Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, the 41-year-old heir to the throne who graduated from American University in Washington and speaks English like someone from the mid-Atlantic region. 
On Thursday, Prince Salman met Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., completing a high-level tour that included a White House meeting Tuesday with President Obama and his national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon. He also paid a call to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who said the United States supported ''the kinds of important work that the crown prince has been doing in his nation.''
The prince, who is considered the most moderate member of his family, has been assigned to lead whatever dialogue there is with the opposition. But this is the same Sunni monarchy that imposed martial law to silence the demands of the mostly Shiite opposition. It also allowed the deployment of Saudi troops as part of a campaign to stop further protests, which has included widespread arrests, detentions and, most recently, the trials of 47 doctors and nurses who treated injured demonstrators.
Given Mr. Obama's lofty rhetoric about the historic significance of the uprisings in the Arab world, why engage with a royal family that has led such a brutal crackdown?
Partly it is an acknowledgment of geopolitical reality. Bahrain's royal family is unlikely to topple, if only because the Sunnis who rule Saudi Arabia will not tolerate their neighbor being run by a Shiite-led government. Bahrain is also home to the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet. And it is close to Saudi Arabia, Washington's most powerful ally in the region.
So administration officials are clinging to the hope that, perhaps against the odds, Bahrain's leaders -- or at least the crown prince -- may be willing to undertake democratic changes.
''You have somebody in the crown prince who's credible, who seems to want to do the right thing,'' said one senior administration official. But, as another administration official put it, ''It's not as if we have that many choices about who to talk to about promoting a dialogue.''
Even before the uprisings, the United States looked to Prince Salman. In a diplomatic cable sent by the American Embassy in Bahrain in late 2009, and made public by WikiLeaks, he was described as ''very Western in his approach'' and ''closely identified with the reformist camp in the royal family -- particularly with respect to economic and labor reforms designed to combat corruption and modernize Bahrain's economic base.''
But several analysts warn that even if Prince Salman is sincere, he is only one member of a family that includes hard-liners like his uncle, Prince Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, the long-serving prime minister. With his mild manner and fluent English, Prince Salman may be merely the monarchy's friendly face, skeptical analysts say.
The prince is on ''a world tour to convince people that Bahrain is turning over a new leaf when in fact the hard-liners are conducting business-as-usual at home,'' said Leslie Campbell, regional director for the Middle East and North Africa at the National Democratic Institute, which is active in Bahrain.
State Department officials are alarmed that in recent weeks Bahrain's state-owned media mounted a virulent anti-American campaign against the embassy, accusing it of colluding with Shiite groups. An American diplomat involved in human rights issues recently left Bahrain after receiving threats, including from a blogger, who referred to the diplomat's wife as being Jewish.
Despite this, Mr. Campbell supports the outreach to the prince, saying that it makes sense to strengthen the hand of someone ''who is at least by inclination moderate and fair-minded.''
The administration, he said, should extract concrete pledges from the prince about how he plans to respond to protesters' demands for a more open society. His father, King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, recently lifted the state of emergency and announced that talks with the opposition would resume in July. But the Saudi troops who carried out the crackdown remain in the country, and some of the top opposition leaders are languishing in jail -- a fact that Mr. Obama underscored in his recent speech on the Arab upheaval. The president pressed Prince Salman about the prisoners in their meeting, an official said, but it was unclear how he responded.
The prince did express regret about how the crackdown had tarnished Bahrain's image, particularly since the government had worked so hard over the past decade to present Bahrain as an enlightened Persian Gulf kingdom. Hanging hopes for change on whether the royal family fears a public-relations disaster is a slender reed.
But in the end, Mr. Obama may have little choice because the alternative, said Tom Malinowski, the director of the Washington office of Human Rights Watch, is ''either violent upheaval or permanent repression.''

HEADLINE: Talks on Debt Limit To Heat Up Next Week

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
With time growing shorter, lawmakers and White House officials involved in budget talks tied to the debt limit said on Thursday that they would meet at least three times next week to try to close in on an agreement. 
''There's a commitment for next week that we will be engaging, once again, in a robust series of meetings to see if we can achieve a result,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader and one of two Republican lawmakers taking part in the talks.
With the Senate and House schedules out of synch in recent weeks, the meetings have been sporadic despite an Aug. 2 deadline set by the Treasury Department for raising the $14.3 trillion federal debt limit or face the prospect of the government defaulting on its financial obligations for the first time.
Last week, Speaker John A. Boehner said that while modest progress had been made in the talks presided over by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., he would like to see negotiations moving faster, with the aim of reaching a deal in the next month.
The bad economic news of recent days has also provided motivation to press ahead with the talks in order to find an agreement that could calm the unsettled markets. ''The news economically on the jobs front in the last several days underscored the importance of this meeting that we just came out of,'' Mr. Cantor told reporters.
In their two-hour meeting at the Capitol on Thursday, lawmakers, White House representatives and Treasury officials explored potential sources of new revenue that Democrats say will be essential to winning their support for any deal in the House and Senate. Officials close to the talks said the participants had at least a few more weeks of work to do.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Rule by Rentiers

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The latest economic data have dashed any hope of a quick end to America's job drought, which has already gone on so long that the average unemployed American has been out of work for almost 40 weeks. Yet there is no political will to do anything about the situation. Far from being ready to spend more on job creation, both parties agree that it's time to slash spending -- destroying jobs in the process -- with the only difference being one of degree.
Nor is the Federal Reserve riding to the rescue. On Tuesday, Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, acknowledged the grimness of the economic picture but indicated that he will do nothing about it. 
And debt relief for homeowners -- which could have done a lot to promote overall economic recovery -- has simply dropped off the agenda. The existing program for mortgage relief has been a bust, spending only a tiny fraction of the funds allocated, but there seems to be no interest in revamping and restarting the effort.
The situation is similar in Europe, but arguably even worse. In particular, the European Central Bank's hard-money, anti-debt-relief rhetoric makes Mr. Bernanke sound like William Jennings Bryan.
What lies behind this trans-Atlantic policy paralysis? I'm increasingly convinced that it's a response to interest-group pressure. Consciously or not, policy makers are catering almost exclusively to the interests of rentiers -- those who derive lots of income from assets, who lent large sums of money in the past, often unwisely, but are now being protected from loss at everyone else's expense.
Of course, that's not the way what I call the Pain Caucus makes its case. Instead, the argument against helping the unemployed is framed in terms of economic risks: Do anything to create jobs and interest rates will soar, runaway inflation will break out, and so on. But these risks keep not materializing. Interest rates remain near historic lows, while inflation outside the price of oil -- which is determined by world markets and events, not U.S. policy -- remains low.
And against these hypothetical risks one must set the reality of an economy that remains deeply depressed, at great cost both to today's workers and to our nation's future. After all, how can we expect to prosper two decades from now when millions of young graduates are, in effect, being denied the chance to get started on their careers?
Ask for a coherent theory behind the abandonment of the unemployed and you won't get an answer. Instead, members of the Pain Caucus seem to be making it up as they go along, inventing ever-changing rationales for their never-changing policy prescriptions.
While the ostensible reasons for inflicting pain keep changing, however, the policy prescriptions of the Pain Caucus all have one thing in common: They protect the interests of creditors, no matter the cost. Deficit spending could put the unemployed to work -- but it might hurt the interests of existing bondholders. More aggressive action by the Fed could help boost us out of this slump -- in fact, even Republican economists have argued that a bit of inflation might be exactly what the doctor ordered -- but deflation, not inflation, serves the interests of creditors. And, of course, there's fierce opposition to anything smacking of debt relief.
Who are these creditors I'm talking about? Not hard-working, thrifty small business owners and workers, although it serves the interests of the big players to pretend that it's all about protecting little guys who play by the rules. The reality is that both small businesses and workers are hurt far more by the weak economy than they would be by, say, modest inflation that helps promote recovery.
No, the only real beneficiaries of Pain Caucus policies (aside from the Chinese government) are the rentiers: bankers and wealthy individuals with lots of bonds in their portfolios.
And that explains why creditor interests bulk so large in policy; not only is this the class that makes big campaign contributions, it's the class that has personal access to policy makers -- many of whom go to work for these people when they exit government through the revolving door. The process of influence doesn't have to involve raw corruption (although that happens, too). All it requires is the tendency to assume that what's good for the people you hang out with, the people who seem so impressive in meetings -- hey, they're rich, they're smart, and they have great tailors -- must be good for the economy as a whole.
But the reality is just the opposite: creditor-friendly policies are crippling the economy. This is a negative-sum game, in which the attempt to protect the rentiers from any losses is inflicting much larger losses on everyone else. And the only way to get a real recovery is to stop playing that game.

HEADLINE: Struggling College Graduates

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Despite what you read, they often end up doing O.K.

 BODY:
Sally Cameron has an Ivy League graduate degree, and yet found herself tending bar. Mel Rodenstein earned a master's degree in international affairs but was working in a "mindless" clerk's job, eating rice and beans to save money. 
Then there was the young woman who attended a good public university only to spend the first year after college driving around North America, with a friend and fellow struggling graduate. "There are no jobs anyway," the woman said.
All of these college graduates could have appeared in recent newspaper stories bemoaning the fate of college graduates. Yet they appeared in similar stories that ran years ago -- 1982 in Ms. Cameron's and Mr. Rodenstein's case and 1993 in the case of the young women on the road trip.
So Kevin Carey, an education writer and policy analyst, did something brilliant. He tracked down the graduates to see what had become of them. He has written about his findings in The New Republic:
[Mr. Rodenstein] went on to a series of nonprofit management jobs and, by 2010, was a senior research project supervisor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Health.... Today, one of the [two road trippers] lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, and runs her own H.R. consulting firm. The other got a PhD and works 20 feet away from this author in a Washington, DC think tank. 
Sally Cameron, meanwhile, isn't tending bar anymore. She's a senior manager at an international development consulting company that works under contract with USAID. Her recent work includes building railroads in cyclone-devastated Madagascar....
In other words, they all turned out pretty well. They were no doubt damaged by the downturn into which they graduated. But they turned out vastly better than most people of their generation who didn't get a college degree. Today, in fact, you could probably use a couple of them to illustrate a very different trend: the growing gap in the pay between college graduates and everyone else.
Mr. Carey again:
For going on four decades, the press has been raising alarms that college degrees may no longer be a sound investment. Two things about these stories have remained constant: They always feature an over-educated bartender, and they are always wrong.
I recommend the whole article. It's more clever than my summary can convey. It's also a good example of persuasive writing. 
If you're interested in more on the subject, Catherine Rampell and I have each written related posts recently.

HEADLINE: The Straw Man in Iowa

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: For those who object to the role of the Iowa caucuses, the issue isn't that Iowans are inferior; it's that Iowa should be treated like any other state. 

 BODY:
In The Des Moines Regsiter, Kathie Obradovich takes me and others to task:
It's time to press your bib overalls, bring out the straw bales and tidy up the pig pens, Iowans. Utah Republican Jon Huntsman's decision to skip the first-in-the-nation caucuses means it's time to dust off all the cliches about the Hawkeye state.
David Leonhardt ... wrote that Iowa and New Hampshire "lack a single big city." Therefore, he says, we don't hear much in the first year of a presidential campaign about issues that concern metro areas, like quality of schools and deteriorating infrastructure.
Really? Good luck finding a state more fixated on school quality than Iowa. Ask around and see if anyone here is worried about deteriorating roads and bridges - Iowa has plenty of them. The last census continued a decades-long trend of migration to Iowa's urban centers. Sixty percent of the population was urban in 2009, according to the State Data Center.
There are two basic responses to an argument along these lines. The narrow one is that Iowa is not nearly so representative as the defenders of its caucus suggest. Does anyone really think that the public-transportation and highway issues in Des Moines are identical to those in Atlanta or Chicago or Los Angeles? Does Iowa's population -- far less diverse than the rest of the nation's -- have the same range of educational issues as other places? 
But the broader response is the more important one. Put simply, why does Iowa deserve to have the first, highly influential nominating event every single presidential cycle? 
Iowa's defenders like to argue against the notion that Iowans are inferior. But that is not what many of us who object to the caucus believe. We would be happy for Iowa to be treated exactly as well as every other state. Our question is: what makes Iowans superior to the residents of the other 49 states?

HEADLINE: Man vs. Machine

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A look at how costs for workers and capital have changed in the last two years, and how those changes may have affected businesses' hiring and investment decisions. 

 BODY:
In the epic battle of man versus machine, machines have a growing price advantage.
As I wrote in a story today, companies' spending on capital has grown much faster than their spending on labor since the recovery began in June 2009. Spending on equipment and software has risen 25.6 percent in the last seven quarters, while companies' aggregate spending on employees has risen only 2.2 percent.
Now, many economists will argue that hiring always lags capital spending, which is generally true. What's troubling is how wide the gap in spending growth is this time around. In the seven quarters immediately following each of the last 10 recessions, equipment and software spending rose on average 15.6 percent, and labor spending rose on average 8.8 percent.
Somehow, capital spending is growing faster and labor spending is growing more slowly than has been the case in almost every previous recovery on record.
One reason hiring has been so sluggish is that equipment and software prices have been dropping quickly, while labor costs have been rising fast.
Again, this usually happens, but has been especially true in the current recovery. Here's a chart showing the change in prices for compensation and for equipment and software since the recovery officially began in the second quarter of 2009:
It may seem strange that the cost of labor is rising so fast. With such a weak economy, it doesn't seem as if a lot of workers are getting raises. (Are you?)
And technically, employees are not getting much of a raise - at least not in cash. The higher cost of labor is primarily being driven by rising benefits costs and, in particular, rising health insurance costs.
Let's take another look at that last chart, splitting up the total employee compensation prices into two separate indexes for wages/salaries and for benefits:
As you can see, the benefits cost line is quite steep. Even more daunting to employers, it could get even steeper in the years ahead; health care costs are rising sharply, and their costs a year or two from now are very hard to predict.
So it's no wonder companies are reluctant to invest in new workers when the economy still seems so uncertain.

HEADLINE: CT&T Executive Denies Reports of Company's Poor Health

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The company, which made a splash at the 2010 Detroit auto show with its lineup of compact, low-speed electric vehicles, is adjusting to structural changes, the executive said. 

 BODY:
"Don't believe what you read," Joseph J. White, the chief operating officer of CT&T E.V. Sales and Marketing, said Friday in response to recent news reports alleging that the electric vehicle company's South Korean parent was unable to deliver vehicles, was reneging on announced plans for ambitious North American sales and manufacturing, and was on the verge of financial collapse.
"A lot has changed structurally for us," Mr. White said Friday in a telephone interview from his offices in Greenville, S.C. "Our parent company in Korea is now a public company, where it was privately held. Our operation here in the United States has morphed into more of a strategic holding company. We are in the process of adapting to those changes."
CT&T made quite a splash at the 2010 Detroit auto show when it unveiled a lineup of small electric vehicles and announced plans to manufacture them in the United States. The company's intentions to build production centers in South Carolina, Pennsylvania and Hawaii were announced shortly thereafter.
Mr. White's title, previously chief executive of CT&T United, has changed to suit his role at the newly formed CT&T sales and marketing subsidiary. Although CT&T United's phones have been disconnected, business is still being conducted, Mr. White said. He declined to say how many employees the company has or what its sales volumes are.
"We are still selling vehicles, delivering them to our customers, and we have significant inventory here -- over $5 million worth," he said of the South Carolina plant. "In fact, a few days ago in Korea, our parent company just unveiled another new four-passenger L.S.V. for our lineup," he said, referring to the brand's low-speed electric vehicles.
He said he was unaware of reported liquidity problems at the parent company. "They have internal organizational issues, which I believe they are working through," he said.
The Associated Press reported this week that CT&T's stock price on the Korean stock exchange has plunged 89 percent this year, from 1,030 won on Jan. 3 to 115 won (11 cents), when markets closed last week.
Unflattering testimony from representatives in Hawaii, South Carolina and Pennsylvania has not helped the company's case.
"That seems to be the source of a lot of controversy right now," Mr. White said. "But our plans have always been to have a site in South Carolina first. That's still the plan."
Site selection, however, is continuing. "I can tell you it will be in upstate South Carolina," he said. "But we currently have no timetable for that. Further consideration of other sites, in other states, will have to be for later on."
According to the AP report, CT&T said in July 2010 that it intended to assemble E.V.'s in Duncan, S.C., which would have brought 370 jobs to the town. A CT&T officer, James Park, said in the report that the company was abandoning plans for plants in Pennsylvania, but that it still wanted to build in Hawaii, as well as South Carolina. The American subsidiary is trying to raise $250 million to move forward with its plans, Mr. Park said.
CT&T's vehicle lineup includes a hatchback, a mini pickup, a six-passenger amphibious vehicle and police parking enforcement vehicles. They are capable of speeds of about 40 m.p.h. and have ranges of up to 60 miles before requiring a recharge. Prices range from $8,000 to $20,000, depending on the model and accessories.
Mr. White said his company was working with American suppliers to establish domestic sources for parts and engineering. "But we are still able to get vehicles from Korea to fill our orders," he said.
Mr. White also said his company had established an engineering and technical services relationship with a South Carolina company, 2AM Group, to help move its North American plans forward. Brian Jones, a manager at 2AM Group, told The Associated Press that CT&T was "still getting everything together to be able to set up the manufacturing operations."
"They have a good product," he added.

HIGHLIGHT: A little-known travel tool, Kayak Explore, lets users see the best flight deals to hundreds of cities across the globe. 

 BODY:
Whether you are trying to find the best time to travel to a favorite spot or have no destination in mind, a little-known travel tool, Kayak Explore, can help you find the best flight deals to hundreds of cities across the globe. 
Explore is bundled with Kayak's online suite that includes flight and hotel search options, travel tools and other information, like a very useful list of airline fees. It also includes Kayak HD, a free iPad app.
The concept is simple: enter a departure city and then select a desired time frame for travel. The results are displayed on a large Google map, with best fares plotted between your city and hundreds of destinations. Results can be filtered by region, price range, flight duration and desired activities (like beach, golf or skiing). If you adjust the month from August to September, for example, you will see dramatic price drops for flights to Europe. In a recent search, the best price from New York to London in August was listed at $1,060 for a nonstop roundtrip ticket. In September, the price drops to as low as $750. Fares are based on economy travel found over the last 48 hours on Kayak.
Once the results are displayed, you can explore all of your options or zoom in on a desired location. To search for specific dates, click on the location (or tap the screen if using the iPad), which takes you to Kayak's flight search tool, where you can book a flight.
Kayak Explore is a handy tool for those with flexible travel dates, or those open to exploring their options. Kayak's mobile app for the iPhone lacks this explorer feature, but has Kayak's suite of offerings that can be found online.

HEADLINE: The Guardians of Racing's Slow Death

BYLINE: JIM SQUIRES


HIGHLIGHT: Fighting to continue performance-enhancing drugs on race day and keep horse racing leaderless with an outmoded business model is a futile self-preservation strategy by the worst elements of the sport. 

 BODY:
When injections of furosemide and doses of aminocaproic acid to control exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage are given to starters in the 143rd Belmont Stakes Saturday, it might be the last time an American Triple Crown race will ever be run on legal performance-enhancing drugs. Less than a week later, an industry drug summit will convene in New York to take up the efficacy of the practice now threatened by proposed federal legislation that would outlaw it. 
Although several industry groups, including the wealthy and powerful Jockey Club, have endorsed joining the rest of the racing world in banning all performance-enhancing drugs on race day, two major organizations - the National Thoroughbred Racing Association and the Horsemen's Benevolent Protective Association -- are mobilizing to defeat it. And for good reason -- any change in the only federal law that affects horse racing could render both groups irrelevant and alter dramatically the landscape of racing and Internet gambling.
The legislation, put forward by Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, and Representative Ed Whitfield, Republican of Kentucky, would amend the Interstate Horse Racing Act of 1978 that exempted parimutuel gambling on horse racing from interstate gambling prohibitions by revoking the exemption to any track that does not enforce strict and consistent antidrug rules with accredited tests and stiff punishment for violators.
Considered a boondoggle for horse racing at the time, the 1978 law has since become its financial savior because most tracks would be out of business without off-track wagering revenue from simulcasting across state lines. 
At the same time, the law basically established a flawed business model that many consider the sport's undoing and that has become a target of lobbyists for casino and other gambling competitors demanding equal treatment.
To nearly everyone familiar with it, the existing statute is a shining example of Washington lawmaking at its worst. 
In 1978, the industry was as fractured, leaderless and rife with built-in conflicts of interests among tracks, trainers, gamblers and fans, as it is today. As a result, the law's "definition" section is longer than its provisions and mandates an obsolete baby-splitting scheme for revenue sharing viewed by business analysts as a millstone on the neck of the sport. 
Not only does it define "horsemen" as whatever group that can prove it represents the majority of owners and trainers in a given state, it requires that tracks, horsemen's groups and the racing commissions in every state where a signal exchange takes place have written agreements on how the money involved is to be divided. No new wager can even be initiated without prior unanimous consent. 
With the future of the sport now believed to be digital global simulcasting and advance deposit wagering systems anchored in cyberspace, this has become a nightmare for track operators trying to keep the exemption while scheming for ways around the veto power of the horsemen's groups. 
The H.B.P.A., whose political power is rooted in its ability to influence state legislatures and regulators, routinely opposes any remodeling of the distribution formula or the drug laws and maintains that the race-day treatment with anti-bleeder medicine and the use of anti-inflammatory, non-steroidal pain killers are actually "protective" measures in the best interest of the horse. 
The impending drug summit, believed by many as an attempt by the racing establishment to get out in front on the issue and forestall government involvement, will most likely be a global argument over whether anti-bleeder medication is good or bad.
While exercised-induced bleeding in the lungs occurs in all athletic endeavors, only four or five percent of racehorses bleed badly enough to hamper performance. Still, between 95 percent and 98 percent of all horses in the 50,000 North American races each year are treated -- many as often as three or four times a month -- providing a revenue stream from owners to veterinarians of more than $100 million annually. 
Only anecdotal evidence exists supporting furosemide (Lasix or Salix) and aminocaproic acid (Amicar) as temporarily beneficial for horses, but there is extensive science on their long-term detrimental effects on human heart and kidney patients for whom they were developed. 
A powerful diuretic, furosemide lessens blood flow to the lungs by redirecting it to the kidneys, at the same time causing a horse to lose 20 to 30 pounds of electrolytes every time it is administered. This results in an immediate calcium deficiency for which the horse compensates by leeching calcium from the bones, disrupting the bone remodeling process that is under way in the horse until age 6.
The late Kentucky veterinarian Alex Harthill claims he administered the first dose of Lasix to the Kentucky Derby winner Northern Dancer in 1964. In the years since, the annual starts for racehorses has dropped from 11 to 6 and average lifetime starts from 44 to 14. In recent years aminocaproic acid, which slows the breaking down of blood clots, has been added to the raceday regimen of some horses. Among its side effects are cramping, diarrhea, dizziness, swelling of the limbs, confusion and hallucination. 
In the long run, both the debate over the health of the horse and the wisdom of amending the law may be muted by the reality of the sport, widely considered to be terminally ill from economic malaise and a persistent public image as corrupt and inhumane. 
Leaders of the reform movement -- including mainstays like Arthur Hancock, who has raised three Kentucky Derby winners, and Roy and Gretchen Jackson, who raced Barbaro -- believe that American racing has no bigger problem than its image as a drug culture. 
Already more than 220 of the most prominent breeders and investors in the game have signed a letter supporting an end to race-day drugs as the first crucial step toward survival.
Horse racing is flourishing in only a few places -- France, Australia and the Gulf states of the United Arab Emirates. But the sport is in trouble almost everywhere else for largely the same reason - too much of a bad thing. 
The best and perhaps only hope for revival lies in a scaled-down sport that assures top-quality horses at top-flight venues and customer-attracting innovations like exchange betting, which allows wagering during the running of the race, even on horses to lose. 
The average age of a typical customer using an American advance deposit wagering platform such as TVG is 55. But TVG was recently purchased by Betfair, the European wagering giant that pioneered exchange betting and whose average customer is 35 years old.
Whether young, tech-savvy customers are in racing's future is far less certain that what has already been proven. People won't show up at tracks or in television audiences to watch horses break down, and gamblers will not bet on a poor game that might be decided by the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals. 
Fighting to continue performance-enhancing drugs on race day and to keep horse racing leaderless with an outmoded business model is a futile self-preservation strategy by the worst elements of the sport.

HEADLINE: Big Deal | An Update on the Apthorp

BYLINE: SARAH KERSHAW


HIGHLIGHT: With finances stabilizing at the elegant but troubled Renaissance Revival Apthrop, buyers are taking a closer look. The fashion designer Alber Elbaz decided recently to buy a condo there. 

 BODY:
Like most apartment hunters, Steven M. Goldman knew he was going to have to do some homework on the building he chose.
But doing homework on the place, the Apthorp, with its head-spinning history as one of the most expensive and contentious condominium conversions in city history, seems a little more like undertaking research for a doctorate. (Luckily, Mr. Goldman is a lawyer specializing in mergers and acquisitions and a former New Jersey state banking and insurance commissioner.)
Since developers paid $426 million for the 161-unit rental building in 2006, envisioning a spectacular success at the height of the real estate boom, the news coverage alone has been encyclopedic - a storyline with so much high drama that it seems possible only in New York.
So what's the latest at the Apthorp? 
In November, a new sales team took over the marketing of the elegant Renaissance Revival building at 79th and Broadway, which was built in 1908 by the Astors and was home to celebrity renters like Nora Ephron, Al Pacino, Joseph Heller and Cyndi Lauper.
The team, the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, faced an uphill climb on sales, along with an image problem. The Web site Curbed has a regularly updated feature, "As the Apthorp Turns," chronicling the travails of the conversion, which began with the inevitable financial troubles after the housing market crashed in 2008. Few sales and deep discounts drove the developers to the brink of foreclosure.
Then there were feuds between the original developers and a parting of ways - including a dispute over how to part ways (specifically, in which rabbinical court). There were also the continuous complaints from tenants living in the rent-regulated and market-rate apartments, concerning dangerous and annoying conditions resulting from renovations, including the presence of mice and lead-paint dust. And there were numerous health and safety violations, with local and state politicians taking up the tenants' cause; and a highly publicized cliffhanger as to whetherAndrew M. Cuomo, the state attorney general at the time, would approve the conversion, which he did, in May 2010.
The Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group took over marketing from Prudential Douglas Elliman, which in 2009 had sent in its power broker, Dolly Lenz, to sell at least 25 units in six weeks so the conversion plan would be approved by the state. After the switch, The Wall Street Journal declared in a headline, "Goodbye Dolly!"
Ms. Lenz in fact met that goal, and Howard M. Lorber, the chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said suggestions that his brokerage had been forced out by the developers were untrue because the firm had decided not to renew its contract.
Mr. Goldman, who went into contract in March on a three-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath apartment but declined to say how much he was paying, supports the assertion by Corcoran Sunshine that things are looking up and less soap-opera-esque.
He was particularly focused on the building's finances, and said that the developers' restructuring of debt, the $37 million sale of retail space, and what appeared to be an increase in the pace of sales had made him confident. "I think the exterior of the building is so unusual," Mr. Goldman said, "and the units themselves just have an Old World charm I don't think you can find anywhere."
Needless to say, the sales team, which began its marketing push in earnest in February, salivated upon learning recently that the fashion designer Alber Elbaz decided to buy a condo, hoping that such star power would help restore the building's image as the ultimate in prewar luxury.
Both Mr. Elbaz and Mr. Goldman said they had been swept away by the Palazzo-like architecture, the grand wrought-iron gates, the regal courtyard and the painstakingly restored details in the handful of condos that have been renovated, including hand-laid marble and mosaic tiles.
Of the 161 units, 25 percent are on the market, 25 percent have sold and 50 percent are rentals. As for sales, Prudential Douglas Elliman sold 35 condos, many of them at discounts as deep as 30 percent off original asking prices, which averaged $3,000 per square foot, versus slightly more than $2,000 today. The new sales team, according to Beth Fisher, a senior managing director of Corcoran Sunshine, has closed on only one unit, but an additional six are in contract, for a total of $30 million, and an average sale price of $2,000 per square foot.
Condos on the market range from $2.65 million, for a 1-bedroom, to $16.07 million for a 10-bedroom.
Ms. Fisher said the key to rescuing the building from financial doom was to align prices with market conditions and reconfigure some units, in a building where no two are alike and many have remained untouched since early in the last century.
Renters, according to David Hershey-Webb, a lawyer who represents the Apthorp Tenants Association, are still concerned about conditions as renovations continue, mainly about the lead-paint dust. They have submitted an engineer's report to the attorney general documenting the presence of the dust, he said, but have not yet received a response.
The developers, a consortium that includes Africa Israel USA and other investors, declined to comment. But a spokeswoman said that over the last few months the building had been routinely inspected and "any citations have been minor and have been addressed in a timely manner."
And so, for the Apthorp-obsessed, the story continues.

HEADLINE: India's Way: Jim Yardley Responds to Readers on Development in Gurgaon

BYLINE: JIM YARDLEY


HIGHLIGHT: Jim Yardley responds to readers' questions and comments on his recent story on economic development in India. 

 BODY:
I want to thank everyone for all the thoughtful comments about the Gurgaon story. India is one of the most fascinating assignments in the world, if occasionally a vexing one, given its complexities and contradictions. In the India's Way series, we hope to examine how India works - and doesn't work. We want to look at how it has grown, examine the unique ways Indians are trying to move their country forward and also explore the challenges ahead.
Here are some responses to a few questions. Thanks very much for your attention and readership. 
- Jim Yardley
Q. What exactly are the democracy dividends for India? Nat, Wilmington, Del.
A. Nat, this is a good question, especially given that India is so often compared with authoritarian China. I spent six years in China before moving to India, and China is certainly ahead of India economically. Of course, China started economic reforms a decade earlier and has followed a very different top-down, export-driven model.
China's success has made many observers wonder if authoritarianism is the best way for such a huge developing country to get richer, faster. No doubt, China's rulers have an easier time getting land for infrastructure and crushing dissent and opposition to government policies. And the Chinese bureaucracy can be very task-oriented. But China is now beginning to enter a new phase of its development, when its lack of democracy is likely to begin to pose problems.
But this is about India, and my take is that democracy is the only workable system for India. India is so much more diverse than China, with so many different religions, ethnicities, languages and more. For many years, the prevailing question was whether India would remain intact. Critics often assumed it would break into pieces. But that has not happened. India has steadily gotten stronger, slowly but steadily. Its existence is a triumph, in many ways, and without a doubt, the federalist structure of India's parliamentary democracy is the glue that binds the nation together. India's political system is accommodating, by design; it absorbs the different factions of the nation by inviting them into the political process. 
Of course, this makes Indian politics quite messy and, at times, very frustrating. Democratic politics in India can become easily splintered, making it difficult to find consensus and move forward on key issues. (Sound familiar, United States?) But if you look at recent state elections in India, you'll see a growing trend: Voters are supporting candidates who deliver cleaner government and economic growth. Lots of political analysts hope we are beginning to see the economic benefits of democratic political competitions. 
This is a huge topic - entire books can't fully capture it - but democracy is the system for India. 
Q. Is India's middle class optimistic about the country's future? Are they awed? Are they eager to leave? Marc Bissou, Folsom, Calif.
A. This is a complicated question (and I should stipulate that I cannot speak for India's middle class.) Merely defining this group is a subject of debate in India. But, in general terms, India's middle class is in a curious position: its members are the biggest beneficiaries of the country's economic progress, yet their numbers are still not big enough, nor are their interests cohesive enough, to give them "vote bank" power in elections. 
This is not to say they don't have influence or political power; to the contrary, India's media - at least the English-language media - are the bullhorn of middle-class interests. You also see a rising national pride (as well as hubris in some quarters) that is intertwined with the country's growing global profile. 
Still, I do think there is a fair amount of middle-class alienation and frustration. India can be such a chaotic place, especially in the cities; anyone with enough money is usually eager to live in the sort of "private islands" discussed in the Gurgaon story. The middle class is also often the most appalled by the corruption and ineffectiveness of the political class.
I would disagree that educated middle-class people want to leave India in droves. Certainly many middle-class Indian families aspire for their children to be educated at top colleges in the United States or Britain. But, if anything, I think you probably see a healthy number of nonresident Indians now trying to return home and get a piece of the economic action - especially given the tough job situation in the West.
Q.Could more powerful local government be an answer to cities like Gurgaon and Bangalore, or for that matter, Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai, Trivandrum, Cochin, Indore and the like that are all vying to be the next tech hub? manbearpig, Waukesha, Wis.
A. Dear manbearpig (great name), thanks for all these questions and insights. If you don't mind, I'll boil them down, because you've smartly identified a major issue in India: the problems with urban governance. 
India is a country that is rapidly urbanizing even as the national government hasn't done nearly enough to encourage or prepare for urbanization. City governments are usually very weak. India's federalist system grants enormous powers to state governments and is usually loath to decentralize power to growing cities. If they do, they give up power and money, since cities are usually the biggest source of tax revenues - not to mention graft opportunities. To me, Hyderabad is a city that works pretty well, but it is also a state capital, so state leaders pretty much run the city, too. I've visited Bangalore a handful of times, and it has many of the same issues as Gurgaon (better weather, though). 
But getting back to urban governance: Gurgaon is a perfect example of this state-local tension. The officials in Haryana long resisted giving up control of Gurgaon because it is the biggest cash cow in the state. Now, Gurgaon's new municipal government faces the incredible challenge of trying to catch up, as far as building new infrastructure, in a city that already has nearly two million people! It is as if this new government is in a 100-yard dash against competitors who were given a 50-yard head start.
Another issue in urban governance is transparency. Oftentimes, power is distributed across several agencies or different layers of governments. This means it is harder to hold particular bodies accountable. You see this in Indian cities, where the layering of state and local governments often serves to obscure who is making what decisions, and why.
Q. I have friends who have been to sub-Saharan Africa and they tell me that living conditions in India are even worse. My question is: What does the writer think is the reason for such sorry state of affairs in India? And what would he recommend?Dasarpa, Boston
A. Poverty is still a crisis in India. Rural India can be desperately poor, but now you are seeing rising problems with urban poverty, as migrants come to cities in search of work. They live in slums and are hard hit by rising prices. And local governments usually do very little for them, if anything at all. 
Many economists would argue that the inequity is an ugly but unavoidable phase for a developing country undergoing economic liberalization - especially one such as India, which began at such an extreme rate of destitution and has such a huge population. 
There is a huge debate in India about how best to lift the poor. But the fundamental questions are pretty clear: Can education be improved and expanded rapidly enough? Can new agricultural policies create a new "green" revolution? Can the corrupt and grossly inefficient system of distributing government subsidies - including grain and kerosene - be improved to create a reliable safety net? Can India find ways to create mass employment, off the farm, that does not require a white-collar education?

The special election in New York's 26th Congressional District -- and the surprising Democratic victory there -- was cause for much optimism among Democrats, but Nate argued that while Republicans should be somewhat worried by the result, Democrats shouldn't throw more than five or six parades. The New Republic's Jonathan Chait on the other hand, argued that the race is more significant. "The political landscape that produced the Republican sweep of 2010 is gone. Just what replaces it remains to be seen," Mr. Chait wrote.
Nate already mentioned the virtual brouhaha sparked by his contention that Herman Cain's prospects for the Republican nomination should be taken more seriously (the simple case and the not-so-simple case). But The Week has a useful rundown of the arguments that were made by both sides.
The flip side of the Cain debate was the one over the chances of former Governor Jon Huntsman of Utah. While Nate argued that many pundits were underestimating Mr. Cain, he wrote that Mr. Huntsman's odds were being overestimated, especially because of a number of moderate positions Mr. Huntsman has taken. Well, Time's Alex Altman has a good analysis of how Mr. Huntsman will try to convince conservatives he is one of them.
FiveThirtyEight did a series of posts (here, here and here) on the predictive value of economic indicators in presidential elections. At Lawyers, Guns and Money, Dave Brockington argued that we were setting up a straw man. FiveThirtyEight's "discussion of political scientists and our models etc. is increasingly becoming rather straw-esque," he wrote. Mr. Brockington seems to think that political scientists know everything and their models are perfectly predictive (just kidding, Mr. Brockington.)
In one of those economic posts, FiveThirtyEight examined "The 10-Word Question That Could Cost Obama the Election," namely Ronald Reagan's famous inquiry, "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" And the Washington Examiner's Michael Barone provided some history on the question, noting that the Gipper wasn't the first to ask it, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was.
It was a while ago, but remember our analysis of the advantages a Southerner has in trying to win the Republican presidential nomination? Ed Kilgore, at NPR.org, wrote a thought-provoking article on the phenomenon. Mr. Kilgore argues that it's not regional affinity that makes a Southerner more likely to support a Southern candidate -- it's ideology. He concludes, "...southern Republicans tend to support the most conservative viable candidate in presidential primaries at least as much as they support fellow-southerners."
Finally, our comment-of-the-half-month goes to... everyone who commented on "Weiner's Seat Could Be Scrambled in Redistricting." The comments were smart, substantive and insightful. Unfortunately, awarding this to a group means you'll have to split the prize money.
