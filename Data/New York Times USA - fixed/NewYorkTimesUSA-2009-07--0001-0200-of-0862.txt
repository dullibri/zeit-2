HEADLINE: Going Public in the Throes of a Recession

BYLINE: By LORA KOLODNY

 BODY:
Since Tom Adams joined Rosetta Stone as chief executive in 2003, the company, which makes self-study language software, has grown from a small, family-owned business with $10 million in annual revenue and 90 full-time employees into a 1,200-employee operation with first-quarter revenue this year of $50.3 million. 
 Nonetheless, with the economy mired in the worst downturn in recent memory, it took many by surprise when Mr. Adams, 37, chose to take Rosetta Stone public in April. It was only the fourth company to try an initial public offering on an American exchange in 2009, and it was a rousing success, selling out shares priced above the estimated range of $15 to $17 and raising $129 million. Rosetta Stone's shares have recently traded above $27. 
 The successful offering was encouraging news for many privately owned companies and small businesses, suggesting, as it did, that strong valuations are still possible, even in such a difficult economy. The Arlington, Va.-based company is living proof, says Bill Tai, a partner at the investment firm, Charles River Ventures in Menlo Park, Calif., that ''a company with solid foundations and the ability to ride interesting trends can attract funding, even multiple bidders for their financing, in a time of great uncertainty.'' 
 Lora Kolodny recently spoke with Mr. Adams about his decision to take Rosetta Stone public. A condensed version of their conversation follows:
 Q:How did you become chief executive of Rosetta Stone?
 A: When the original C.E.O., John Stoltzfus, died of a heart attack in 2002 -- he was just 59 -- Matt Schenck, an American who worked there, and one of my best friends from high school, called and said, ''Look, we really need you.'' 
 I had worked at the company on a consulting basis, briefly, and I had a particular blend of international and life experiences that made me a match for some position. 
 Q.What kinds of experiences?
 A: I've learned languages all my life. I'm Swedish, but I also grew up in St. Cloud, a suburb of Paris, and Cookham Dean, a London suburb where we moved when I was 10. I didn't know a word of English then. That was a very humiliating kind of defining time for me.
 I knew I wanted to do my own thing full time after living and working in China as a commodity merchant, sourcing copper from Mongolia. I went to business school at Insead in France hoping, eventually, to run my own company. 
 Q:Was it specifically your charge to take Rosetta Stone public?
 A: Absolutely not. From the day I started, my goal was, and still is, to change how people learn languages, make it so that anyone, regardless of where they live or their age or stage in life, can learn successfully on their own. 
 Q:Were there any people, internally or otherwise, who resisted the I.P.O.?
 A: There were some worries in our product development, sales and marketing teams about being able to get things done quickly and creatively if we were subject to all kinds of regulation. Many people have this notion that as a private company you can do whatever you want -- and as a public company you're suddenly a cannibal. 
 I asked them: How should we make sure our investors get liquidity? Should we take on new investors? For how long can we cycle in and out of that? Do you want the company to be sold to a strategic buyer with a mission and a culture that is different than ours?
 When they stopped to think about the I.P.O. and how it could bring resources to us, and elevate our brand, they began to see the pros and cons of staying private and going public differently. 
 Q:Was the recession a factor?
 A: Ironically, the recession may have helped us in ways. For example, we had lots of people turning out for most of our investor presentations. 
 We would show them our product, talk to them about our strong Q4 results and our 53 percent revenue growth last year. We can't disclose how oversubscribed we were but there was very, very strong interest. It was not a highly challenged placement in the end. 
 Q:Did you consider waiting for a healthier market?
 A: Without naming names, I did think about companies that went public when markets were healthier. Maybe their I.P.O. moment was really good. But in actual fact their stock now trades below the level when they went public. They have lost people a lot of money, and as a business today feel the pain of their investors.
 Q:What's changed since the I.P.O.?
 A: Net, following the I.P.O., we are cash-flow positive with no debt. This is a very strong position and balance sheet.
 Q:Didn't you have a strong balance sheet before the I.P.O.?
 A: This is true. We were profitable for three years consecutively before the I.P.O. But there is a difference between being a company that has enough cash in the bank to pay expenses for 2 months versus 9 or 12 months. Your approach to everything changes with the capital and resources the I.P.O. brings. You can become more proactive and aggressive in your business. 
 As a private company, your primary recourse is to go to the bank and borrow the money. You just are kind of stuck with whatever you get there. Or, these days you can deal with private funding at very discounted valuations. 
 Entrepreneurs in that situation cannot take excess cash onto their balance sheet. So, they don't have as strong a ''risk profile'' as they might have if they went public. Look at Google and how much cash they throw at projects that may or may not work. They take great risks to great results. 
 Q:How are you going to use the money you raised? 
 A: Adding to the offerings we have today and expanding sales internationally. We are excited about hardware trends and the potential of educational technology in general. We are working in new ways with online socialization. For the first time, there will be a way for language learners to both practice and connect with native speakers in one platform online. We'll have a big announcement about this soon. 
 We see our primary opportunity as growing through our own innovation. But with added financial resources we can entertain mergers and acquisitions down the line. 
 Q:Has regulation changed the way you work day to day? 
 A. Yes. I feel a few headaches. I have to allocate more time to talking with more investors and reporting on all aspects of the business. And I can't always discuss products or developments I am eager for the world to know about with customers or the press.
 Q: Is there anything you regret about going public?
 A: Nothing. I know it is not in vogue to consider an I.P.O. in this day and age. But sometimes, the way to stay independent is to go public. It won't be your own company, entirely, but you and all of your employees can own some of it, and you have held onto your mission and cultural values.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Says California May Enforce Emissions

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that it had granted California the right to enforce its first-in-the-nation standards controlling greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and light trucks. 
 The move reverses a 2008 ruling by the Bush administration and effectively ends a seesaw political battle between automakers and environmental regulators that began in Sacramento eight years ago when the California Legislature first took up the issue.
 Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, said in an interview that she had reversed the ruling by her predecessor, Stephen L. Johnson, because the traditional presumption had been that California, with its history of air pollution, had grounds to establish rules that exceed federal requirements.
 ''The burden is on those that object,'' Ms. Jackson said.
 The immediate impact of the decision, which had been widely anticipated, is more symbolic than practical. The 2009 fleet of new vehicles is already in compliance with the California rules and the 2010 fleet is also expected to meet the requirements, said Tom Cackette, deputy director of California's Air Resources Board.
 ''Auto manufacturers have been making changes to vehicles both because they anticipated they might have to meet California standards and because there was a general interest in public in buying more efficient cars,'' Mr. Cackette said.
 Nationally, about one-third of the greenhouse-gas emissions contributing to climate change come from the transportation sector, most of it from cars and light trucks. 
 The rules in California will cut emissions from new vehicles by 14 percent from 2008 levels in 2011. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have also adopted the California rules in an effort to combat climate change.
 California's emissions rules are also expected to be congruent with new federal fuel economy standards announced in May by the Obama administration. Both standards envision that emissions will be cut by 30 percent in 2016.
 The aligning of California's rules and the federal mileage standards is intended to ensure that automakers comply with a single standard. This ''moves us toward a policy that ensures that consumers in all 50 states have access to highly fuel-efficient vehicles at an affordable price,'' said Dave McCurdy, president and chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.
 In the interview, Ms. Jackson of the E.P.A. praised Fran Pavley, the state senator from California who originally crafted the early blueprint for the state standards in 2001.

HEADLINE: In a Cold Economy, Fancy Food Is Hot

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
BUZZ, indeed.
 Honey, an ancient food that seems only to be gaining in popularity, was presented by 153 companies at the Fancy Food Show, a trade show that ended June 30 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. That was an increase of over 25 percent from last year, show organizers said. 
 The talk of the show was artisanal products, which are made by small producers, often by hand. Honey, quintessentially artisanal, was featured in products like candy, drinks and condiments. One of them, Magnolia Honey's Raspberry William preserves, sweetened with honey, won a best product award.
 In case you did not know how to use honey, Savannah Bee, which offers admirable honeys, has introduced a honey for grilling marinades (an earthy blend), to use in tea (light and unassertive) and to drizzle on cheese (quite floral). 
 As flavor trends go, blood orange also seems to be on the rise, judging from the number of products featuring it at the show. Blood-orange onion confit, blood orange marmalade, blood orange soda, blood orange tea were also on display. Sarabeth's Kitchen won an award for its blood orange marmalade, as did Aliseo, an Italian company, for its fresh blood orange juice. 
 Louise Kramer of the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade, which runs the show, said that organizers had wondered how the economy would affect the show. The number of buyers, 25,000, was up; exhibitors, 2,300, were down slightly.
 ''In a down economy, people still want to treat themselves,'' Ms. Kramer said. ''But one trend we have seen is smaller packages, like four-ounce cheeses, so they are not as expensive, there is no waste and they can go into supermarkets.'' 
 Products ran the gamut from gimmicky -- like Bruno White's Cookal caramelization kits, which came with caramel bits to sprinkle, melt or glaze on desserts -- to fine, like Fra'Mani's turkey galantine from California, a roulade of beautifully seasoned white and dark meat. A satiny washed-rind cheese from Tasmania, of all places, was seductively but not aggressively stinky. These should be in stores soon. 
 There were caviars, of course, including examples from Almas Caviar Farm from South Korea.
 John Wm. Macy's CheeseSticks now has a commendable whole wheat version. 
 Another fetching tidbit was a red velvet truffle: red-tinted milk chocolate ganache with white chocolate and cream-cheese icing that looked like a tiny slice of cake, from the Candy Basket in Portland, Ore. It was one of the few candies that did not feature sea salt or caramel. 
 But what was new at the show was not always new. Making their debut were R. J. Balson's English bangers from a company in Dorset that claims to have been in business since 1535. Back then, everything was artisanal.

HEADLINE: In China, New Limits On Virtual Currency

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
The buying and selling of the make-believe currencies used in online gaming has become so widespread that Chinese authorities fear it will affect the real economy. 
 To quell that threat, those authorities said on Tuesday that they had issued new regulations aimed at restricting the trade and use of virtual money.
 China is one of the world's biggest markets for huge so-called multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft, and tens of millions of young people are believed to be trading virtual goods and credits for real goods and cash. 
 The coin of fantasy realms have already moved markets here. So-called QQ coins -- a form of currency produced by the Chinese Internet giant Tencent -- have sometimes risen sharply in value against China's official currency, the renminbi, alarming officials at the nation's Central Bank.
 Some people have even traded virtual currencies in China, and exchanged them for clothes, cosmetics and other goods.
 Last year, nearly $2 billion in virtual currency was traded in China, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. Some experts say they believe there is a much larger underground economy in the virtual world.
 Most of China's big Internet companies -- like Sohu.com, Netease and Tencent -- have some gaming component and virtual currencies have grown up alongside many of them.
 Some smaller gaming companies have even set up what are called virtual sweatshops, cramped quarters where young people play online games to earn credits that the companies then sell at a profit to overseas customers in Taiwan, South Korea and even the United States.
 This practice is popularly known in the online gaming community as gold farming.
 Many online marketplaces, like eBay and China's Taobao, even have online advertisements offering virtual goods for sale, like World of Warcraft gold coins and virtual swords for the game Legend of Swordmen.
 Edward Castronova, a professor of telecommunications at Indiana University Bloomington who says he believes virtual currencies could pose a threat to world economies, applauded Beijing's move.
 ''This action shows that at least one government is concerned about the way virtual worlds challenge its control of society,'' Professor Castronova said in an e-mail message Tuesday. ''As virtual currencies take over more and more purchasing power, control over the effective money supply shifts from the central bank to the game developers.''
 On Tuesday, China said that new regulations would restrict the trading and use of virtual money, and that virtual currencies would be banned from being exchanged for goods.
 The government also said it was moving to fight online gambling and disputes over virtual coins.
 In a release, Beijing said that while virtual currencies had helped promote online gaming, they have ''also brought new economic and social problems.''
 Beijing has repeatedly sought to tame the online gaming market with new regulations (and even Internet addiction camps) but the activity continues to grow.
 The new rules, issued jointly last weekend by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Culture in Beijing, are the government's strongest effort yet to tame virtual money.
 The regulations were widely circulated just as Beijing announced it would delay adoption of a widely criticized plan to install software that was supposed to censor pornographic and other ''unhealthy'' Web sites in all personal computers sold in China.
 Richard Ji, an Internet analyst at Morgan Stanley, released a brief report Tuesday saying he expected only limited financial impact on Chinese gaming companies because much of the trading in virtual currencies and goods does not occur on the sites of big, publicly listed gaming companies, he says; it occurs on other Web sites.

HEADLINE: Some Economies Show Signs of Less Reliance on U.S.

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
For a while, when the economic crisis was at its worst, it was a dirty word that only the most provocative of analysts dared to use. Now, the D-word -- decoupling -- is making a comeback, and nowhere more so than in Asia. 
 Put simply, the term refers to the theory that emerging markets -- whether China or Chile -- will become less dependent the United States as their economies become stronger and more sophisticated. 
 For much of last year, the theory held up. Many emerging economies had steered clear of investments that dragged down banking behemoths in the West, and saw nothing like the turmoil that began to engulf the United States and Europe in 2007. But then, last autumn, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers caused the financial system to convulse and consumer demand to shrivel, emerging economies around the world got caught in the downdraft, and the D-word became mud. 
 Now, the tables are turning, especially in Asia, where many emerging economies are showing signs of a stronger recovery than in the West. And economists here have begun to talk of the decoupling once again. 
 ''Decoupling is happening for real,'' the chief Asia-Pacific economist at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, Michael Buchanan, said in a recent interview. 
 To be sure, the once sizzling pace of Asian economic growth has slowed sharply as exports to and investments from outside the region slumped. Across Asia, millions of people have lost their jobs as business dropped off and companies cut costs and output. Asia is heavily dependent upon selling its products to consumers in the United States and Europe, and many executives still say a strong American economy is a prerequisite for a return to the boom of years past. 
 But for the past couple of months, data have revealed a growing divergence between Western economies and those in much of Asia, notably China and India. 
 The World Bank last week forecast that the economies of the countries that use the euro and the United States would contract 4.5 percent and 3 percent, respectively, this year -- compared with 7.2 percent and 5.1 percent growth forecast for China and India. Forecasts from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that were also published last week backed up this general trend. 
 Major statistics for June, due Wednesday, are expected to show manufacturing activity in China and India are on the mend. By contrast, purchasing managers indexes for Europe and the United States are forecast to be merely less grim than before but still show contractions. 
 Why this diverging picture? 
 The crisis hit Asia much later. While the American economy began languishing in 2007, Asian economies were doing well until the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September. What followed was a rush of stimulus measures -- rate cuts and government spending programs. In Asia's case, these came soon after things soured for the region; in the United States, they came much later. 
 Moreover, developing Asian economies were in pretty good shape when the crisis struck. The last major crisis to hit the region -- the financial turmoil of 1997-98 -- forced governments in Asia to introduce overhauls that ultimately left them with lower debt levels, more resilient banking and regulatory systems and often large foreign exchange reserves. 
 Another crucial difference is that Asia, unlike the United States and Europe, has not had a banking crisis. Bank profits in Asia have plunged and some have had to raise extra capital but there have been no major collapses and no bailouts. 
 ''The single most important thing to have happened in Asia is that there has not been a banking crisis,'' said Andrew Freris, a regional strategist at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong. ''Asia is coming though this crisis with its banking system intact. Yes, some banks may not be making profits -- but it is cyclical and not systemic.'' 
 The lack of banking disasters also has meant that, unlike in Europe and the United States, Asian governments have not had to spend cash to clean the balance sheets of faltering banks. 
 Add to that the fact that companies and households in Asia are typically not burdened with the kind of debt that is forcing Americans and Europeans to cut back consumption and investment plans. 
 Asians are generally big savers; those in developing nations have limited health care and pension systems to fall back on. So they put aside cash for retirement, sickness and their children's education, rather than maxing out multiple credit cards. 
 Paul Schulte of Nomura said this difference was leading to a long-term shift. Western nations and consumers will struggle for years to pay down debt -- and in some cases face higher taxes as governments try to rein in their swelling budget deficits. Consumers there, he said, will thus spend less. 
 In developing Asia, by contrast, incomes are expected to rise gradually and savings rates to fall as improving health and welfare systems make the region's fast-growing population less determined to save. 
 Taken together, Mr. Schulte said, this means Asian consumers, as a whole, will become more important in global terms -- another example of how the region will become less dependant on the West. 
 Similarly, companies in developing Asian nations tend to have fewer debts -- partly because the region enjoyed several years of strong economic growth. 
 Low corporate and household debts mean governments in the region have had more firepower to pursue aggressive stimulus measures, said Jonathan Garner, head of emerging markets strategy at Morgan Stanley. 
 The Chinese stimulus package of 4 trillion renminbi yuan, or $585 billion, announced last November, has led to a boom in spending and is a major reason why economists are optimistic about China, and about much of the region as a whole. 
 Asia's generally lower debt levels also mean there has been no credit crunch of the kind that has handicapped companies and consumers elsewhere. 
 ''Asia does not have a credit crunch. It has excess liquidity,'' Mr. Neumann of HSBC said. ''The banking system is stuffed with liquidity.'' 
 This is benefiting Asian asset markets -- from stocks to property -- and is leading to a gradual ''financial decoupling'' from the United States and Europe, Mr. Neumann said. 
 ''For the past two decades, equities markets have been driven by Western risk capital, not Asian investors themselves,'' he said. ''Now, you're finding that Asian money is increasingly driving the market.'' 
 Analysts at Merrill Lynch agree. In a recent research note they said the Hong Kong stock market, for example, had performed much better than markets in the United States, and property prices in the city have risen, partly because of capital inflows from mainland China. 
 Of course, none of this means Asia has become completely independent from the rest of the world. Asia remains heavily reliant on exports for economic growth. 
 The result, despite increased ''decoupling,'' is that growth in Asia has slowed down, in some cases sharply. 
 The Indonesian economy, for example, is expected to grow 3.6 percent this year, the Asian Development Bank forecasts. This compares to more than 6 percent in 2008 and 2007. 
 The bank expects the Indian economy to grow to 5 percent this year, and the Chinese economy 7 percent -- down from 7.1 percent and 9 percent, respectively, in 2008. 
 Nor has the effect been uniform. Developed Asian economies, like Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong, are much more tightly tied into the world economy and financial system. All three are in recessions. 
 ''The United States has deep structural problems that are coming home to roost -- Asia hasn't got those, and that has been very, very important,'' says Mr. Garner of Morgan Stanley. 
 ''Emerging Asian nations went into recession last,'' he says. Increasingly, they are looking like they will also to come out first -- and strongest.''

HEADLINE: Rain, Rain, Go Away. Really. Oh, and by the Way, We Hear That Seattle's Nice.

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
I like New York in June ... - ''Babes on Broadway''
 Oh yeah? The city was a soggy mess in June, drenched with rains. There was even a touch on Tuesday, leaving the city close to setting a record before the month floated into history at midnight. Ball fields had flooded and lonely lifeguards had shivered from Coney Island to Orchard Beach. Even a relentless booster like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had to joke: ''It only rained twice this week -- once for three days and once for four days.''
 Worse, you couldn't even call it Seattle-like weather. 
 Seattle was gorgeous.
 For that, Seattle almost had to apologize. ''We're having to explain to people they really are in Seattle,'' said Tom Norwalk, a spokesman for that city's Convention and Visitors Bureau, speaking by telephone. 
 And -- ignominy! -- a Seattle umbrella shop did its best business by shipping east. 
 Central Park was pelted with 10.06 inches of rain for the month through Tuesday afternoon, according to preliminary figures from the National Weather Service, more than twice the average for the month, and close to the record 10.27 inches set in 2003. In contrast, Seattle, known for its precipitation and ''June gloom,'' recorded an almost imperceptible 0.18 inch of rain, one-seventh of the average. 
 And before a sprinkle on June 19 dashed Seattle's hopes for meteorological immortality, it had gone 29 days without rain, tying a local record set in 1982. 
 ''Close, but no cigar,'' lamented Cliff Mass, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington and a weather blogger who chronicled the ''mega-dry'' streak. 
 The Seattle-New York weather seesaw was scarcely coincidental, Dr. Mass said. ''It's usual to have opposite weather,'' he said. ''There's a wavelike pattern to the atmosphere. We are often 180 degrees different.''
 So when Seattle turned nice, New Yorkers were almost destined to suffer. And suffer they did.
 While the rains left the city's parks greener than ever, ''it's been difficult to mow the outfields,'' said Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner. ''The infields hold water -- they're under huge puddles.''
 Beach use in June was way down, Mr. Benepe said, to 735,000 from the usual 2.6 million, according to crowd counts. ''We could get 735,000 on one hot day,'' he said. 
 Presiding over the empty beaches was an augmented army of 1,200 lifeguards, ranks swelled by the financial crisis and the lure of a job, even if just for the summer. ''They're spending a lot of time practicing and sitting huddled under umbrellas,'' the commissioner said. 
 But there was good news as well. ''With rains like this, the parks are especially lush,'' he said. ''They've never been so green. It's a great season for flowers.''
 When the sun has peeked through, people have rushed out. ''If there's 15 minutes of sunshine, they get out to the parks,'' Mr. Benepe said. 
 For their part, Seattleites showed little concern that their city's reputation for dampness might be at stake, and they flocked outdoors. Last weekend the main attraction was the city's first rock 'n' roll marathon, with bands serenading 25,000 marathon runners along the route. A gay pride march and a game by the city's soccer club, the Seattle Sounders, drew large crowds. 
 ''People were everywhere out and about,'' said Christina Donegan, the Chamber of Commerce vice president for communications. 
 Of course, they usually are anyway. ''People out here have a lot of Gore-Tex, and they're ready to use it,'' Dr. Mass said of the popular wet-weather fabric. 
 Actually, New York City averages more rainfall annually than Seattle, 49.69 inches to 37.07 inches, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but Seattle's climate is damper, with more days of rain and mist.
 Mayor Bloomberg looked on the bright side. ''One of the things any mayor is worried about is if the reservoirs are going to empty out,'' he said. ''We took care of it early this year.'' 
 Also, he said, ''There's more to do indoors in New York City than to do in- or outdoors anywhere else.''
 The weather was so nice in Seattle that Bella Umbrella, a shop specializing in renting its 800 vintage models for weddings, might have suffered but for an unexpected boon. ''I've had the best two months I ever had, and a lot of it was because of last-minute orders from the East Coast,'' said Jodell Egbert, the owner. For brides and grooms, she said, she represented ''Plan B.'' 
 And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain. - Creedence Clearwater Revival

HEADLINE: A Times Square for Our Time, Pedestrian in More Ways Than One

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Note to the Department of Transportation: We all appreciate the merits of fast and cheap these days, but surely you can do better by Times Square. 
 Open since late May, the pedestrian mall at Times Square, where the city boldly closed off traffic, has a rough, slipshod feel -- if anything, more slipshod now that the folding lawn chairs the Times Square Alliance provides are starting to show wear and tear, their plastic strips poking out below seats that sag so much they all but touch the ground. With yellow tape roping off discrete areas and the tacky chairs inviting passers-by to have a seat, sections of Broadway now look like something between a crime scene and an audience, which may be an inadvertent tribute to the culture of the space, but does not offer much in the way of aesthetics. 
 Granted, the chairs and orange barrels demarcating the pedestrian space are temporary. In fact, the entire project may be temporary: the city will not decide until December whether to keep the street closed to traffic. In any case, on Tuesday workers began painting parts of the pavement red, and there are plans to add a gravel surface in the coming weeks. 
 But right now, the pedestrian mall, it must be said, looks a little unworthy of New York. The city may be reeling from recession, but the huge orange plastic containers and tatty hardware-store chairs give the sense that it's already letting itself go, like some Lehman Brothers wife who has not just forsaken her golden highlights, but given up on grooming altogether. Surely someone at Ikea could have helped the city ease this transition -- maybe some witty, oversize umbrellas (sure, weighed down), or at least chairs that do not look like they are lonely for the company of pink flamingos. 
 Or maybe the problem is not the quality of the seats. Maybe the problem is all the people sitting in them. New York is a city of walkers, not sitters; a city of motion, not repose. In Times Square, tourists should be looking at New York, caught up in the swarm of activity and lights and commerce and theater; instead, New Yorkers find themselves looking at the tourists, a cordoned-off display of the temporarily sedentary. 
 ''Is that what you think?'' asked Gulshan Mia, 30, who was sitting on one of those chairs between 43rd and 44th Streets one recent morning, listening to music on her iPod. ''But that's because you're from New York.'' Ms. Mia is from South Africa, and was living up until a few months ago in Taiwan; even now, with an apartment in Jersey City, she would not necessarily call herself a New Yorker. 
 But she is not a tourist, either. Ms. Mia works at Toys R Us in Times Square, and is what you might call a pedestrian mall regular. She wakes up every morning a half an hour early just so she can get to Times Square, sit in one of those seats, listen to music and people-watch. She comes there on her work breaks, too. 
 She said she enjoyed the meandering pace of the tourists, and the international sign language of couples bickering over who gets the one chair that's open at any given time. She watches global diplomacy in action as the Germans bum cigarettes from the Italians and the Italians bum a light from the British. At lunchtime, she makes eye contact with fellow nontourists on their lunch breaks. ''I don't know if you know the nod,'' she said. ''I'm starting to feel like I belong now that I get the nod.'' 
 The landscape designer Diana Balmori said she thought of the makeshift mall as a kind of ''tidal marsh,'' a place where the land and water push up against each other, and it is not clear which will take over. For Ms. Balmori, the phrase represents Broadway's new tentative divide between a street for cars and a space for people. It's also an apt description for Times Square itself, a space half-defined by the city and half-defined by the tourists who inhabit it. And it captures the people like Ms. Mia, someone living in New York but not of it, like a few of the other self-described regulars parked in Times Square that morning: a restaurant manager with a thick Argentine accent, a hitchhiker lounging on a chaise who said he lived in New Orleans but summered in Manhattan.
 Sitting beside Ms. Mia, I was starting to rethink my impression of the pedestrian mall, appreciating some of its merits, messy though they may be. But only for a minute. 
 ''I just really like it here,'' she said. ''I find it strangely peaceful.''
 We've come to accept the multitudes of adjectives that rotate in and out of use for Times Square depending on the era: gritty, dangerous, commercial, touristy, kitschy, overpriced, overcrowded, flashy, tacky, corporate. But peaceful? 
 That's just wrong.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Grants California the Right to Enforce Emissions

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that it had granted California the right to enforce its first-in-the-nation standards controlling greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and light trucks. 
 The move reverses a 2008 ruling by the Bush administration and effectively ends a seesaw political battle between automakers and environmental regulators that began in Sacramento eight years ago when the California Legislature first took up the issue.
 Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, said in an interview that she had reversed the ruling by her predecessor, Stephen L. Johnson, because the traditional presumption had been that California, with its history of air pollution, had grounds to establish rules that exceed federal requirements.
 ''The burden is on those that object,'' Ms. Jackson said.
 The immediate impact of the decision, which had been widely anticipated, is more symbolic than practical. The 2009 fleet of new vehicles is already in compliance with the California rules and the 2010 fleet is also expected to meet the requirements, said Tom Cackette, deputy director of California's Air Resources Board.
 ''Auto manufacturers have been making changes to vehicles both because they anticipated they might have to meet California standards and because there was a general interest in public in buying more efficient cars,'' Mr. Cackette said.
 Nationally, about one-third of the greenhouse-gas emissions contributing to climate change come from the transportation sector, most of it from cars and light trucks. 
 The rules in California will cut emissions from new vehicles by 14 percent from 2008 levels in 2011. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have also adopted the California rules in an effort to combat climate change.
 California's emissions rules are also expected to be congruent with new federal fuel economy standards announced in May by the Obama administration. Both standards envision that emissions will be cut by 30 percent in 2016.
 The aligning of California's rules and the federal mileage standards is intended to ensure that automakers comply with a single standard. This ''moves us toward a policy that ensures that consumers in all 50 states have access to highly fuel-efficient vehicles at an affordable price,'' said Dave McCurdy, president and chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.
 Carmakers have accepted the fuel economy and emission standards that they long opposed, at a time when their industry is in crisis and accepting billions of dollars in federal money. 
 In the interview, Ms. Jackson of the E.P.A. praised Fran Pavley, the state senator from California who originally crafted the early blueprint for the state standards in 2001. 
 Ms. Pavley was jubilant Tuesday. 
 ''It took eight years, multiple federal courts, the U.S. Supreme Court, two presidents, two governors and a partridge in a pear tree,'' she said in an interview. ''What a difference that last presidential election made.''

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Says China Is Giving It Loans

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER and MICHAEL WINES; Celia W. Dugger reported from Johannesburg, and Michael Wines from Beijing.

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG 

 BODY:
Zimbabwe's prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, said Tuesday that an official he had appointed had secured lines of credit worth $950 million from China, President Robert Mugabe's longtime ally.
 Mr. Mugabe's party has mocked Mr. Tsvangirai for failing to bring home much aid from his three-week tour of the United States and Europe. Zimbabwe's government -- a virtually bankrupt contraption led by Mr. Mugabe and his rival, Mr. Tsvangirai -- needs an estimated $8 billion to rebuild the country's ruined economy. 
 The West has been leery of giving the government a large infusion of money until Mr. Mugabe stops the human rights abuses that have been a fixture of his 29 years in power. China, however, has maintained its close relationship with Zimbabwe as it has extended its financial ties to other nations in Africa. 
 Mr. Tsvangirai said Tuesday that the finance minister he had appointed, Tendai Biti, had negotiated the loan package with China. Details of the deal were scant, and Chinese officials could not be reached to confirm the deal or to comment on it. 
 Officials close to Mr. Tsvangirai said they believed that at least some of the financing would be provided on the condition that the money was spent on Chinese goods, like fertilizer.
 ''It is available for the procurement of goods from China -- that is my understanding,'' said Ian Makone, an aide to Mr. Tsvangirai.
 Eddie Cross, a senior official in Mr. Tsvangirai's party, said he dined with the Chinese ambassador last week and was told the lines of credit would include favorable terms for infrastructure projects and commercial ones to buy Chinese goods.
 Mr. Tsvangirai, who won more votes than Mr. Mugabe in last year's presidential election but was forced out of a runoff by brutal, state-sponsored attacks on his supporters, reluctantly agreed to share power with Mr. Mugabe five months ago. The two men and their parties are now jockeying for political advantage ahead of an election still to be scheduled.
 Defense Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, who ran Mr. Mugabe's violent re-election campaign last year, was himself leading a delegation of officials from the governing party, ZANU-PF, in Beijing on Tuesday. An official in China's Politburo assured the delegation that China's longstanding policy of investing in Zimbabwe was unchanged.
 ''We will encourage and facilitate more Chinese companies to seek development in Zimbabwe,'' said Zhou Yongkang, the Politburo member.
 China and Zimbabwe have been close since Beijing supported Mr. Mugabe's military campaign against white rule in the 1970s. In recent years, China has helped prop up the country's economy as other foreign investors fled. Chinese firms have contributed, sold or bartered arms, airplanes, buses, hydroelectric generators and other goods to Zimbabwe, including equipment to eavesdrop on telephone conversations. China also supplied an elaborate blue tile ceiling for Mr. Mugabe's mansion in Harare, the capital.
 The warm greetings Mr. Tsvangirai received from leaders in the United States and Europe, including President Obama and Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, rankled Mr. Mugabe, who is blocked from traveling to the West by sanctions, along with most of his ruling clique. 
 The Herald, the state-run newspaper that is Mr. Mugabe's mouthpiece, reported in June that the government had considered recalling Mr. Tsvangirai, but that Mr. Mugabe had decided that doing so would be too drastic. The ZANU-PF Politburo condemned Western countries for refusing to lift the sanctions and said national unity was ''worth more than the conditional financial pittances from the West.''
 Mr. Tsvangirai said Tuesday that his trip had netted pledges of almost $500 million in assistance from Western nations. The details ''will be released in due course,'' he said.
 Some analysts were skeptical of the amount he said he had raised in new aid. Zimbabwe, racked by hunger and disease in recent years, has received hundreds of millions of dollars annually in humanitarian assistance from the West, almost all of it dispensed through international organizations and charities, not the government. 
 Mr. Tsvangirai's trip seems to have aggravated tensions between the two political parties -- and even within Mr. Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change. Mr. Tsvangirai himself was relatively mild in his criticism of Mr. Mugabe while he was abroad, insisting that the 85-year-old president was an essential part of the solution to Zimbabwe's political crisis, as well as part of the problem.

HEADLINE: The News on Yao Shakes The Rockets' Foundation

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
The makeshift Houston Rockets pushed the Los Angeles Lakers harder than any other team in the playoffs. The Rockets might have lacked multiple stars, but in their place was resolve. Now the team seems to be star-crossed as the free-agency period begins.
 Houston, built upon the marquee names of Yao Ming, Tracy McGrady and Ron Artest, may not have any of them when next season begins, either because of injury, rebuilding or free agency. 
Yao, whose injury history is nearly as lengthy as his 7-foot-6-inch frame, sustained a hairline fracture in his left foot during the second-round series against the Lakers. 
 The initial diagnosis said that Yao would be sidelined 8 to 12 weeks. But the team physician Tom Clanton told The Houston Chronicle on Monday that the foot had yet to heal correctly. 
 ''At this point, the injury has the potential for him missing this next season and could be career- threatening,'' Clanton said.
 As the free-agency period begins Wednesday, the condition of Yao, who is seeking multiple medical opinions and considering several treatment options, could drastically alter the future of the Rockets, who were on the cusp as perennial challengers from the Western Conference.
 Yao played 77 games last season, averaging 19.7 points and 9.9 rebounds. In three previous injury-hampered seasons, he averaged only 53 games.
 When healthy, Yao is a dominating center and a team building block. But those blueprints may be shredded and Houston General Manager Daryl Morey may be facing a rebuilding period.Morey has met with Marcin Gortat, the Orlando Magic's backup center who is a restricted free agent.
 Entering next season, the bulk of the Rockets' payroll, which is approximately $65 million, is consumed by Yao's $16.39 million salary and McGrady's $22.48 million.
 McGrady is recovering from a season-ending injury -- microfracture surgery on his left knee -- and is scheduled to resume basketball-related workouts in the next few weeks. The Rockets have explored trades to free themselves of McGrady's contract, and a move could be hastened because of Yao's injury and the need to add frontcourt depth.
 Artest, the lone member of the three to finish the season on the court, is an unrestricted free agent. With a weak economy that all but mandates that teams be conscious of payroll, Artest's asking price may be deemed high. 
 But after a career marked with erratic behavior, Artest settled in well with the Rockets last season. David Bauman, Artest's agent, told The Chronicle that his preference was to remain with Houston. 
 Artest earned $7.4 million last season. Before his trade to Houston, Artest could have opted out of his contract and tested free agency last summer, but chose not to. Artest said he regretted the decision while watching Elton Brand and Baron Davis land big contracts after opting out of their contracts.
 ''We know what we want,'' Bauman said. ''I think the market will support that. Our first choice is to sit down with those guys. He wants to come back to Houston. That's his first choice. We have to balance all those considerations, as does Houston.''
 Another consequence of Yao's status is that the Rockets may become players in the 2010 free-agent sweepstakes for the possibility of acquiring a frontcourt player like the Toronto Raptors' Chris Bosh.
 Rebounds
 Utah's Carlos Boozer bypassed free agency, a hint of the current sour economic climate awaiting this year's free-agent class. Last season, he told ESPN that he would become a free agent and bypass the last season of his contract with the Jazz, in which he is owed $12.7 million. His decision not to opt out is an indication that he could not top the salary in the open market.

HEADLINE: A Trying Time in Housing for Elderly

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md. 

 BODY:
Housing for the elderly that offers fully equipped apartments, communal meals, social activities and access to health care has traditionally come in only two models. Residents could rent their units on a monthly basis, or they could pay a large entrance fee that would be partly or largely refundable when they moved out or died.
 An elegant new Craftsman-style condominium development in this Washington suburb represents a third model; it was intended to give affluent people 60 years or older or their heirs a rare opportunity to benefit from appreciating real estate values. Conceived when housing prices were escalating rapidly, the $300 million project, known as Fox Hill, has 240 units ranging in price from $557,000 to $1.8 million.
 Situated on 16 wooded acres adjacent to the exclusive (all-male) Burning Tree golf club, Fox Hill has an array of resortlike features, including four restaurants, a salon and spa, a recording studio, an art studio and an indoor driving range. It also has a full-service bank branch, a pet salon and a wine cellar for residents' use. 
 The light-filled condo units range in size from 830 to 2,140 square feet. They have nine-foot ceilings, gas fireplaces, large closets, crown moldings and washers and dryers. Only features like the emergency call system in the units and the unobtrusive handrails in the corridors suggest that the project caters to an older population.
 Yet Fox Hill is struggling to fill up. Only 54 units have closed in the six months since the project was completed, said Don Shulman, the general manager. The average age of the 79 residents is 78. In an effort to attract more people in their early 70s, the project is being rebranded from ''Fox Hill: A Fine Senior Condominium Community'' to ''Fox Hill Club and Residences,'' he said. 
 Experts in senior housing say there could hardly have been a worse moment to introduce a new concept. ''These are untested waters,'' said Stephen M. Monroe, managing editor of the Senior Care Investor, a trade publication. ''It's a high-end condo, which is unusual, and this is the worst economy in 50 years, which is also unusual.''
 Occupancy has been slipping for all types of senior housing, as elderly people find it difficult to sell their homes. The sector's occupancy rate in the first quarter was 89.2 percent, a decline of two percentage points from the same period last year, according to the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing and Care Industry. 
 A marketing challenge at Fox Hill stems from the problems faced by the project's developer and co-owner, Sunrise Senior Living, a publicly traded company based in McLean, Va., which grew rapidly and is trying to stave off bankruptcy.
 Once regarded as the industry's gold standard, Sunrise has taken various steps to streamline its portfolio, reduce administrative costs and restructure its debt under its new chief executive, Mark S. Ordan. ''We hope that we have shown our banks that we are being very forthright and are working through our issues to strengthen the company,'' he said. The company operates about 400 properties.
 In the latest blow to the company, HCP Inc., a real estate investment trust based in Long Beach, Calif., that owns senior-housing properties, asked a Delaware court on Monday for permission to terminate 64 management contracts with Sunrise. James F. Flaherty III, the chief executive of HCP, accused Sunrise of taking excessive fees, failing to stick to budgets, and failing to disclose transactions with vendors that were not arm's-length. HCP has already canceled 26 other management contracts with Sunrise. 
 Mr. Ordan denied the allegations in the lawsuit and accused HCP of trying to cancel the management contracts in order to operate the properties more cheaply. ''We've been good managers, and we have contracts in force,'' he said. ''We are not going to back off, cave in and put our residents in harm's way.'' Mr. Ordan, a former gourmet-grocery executive who specializes in trying to rescue troubled companies, replaced Paul J. Klaassen, a co-founder of the Sunrise. Widely admired as a pioneer in senior housing, Mr. Klaassen became mired in accounting and governance problems in recent years. 
 Mr. Klaassen had initiated the condo development in the hope of replicating the apartments-for-life concept from the Netherlands, where residents are able to stay put as their frailty increases by bringing services into their home. Initially, Mr. Klaassen planned a half-dozen condo developments across the country, but only Fox Hill was developed. In 2006, Sunrise sold two-thirds of its interest in the project to other investors.
 Authorities in senior housing say that while the condo concept is not entirely new, only a handful of others exist, including the Jefferson in Arlington, Va., which is also operated by Sunrise but is priced much lower.
 At Fox Hill, condo owners have ready access to home health care (at an extra cost). Also within the building are 83 assisted-living units, which Sunrise runs under the traditional rental model. A person with dementia, for example, could receive more intensive care there but still remain in close proximity to a spouse or partner living in a condo. In contrast to the condos, the assisted-living units have filled up fast, with half now occupied, Mr. Shulman said. Residents pay an average of $8,000 a month for their units, three meals a day and other services.
 Though condo dwellers own their units, the development does not operate like a traditional condo building. The service areas, including the restaurants, are owned by a series of partnerships, and are not controlled by the homeowners association. Condo owners pay monthly charges ranging from $2,300 to $4,300, depending on the size of the unit, of which $600 is set aside for food and entertainment. The money is drawn down at the resident's discretion, much as at a country club. 
 In building Fox Hill, Sunrise made extensive use of costly finishes, including slate, granite, stone and walnut. Andy Coelho, the vice president for construction, said the project cost nearly twice as much a square foot as a traditional Sunrise development. Delays and changes to the project resulted in $51.1 million in cost overruns, according to public documents.
 Will the senior condo concept catch on when the market recovers? Robert G. Kramer, the president of the National Investment Center, said many in the industry were waiting to determine how the current downturn in real estate values would affect older people's attitudes about ownership. ''It's going to be very interesting to see what this does to the psyche of the senior,'' he said.
 Some Fox Hill residents said the opportunity to own their real estate was far less important to them than the project's location, setting, services and opportunities for social interaction. ''I think it's a good investment, but I wasn't really concerned about that,'' said Elias Eliasof, 88, a widower who divided his time between Bergen County, N.J., and Singer Island, Fla. 
 But to Thaddeus and Mary Jean Lindner of Boynton Beach, Fla., who spend half the year in the Washington area, having ownership of their new home was essential. ''I haven't rented since college,'' said Mr. Lindner, 83, who sold an apartment at the Watergate complex before moving into a two-bedroom condo at Fox Hill overlooking the golf course, of which he is a member. 
 ''It's like being at a Ritz-Carlton in Colorado with all of the amenities that they offer,'' said Mr. Lindner, who still works at his commercial parking business in Washington. ''Except that we live here, and we have equity.''

HEADLINE: Climate in the Senate

 BODY:
The House's approval last week of a bill capping greenhouse gases was a remarkable achievement, almost unthinkable six months ago. Yet all of the hard work -- the hearings, the negotiating, the arm-twisting -- will add up to zero if the Senate cannot be persuaded to do the same, and preferably better. The country would be left with an outdated energy policy and the planet would be stuck with steadily rising emissions. 
 The Senate will not be an easy sell. It has rejected less ambitious climate bills before. While 60 filibuster-proof votes are needed, only 45 Senators mostly Democrats, can be counted as yes or probably yes. There are 23 fence-sitters and very little Republican support. 
 Despite federal studies suggesting that the costs to businesses, consumers and the economy will be minimal, the Republican leadership continues to claim that the bill will cause an unacceptable rise in energy prices. 
 Democratic leaders should nevertheless resist calls to weaken the targets on emissions reductions. The House bill is itself a compromise, and a weaker Senate bill could be worse than no bill at all. 
 The Senate should also remove the House version's more glaring defects. Among these is a provision -- inserted at the insistence of the farm lobby -- that would postpone a systematic accounting of the carbon emissions from biofuels like corn ethanol. The farm lobby and its allies on the Agriculture Committee are clearly nervous that the accounting would cast corn ethanol in an unfavorable light.
 Another flaw is a last-minute provision imposing a mandatory tariff on imports from countries that do not adopt comparable systems for limiting global warming gases. The original bill would have left that to the president's discretion. The mandatory tariff would not take effect until 2020, but the provision could fan already dangerous protectionist sentiments overseas. The Senate should restore the president's discretionary power. 
 There is much to commend in the House bill. It seeks a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gases from 2005 levels by 2020 and an 80 percent reduction by midcentury -- the minimum, according to most scientists, required to avert the worst consequences of climate change. The bill also provides money for developing more energy-efficient vehicles and buildings and other steps that would provide even bigger and faster reductions in global warming emissions.
 We hope for even better in the Senate. What there cannot be is backsliding. Global negotiations to replace the expiring Kyoto agreement on climate change resume in the fall. The world is waiting for the United States, after years of indifference, to take a strong leadership role. So is the American public.

HEADLINE: In 2nd Quarter, Markets Revived but Pessimism Remained

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The good news is that Wall Street finished its best quarter in years on Tuesday -- part of a dizzy spree that lifted the broad market 35 percent since early March. 
 The not-so-good news? It would take almost three more rallies like that to push the Dow Jones industrial average back to 14,000 and return markets to where they were before the financial crisis. On Wall Street -- where exuberance, irrational and otherwise, is usually an art form -- there is a nagging fear that the market is again losing its footing.
 Despite signs that this downturn is easing, many Americans are more downbeat about the economy now than they were when the stock rally began. Unemployment is rising. Home prices are falling. Many corporate earnings are still weak. 
 ''Less-worse isn't the same as better,'' said Barry Ritholtz, chief executive of FusionIQ, a research firm. ''We want to see 'good.' In order to grow profits, in order for earnings to increase, in order for corporate America to start hiring and spending, we need to see greener shoots. So far that hasn't really happened.''
 If consumers continue to guard their money and banks sustain more losses from foreclosures, credit card defaults and losses in commercial real estate, analysts say that stock markets will face huge obstacles to growth that could keep investors in the doldrums for many more months. 
 Yet by almost any measure, the second quarter was one for the record books. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 15.2 percent in the second quarter. The Dow Jones industrials gained 11 percent in the quarter, while the Nasdaq composite index soared 20 percent. 
 Many blue-chip stocks posted spectacular gains. Bank of America soared 94 percent. American Express gained 71 percent. Microsoft was up 29 percent. 
 But some analysts sense the euphoria is tempered. Markets ended basically flat for the month of June, pulled in different directions by economic figures showing improvement and those revealing unexpected weakness.
 Trading on Tuesday underscored those wobbles. The Dow Jones average fell 82.38 points, or 0.97 percent, to 8,447. The broader S.& P. 500 slid 7.91 points, or 0.85 percent, to 919.32. Gains in some technology shares kept losses on the Nasdaq to 9.02 points, or 0.49 percent. It declined to 1,835.04.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 14/32, to 96 20/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose 3.53 percent, from 3.48 percent Monday.
 Bullish forecasters say the S.& P. 500, which is up 1.8 percent for 2009, will continue to rise as the economy bottoms out, and close the year at 1,050 or 1,100. But bears say that taxpayer aid is still holding up the financial system, and they warn that investors who expect better returns may be in for a bitter disappointment.
 ''We feel like we're entitled to go back up again,'' said David Tice, a prominent Wall Street bear. ''We went from the telecom bubble to the Internet bubble to the corporate finance bubble to the real estate bubble. Now each of those has broken. We have never been more convinced that the worst is not yet over.''
 Some analysts say that stocks may simply rise and fall fitfully in the months -- or years -- to come without making broader progress, as they did from the mid-1960s to the mid-'70s. And they say that investors who once bought and held stocks or pieces of index funds and rode them higher will need to devise different investment strategies.
 ''The market is going to be range-bound for this year and going into next year,'' said Mary Ann Bartels, head of technical and market analysis at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. ''Is the market still investable? Our answer is yes.'' 
 Some investors say energy companies and basic-materials producers will lead the markets as commodity prices rise. Others like technology firms, emerging markets or any company that offers a dividend and is not steeped in debt. 
 Unemployment is at 9.4 percent, and economists expect it will rise to 9.6 percent when the Labor Department releases its June employment figures on Thursday. Private wages and salaries are continuing to fall, and Americans are saving more money as they try to hedge against job losses.
 All of which, say some analysts, could mean slower growth in consumer spending, corporate earnings and stock prices in the months to come.
 ''We'd all like our stocks to go up,'' said Mr. Tice, the bear. ''But now's the time to defend ourselves.''
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week and 52-week bills:

HEADLINE: Lawmakers In Indiana Pass Budget By Deadline

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
Indiana lawmakers beat their deadline and passed a state budget early Tuesday evening, but in five other states, budget deals for the 2010 fiscal year remained in limbo, as legislators made last-minute efforts to avert shutdowns. 
 All but four of the 50 states are supposed to have their budgets in place by Wednesday, the start of their fiscal year. With the deadline looming, Arizona, California, Mississippi, North Carolina and Pennsylvania had not yet done so. In Pennsylvania, state officials said they would not be shutting down services, at least not for several days. But Arizona lawmakers, unable to reconcile a $4 billion shortfall, faced a high likelihood of cuts to nonessential state services on Wednesday.
 Indiana had been bracing for a broad shutdown that could have left as many as 30,000 state employees temporarily out of work, a state official said. 
 The budget sessions have been especially stressful this year, as most states experienced severe revenue shortfalls because of the worst recession in 60 years. 
 ''A lot of states had already cut spending, and then revenues continued to come in lower than expectations,'' said Brian Sigritz, a staff associate at the National Association of State Budget Officers. ''States are looking at having to go back after making cuts to make additional cuts.''
 In California, where lawmakers were trying to close a $24 billion deficit, it seemed that the state might be forced to issue I.O.U.'s as soon as Thursday to vendors, private contractors and local governments providing social services. The state's controller, John Chiang, has said California is facing ''a cash shortfall not seen since the Great Depression'' and has exhausted all other financial options for paying its bills. 
 But such warnings had not yet broken a legislative stalemate in Sacramento, where a two-thirds majority is needed to pass a budget. Democrats, who control both houses of the Legislature but lack the supermajority, had several proposals rejected by Republicans, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who threatened to veto any bill that included new taxes. In North Carolina, legislators passed a bill that would enable the government to continue to function in the event that a budget was not passed in time. Lawmakers there face a $4.7 billion shortfall. 
 Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania met with the leaders of legislative caucuses late Tuesday to go through the budget line by line, hoping to close a $3.2 billion gap.
 Chuck Ardo, a spokesman for Mr. Rendell, said state agencies would keep working even if the budget was overdue. 
 ''State employees will continue working,'' Mr. Ardo said, ''but their paydays will be delayed if the budget is not passed within a reasonable amount of time. Citizens should not notice any lingering effects from the budget impasse.''

Making Music 
 To Start a Revival 
 Car sales in the United States are in a funk. Even with a strong June, the current annualized rate of about 10 million vehicles sold will not be enough to compensate for scrapped cars and population growth. 
 Yet the best investment play on an American recovery may not be a car company or parts maker. Instead, it may be SiriusXM, the company that operates the subscription satellite radio service. 
 This is partly a process of elimination. Two of Detroit's Big Three -- Chrysler and General Motors -- are in bankruptcy. Ford is, of course, an investment option. But some 40 percent of Ford's sales come from abroad, so it's not a pure play on the domestic market. And while there are domestic parts companies, the industry pressures they face make them look like very risky investments.
 Now consider Sirius XM. Its services are available only in North America. Nearly all of the $2.4 billion in sales the company should rack up this year come from car owners. They pay around $17 a month to listen to some or all of its 300 channels, and plenty of new cars come with free trials to hook new subscribers. So Sirius XM, which has suffered with the auto industry's downturn, may now be set to benefit from any recovery. 
 Suppose the company can increase its 19 million subscribers by 15 percent a year over the next 10 years, to about 75 million. That's fast, but credible. That would still account for less than a third of all vehicles on the road today. In contrast, more than 80 percent of all homes have pay television services like cable or satellite. 
 Investors currently value cable TV subscribers at about $1,000 each, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Satellite radio subscriptions cost less than half those of television, so let's assume that each subscriber may be worth $450. At 75 million customers, that's a total value of some $34 billion by 2019, ignoring the effects of inflation.
 Discount that back by 15 percent a year to account for the time value of money and the uncertainty of reaching ambitious subscriber targets, and Sirius XM's business could be worth about $8.3 billion today. After subtracting debt and accounting for warrants owned by the media mogul John Malone, that equates to about $5.9 billion of equity value, or around 93 cents a share. That leaves room for today's stock price to more than double. 
 Of course, the company has disappointed shareholders before. But investors keen to wager on the domestic auto industry's rebound may want to switch on the radio.
 Keeping a Safe Haven 
 The Swiss National Bank is not pleased about the speculation in the Swiss franc in currency markets. Several times since March, the bank has stepped in by suddenly selling francs to buy dollars or euros. Each time, the value of the franc has plunged. 
 Official interventions in currency markets often misfire. The speculators win, leaving central banks nursing losses. But the central banks that lose are usually trying to prop their currencies up. The Swiss National Bank is trying to keep a strong one from becoming still stronger. So far, its attacks have scored easily. 
 Investors' goals and those of the Swiss National Bank clash. Foreigners like the Swiss franc as a safe haven, but the last thing Switzerland needs is a stronger franc. That would reduce the price of imported goods, exacerbating deflation. As it is, prices are expected to fall by 0.5 percent this year. 
 The Swiss National Bank's threshold appears to be at an exchange rate of 1.5 francs to the euro. The central bank's intervention this week quickly sent the rate up to 1.53. Something similar happened last week. Traders were left reeling. 
 Swiss currency policy ties in with monetary policy that aims to prevent deflation from becoming worse. The bank has almost tripled the monetary base in the last year. But the money isn't being put to use. Credit is still tight, but it would be worse without the monetary expansion. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development suggested last week that the Swiss should add more fiscal stimulus to their weaponry. But as the United States and Britain are showing, fiscal stimulus can quickly rack up deficits and debt. The Swiss are right to see monetary policy as more flexible, potent and reversible. And their currency interventions will do no harm at all. ROBERT CYRAN and IAN CAMPBELL

HEADLINE: A Small Player Breaks Into Starbucks

BYLINE: By KELLY K. SPORS

 BODY:
Daniel Lubetzky, a social entrepreneur who has started several food ventures, always hoped to sell his company's KIND Fruit + Nut Bars in Starbucks Coffee stores -- a chain whose values and consumers he felt meshed with his own. So in the five years since starting KIND, he took every opportunity to introduce himself to Starbucks executives, promoting his company's success in e-mail messages to them and sending them samples of his bars.
 The executives, he says, ''were always very polite,'' but they never bought the bars. Until now.
 On Tuesday, Starbucks began selling three flavors of KIND bars at its registers as part of a campaign to revamp its menu with more healthful fare. The bars, with flavors like Mango Macadamia, are combinations of dried fruits and nuts bound together by honey. They are made, the company says, with whole natural ingredients rather than paste, and they are selling for $1.95 at Starbucks. 
 ''This is such a huge break,'' says Mr. Lubetzky, whose company generated about $15 million in revenue last year. ''Now we just have to show we can make it work.''
 Many entrepreneurs dream of placing their products with major retailers. But it can be a tough sell for small companies without a well-known brand name.
 ''The primary motivation of any big retailer is to get more dollars per square foot,'' says H. David Hennessey, a marketing professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. ''You have to show them very clearly and effectively how you can achieve that for them.'' 
 Big product makers have a clear advantage, Professor Hennessey says, because they can usually offer multiple product lines at lower prices and already have inventory management systems in place. Smaller companies must compete on price with major brands, but also be unusual enough to make them worth the retailer's investment.
 Just getting that first meeting can be a challenge. In 2003, Tom Szaky, co-founder of a start-up, TerraCycle, which sells fertilizer made from worm excrement, dialed up Wal-Mart's fertilizer buyer every day for three weeks straight until the buyer finally answered his phone. 
 Knowing he had just a few seconds to win him over, he told the buyer he had developed an ecologically friendly fertilizer that is cheaper to produce than the major brands. Intrigued, the buyer invited him to Wal-Mart headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., where the buyer agreed to give TerraCycle a shot. 
 But breaking into the big leagues does not come without risk. Some retailers demand that new suppliers redesign their packaging and change how they handle shipping and inventory, even while facing the risk that their product could be pulled at any time.
 Jamie Bird of Grand Rapids, Mich., was contacted by Target after her Wet Happened? diaper bags were featured on a blog for parents in the summer of 2007. A buyer for the chain invited Ms. Bird -- who had been hand-sewing the bags from her basement -- to join Target's Parent Inventors program, which gives products made by and for parents a 12-week test run in Target stores.
 Ms. Bird flew to Minneapolis at her own expense for a one-day orientation program. Among the many required steps, Ms. Bird was told to design new packaging for her bags, find a manufacturer, contract with a warehouse that used Target's specified electronic inventory system, and buy a $5 million insurance policy with liability coverage. Ms. Bird estimates she spent $22,000 to get ready for the Parent Inventors program before Target placed its first order.
 ''They have all these hoops you have to jump through just to start selling,'' she said. ''I was getting sick just thinking about how much I was spending and worrying that my bags wouldn't sell.'' Ms. Bird says the test run worked out well, but she is still waiting to hear whether the retailer will continue selling the bags.
 Mr. Lubetzky's attempts to win over Starbucks took far longer. After first offering KIND bars in 2004, he primarily focused on getting them into natural foods stores, like Whole Foods. His sales team would occasionally call Starbucks buyers to gauge interest, with little success. He gave bars to some mutual friends of Starbucks's chief executive, Howard Schultz, but says he never heard if Mr. Schultz tried them.
 Then, in 2007, Mr. Lubetzky spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, about his philanthropic work through his PeaceWorks Foundation, which strives to bring peace to Middle Eastern countries by building commercial food ventures. (Mr. Lubetzky channels 5 percent of the profit from his businesses to the foundation.)
 At Davos, he reconnected with a Starbucks director of international business development he had met previously who was also speaking at the forum. They became friends, and when Mr. Lubetzky went to Seattle on other business a few months later, the executive offered to give him a tour of Starbucks headquarters. Mr. Lubetzky used the tour as an opportunity to meet executives and hand out samples of KIND bars.
 The visit led to an e-mail correspondence with Starbucks's food and beverage chief, who complimented the bars, but said Starbucks still was not inclined to sell nutrition bars. She asked him to keep in touch, so he sent her occasional e-mail messages about KIND bars' publicity and growth. The company sold roughly 15 million bars in 2008, double what it sold in 2007. (It expects sales to double again this year.)
 In the fall of 2008, Mr. Lubetzky read in an article that Starbucks was rethinking its food strategies. Seeing an opening, he sent an e-mail message to the executive reminding her of KIND and noting a Yale pilot study indicating that eating two KIND bars a day can help people lose weight. It turned out the executive had left Starbucks, but she put Mr. Lubetzky in touch with yet another former Starbucks executive and social entrepreneur, Peter Thum, who had sold his company, Ethos Water, to Starbucks in 2005.
 Mr. Thum helped Mr. Lubetzky arrange a phone call with Starbucks's global merchandise vice president, Julie Felss Masino. Mr. Lubetzky sent her a PowerPoint presentation with background information about KIND's philosophy and growth. 
 To his surprise, Ms. Masino sounded upbeat and said KIND seemed to fit nicely with Starbucks's new plans. The company is introducing an array of healthier and lighter foods and baked items, including salads, smoothies and fruit muffins. ''She said they were changing their strategy and so all of a sudden we fit,'' he recalled.
 Things moved quickly from there. Starbucks soon agreed to buy more than 500,000 bars for its roughly 7,000 company-owned stores in the United States, and KIND had to figure out how to get its current manufacturers to turn out product quicker. The company is now in the process of building a new manufacturing plant.
 The next big challenge will be keeping the bars in Starbucks. Mr. Lubetzky says he is giving free bars to all Starbucks baristas, and he is also considering a promotional program that would give customers a KIND bar from Starbucks when they perform a kind act.
 It probably will be several weeks before Mr. Lubetzky knows how his bars are selling, but he visited a Starbucks in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday, grabbed a chicken sandwich with chipotle and introduced himself to the barista: ''She said she'd already sold a few bars.''
 Jenny McCabe, a Starbucks spokeswoman, says the company believes KIND is a ''wonderful fit'' for the company's new healthy-food campaign, but she offered no assurances: ''It's up to our customers to determine the role KIND bars will play in our stores moving forward.''

HEADLINE: Regulator Reviews Troubles In Municipal Bond Securities

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced Tuesday that it was ''conducting sweeps'' of firms involved in several recent municipal bond collapses with an eye toward future investigations and possible disciplinary actions. 
 The regulator, known as Finra, an industry-funded group that polices Wall Street, is seeking information from financial firms involved in several recent market problems -- firms that underwrote securities tied to derivatives that were sold to municipalities and those that sold so-called municipal gas bonds that were guaranteed by the defunct Lehman Brothers and are now distressed securities. 
 The sweeps are part of a new scrutiny of the $2.7 trillion municipal bond market, which has been shaken by a rise in defaults and increased pressure from a weakened economy. Finra will be looking at a broad range of practices, including interactions with retail investors, and will collect data on sales, marketing, pricing, disclosure and consumer complaints. 
 ''Finra is taking concerted action to ensure that investors are aware of both the risks and the benefits that might be associated with a muni bond investment,'' said Richard G. Ketchum, chief executive of Finra. 
 Highly complex instruments like derivatives were often marketed to municipalities as a way to lower their borrowing costs through variable rate securities. But in many cases, these securities have had the opposite effect. 
 One case involves Jefferson County, Ala., which now faces bankruptcy after its interest on $3 billion of adjustable rate debt, rather than being lowered, rose to 10 percent. 
 In the case of the gas bonds, Finra is seeking information from firms that sold the bonds to retail investors. The bonds were underwritten and guaranteed by Lehman Brothers, and quickly lost value when they, too, became distressed securities.

HEADLINE: Bank Woes Deepening In Europe

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
When the financial crisis struck the global economy last autumn, European governments moved swiftly to keep their biggest banks from falling into an abyss -- never mind fears over nationalization. 
 But now, as big banks on this side of the Atlantic show signs of recovery, a number of their counterparts overseas are sinking into a spiral of deepening losses that has prompted the European Union to consider a more aggressive approach to cleaning up its banking system.
 Few people outside Belgium have ever heard of KBC Bank. But the travails of this lender, based in Brussels, highlight the broader challenges Europe is facing by not having more fully confronted the deteriorating health of its financial institutions. 
 Since October, KBC Bank has had to seek government relief three times. In all, it has received $41.5 billion in financing and guarantees to recover from disastrous mortgage bets that its financial engineers and traders made when times were good. For a bank with a balance sheet of just $425 billion, it is an astounding sum, exceeding the bailout of the Royal Bank of Scotland. 
 KBC is not alone. Souring loans and festering portfolios of securitized mortgages still plague a number of national banks.
 Moody's, the rating agency that recently issued a warning about the credit risk at 30 Spanish banks, is expected to lower its outlook for the Greek banking sector because of a sharp rise in nonperforming loans. In Ireland, the nationalized Anglo-Irish Bank still has a contaminated loan book that has emerged as threat to the country's sovereign credit rating. 
 Nonperforming loans at Russian banks are even more worrisome, composing about 10 percent of the average bank's books, a figure expected to balloon to 25 percent by the end of the year, forcing banks to raise as much as $80 billion in new capital. And in Sweden, the imploding Latvian economy has hobbled Swedbank, a huge provider of loans in the Baltics. 
 Scott Bugie, a European bank analyst at Standard & Poor's, said it would be ''a multiyear process'' for these and other European banks to improve their capital positions and return to sound financial footing. He predicted that bad loan write-offs at Europe's 50 largest banks would double next year. 
 The growing losses have raised calls for several new approaches, including a more aggressive approach by the European Union to diagnose banks' creditworthiness. Now, regulators are debating whether to impose a regionwide stress test for banks, like the ones the United States required of its 19 largest banks. 
 But the European proposals have raised questions bordering on incredulity with some critics.
 ''This has the feel of a Magritte painting,'' said Karel Lannoo, chief executive of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, comparing the European Commission's approach with the surrealism of the Belgian painter. ''This is Belgium's third-largest bank,'' he said of KBC, ''and it has had three successive rounds of aid, and they still can't target the problem.'' 
 KBC does not fit the profile of the classic overreaching bank. Its core business is serving Belgian corporations and individual investors. But as the credit boom approached its zenith, a small team of designers of exotic securitized investments pushed the envelope much further. 
 Whether it was manufacturing high-yielding collateralized debt obligations, leveraged lending to hedge funds or buying up life insurance policies and securitizing them, these bankers, based in London and New York, cultivated an anything-goes aura that was at odds with the bosses in Brussels. 
 So eager were KBC salesmen to sell high-reward products like collateralized debt obligations that they effectively promised risk-free returns, which lured a number of nonexpert investors. 
 A group of European companies that said it was told that the investments were marketed as risk-free is suing the bank. 
 Luc Philips, the chief financial and risk officer of KBC, said, ''the decisions made by KBC FP were preapproved and vetted by the market and credit risk committees at the KBC Group headquarters in Brussels.'' As for the lawsuits, Viviane Huybrecht, a spokeswoman, said the bank was examining them on a case-by-case basis. 
 The financial products team leaders, Darren Carter and Thomas Korossy, came to KBC in 1999 when the bank bought the equity derivatives business from D. E. Shaw, an American hedge fund. 
 The atmosphere was loose and geared toward risk-taking. Employees would come to meetings dressed in shorts and flip-flops, and if a business proposal did not meet the internal standard of a 22 percent return, it was discarded, former executives say. 
 Angry investors claim the unit was unsupervised. They point to the bank's unusual practice of combining the roles of chief financial and chief risk officer, a policy that is in stark contrast to the most basic of corporate governance standards. In an interview, Mr. Carter said the bank's collateralized debt obligations were of the highest quality, and were insured by the bond insurer MBIA. 
 When the mortgage market collapsed in late 2007, KBC, which had one of the highest ratios of collateralized debt obligations to bank capital of any institution in Europe, soon found itself close to insolvency. In October 2008 and again this January, KBC received 7 billion euros in public funds. When MBIA said in February that it could not pay off on its riskier positions, KBC was suddenly responsible for another 14.5 billion euros in collateralized debt obligations. 
 In May, Andre Bergen, the chief executive, turned to the government again, this time for a bailout of 22.5 billion euros. 
 The week before the latest infusion was announced, Mr. Bergen, 60, was rushed to the hospital for open-heart surgery. Late Tuesday, the bank said it was splitting the role of chief financial officer and chief risk officer, and that Mr. Bergen would step down permanently to recover, to be replaced by the interim chief Jan Vanhevel. Another crucial player, Guido Segers, resigned as the head of merchant banking, and traders and bankers have left as part of the inevitable downsizing. Still, the executives behind the collateralized debt obligation strategy remain in charge. 
 Ms. Huybrecht said the bank was trying to put the past behind it. But in two and a half years, if its investment is converted into KBC stock, the Belgian government could end up owning as much as 25 percent of the bank.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about KBC Bank of Belgium and other troubled European banks misstated the bond insurer MBIA's position on paying claims on risky securitized investments. While KBC and other banks have sued MBIA, contending their claims will not be satisfied, MBIA is contesting that suit and says it plans to pay all outstanding claims. It has not said that it cannot pay off on its riskier positions.

HEADLINE: Retired At 54. Pensionless At 74?

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
General Motors is using its huge pension fund in a way it never intended.
 It had planned -- and put money aside -- for a steady march of retirees over time. But instead, tens of thousands of blue-collar workers, most in their 40s and 50s, are all becoming eligible for retirement benefits now, as the company rapidly downsizes. 
 And even as its pension fund faces this giant bulge in payouts, G.M. is not putting any new money in -- the company is not required to make any contributions to the fund until 2013. 
 The longer this goes on, the weaker the fund will be and the more uncertain its long-term viability. 
 For now, the pension payments to its younger ''retirees,'' part of a deal G.M. negotiated with the United Automobile Workers union in 2007, allow the company to drastically shrink its work force without having to come up with the cash to pay severance. The payments also relieve some of the burden on social service programs in the countless factory towns and counties around the country with large numbers of G.M.'s newly jobless. 
 ''G.M. basically raided the pension plan, by having a lot of these severance benefits paid through it,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow with the Brookings Institution who specializes in financial institutions and policy. 
 What G.M. has done is perfectly legal. Nor is this the first time an employer has used a pension fund to pay for pruning its ranks. Well-subsidized early retirements are a time-honored practice in the public sector, where teachers often retire after 30 years and police officers can sometimes claim rich pensions after working as few as 20 years. Many corporations once offered sweetened pensions to people in their 50s and early 60s as well, but they have generally stopped the practice because it locked them into making payments indefinitely. 
 G.M. never stopped. To the contrary. The question now is whether the plan will run short of money and what effect that might have on the company, its workers and retirees, and the federal government, which insures pensions and is now G.M.'s majority owner. 
 In the short term, G.M.'s newly minted retirees, those in their 40s and 50s, have the most to lose if the plan is rapidly depleted and fails. But over time, the risk will shift to the government and the dwindling number of active U.A.W. workers still building cars at G.M. For those workers, a secure pension is already becoming an increasingly distant dream.
 ''They could find that they don't get their full pensions when they retire, because the plan has had to be terminated because of the payments to current retirees,'' Mr. Elliott said. ''There are definitely these intergenerational transfer issues with underfunded pensions.''
 G.M. declined to discuss the situation, although it has said it intends to keep the plan going when it emerges from bankruptcy. 
 For decades, G.M.'s blue-collar workers have earned pensions with two components. The first is the ''basic benefit,'' currently about $1,590 a month, or $19,000 a year, for an auto worker with 30 years' service. The U.A.W. won this ''30-and-out pension'' after a strike at G.M. in 1970, and still considers it something close to an inalienable right. In a 30-and-out plan, someone can go to work at 18, work nonstop for 30 years and retire at 48.
 The second part is a supplement, worth what each worker's Social Security benefit will be on the earliest date he or she can start drawing the benefits, currently age 62. (Even then, the workers are joining Social Security three years early, so they qualify for just 80 percent of the full benefits they would get at 65.) 
 Even in the days when G.M. was healthy, years ago, most of its 30-and-out retirees were too young to qualify for Social Security. The supplements were supposed to make up the difference until the retiree became eligible for Social Security. 
 The total dollar amounts are not eye-popping. Unlike many pension plans in the public sector, G.M.'s U.A.W. plan cannot be ''spiked'' by working insane amounts of overtime just before retirement. Nor is it indexed for inflation. 
 ''What we're getting isn't enough to live on,'' said Dwayne Humphries, a 54-year-old G.M. retiree in Arlington, Tex., who completed his 30 years last year, retired, and is now getting the standard $3,150 a month, or $37,500 a year. Roughly half of the total, $19,000 a year, is the basic benefit. The rest duplicates Social Security. 
 ''It's tight,'' said Mr. Humphries, who was earning $50,000 to $60,000 a year before his retirement. ''It takes a different way of living than what you were used to.'' 
 To make ends meet, he helps out with his son's small business, cleaning swimming pools.
 When a G.M. retiree turns 62, he joins Social Security, and the pension fund stops paying him the supplement. So eight years from now, Mr. Humphries will still be getting $37,500 a year, but only about $19,000 will come from the G.M. pension fund. The rest will come from Social Security.
 That will greatly lighten the load on the pension fund. But thousands of G.M. workers have taken early retirement in the last few years, and each of those workers' total benefits come from the fund. So while the benefits may seem inadequate to individual workers like Mr. Humphries, they add up to hundreds of millions of dollars being pulled out of the fund every year. 
 When a reorganization began to loom at G.M., in 2007, the company faced the choice of offering people cash buyouts or sweetening their pensions, letting them collect their 30-and-out benefits even if they had not yet worked the requisite 30 years. 
 Mr. Elliott called the decision ''a no-brainer,'' thanks to the federal rules for funding pensions.
 ''When you have an increase in benefits in a pension plan, you're given quite a number of years to fund the increase,'' he said. ''So by doing it through the pension plan, they could defer paying any cash for this for years.''
 How long the fund can sustain this is a mystery. G.M.'s financial reports combine the U.A.W. pension plan with the company's other big plan, for salaried employees. (It was frozen in 2006 and cannot undergo a sudden increase in benefits.) The U.A.W. plan's own annual reports, on file with the Labor Department, provide no fresh financial information because they stop at 2006. 
 At that point, the fund had roughly $67 billion in assets -- more than enough to cover the $59 billion in benefits it had promised to pay. The plan was then paying out a little more than $5 billion a year to retirees. 
 Now the assets are almost sure to be smaller, thanks to the market losses of 2008 and the growing payouts. ''My guess is, they can probably go for 20 years before they run out of cash,'' Mr. Elliott said. That may sound like a long time, but with so many retirees and spouses still in their 50s, the plan needs resources for at least 50 years. 
 ''If you're supposed to be paying people for 50 years, it's actually not that comforting that they have enough cash to pay people for 20,'' Mr. Elliott said.
 The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation declined to comment, but officials there have long worried privately that the collapse of one big automaker pension plan would be the end of the whole federal system of insuring pensions. 
 Normally, federal law would require G.M. to put fresh money into the pension fund. But G.M. has not had to make any contributions since 2003, when it issued bonds and put the proceeds -- $15.2 billion -- into the fund. That was more than the required amount, and the pension law allows companies that make bigger-than-required contributions to use the excess tooffset the contributions they will owe in subsequent years. 
 That, and earlier contributions, are allowing G.M. to halt contributions until 2013. By then, the plan may have a significant shortfall. The law gives G.M. seven years to catch up, which could be difficult if the company is not performing well. 
 Ron Gebhardtsbauer, head of the actuarial science program at Pennsylvania State University, said G.M. and its government stewards could reduce the risk by raising the retirement age in the future. 
 ''They're a bankrupt company and they shouldn't be giving overly generous benefits,'' he said. ''It's sort of like the banks giving out bonuses when they're not profitable.''

HEADLINE: As Iraq Stabilizes, China Bids on Its Oil Fields

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Oil companies from China, the world's second-largest and fastest-growing consumer of oil, bid aggressively on Tuesday as Iraq began auctioning licenses in six large oil fields.
 A partnership of BP and the China National Petroleum Corporation, or C.N.P.C., won the first contract awarded, in the latest indication of Chinese interest in Iraq, a country that has until recently seemed to be firmly in the American sphere of influence for natural resources.
 In another sign of China's interest in Iraqi oil fields, Sinopec, China's refining giant, offered $7.22 billion last week to buy Addax Petroleum, a Swiss-Canadian company with operations in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and in West Africa. If Addax's shareholders and Canadian regulators approve the deal, which Addax's board is recommending, it would be China's largest overseas energy acquisition.
 Sinopec's rival, the China National Petroleum Corporation, started drilling in the spring in the Ahdab oil field in southeastern Iraq. China's three main oil companies -- Sinopec, C.N.P.C. and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation -- all bid in various combinations with Western multinationals on Tuesday in Baghdad, although further negotiations remain to iron out the details of each of their contracts. 
 It is common in the oil industry for initial auction results to be followed by weeks of dickering over details. But the bidding in Baghdad on Tuesday was particularly contentious, as multinationals demanded that the Iraqi government allow them to keep more of the revenue from each extra barrel of oil they pump beyond levels previously sustained by Iraq's chronically corrupt and technologically weak national oil industry.
 Few Americans or Iraqis may have expected China to emerge as one of the winners in Iraqi oil, particularly after six years of war. But signs of stability in Iraq this year, and a planned American military pullout from Iraqi cities on Tuesday, happened to coincide with an aggressive Chinese push to buy or develop overseas oil fields.
 The Chinese companies ''have been interested in Iraq,'' said David Zweig, a specialist in Chinese natural resource policies at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ''They were interested in Iraq before the war, and now that things have improved somewhat there, it's on their agenda.''
 Some experts contend that the West should not be concerned about a substantial Chinese presence in Iraqi oil fields, because it gives China greater stake in improving stability in the region.
 ''If you want China to be a responsible stakeholder in the world, you need to let China buy stakes in the world,'' said Mark P. Thirlwell, the program director for international economics at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney, during a speech in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
 The Iraqi government originally tried last year to award oil fields to Western companies through a no-bid process. That prompted objections from a group of United States senators, who wanted greater transparency, and the plan was replaced with the auction, which had the effect of letting Chinese companies play a much larger role.
 China's leaders were surprised by the steep rise in commodity prices early last year, which exposed the vulnerability of their country's huge manufacturing sector to high raw material prices. When oil prices plunged in the autumn, China began buying, importing and storing oil in huge quantities, helping to drive a partial rebound in world oil prices in spring. And China stepped up its hunt to acquire foreign oil.
 Chinese officials, economists and advisers have been almost unanimous in recent weeks in saying that their country needed to invest more in natural resources, while also voicing concerns about the long-term creditworthiness of the United States and the buying power of the dollar. 
 China has $2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, mostly invested in dollar-denominated bonds, and has been looking for ways to diversify gradually into other assets like commodities, said a Chinese government adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the secrecy of Chinese reserve policies.
 China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, called Friday for the development of an international currency other than the dollar that would be a safe repository of value, in the latest sign of China's search for other ways to invest its international reserves.
 Philip Andrews-Speed, a specialist in China's oil industry at the University of Dundee in Scotland, said Iraq was clearly attractive for China and its oil industry.
 ''All, or nearly all, oil companies who have the courage want to be in Iraq because of the large size of the proven resource base and the potential for new discoveries,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''So, in this respect, the Chinese are part of the herd.''
 Chinese oil companies have been particularly interested in buying oil fields ever since crude prices plunged late last summer, because that dragged down the cost of the fields as well, Mr. Andrews-Speed wrote. And with their experience in some of the most turbulent countries in Africa, Chinese oil companies may have the ability to cope with the unpredictability of Iraq.
 ''They may be no more competent at managing these risks than other companies, but they do seem to be prepared to accept a higher level of risk,'' he wrote, citing China's willingness to do business in Sudan.
 Chinese companies have suffered a series of setbacks in their efforts to buy natural resources companies in industrialized countries, from Cnooc's unsuccessful bid for Unocal in the United States four years ago to Chinalco's failed attempt this spring to acquire a $19.5 billion stake in Rio Tinto of Australia.
 Those setbacks, driven partly by political objections in Washington to the Unocal transaction and in Canberra to the Rio Tinto deal, have forced Chinese companies to show more interest in resources in less stable countries like Iraq.
 ''It's really hard for them to do anything in the developed world, including Australia,'' Mr. Thirlwell said in an interview on Tuesday.
 Driving China's interest is the country's voracious thirst for oil. As recently as the early 1990s, China was a net exporter of oil because of production mainly from aging oil fields in the northeastern corner of the country.
 But China's oil consumption has soared since then, thanks to an economic boom and climbing car sales that have produced traffic jams in big cities. China surpassed the United States this year as the world's largest car market, partly because China has weathered the global economic downturn better than the United States; China's oil consumption reached 8 million barrels a day last year, up from 4.9 million in 2001, according to a statistical review from BP, the British oil company.
 Oil production has grown much more slowly, as older oil fields have run dry. New fields, either offshore or in western China, have barely replaced them. China produced 3.8 million barrels a day of oil last year, up from 3.3 million barrels per day in 2001, which still left the country dependent on imports for more than half its oil.
 Iraq has the world's third-largest proven reserves, after Saudi Arabia and Iran. Many geologists say that the true oil resources of Iraq are even greater than official statistics suggest, because Iraq's oil industry has suffered from decades of disruption and underinvestment. Many oil fields have not been fully explored as a result.
 Addax has oil licenses in two oil fields in northern Iraq, the Taqtaq and Sangaw North fields, both near Kirkuk, and its drilling has already struck large quantities of oil repeatedly in the Taqtaq field.

HEADLINE: Japan Offers $1.7 Billion Bailout for Chip Maker

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
In its first major industry bailout since the start of the global financial crisis, Japan said Tuesday that it had put together a package of $1.7 billion in public and private money to shore up a troubled chip maker, Elpida Memory. 
 By using public money to prop up Elpida, Japan hopes to salvage its only major maker of dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAM, considered vital to its electronics industry. The aid package also protects the nearly 6,000 workers at Elpida, which suffered record losses last year as the demand for semiconductors fell sharply. 
 But in using taxpayers' money, the government also risks keeping feeble companies on life support, which ultimately could hurt Japan's competitiveness, analysts said. Japan has set aside 2 trillion yen, or $21 billion, in public funds to aid companies hurt in the economic slowdown. 
 ''It's a fine balance,'' said Shinichi Ichikawa, the chief equity strategist for Japan at Credit Suisse. ''Japan has decided it must save Elpida for the sake of Japanese industry,'' but ''going too far means keeping zombie companies alive.'' 
 The bailout follows similar moves in other countries. The United States has poured billions of dollars in taxpayer money into the automakers General Motors and Chrysler, while Germany has shored up the automaker Opel with taxpayer money. 
 Japan's rescue plan comes during its worst recession since World War II. On Tuesday, the government said Japan's unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage points, to 5.2 percent, in May, the highest level in nearly six years. 
 The Japanese economy has contracted for 12 consecutive months, despite government efforts to bolster growth with stimulus spending. Weak domestic demand and a dwindling population mean that recovery remains at the mercy of its struggling exporters, concentrated in autos and electronics. 
 As a maker of DRAM chips, which are used in PCs, Elpida is seen as especially important to the country's electronics industry. Japanese officials fear that Elpida's demise would force domestic manufacturers to rely on overseas rivals like Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the market leader. 
 Elpida is reeling amid a collapse in demand and an oversupply in chips that has caused prices to plummet. It suffered a loss of 179 billion yen in the year to March, after a 24 billion yen shortfall a year earlier. Weaker players, like Spansion of the United States and Qimonda of Germany, filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year. 
 ''Elpida is Japan's only DRAM maker, and it has been hit by extremely severe conditions amid the global economic slump, despite its superior technology,'' the trade minister, Toshihiro Nikai, said Tuesday. ''Securing a supply of DRAM is very important for Japan's industry and livelihood.''
 Elpida's aid package of 160 billion yen includes 40 billion yen in public funds and loans from the state-run Development Bank of Japan, and 100 billion yen in loans from private banks, according to a statement by the trade ministry. 
 Taiwan Memory, a chip maker set up by the Taiwan government to reorganize the island's own struggling chip sector, will also invest 20 billion yen in Elpida, the ministry said. Taiwan Memory had recently announced it would partner with Elpida to develop memory chips for cellphones.
 Elpida's bailout is the first under an emergency measure that makes public money available to businesses hurt in the global economic crisis, part of the economic stimulus plans championed by Prime Minister Taro Aso. Companies that accept public money are required to develop strategies to turn around their businesses in three years. 
 Elpida will use the bailout to invest in cutting-edge technologies, the company's chief executive, Yukio Sakamoto, said.
 ''In the competitive DRAM industry, companies without the capacity to invest are sure to lose out,'' Mr. Sakamoto told reporters after the rescue package was announced. The challenge for Japan is how to handle companies seeking public funding that are shouldered with woes that go beyond the financial crisis. 
 Another company, Pioneer, a long-struggling electronics maker, is expected to seek billions of yen in aid, for example. Excessive government intervention ''hampers necessary consolidation and industry shake-out, sapping the nation's industrial vigor,'' Nikkei, Japan's largest business daily, wrote in a recent editorial. ''The government fosters moral hazard if it extends a helping hand too readily.''

HEADLINE: The Perfect Burger and All Its Parts

BYLINE: By JANE SIGAL

 BODY:
THE simple hamburger isn't so simple any more.
 Over the last decade or so, there has hardly been a serious chef in America who hasn't taken a shot at reinventing or improving it. They have trained their skills on every element, from the precise grind of beef to the ketchup and pickles. Some have turned their bakers loose on reformulating the bun.
 By most accounts, the burger's upward journey began eight years ago, when Daniel Boulud stuffed ground sirloin with truffles, braised short ribs and foie gras at his DB Bistro Moderne in Manhattan. A few weeks ago, Mr. Boulud brought things full circle, opening a burger bar on the Bowery called DBGB Kitchen and Bar.
 While some chefs have groused quietly about the insatiable demand for burgers, most are philosophical. ''All chefs can be frustrated by the buying public sometimes,'' said Clark Frasier, a chef with restaurants in Massachusetts and Maine. ''In this economy I'm happy to sell anything they want to eat.'' 
 All this high-powered attention has produced some new ways of thinking about and cooking burgers. Interviews with 30 chefs provided dozens of lessons for the home cook that aren't terribly difficult and don't cost much money. And it all yielded the ideal burger.
 A PERFECT BURGER RECIPE There's a lot you can learn from a man who's griddled thousands of burgers. Michael David, executive chef at Comme Ca brasserie in Los Angeles, had already earned his burger stripes on the team that developed Mr. Boulud's French-American DB Burger. 
 At Comme Ca, Mr. David finally nailed the consummate burger on the 11th try. 
 The genius of his Comme Ca burger is that it is consistently juicy, perfectly seasoned and precisely medium-rare. The patty is charred on the outside and rosy pink from edge to edge. 
 It is a radical improvement on what most people already do, but it's not much more complicated. His trick is to treat the burger the way many chefs do a steak. 
 He puts a good hard sear on both sides using his plancha, the freight train of flat tops, then transfers it to a 375-degree oven to finish cooking. After it comes out, there's a built-in resting period while he toasts the buns and makes a last-minute lettuce salad. 
 His method translates to an amazing amount of flexibility. Home cooks who don't have a plancha can sear the meat either on a grill or on the stovetop in a cast-iron skillet. It works equally well for one or two people, or for a crowd, because you can sear in batches. 
 The final cooking works beautifully in a toaster oven as well as a regular oven. Or, if you have an outdoor grill that is as large as some people's kitchens, you can simply move the burgers to a cooler spot once they've been charred.
 Mr. David melts Cheddar cheese over the patty and dollops iceberg lettuce salad dressed with spicy mayonnaise on top and, voila, a reformed burger. 
 THE RIGHT CHOICE OF MEAT But before you get to cook the burger, you have to choose the right meat.
 In ''Burger Bar'' (Wiley, 2009), Hubert Keller writes that what you do not want is preshaped burgers or meat that is stuffed and compacted into plastic packaging. Once beef is compressed, a light texture cannot be regained. 
 Douglas Keane, the executive chef and an owner of Cyrus and the Healdsburg Bar & Grill in Healdsburg, Calif., advises people to lose their fear of fat. He started with 80 percent lean beef, then moved to a 70-to-30 ratio. 
 ''The day I did it,'' he said, ''the servers started coming in and asking, 'What did you do to the burger? The guests are going crazy.' ''
 Mark Bucher, the executive chef at the Burger Joint in Washington, said that to make a great burger at home, have your butcher grind a piece of brisket. ''It's got a 25- to 30-percent fat-to-meat ratio,'' he said. ''It's gorgeous. It's my favorite.''
 Pat LaFrieda, president of LaFrieda Wholesale Meat Purveyors, which delivers custom blends to many of the top burger restaurants in New York City, recommends grinding the meat yourself with a food processor or a mixer's grinding attachment. He prefers chuck and brisket, and said to put them in the freezer first and chill them to 30 degrees. 
 ''It's like grating cheese at home,'' he said. ''Or coffee beans. It's better, isn't it?'' He explained that preground beef is often made from the trimmings left over from steaks, roasts and stew meat.
 It is important, he said, to choose select, choice or prime grade meat.
 ''When dairy cows come of age, they give a very lean, low-grade beef,'' he said. ''That's often what's used for preground meat. That's something the consumer wants to stay away from.'' 
 A NICE ROUND SHAPE Next, you form the patty.
 ''If you do nothing else, you should handle it less,'' said Suvir Saran, an owner of Devi, an Indian restaurant in Union Square. Mr. Saran, who calls himself a vegetarian who cheats, offers burgers at his restaurant, American Masala in Jersey City. Handling the raw meat too much means you're going to end up with a brick of meat. 
 Mr. David of Comme Ca thinks a lightly shaped patty holds together better if it's refrigerated for an hour or two before cooking.
 Michael Mina, founder of the Mina Group, which includes the recently opened XIV in Los Angeles, rolls each patty into a ball, then presses it flat to get a nice round shape.
 Alternatively, jar lids are popular with chefs. Mark Richardson, the executive chef at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco, swears the lid of a Hellmann's mayonnaise jar makes the best possible burger mold.
 Laurent Tourondel is completely against those chefs who use a whopping 12 ounces of meat. 
 ''It's not too appealing to have such a thick piece of meat to bite into,'' said Mr. Tourondel, the executive chef and partner at the many BLT restaurants. He thinks the patty needs to be in proportion with the tomato, the bread and whatever else you have.
 No matter how big the patty is, one small shaping trick will help it cook better. ''The first thing you do is take your thumb and make a well in the burger,'' said Bobby Flay, the owner of eight restaurants, including Bobby's Burger Palace, and the author, most recently, of ''Bobby Flay's Burgers, Fries & Shakes'' (Clarkson Potter, 2009). 
 Tamara Murphy, the executive chef and an owner of Brasa, in Seattle, said the air and water in burgers make them puff up when they're cooked. ''Nobody wants a ball of a burger,'' she said. ''Then people take their spatula and go, smash, squishing out all the liquid.''
 Dimpling the patty, she said, helps it cook evenly, and you won't be tempted to smack it down and lose all the juice.
 All the chefs agree that salt is crucial. Whether you're using kosher, table or sea salt, you should be pretty liberal with it. Beef can take more salt than you think. Most chefs recommended seasoning the burger just before cooking it.
 HOW HOT DO YOU GO? The beauty of a burger is its seared crust, and the only way to get it is to make sure the grill, skillet or flat top is hot, hot, hot. ''You have to be willing to cook over high heat,'' said Andy D'Amico, the chef and a partner at Five Napkin Burger, in the theater district, and Nice Matin, on the Upper West Side. 
 Testing for doneness is always a challenge for the home cook. Seamus Mullen, the chef and an owner of the Boqueria restaurants in the Flatiron district and SoHo, uses a wire cake tester. (Any thin, straight piece of metal will work as well.)
 ''We stick it in the middle through the side,'' he said. ''If it's barely warm to the lips, it's rare. If it's like bath water, it's medium rare. The temperature will never lie. It takes the guesswork out of everything.'' 
 AND THE PERFECT BUN These chefs are focusing their laserlike attention on the bread around the meat, too. 
 The buzzer went off for Hidefumi Kubota, the baker at Comme Ca, after Version 14 of the hamburger bun. 
 The bun was too soft and fell apart. Or it was too hard and crushed the burger. It had to be big enough to hold the patty but not so big that you couldn't get the burger into your mouth. He ended up with a light brioche bun.
 Mike Plitt, the pastry chef at Arrows restaurant in Ogunquit, Me., needed about a dozen attempts before he settled on a cross between challah and a buttery dinner roll. 
 But Ryan Skeen, who developed a following for his burgers at Resto and Irving Mill, both in Manhattan, likes Martin's brand potato rolls, sold at supermarkets up and down the East Coast.
 Every chef believes that the buns should be warm and crispy.
 SWEET, SOUR BUT FRESH FIXINGS Nothing is taken for granted, not even pickles. Some chefs have adopted the buy fresh, buy local ethic. Kyle Bailey, the chef at Allen & Delancey on the Lower East Side, for instance, found his pickles around the corner at Guss' Pickles. 
 He especially likes the sour ones because their acidity plays off the sweetness of the ketchup, mayonnaise and bun. ''You want something to cut against the richness,'' he said.
 Other chefs are applying the principle that everything is better if you make it yourself. At MC Perkins Cove in Ogunquit, Me., and Summer Winter in Burlington, Mass., Mr. Frasier pickles serrano chilies. Josh Eden, the chef and an owner at Shorty's.32 in SoHo, serves quick, house-made cucumber pickles, which get their tang from rice wine vinegar. They're extremely easy, crunchy and spiked with sweet, anise-flavored tarragon, instead of the usual dill.
 Cheese receives the same attention. Joey Campanaro, the chef and owner at the Little Owl in the West Village, uses American cheese.
 ''You have the eye appeal,'' he said. ''It looks like what a burger should look like. We're not elevating it to something it isn't.''
 Jim Leiken, the executive chef of DBGB, said the beauty of American cheese is the texture, but rejected it in favor of Cheddar because he prefers its flavor. He also tried blue cheese for a while, but decided it overwhelmed the beef.
 Matt Jennings, a cheesemonger as well as a chef at Farmstead Cheese Shop, La Laiterie Bistro and Farmstead Lunch in Providence, R.I., is in an unusual position to pair cheeses and burgers. What matters most to him when selecting cheese? 
 ''Meltability,'' he said. So if a cheese like Gruyere doesn't melt easily, he grates it, then presses it into a disk the same size as the burger.
 The chefs had some final tips for creating a memorable burger. Choose lettuce that's crisp and serve it cold. Use only really good, ripe tomatoes; a bad tomato waters down the burger without adding any taste. At DBGB, Mr. Leiken replaces the tomato on his Frenchie burger with an intensely flavored house-made tomato-onion compote. 
 Ultimately, though, it's not just the ingredients that make a burger great, said John DeLucie, the chef and a partner at the Waverly Inn in Greenwich Village.
 ''I had a boss who wanted me to make the dish in a photo he showed me,'' Mr. DeLucie said. ''Behind the dish was a girl in a bikini. He always wanted to know why the dish never tasted as good when I made it.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Drug Industry's Offer'' (editorial, June 25): 
 Saving money as part of comprehensive health care reform is critically important. But so is saving lives.
 Leaders in our nation's research hubs understand the fragile balance: United States jobs -- and America's role as global innovation leader -- are jeopardized if Congress does not strike the right balance on health reform.
 Our significant $80 billion commitment toward reform comes straight from our companies' balance sheets -- which forces our chief executives to make difficult business decisions moving forward. But they demonstrated an iron-willed leadership that we hope other industries follow.
 Our commitment to innovation is a big reason that American patients with cancer live longer today, heart attack rates have dropped and deaths from H.I.V. have plummeted. 
 The president has declared medical innovation a national priority as part of his goal of devoting more than 3 percent of gross domestic product to research and development. We will be there to do our part. Now it is time for other stakeholders to join us.

HEADLINE: High School Stars Honored With Theater Awards

BYLINE: By TAMMY LA GORCE

 BODY:
Fresh off his victory in the first-ever National High School Musical Theater Awards, Stephen Mark was ready to lace up his dancing shoes. Only he already had them on. 
 ''This has been the most incredible, exciting night of my life,'' said Stephen, 17, of Ridgefield, Conn., from backstage at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University on Monday, still sweaty after performing a show-closing dance routine for a crowd of more than 800 theater enthusiasts. 
 ''Now I'm ready for the after-party,'' he added. ''I hope people are going to dance.'' 
 Luckily, he was among what might have been the least dance-averse crowd of teenagers in Manhattan: 31 fellow performers from high schools as far away as Yorba Linda, Calif., who came to N.Y.U. on Thursday to compete alongside Stephen for one of two Jimmy Awards, named in honor of the theater producer James M. Nederlander. Winners of the award get a four-year scholarship worth $100,000 to the university's Tisch School of the Arts, contingent upon their acceptance to N.Y.U. 
 Each teenager was selected to participate in the awards program after being named best actor or best actress by one of 16 regional theater programs around the country, based on performances in musical productions during the 2008-9 school year. 
 At the prompting of Van Kaplan, executive producer of the Pittsburgh C.L.O., a regional theater and co-sponsor of the event with Nederlander Alliances L.L.C., the individual theater programs joined forces for the first time this year to crown one best actor -- Stephen, whose performance as Jimmy Smith in Ridgefield High School's production of ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'' earned him a spot under the Skirball Center spotlight -- and one best actress, Jenny Wine, 18, whose portrayal of Julia in ''The Wedding Singer'' at Wichita East High School in Kansas landed her in the competition. 
 The opening remarks of Monday's host, Kathie Lee Gifford, drew a burst of applause from theater luminaries including the performer Tommy Tune and Mr. Nederlander, 87, who remained seated next to his wife, Charlene, during an emotional video tribute to his long career on Broadway and, later, a standing ovation. 
 ''Why didn't we think of doing this a long time ago?'' Ms. Gifford said. 
 Behind the scenes, organizers came up with plenty of reasons. According to Mr. Kaplan, whose theater has been presenting the Gene Kelly Awards to Pittsburgh-area high school students since 1991, a lack of emphasis on school arts programs has made staging a national event difficult, and the weakened economy has complicated matters. 
 But the recent rise to prominence of several actors recognized by regional theaters for their high school-era performances is lending regional theaters credibility. Anne Hathaway and Laura Benanti, a Tony Award winner, were recognized with Rising Star Awards by the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey during their high school years, for example, and the ''Star Trek'' actor Zachary Quinto got help early in his career from the Pittsburgh C.L.O. 
 The rise of television shows like ''So You Think You Can Dance'' and ''American Idol'' have also directed attention to young people in the performing arts. ''The link between the amateur world of high school students and the professional theater world is getting stronger,'' said Mr. Kaplan, 52. ''Those shows are bringing it to the forefront. And obviously we're grateful for anything that advances the arts.'' 
 For the first batch of Jimmy Award contenders, the days leading up to the ceremony amounted to a cram session on the pressure-cooker life of a Broadway performer. Between a group viewing of ''West Side Story'' on Friday -- the first real Broadway experience for several of the students -- and pep talks by visiting performers including Constantine Maroulis, the former ''American Idol'' heartthrob nominated for a Tony Award this year for his starring role in ''Rock of Ages,'' the teenagers were put through their paces by a team of N.Y.U. faculty members and regional theater professionals. 
 At the ceremony, the 32 would-be stars sang selections from the roles they performed on their high school stages. Those numbers allowed five judges -- including Scott Ellis, associate artistic director of the Roundabout Theater Company, and the Broadway casting agent Bernard Telsey -- to winnow the group to four finalists. Then, after an intermission, came solos of their choice: Stephen's performance of ''Run Away With Me'' earned him his Jimmy, and Jenny's rendition of ''I Dreamed a Dream'' secured hers. For one judge, Kent Gash, director of the Tisch School of the Arts' Studio, the night was a culmination of a hectic week. ''I've seen these kids preparing on campus,'' he said before the performances. ''I expect to be blown away. I expect to have my soul fed tonight.''
 There could be little doubt that the soul of Mr. Nederlander, who said during the ceremony that he intended to ''keep punching and never quit'' life on Broadway, had been nourished. 
 ''All these kids are terrific, fantastic,'' he said after the awards. ''I consider this a great honor.''

HEADLINE: Corn Planting Is Second-Largest Since 1946

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
American farmers have planted their second-largest corn acreage since 1946, the government said Tuesday, shocking traders who thought that cold, wet spring weather in the Midwest had shrunk corn sowings. 
 Corn plantings rose 1 percent from last year, to 87.035 million acres, the Agriculture Department said, up from March estimates of 84.986 million acres and above trade estimates that averaged 83.961 million acres.
 ''These numbers definitely are bearish on corn,'' said Mario Balletto, an analyst with Citigroup in Chicago, noting crop conditions bode well for strong yields.
 Barring bad weather during the rest of the growing season, livestock and ethanol producers should have ample supplies of corn, said Darrel Good, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois.
 ''This takes a lot of pressure off the corn, and we might continue to see a little weakness,'' Mr. Good said.
 Planting in the America's grain-growing heartland got off to a slow start this spring, and traders had expected the report would show farmers were forced to switch areas planned for corn to soybeans, which take less time to reach maturity.
 ''In late May, however, drier conditions allowed farmers to make rapid progress,'' the agency said, noting 97 percent of intended corn acres had been planted by the time it conducted its survey during the first two weeks of June.
 Corn prices rallied just as farmers began planting, said Terry Francl, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.
 ''That may have been the thing that convinced people to plant a little more corn,'' Mr. Francl said.
 The sowings imply corn production of 12.3 billion bushels, based on yield projections made earlier this month. That would be the second-largest corn crop after 2007's 13.038 billion bushels.
 The agency also forecast wheat acres at 59.775 million acres, down 5 percent from last year but above trade expectations of 58.243 million acres.
 As expected, farmers planted a record area to soybeans this spring. The agency said farmers seeded 77.483 million acres of soybeans, up 2 percent from last year, implying production could reach a record 3.3 billion bushels.
 The soybean plantings were below average trade estimates of 78.121 million acres, released ahead of the report.
 A large soy crop would replenish United States supplies drained as China went on a buying spree at a time when weather problems sidelined competing suppliers in South America.

 BODY:
Diner
 85 Broadway (Berry Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn; (718) 486-3077.
 One minute our waiter was standing over us, in the usual tableau; the next he was seated beside us, not only reciting the night's menu but also scribbling it, in shorthand, on the paper that covered our table. That's Diner for you: shaggy, improvisatory and cheeky, much like Williamsburg -- or at least, like Williamsburg when Diner opened there a decade ago. 
 The neighborhood has changed. And Diner? Not so much. A while back, Caroline Fidanza ceded the reins in the kitchen to Sean Rembold, who had worked beside her. But now, as ever, the cooking emphasizes seasonality, accessibility, comfort and correctness: the beef for a recent strip steak special ($32) was grass-fed. Diner was doing the Brooklyn tropes before they were Brooklyn tropes.
 And it still does them with charm and skill, based on a recent dinner there, which I found more satisfying than a dinner not too long before that at Marlow & Sons, the most prominent of Diner's offspring, including the two Bonita restaurants.
 A half chicken ($22) was impeccably cooked. Same for a fillet of halibut ($23). Neither reflected particular daring -- that was left to an appetizer of grilled duck hearts ($11), by far the best dish of the night. The runner-up? Possibly a sorrel soup ($8) with such intensely smoky, porky accents that it tasted almost like a liquefied ham sandwich. I mean that as a compliment.
 All of the desserts I sampled -- chocolate cake, poundcake, lemon pie (each $8) -- were good. There's a sophisticated wine list and carefully chosen beers. You can get an easy-drinking, refreshing Presidente ($4) from the Dominican Republican. You should.
 Diner's setting -- in a narrow, snug metal dining car from 1927 -- remains irresistible. But its prices have risen sharply since the start, when an evening's soup special was, say, $3.50, and the chicken was $9. That's inflation, yes. But that's also what happens when a neighborhood itself ascends.

HEADLINE: Insured but Unprotected, and Driven Bankrupt by Health Crises

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Health insurance is supposed to offer protection -- both medically and financially. But as it turns out, an estimated three-quarters of people who are pushed into personal bankruptcy by medical problems actually had insurance when they got sick or were injured. 
 And so, even as Washington tries to cover the tens of millions of Americans without medical insurance, many health policy experts say simply giving everyone an insurance card will not be enough to fix what is wrong with the system.
Too many other people already have coverage so meager that a medical crisis means financial calamity. 
 One of them is Lawrence Yurdin, a 64-year-old computer security specialist. Although the brochure on his Aetna policy seemed to indicate it covered up to $150,000 a year in hospital care, the fine print excluded nearly all of the treatment he received at an Austin, Tex., hospital. 
 He and his wife, Claire, filed for bankruptcy last December, as his unpaid medical bills approached $200,000. 
 In the House and Senate, lawmakers are grappling with the details of legislation that would set minimum standards for insurance coverage and place caps on out-of-pocket expenses. And fear of the high price tag could prompt lawmakers to settle for less than comprehensive coverage for some Americans. 
 But patient advocates argue it is crucial for the final legislation to guarantee a base level of coverage, if people like Mr. Yurdin are to be protected from financial ruin. They also call for a new layer of federal rules to correct the current state-by-state regulatory patchwork that allows some insurance companies to sell relatively worthless policies. 
 ''Underinsurance is the great hidden risk of the American health care system,'' said Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor who has analyzed medical bankruptcies. ''People do not realize they are one diagnosis away from financial collapse.''
 Last week, a former Cigna executive warned at a Senate hearing on health insurance that lawmakers should be careful about the role they gave private insurers in any new system, saying the companies were too prone to ''confuse their customers and dump the sick.''
 ''The number of uninsured people has increased as more have fallen victim to deceptive marketing practices and bought what essentially is fake insurance,'' Wendell Potter, the former Cigna executive, testified. 
 Mr. Yurdin learned the hard way. 
 At St. David's Medical Center in Austin, where he went for two separate heart procedures last year, the hospital's admitting office looked at Mr. Yurdin's coverage and talked to Aetna. St. David's estimated that his share of the payments would be only a few thousand dollars per procedure. 
 He and the hospital say they were surprised to eventually learn that the $150,000 hospital coverage in the Aetna policy was mainly for room and board. Coverage was capped at $10,000 for ''other hospital services,'' which turned out to include nearly all routine hospital care -- the expenses incurred in the operating room, for example, and the cost of any medication he received. 
 In other words, Aetna would have paid for Mr. Yurdin to stay in the hospital for more than five months -- as long as he did not need an operation or any lab tests or drugs while he was there. 
 Aetna contends that it repeatedly informed Mr. Yurdin and the hospital of the restrictions in policy, which is known in the industry as a limited-benefit plan. 
 The company says such policies offer value by covering some hospital expenses, like surgeons' fees or a stay in the intensive care unit. Aetna also says all of its policyholders receive significant discounts on the overall cost of hospital care. But Aetna also acknowledges that a limited-benefit plan was inappropriate in Mr. Yurdin's case because his age and condition -- an irregular heartbeat -- made him likely to require more comprehensive coverage. 
 ''Limited benefits aren't right for everyone, and it clearly wasn't right for Mr. Yurdin,'' said Cynthia B. Michener, an Aetna spokeswoman.
 Charles E. Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, which is taking a lead on health legislation, says Congress needs to make ''meaningful'' insurance coverage more affordable and accessible. But ''until that happens,'' he said, ''any presentation of limited-benefit plans ought to be completely straightforward, and not misleading in any way.''
 Insurers like Aetna generally defend limited-benefit policies as a byproduct of the nation's flawed health care system, which they say makes it too expensive to adequately insure someone like Mr. Yurdin. 
 If everyone in the country were required to have insurance, the industry says -- a mandate that Congress is contemplating -- the costs and risks of insurance would be spread over a large enough pool of people to let insurers provide full, affordable coverage even to people with pre-existing medical conditions. 
 Mr. Yurdin worked at TEKsystems, which employs people for short periods as contractors for other companies. TEKsystems says it does not pay for the contract workers' health benefits, but it does enable them to purchase individual policies with limited benefits so they have at least some coverage. 
 ''There's no way we make this sound like regular coverage,'' said Neil Mann, an executive vice president at Allegis Group, which owns TEKsystems. 
 Although Mr. Mann acknowledged that the plan Mr. Yurdin purchased excluded routine hospital care, he said he thought it still provided value to employees who wanted ''peace of mind.'' 
 True peace of mind, however, comes with a much higher price tag. When Mr. Yurdin no longer qualified for the Aetna coverage after he left TEKsystems and his eligibility eventually ended, his only option was a special state plan in Texas for people who are at high risk for expensive medical care. He has been paying more than $1,000 a month for comprehensive coverage, compared with the roughly $250 a month he was paying for the Aetna plan. 
 But as of Wednesday, his future insurance problems are largely solved: he qualifies for Medicare because he turns 65.
 Many insurers, as part of the Congressional overhaul of their business, say they expect the demand for limited-benefit policies to fall. ''Until the nation achieves the universal coverage that we strongly support, some individuals will want to be able to choose limited indemnity products, but with comprehensive health reform we think that need should diminish,'' said Simon Stevens, an executive at UnitedHealth. 
 UnitedHealth drew criticism last year for selling policies with sharply limited coverage through AARP, the advocacy group for older people. One of the plans capped reimbursement for an operation at $5,000, for example, although many procedures cost at least several times that amount. After Senator Grassley began investigating its sales practices, UnitedHealth agreed to stop offering the limited AARP plans. 
 Mr. Yurdin and his wife say it was not clear that he was liable for tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills until after he had the first two of what would eventually be four operations. St. David's says it tried to persuade them to apply for charity care, under which the hospital would absorb much, or all, of the unpaid bills. 
 But the couple says a lawyer advised them to turn to bankruptcy as the way to be certain they would not be left with too much debt. ''I knew we were getting way, way over our heads,'' Mrs. Yurdin said.
 While Aetna disputes the Yurdins' and the hospital's version of events, it also says it has tried to clarify the language it uses to describe the coverage. In its most recent brochure, the fine print describing the limits to ''other'' hospital services now defines what they are in a footnote on the same page and warns that the excluded expenses could be ''significant.'' 
 Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, who is also on the Finance Committee, has introduced legislation that would require insurers to be more clear about what they do -- and do not -- cover. He says he advocates such a change, even if Congress cannot agree to a more sweeping overhaul of the health insurance industry. 
 But advocates for broad changes to the health care system say Congress can succeed only by making sure health reform goes beyond giving every American a buyer-beware insurance card. One such person is Len Nichols, a health economist for the New America Foundation. 
 ''Conceptually,'' he said, ''insurance means normal people should not go bankrupt from serious medical conditions.''

HEADLINE: Declines in Home Prices Are Slowing

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
In a hint of hope for the country's struggling housing market, home prices did not fall as fast in April as they did in previous months, according to figures released Tuesday. 
 Home prices continued to fall as unemployment rose and new foreclosures hit the market. But the pace of declines, which had been accelerating, leveled off slightly, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index, a closely watched yardstick of the market.
 ''This is a real relief,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note. ''With sales volumes now stable and likely to rise a bit over the next few months, we think sustained slower price falls are a decent bet.''
 In April, home prices in 20 major metropolitan areas fell 18.1 percent from a year ago. Although that is a stark drop from April 2008 (when prices were already 15 percent below their April 2007 levels), it is milder than the 19 percent decline recorded in January. 
 ''It echoes parts of the larger economy,'' said David M. Blitzer, index chairman at Standard & Poor's. ''The stock market bottomed in March and started to go up. Consumer sentiment numbers have gotten better as well. There's a little pickup in the way people view the financial world, and it's beginning to show up in housing.''
 Home prices in eight markets actually crept up in April from a month earlier as bargain-hunting buyers tiptoed back into markets. Prices in Cleveland, Dallas and Denver all rose more than 1 percent for the month, although those cities and all of the 20 metro areas in the survey were still down for the year.
 But single-home prices are still plunging in parts of the United States hit hardest by the housing boom and bust. Prices in Las Vegas fell 3.5 percent from a month earlier, and were down 32.2 percent from April 2008. Prices in Phoenix were 35.3 percent lower than a year ago.
 While the rate of decline did slow a bit, home prices are still under enormous pressure as potential buyers lose their jobs or suffer wage cuts. Home mortgage rates have also bounced back from record lows as investors put more pressure on government bonds, leading to concerns about whether higher borrowing costs will pressure sellers to cut their prices even further.
 But over all, economists characterized the numbers as a positive, if small, step for the housing market.
 ''This is the critical moment,'' Mr. Blitzer said. ''You have to slow the descent before you can turn up.''
 But in a more subdued note, the private Conference Board reported Tuesday that consumer confidence retreated in June after improving steadily for three months. Consumers said their current economic conditions were worse, and their expectations for the future -- which had nudged the index higher -- also fell.
 The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence fell to 49.3 in June, from 54.8 in May. 
 Fewer consumers said that business conditions were good or that jobs were plentiful. And more people expect that jobs will be harder to get in six months, and that business conditions will be worse. Fewer consumers plan to buy new cars, major appliances or new homes.

HEADLINE: Pro Bono Spots Soak Up More Commercial Time

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
FOR almost 65 years, Smokey Bear has been reminding Americans, ''Only you can prevent forest fires'' (and, more recently, wildfires). As the economy faltered, it turned out, Smokey was sharing screen time -- and exposure in other media -- with pro bono advertising intended to prevent home foreclosures, encourage financial literacy and keep students from dropping out of high school.
 Those are among the findings of an annual report from the Advertising Council, the nonprofit organization that coordinates the efforts made by Madison Avenue in the realm of public service campaigns. The report is scheduled to be released this week. 
 As the effects of the financial crisis hit the marketplace last year, the report found, media companies still donated commercial time, ad space and other support for pro bono campaigns worth more than $1.83 billion.
 The total -- higher than 2007 by about $320,000 -- comprised television and radio commercials, outdoor ads, print ads, ads online, public relations, ads in yellow pages directories and ads in alternative media. By comparison the total for 2007 was down 3.2 percent from 2006, and the total for 2006 was up 1.5 percent from 2005.
 The total for 2008 was noteworthy, according to the council, because it came during a year when ad space and commercial time were crowded with an estimated $2.5 billion in political pitches, $1.5 billion in Olympic-related spending and $1.2 billion for the efforts by the television industry to educate viewers about the switch to digital TV.
 Those initiatives ''sucked up a lot of inventory that otherwise would have been available'' for public service ads, said Peggy Conlon, president and chief executive at the council in New York.
 Given everything that happened last year, she added, the council is pleased ''we held our own.'' 
 There are some caveats to the results of the report because of the recession. The fact the council tracks the dollar value of the time and space turned over to pro bono ads skews the findings because the rates the media charge in harder times are lower than in better times.
 And support for public service campaigns is usually stronger during economic downturns because media companies often prefer to run classy-looking, altruistic ads to fill space and time rather than sell that inventory to dodgy marketers whose ads may be cheesy, misleading or deceptive.
 ''Part of it is a reflection that the market is soft,'' Ms. Conlon said, ''but what are they doing with the inventory?'' she asked, referring to the media companies. ''They're using it to help people.''
 If public service ads last year are measured by the total number of placements rather than their dollar value, the difference from last year is more pronounced. The number of placements rose a robust 15 percent from 2007. And in the fourth quarter, as the financial crisis raged, placements increased 22 percent compared with the same period the previous year.
 The trend is continuing into 2009, Ms. Conlon said, as the recession wears on. In the first quarter, the total number of placements rose 21 percent compared with the same period a year ago.
 ''I'd love to say it's an opportunity for media companies to really use their pulpit,'' Ms. Conlon said, ''to get these important messages out.''
 Brian Perkins, chairman of the council, predicted that for 2009 the donated media, based on dollar volume, will come in around the $1.83 billion total for last year.
 ''We're pleased with that level of support,'' said Mr. Perkins, who is also a corporate vice president at Johnson & Johnson. ''We know it's a soft market; we're pleased the media companies are hanging in with us.''
 Of the 10 campaigns that received the most support from media companies last year, measured by dollar volume, three have resonance in a recession.
 One is the campaign to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, which the council took up on behalf of an organization named NeighborWorks America. It received $72.9 million in donated space and time, according to the report, good for third place behind a campaign for parental controls for TV sets, with $116.7 million, and a campaign to prevent drunken driving, with $88.7 million.
 The campaign to discourage high school students from dropping out was fifth on the list, with $70.1 million in donated time and space. The council worked on that campaign on behalf of the Army.
 The campaign promoting financial literacy was seventh on the list, with $61.5 million in donated space and time. That campaign was on behalf of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
 Another effect of the recession, Ms. Conlon said, is the popularity of a campaign about hunger prevention, which the council is undertaking on behalf of Feeding America. That campaign, which began in November, has already received more than $11.7 million in donated media through May, she added.
 Mr. Perkins said: ''Everybody sees the tough times in business. But I think people are going the extra mile to make sure the Ad Council and the causes it supports are taken care of.''
 ''In good times, it's nice,'' he added. ''In bad times, it's really appreciated.''

Ad industry efforts aimed at preventing foreclosures received $72.9 million in donated space and time, the Ad Council said.

HEADLINE: Woods Plays Genial Host, Then Responds to Criticism

BYLINE: By LARRY DORMAN

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md. 

 BODY:
Shortly after noon Tuesday, about 36 hours before the official start of his third AT&T National as tournament host, Tiger Woods was in a playful mood. Seated at the head of a conference table in the upstairs board room at Congressional Country Club, Woods smiled after glancing at Thursday's first-round tee times.
 ''Hey, I've got Lucas,'' he said, referring to the freshly minted United States Open champion, Lucas Glover. ''How about that for a great draw? And Charley Hoffman. Perfect. I think maybe I'll have to wear my hat like this.'' 
 Woods whipped off his Nike cap, grinning as he turned the ends of the brim up until it flattened into Hoffman's trademark surfer-skater-rapper look. Then he spun the hat around backward and leaned into the table to address a few more serious issues.
 Two weeks after his tie for sixth at Bethpage Black, Woods seemed well over the disappointment of failing to seriously contend in the second consecutive major in which he was the overwhelming pretournament favorite. This week brings Woods a real-life perspective to his golf ups and downs, provided by the thousands of servicemen and women who are admitted free and the wounded warriors who participate as honorary starters in the pro-am.
 ''We spend the week thanking them for coming out here and being a part of this event,'' he said, ''because what they do for our country here and abroad is phenomenal.''
 While he might have been tough to live with during the weeks of fits and starts at Augusta National and on Long Island, Woods has digested the relevant learning and tossed the rest like rinds into the disposal. 
 ''As a whole, I didn't hit the ball as well as I would have liked at Augusta, and at the Open, I hit it well and I just didn't putt well,'' he said placidly. ''At major championships, you can't have one thing missing. You can't hit the ball well and not putt well or not chip well or not think well. That's the whole idea -- to test every facet of your game.''
 Tested and found wanting at both the Masters and the Open was Woods's ability to finish off rounds, normally a nonpareil strength. At Augusta, where he finished four strokes out of the three-way playoff won by Angel Cabrera, Woods bogeyed his final hole in two of four rounds. At Bethpage, he played his final four holes to complete the first round in four over and bogeyed his final hole of the second round.
 ''When I played the last four in four over,'' he said, ''I had fought so hard through those conditions to get it back to even, and it was frustrating that I did finish that way. But I knew I wasn't out of the tournament. 
 ''Then it was surprising to see how low those guys went the first two days on the other side of the draw. They were just making birdie after birdie. Eleven under was leading at one point. We didn't see that starting out in the practice rounds. No one foresaw someone getting to double digits.''
 Woods's trials since having knee surgery have shown how difficult it is to win consistently on the PGA Tour. He made it look too easy for too long. Consider that in the 23 months since the 2007 British Open, where he finished in a tie for 12th, Woods has not finished outside the top 10 in a stroke-play event and has won 10 times, including two major championships. 
 Finishing off a sentence for an interviewer who was struggling to describe that level of performance, Woods said, ''It's pretty good.''
 As high as the on-course standards are, they have been just as high off it. The Tiger Woods Foundation has funneled millions of dollars into programs that benefit at-risk young people in California and, through the efforts of his mother, Kultida, young people in Thailand. Though pushed back by the economic downturn, plans remain on track for a Tiger Woods Learning Center to be built in Washington to mirror the one in Irvine, Calif., Woods estimated Tuesday that 10 million children have already been helped by foundation programs aimed at teaching life skills.
 Viewed against that backdrop, remarks made by the Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown on a recent HBO show featuring Brown and the N.B.A. Hall of Famer Bill Russell were difficult for Woods to understand. Brown characterized Woods's efforts to effect social change as ''terrible, terrible.'' Brown added, ''Because he can get away with teaching kids to play golf, and that's his contribution.''
 Brown said he thought Woods should do more. Woods responded at his news conference later on Tuesday afternoon.
 ''I think I do a pretty good job as it is with what we're trying to do with the foundation,'' he said, citing millions raised through the AT&T National, the Chevron World Challenge, the Tiger Jam in Las Vegas and the foundation's Block Party in Orange County, Calif.
 ''It's taught a lot of kids how to get back and learn,'' he added. ''To learn how to lead, learn how to give back, learn how to teach others.''

HEADLINE: Police and Militias Keep Order on Streets as Iran Tries to Head Off More Protests

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: CAIRO 

 BODY:
Police officers and militia forces crowded the streets of Tehran on Tuesday, setting up checkpoints and making clear that the government had zero tolerance for any further public expressions of defiance to the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a day after Iran's powerful Guardian Councilcertified his landslide victory.
 The government made a series of official moves to close the book on weeks of protest that represented the strongest challenge to its control since the Islamic republic was founded in 1979. Parliament issued a statement expressing broad gratitude over the June 12 vote and thanking the police and the Basij militia for maintaining security. Mr. Ahmadinejad visited the Ministry of Intelligence, where he gave a speech to employees. 
 The government crushed the vast protests following the vote, dispatching armed militia and police officers and leaving an estimated 17 people dead and hundreds injured. The authorities continued to detain hundreds of journalists, former government officials, political activists and even independent researchers, in the quest to prevent any further demonstrations. 
 There seemed little prospect of any chance for organized and sustained action against the government's version of events, political analysts said, in part because the arrests had starved the opposition of leadership, foot soldiers and an effective means to communicate. 
 One of the most recent arrests, of Bijan Khajehpour, an independent political economist, sent a chill deeper yet into Iran's civil society because he had not been involved in the opposition demonstrations, political analysts said. 
 Mr. Khajehpour had been detained at the airport coming into the country from Britain, and like many others, has disappeared into the notorious Evin prison, raising concerns over the scope of the crackdown and the prospect of a political purge, the analysts said.
 ''Bijan was perhaps the last independent-minded analyst living in Tehran who continued to travel to Europe and the U.S. and give open lectures about Iran,'' said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''He always believed that if he was totally transparent, the government would understand he was not doing anything wrong.''
 The government has also, over the past several days, fired high-ranking officials who had supported Mir Hussein Moussavi, the president's main challenger, according to Iranian news reports.
 Human rights groups said arrests had taken place around the nation, but there were particular fears that those held at Evin were in physical danger.
 Amnesty International said in a statement that it was ''gravely concerned that several opposition leaders detained in the wake of the 12 June elections may be facing torture, possibly to force them to make televised 'confessions' as a prelude to unfair trials in which they could face the death penalty.'' 
 Reporters Without Borders, a press freedom organization, said that the concern extended beyond opposition leaders. ''Several witness accounts makes us fear that torture and ill treatment are being systematically inflicted on prisoners who have demonstrated against the regime,'' the group said in a statement. ''Several journalists and bloggers were brutally treated by the guards and by men employed by the state prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi.''
 The Guardian Council's validation of the election on Monday followed days of promises that a committee would be formed to review the election and that a partial recount would occur. But the committee was never seated, nor was the review process established. 
 The recount involved what officials said was a random 10 percent of ballots in Tehran's 22 electoral districts and in some provinces. The officials concluded that in some areas, Mr. Ahmadinejad had won even more votes than initially stated.
 With the vote now officially over, the government pressed forward with its efforts to rewrite a narrative of events that had been cast first by the millions who took to the streets, and then through independent and citizen journalism. The government has made reporting inside the country impossible, forcing foreign journalists to leave, while arresting and threatening Iranians who challenge the government's position.
 The government maintains that Western agents, primarily Britons, have been responsible for the unrest. On Monday, the government sought to recast blame for the deaths of about 17 protesters.
 The commander of Iran's Basij militia, Hossein Taeb, said that impostors wearing Basij uniforms had been responsible for infiltrating crowds attacking unarmed citizens. He also suggested that a Basij impostor had been responsible for killing Neda Agha-Soltan, the young woman who became an international symbol when video of her shot and dying in the street went on the Internet and was seen around the world.

HEADLINE: Belarus Leader Pardons American Lawyer at Center of Dispute

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
The Belarussian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, on Tuesday pardoned an American lawyer at the center of a 16-month dispute between Belarus and the United States, in a push to fully restore relations between the two countries. 
 During a meeting with members of the United States Congress, Mr. Lukashenko agreed to free Emanuel E. Zeltser, who was serving a three-year sentence for industrial espionage and forgery. American diplomats protested Mr. Zeltser's mysterious arrest and closed trial, and they pressed for his release on humanitarian grounds, saying he had fallen gravely ill in prison. 
 ''I am glad about my freedom,'' Mr. Zeltser told The Associated Press by telephone on leaving the prison clinic in the eastern town of Mogilyov. He was met by American officials and was to travel with them to the United States Embassy in Minsk, the capital, The A.P. reported. During the morning meeting, Mr. Lukashenko cast the pardon as a conciliatory gesture, and he appealed to the United States delegation to respond by lifting three-year-old economic sanctions against Belarus.
 Mr. Lukashenko ''could not have been more accommodating'' toward his American visitors, something that has not been true in the past, said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, a member of the delegation. Senator Cardin said the United States would lift the sanctions when Belarus showed progress in political reforms and human rights.
 President George W. Bush imposed sanctions after the 2006 presidential elections in Belarus, when the police cracked down harshly on antigovernment demonstrators. Belarus responded by expelling the American ambassador and recalling its own envoy from Washington.
 The pardon comes as Belarus, once Moscow's most loyal post-Soviet ally, tacks sharply to the West. For almost a year, Mr. Lukashenko has been making moves to accommodate Western criticism, like granting amnesty to a series of political prisoners. This spring, Belarus was invited to join the European Union's Eastern Partnership, and it received an additional International Monetary Fund loan of $1 billion, increasing its total pledge to $3.4 billion.
 Tension has been rising meanwhile between Belarus and Moscow, after top Russian officials criticized Mr. Lukashenko's economic policies and imposed a painful ban on imports of Belarussian dairy products. Belarus responded last month by boycotting a long-planned ceremony to introduce a joint military force between Russia and its closest allies.
 Mr. Lukashenko's overtures on Tuesday fit squarely into that pattern, said a Western diplomat with knowledge of the meeting. ''I do suspect a good deal of what the president said today was directed as much to Moscow as it was to Washington or Minsk,'' the diplomat said. 
 The decision brings an end to a bizarre legal case. Mr. Zeltser and his personal assistant, Vladlena Funk, were arrested at the Minsk airport on an airplane belonging to a Russian oligarch, Boris A. Berezovsky. Mr. Berezovsky has accused Mr. Zeltser of using a forged will to steal the assets of his former partner, but he said he had no involvement in the arrest.

HEADLINE: A Forecast With Hope Built In

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 In the weeks just before President Obama took office, his economic advisers made a mistake. They got a little carried away with hope.
 To make the case for a big stimulus package, they released their economic forecast for the next few years. Without the stimulus, they saw the unemployment rate -- then 7.2 percent -- rising above 8 percent in 2009 and peaking at 9 percent next year. With the stimulus, the advisers said, unemployment would probably peak at 8 percent late this year. 
 We now know that this forecast was terribly optimistic. The jobless rate has already reached 9.4 percent. On Thursday, the Labor Department will announce the latest number, for June, and forecasters are expecting it to rise further. In concrete terms, the difference between the situation that the Obama advisers predicted and the one that has come to pass is about 2.5 million jobs. It's as if every worker in the city of Los Angeles received an unexpected layoff notice.
 There are two possible explanations that the administration was so wrong. And sorting through them matters a great deal, because they point in opposite policy directions. 
 The first explanation is that the economy has deteriorated because the stimulus package failed. Some critics say that stimulus just doesn't work, while others argue that this particular package was too small or too badly constructed to make a difference. 
 The second answer is that the economy has deteriorated in spite of the stimulus. In other words, the patient is not as sick as he would have been without the medicine he received. But he is a lot sicker than doctors realized when they prescribed it.
 To me, the evidence is fairly compelling that the second answer is the right one. The stimulus package does seem to have helped. But its impact has been minor -- so far -- compared with the harshness of the Great Recession. 
 Unfortunately, the administration's rose-colored forecast has muddied this picture. So if at some point this year or next the White House decides that the economy needs more stimulus, skeptics will surely brandish that old forecast. 
 Worst of all, the economy really may need more help. 
 There is no ironclad way to judge the stimulus, because we can't rerun the last six months in an alternate universe. But you can get a pretty good sense by looking at the size of the gap between where the economy is today and where the administration thought it would be: those 2.5 million jobs that would still exist if the forecast had been right. 
 This gap is just far too large to be explained by the stimulus. The plan that Mr. Obama signed definitely has its flaws. It spends money more slowly than is ideal and spends some of it on projects of little long-term value. But no stimulus package could have come close to preventing 2.5 million job losses over six months. 
 For starters, a stimulus package doesn't affect the job market immediately because most employers don't hire or fire workers as soon as they sense their business shifting. That's why economists refer to employment as a lagging indicator.
 When private economists began analyzing various stimulus proposals in January, they said that none would have a major effect on the jobless rate until the end of the year. By June, the effect would be only a few tenths of a percentage point, which translates into several hundred thousand jobs.
 The stimulus that passed may in fact be having an impact of roughly this scale. Consumer spending, after plummeting late last year, is up slightly this year, despite a continuing rise in the savings rate. This combination suggests that spending would still be falling if not for the tax cuts in the stimulus. 
 ''Early results,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com, ''suggest the stimulus is performing close to expectations.'' Obviously, though, the economy is not performing close to expectations.
 It's not fair to expect Mr. Obama's economists to be clairvoyant. But they did make one avoidable mistake that led directly to their overoptimism. They relied on the same forecasting models that had completely failed to see the crisis coming. 
 These models, which are also used by Wall Street and various research firms, do a decent job most of the time. But they are notoriously bad at forecasting turning points because they are based on an assumption that the recent past will more or less repeat itself.
 Clearly, recent economic history is not going to repeat itself. It included two huge asset bubbles, first in stocks and then in real estate. The models came to treat those bubbles -- and the additional consumer spending they caused -- as the new normal. When asset prices began falling, the models couldn't keep up, with either the pace of declines or the economic damage they were causing.
 ''All sorts of relationships got completely out of whack, and models couldn't cope with that,'' says Joshua Shapiro, an economist at MFR, a research firm. MFR did not take the models too literally and was one of the few firms to have been appropriately pessimistic. The Obama administration believed the models. 
 And what do these models say today? They are forecasting that the recession will end in the next few months. Administration officials aren't quite so specific, but they are in a similar place.
 Christina Romer, a senior Obama economist, argues that businesses that have spent the last few months drawing down their warehouse inventories will eventually need to rebuild them. Lawrence Summers, the top economics adviser, says that many consumers who have been delaying the purchase of a new car will eventually take the plunge. The government, meanwhile, will be pumping out close to $30 billion in stimulus money every month for months to come.
 A big headline across the front page of Monday's Financial Times summed up the position: ''Romer upbeat on economy.''
 It's an entirely reasonable prediction. Yet it's hard not to look back on the last six months and worry that the administration is still underestimating the severity of the situation. 
 Many consumers may not rush back to their old buying habits. Mr. Shapiro points out that household debt, relative to assets, remains far higher than historically normal. ''It's going to be a very long slog,'' he predicts. That would certainly be consistent with the aftermath of other financial crises.
 The larger point is that, even if the optimists are right this time, the economy isn't going to feel remotely healthy anytime soon. Since jobs (and incomes) are a lagging indicator, the unemployment rate will probably surpass 10 percent this year and remain above 9 percent well into next year. Long after the experts say the economy has turned, it is going to feel pretty bad.
 Another stimulus package may soften the blow, but it can't prevent most of the pain. The problems are too big. So it would make sense for everyone -- the administration and the rest of us -- to have a sober view of what might lie ahead.

HEADLINE: An Advocate for Women

 BODY:
Domestic violence is a serious law enforcement and public health problem affecting as many as one in four women in this country. Yet Washington has devoted too little attention to reducing domestic violence and sexual assaults generally. We welcome President Obama's decision to create a new post, White House adviser on violence against women, and his appointment of a seasoned advocate for victims to fill it. 
 Lynn Rosenthal is a former executive director of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. She will report to Mr. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, whose keen interest in the issue dates from his days in the Senate and his key role in enacting the 1994 Violence Against Women Act.
 Ms. Rosenthal's challenge, and the administration's, will be to improve the carrying out of existing laws intended to protect women, starting with better coordination of the activities of all the government bureaucracies involved, including the Justice Department, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
 A national survey of domestic violence shelters released in May showed a significant increase in the number of women seeking assistance since last fall, a rise largely attributable to the stresses of the economic crisis and rising unemployment. States need to set up more emergency shelters and find more transitional housing for people fleeing violent situations. And they must do more to help these victims rebuild their lives.
 Ms. Rosenthal will need to tackle bureaucratic and legal hurdles and find more money to help states, localities and charitable groups address those needs. She must also help end the scandal of the thousands of rape kits sitting untested in crime labs and police storage facilities across the country, allowing countless criminals to escape punishment. All of this will require strong and creative leadership from Ms. Rosenthal and Mr. Biden and from the president.

HEADLINE: G.M. Pushes the Case For Its Rebirth in Court

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED; Micheline Maynard reported from Detroit and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.

 BODY:
General Motors headed to bankruptcy court on Tuesday to seek approval for the linchpin of its turnaround plan, the sale of its best assets to a new government-backed company.
 If the motion is approved, a new G.M., owned primarily by the American and Canadian governments and a union health care trust, would emerge little more than a month after the carmaker sought Chapter 11 protection in early June in one of the country's most significant bankruptcy filings.
 The proceedings looked likely to extend for at least another day, as testimony from Fritz Henderson, G.M.'s chief executive, and several company advisers stretched into Tuesday night. The carmaker and the Obama administration are pushing to conclude the sale by July 10. 
 Mr. Henderson, who has been chief executive for three months, testified in the case, held in Federal Bankruptcy Court before Judge Robert E. Gerber, for five and a half hours.
 Unlike Chrysler, G.M. has so far not faced a significant roadblock to a speedy turnaround. 
 Among the main objectors to its asset sale is a committee of three dissident G.M. bondholders who claim to hold $2.3 million in bonds that they bought for no more than $20 for $1,000 in face value. Others include unofficial committees representing product liability claim holders and asbestos litigants.
 During his time on the stand, Mr. Henderson testified that the cost of winding down the remains of G.M. could reach $1.2 billion, depending on litigation. The company plans to leave $950 million in cash in its bankruptcy estate to take care of claims.
 He also testified that customers appeared to show increased confidence in G.M., in part because Chrysler won approval for a similar turnaround plan in just 42 days. But G.M. still expected to lose money in June, with sales down more than 20 percent from the same time last year.
 Mr. Henderson said the Treasury Department was pushing for a conclusion to the sale that would create what is being called New G.M. by July 10.
 The hearing drew hundreds of spectators who filled the courtroom and three observation rooms. Protesters representing unions adversely affected by G.M.'s restructuring plan arrived in the morning to protest the sale motion.
 The Treasury has named a new G.M. chairman, Edward Whitacre Jr., the former chief executive of AT&T, and is expected to recruit several new directors.
 Lawyers for G.M. argued that the proposed sale under Section 363 of the federal bankruptcy code was ''the only viable alternative'' that would allow for G.M.'s transformation. Without the creation of New G.M., they said in court documents, the company would be forced to liquidate.
 G.M., which sought bankruptcy protection on June 1, is operating on financing provided by the Treasury Department and Canada. Before it filed for bankruptcy, the automaker had drawn $20 billion in Treasury funds. The government estimates it and Canada will provide G.M. with $30 billion more as it operates under court protection.
 Under the plan, the United States government would take a 60 percent stake in the newly formed company, the United Automobile Workers union would have a 17.5 percent stake, the Canadian government would own about 12 percent and G.M. bondholders were expected to get about 10 percent.
 Otherwise, G.M.'s options appear limited. ''There are no lenders willing and able'' to finance the company, and no merger partners or potential acquirers willing to purchase the automaker, its lawyers said.
 In his testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Henderson said that the new G.M. would have a ''fundamentally changed and improved'' operating and capital structure. 
 He predicted it would ''restore confidence on the part of consumers that they can purchase a G.M. vehicle without concerns regarding residual value, replacement parts, warranty obligations and maintenance. Employees, suppliers, dealers and communities will be able to depend on New G.M. as an economically viable and competitive enterprise.''
 The Treasury is backing the warranties of G.M. vehicles purchased while the company operates under bankruptcy protection, as it did for Chrysler. A new version of Chrysler was approved earlier this month, with the Italian automaker Fiat taking management control.
 Industry analysts say a reconstituted G.M. may help bolster what is turning out to be the worst market for auto sales since the early 1980s. Although sales have improved slightly from the beginning of the year, the car companies are on track to sell only about 10 million vehicles this year, down 40 percent from 2007.
 The company has shut 13 of its assembly plants in the United States for up to 11 weeks as part of a bid to cut production and run down inventory while it seeks approval of the sale.
 The company plans to shed dealer contracts and has deals to sell brands like Hummer and Saturn that will not be carried over to the new company. It also plans to end the Pontiac brand, and G.M. said on Monday that it would cut operational ties with a Northern California auto plant it had operated in a joint venture with Toyota Motor.
 Several G.M. dealers who are set to lose their franchises have protested the company's plans to members of Congress. Bankruptcy law allows companies to sever contracts, including those with franchise holders. Over the weekend, G.M. agreed with the government that the new company would assume responsibility for product liability claims, even if they were incurred by the old G.M.

HEADLINE: With More Money, City Schools Added Jobs, Many at Top Dollar

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA and ROBERT GEBELOFF

 BODY:
In the seven years since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took the reins of the city's schools, he has rolled out numerous statistics as proof of his accomplishments, including rising graduation rates and test scores. 
 But one of the clearest ways to see what he and his schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, have done with public education is to track what they have done with its money.
They have overseen a large expansion in annual school spending, to $22 billion from $13 billion, with the additional money pumped in from Mr. Bloomberg's budget and from the state. And that has allowed them to reshape the system to reflect the central elements of the mayor's philosophy: smaller schools, relentless assessments of progress, and higher salaries for administrators to attract top talent.
 A New York Times analysis of seven years of education spending has found a number of changes in how dollars are allocated. There are now 1,075 more principals and assistant principals, even as overall student enrollment has fallen, largely because the city has broken up a number of underperforming schools into smaller schools. There are more administrators, like academic coaches who track test scores, and more support staff, with tasks like patrolling hallways and monitoring attendance. 
 And more administrators are earning top dollar. The number of employees making more than $150,000 has risen to 240, up from 175 in 2002, when those salaries are adjusted for inflation. The number earning at least $125,000 has more than tripled, to 1,935.
 Some shifts were driven by necessity. While the number of teachers in regular classrooms has dropped, hundreds more special education teachers were added to keep pace with a 26 percent jump in students needing those services. There are also thousands more special education assistants and therapists. 
 Much of the increase in the overall budget has been used to pay for rising teacher salaries, pensions and benefits, as well as the growing debt for new school construction. 
 But in many ways the spending patterns reflect the Bloomberg administration's mindset that money attracts people who can bring business-world success to the public arena. Mr. Klein has supported salaries reaching nearly $200,000 for several of his deputies, saying that the pay reflects their qualifications and responsibilities, and that they could be earning far more in the private sector.
 Education Department officials say that the size of the teaching corps is in line with the student population, which dropped to 1,029,459 in 2008 from 1,091,717 six years earlier, and that having more support staff frees teachers to concentrate on the classroom. 
 Mr. Klein has also pushed principals to take on greater responsibility, and his ideal, he has often stated, is to allow principals to spend their money as they see fit. They can decide, for example, whether to hire another math teacher or to use the money for after-school programs instead. In concert with this philosophy, many of the highest-salaried employees today are principals, not administrators: 53 principals made $150,000 or more last year, whereas none were earning that much as recently as 2006, when those salaries are adjusted for inflation. That does not include performance bonuses of up to $50,000 for principals of schools that perform well on standardized tests. 
 ''There is absolutely a priority to attract and keep the best talent, and there is no doubt better pay helps us with that,'' Mr. Klein said, adding, ''When I tell people that they can earn $200,000 for being a principal in New York City, that really gets them paying attention.'' 
 In line with the mayor's affinity for using numbers to judge success, one of the largest areas of growth in the central administration has been in the department's accountability office, which measures performance on state tests and issues school report cards. 
 But as legislators decide whether to keep city schools under the mayor's control, one of the major criticisms is that the school system itself could be more accountable, particularly in the way it spends money.
 Since 2002, the department has remained in a gray area of being technically neither a state nor city agency. It has come under repeated criticism from the city comptroller, who is Mr. Bloomberg's likely opponent in the November mayoral election, and other officials for awarding contracts without bidding, a practice generally prohibited in other city agencies.
 ''Right now, we don't have all the information we need,'' said Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the city's Independent Budget Office. ''People come to us and say, what does this mean, how much are we really spending, what are other ways of looking at this?'' 
 Legislation passed by the State Assembly would hand oversight of the department's budget to the Independent Budget Office, which could have the ability to independently assess other numbers, like graduation rates and school-level spending. The change has not been opposed by the mayor, and Mr. Klein has said that he would welcome an outside agency looking more closely over the department's numbers. 
 ''I think much of this is politics,'' Mr. Klein said in an interview last week. ''We have always been open to oversight and we have been audited repeatedly.'' 
 It is still unclear whether the State Senate, stuck in a leadership battle, will pass the Assembly's bill or press for more changes to the law. Mr. Bloomberg's control of the schools was set to expire at midnight Tuesday, meaning that the schools could revert to supervision by an independent Board of Education, although most officials believe the mayor would be able to maintain stewardship until an agreement in Albany is reached.
 Shifting Responsibility
 The new billions result partly from Mr. Bloomberg's spending decisions, and partly from a lawsuit filed by a group called Campaign for Fiscal Equity, which successfully argued that Albany was shortchanging the city's schools. But the group is not necessarily pleased with the results.
 ''You would think that the school of today compared to the school of yesterday compared to the school of seven years ago would be a richer environment, that there would be a rich art curriculum or more intimate experiences,'' said Helaine Doran, the deputy director of the group. ''There is just no tactical feeling that things are any better.''
 The sheer size of the department's budget makes it unlike any other city agency. The city's next largest agency, the Human Resources Administration, which administers welfare, has about $9.2 billion, less than half of the education budget, according to the Independent Budget Office. The Police Department spends $7.3 billion. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has spoken proudly of trimming the central administration. ''You can't say, 'Let's cut the bureaucracy,' '' he said in January, amid budget negotiations in Albany. ''We have taken $250 million out of the bureaucracy and moved it into the classroom. We have streamlined everything we possibly can.''
 The overall increase in school spending is partly attributable to increased teaching salaries and pensions as well as paying off debt for school construction, which has more than doubled in the last six years. The mayor has raised teacher salaries 43 percent through contract negotiations, with the average salary now at $70,104.
 Generous pensions have been won over many years by the teachers' union, a consistently powerful force in Albany, where pension laws are passed. The mayor and the teachers' union recently reached an agreement, which still needs legislative approval, to trim the cost of pensions for future hires.
 Significantly, the Bloomberg administration has also shifted more responsibility and control over school budgets to principals. 
 Lily Woo, the principal of Public School 130 in Chinatown, said she has been able to take money that in other years would have been spent on hall supervisors and reallocate it to buy supplies like computers and smart boards, which combine technology with traditional chalk boards. Funds that would have been used for a single reading teacher have instead paid for extra hours for a teacher already on staff to work with small groups of children during their lunch time or a free period. 
 ''If you asked schools to effect change without letting them control their money,'' she said, ''it would be like giving a cook a Bunsen burner and telling them to make a four-course meal.'' The number of regular-classroom teachers has dropped by more than 1,600 to 61,549 since the Bloomberg administration took over, according to the Times analysis, which used seven years of payroll data, budget documents, audits and statistics produced by the department at the request of The Times. 
 Meanwhile, the costs of special education teachers, as well as their assistants and supplemental therapists, has soared along with the number of special education students: 103,228 last year, up from 81,268 in 2002. 
 There are 4,500 new school aides, who typically supervise lunchrooms and school yards. More than 2,000 secretaries who previously worked in district offices, which lost much of their role, now work in the schools, according to Education Department data. 
 Over all, enrollment has declined, and the average class size has shrunk about 5 percent from kindergarten through eighth grade, to 23.3 from 24.5. The department's stated goal is 20 students per class for kindergarten through third grade, but it does not have a target class size for grades above third.
 The teacher-to-student ratio, which includes teachers in areas like physical education or lab who are not assigned to particular classrooms, has decreased slightly: to 1 to 15 in 2008 from 1 to 16 in 2002. 
 The centralization of the school system has allowed the city to do away with administrators who once worked in regional or district offices. In their place, for example, the Education Department has increased the number of education analysts and education officers, to 724 from 415 in 2002. Lawrence E. Becker, the head of human resources for the Education Department, said that those titles could include everything from a central administrator looking at financial data to a school-based worker monitoring student test performance. 
 The number of lawyers has also nearly doubled, to 118. Education officials say the additional lawyers are needed to more aggressively pursue teacher discipline cases and to handle a growing number of lawsuits asking the city to pay private school tuition for special education students.
 Efforts at Accountability
 Chancellor Klein has attracted dozens of administrators who had little experience in public schools. Many came from careers in law or business, with hefty salary requirements. James Liebman, the department's chief accountability officer, who also teaches part time at Columbia Law School, made just more than $196,000 in 2007, when Chancellor Klein earned $250,000, the same salary he has received since he began in 2002. 
 ''Many of these people could be earning far, far more in the private sector,'' Mr. Klein said. Referring to the deputy chancellor who oversees political and labor relations, he added: ''Somebody like Chris Cerf could be earning well over $1 million if he were out practicing law.'' Mr. Cerf earned $196,575 in 2008. 
 Photeine Anagnostopoulos, the department's chief operating officer, said her $177,000 salary was less than what she earned in her first job after graduating from business school 25 years ago. 
 Of all the changes Chancellor Klein has made during his tenure, perhaps none has attracted more attention than the power he has given to the Office of Accountability, which has created several systems to track and measure student performance and improvement in the schools. According to Education Department numbers, the office grew to about 110 people in 2008 from about two dozen in June 2001. 
 Officials say the growth reflects the fact that the office's role has undergone big changes in the last several years. The office now issues annual letter grades for each individual school in addition to developing ways for principals and teachers to monitor student improvement. According to The Times's analysis, the accountability office payroll totaled $9.4 million in 2008. 
 Critics have accused Mr. Klein of putting too much faith and money into the accountability office. Last fall, the Independent Budget Office released a report estimating that the department would spend more than $350 million on accountability-related measures from 2007-9. The department objected, saying that the audit included several costs that could not be directly attributed to the office. For example, according to the department, $17.6 million was spent on school inquiry teams, including school staff. 
 ''This is the backbone of the system,'' Mr. Klein said. ''Without accountability, you spend all the time arguing over what you spent the money on, not what results you got for that money.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Wednesday about the large expansion in New York City school spending overseen by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg referred incorrectly in some copies to an increase in the number of education analysts and education officers, to 724 from 415 in 2002. The increase is nearly double, not more than double.

HEADLINE: Aspiring Lawyer Finds Debt Is Bigger Hurdle Than Bar Exam

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
All his life, Robert Bowman wanted to be a lawyer. He overcame a troubled childhood, a tragic accident that nearly cost him a leg and a debilitating Jet Ski collision. 
 He put himself through community college, worked and borrowed heavily to help pay for college, graduate school and even law school. He took the New York bar examination not once, not twice, not three times, but four, passing it last year. Finally, he seemed to be on his way.
 In January, the committee of New York lawyers that reviews applications for admission to the bar interviewed Mr. Bowman, studied his history and the debt he had amassed, and called his persistence remarkable. It recommended his approval.
 But a group of five state appellate judges decided this spring that his student loans were too big and his efforts to repay them too meager for him to be a lawyer. 
 ''Applicant has not made any substantial payments on the loans,'' the judges wrote in a terse decision and an unusual rejection of the committee's recommendation. ''Applicant has not presently established the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor-at-law.''
 Mr. Bowman, 47, appears to have crossed some unspoken line with his $400,000 in student debt and penalties, accumulated over many years.
 New York's courts have overlooked misconduct like lawyers' solicitation of minors for sex, efforts to deceive judges and possession of cocaine. Those instances have led merely to temporary suspensions from practice. 
 ''It usually takes a pretty significant record of some underlying misconduct to keep you out permanently,'' said Deborah L. Rhode, a law professor at Stanford who has studied bar admissions across the states. Excluding someone for having too much debt was odd, she said; the hard questions about loans usually involve applicants who have used bankruptcy to try to escape loans, she said, and Mr. Bowman has not. 
 Mr. Bowman concedes that he has never made a payment on his loans, partly because of medical and other deferrals and problems with his lender. But he says he intends to make good, adding that his only hope is to begin practicing law -- which means overturning the judges' decision. 
 While thousands of indebted students have complained about their treatment by lenders, Mr. Bowman has documented his personal debt crisis with remarkable, obsessive intensity.
 He claims Sallie Mae overcharged him, imposing hefty and unjustified fees; did not allow him to defer payments when he was entitled to do so and improperly accounted for periods when he did defer.
 According to his detailed records, a Sallie Mae representative even threatened him. ''If you default, your license will be taken from you,'' the representative said. ''Do you understand that?''
 When Mr. Bowman said that he did not yet have a law license, the representative responded that the company would prevent him from getting one.
 Martha Holler, a Sallie Mae spokeswoman, said that such threats would violate the company's rules. 
 ''The size of this account is extremely unusual, but not surprising given that the customer took out 32 loans to pursue undergraduate, law and masters of law studies and has not made a single monthly payment over his 26-year student loan history,'' Ms. Holler said. ''We are performing an extensive review of his extraordinary case, and if we identify any errors we will quickly rectify them.'' 
 Mr. Bowman has not had an easy time of it. He was shuffled through foster care and various legal proceedings as a child. He was impressed by the lawyers who represented his interests and saw a possible life's work. 
 Getting a college degree took 10 years because he had spent nearly six in rehabilitation, relearning how to walk after an all-terrain vehicle hit him while he was stopped on his motorcycle. The accident nearly cost him his left leg; he graduated from the State University of New York in Albany in 1995.
 He enrolled at the University of California Hastings College of Law in San Francisco in 2000.
 After his third year, he began a masters of law program in London, where he lived with a girlfriend. He graduated in December 2004 with about $230,000 in student loan debt, and she helped support him while he studied, and studied again and again, for the bar exam.
 In 2007, Mr. Bowman asked for an accounting of his loans, the payment deferrals he had used and his repayment options. He said he did not receive that information for nearly two years -- a point disputed by Sallie Mae, which said it tried to reach Mr. Bowman several times in 2007.
 Mr. Bowman passed the New York bar in February 2008. Soon after, while living with his once-estranged mother in Miramar, Fla., he was swimming at a beach when a Jet Ski lost control and slammed into him, breaking his good leg in four places. 
 ''My luck on these things,'' Mr. Bowman said. ''So I contacted Sallie Mae and I'm like, I need a medical deferment and advice. Their response is, none available.''
 Sallie Mae transferred Mr. Bowman's private student loans, the ones not guaranteed by the federal government, to a collection agency, which tacked on a 25 percent fee. That agency transferred the loan again, and he said the next collection agency tacked on another 25 percent fee. Sallie Mae denied this, saying he was charged the fee only once. But suddenly, Mr. Bowman found that he owed more than $400,000. 
 Knowing it would be difficult to explain his debt to New York's Committee on Character and Fitness, which reviews applications for admission to the bar, Mr. Bowman gathered correspondence with Sallie Mae, loan statements, even the emergency room report on the Jet Ski incident. 
 The three lawyers who interviewed him in Albany in January found Mr. Bowman's ''determination to pursue a postsecondary education remarkable,'' according to the written evaluation. As for the loans, they continued, ''it appears unconscionable that a student loan indebtedness could go from $270,000 to $435,000 in four years.'' 
 Two of the committee members did not return calls seeking comment; the third could not be reached. 
 In April the judges rejected the committee's recommendation and ruled Mr. Bowman could not be a lawyer. Michael J. Novack, the clerk of the court that handled Mr. Bowman's application, declined to comment specifically on his case. 
 ''Generally speaking, if the committee on character and fitness recommends admission of an applicant, the court approves of it,'' Mr. Novack said. ''But not always.''
 Along with asking the court to reverse its decision, Mr. Bowman has consulted lawyers and is preparing a lawsuit against Sallie Mae. One way or another, he vows, he will make the switch from client to lawyer.

HEADLINE: For an Insider, A Lonely Road To Senate Run

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The conversation was not going well. Dennis Mehiel, the powerful Democratic fund-raiser, had Representative Carolyn B. Maloney on the line. And she was obviously unhappy.
 Mr. Mehiel was organizing a fund-raiser in his Upper East Side apartment for Kirsten E. Gillibrand, New York's newly appointed senator, whom Ms. Maloney plans to challenge in the primary next year.
 ''She said she would consider the fund-raiser a personal affront,'' a person with direct knowledge of the conversation said. ''She was upset that a friend and supporter of hers would host the event.''
 Ms. Maloney finds herself very much alone these days. Defying the wishes of Democratic leaders, she plans to announce a Senate bid in the coming days. And that has left Ms. Maloney, a quintessential New York liberal usually embraced by the party, something of an outcast. 
 She has been thwarted in her efforts to hire staff members. Some longtime supporters and interest groups are abandoning her. And an initiative she has worked on for seven years -- to help workers exposed to toxic particles at the World Trade Center site -- is now being advanced by Ms. Gillibrand with the support of Senate elders.
 Pressure from party leaders, among them President Obama, scared off other would-be challengers to Ms. Gillibrand, including the Manhattan borough president and a Long Island congressman.
 But it seems to have only strengthened the resolve of the often irrepressible Ms. Maloney, a 62-year-old North Carolina native who once appeared on the House floor in a burqa to protest the treatment of women by the Taliban.
 In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Maloney said she wanted to give voters a choice.
 ''People around the world watched and were inspired as people in Iran risked their lives to vote,'' she said. ''New Yorkers deserve the same. They deserve the right to vote, the right to make their own decision.''
 Democratic leaders have been viewing Ms. Maloney with concern in recent weeks. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. phoned the congresswoman to gauge how committed she was to running, according to a person close to Ms. Maloney who asked to speak anonymously because the call was supposed to be private.
 The Democrats worry that a contentious primary would imperil their hold on the Senate seat, leaving the Democrat who emerges damaged and depleted of money for what is likely to be a tough general election. So, led by Senator Charles E. Schumer, they have cast their lot with Ms. Gillibrand, a formidable fund-raiser from a region upstate where Republicans usually run strong.
 Ms. Maloney's advisers believe that the behavior of Mr. Schumer and others in the Democratic establishment reflects Ms. Gillibrand's vulnerability. Ms. Gillibrand, appointed in January by Gov. David A. Paterson, is trying to distance herself from positions she took when she was in the House, including her support for gun rights, that are at odds with the views of many of the liberal downstate Democrats who dominate primaries.
 ''They really don't want Gillibrand challenged, because if she is challenged, she could be beaten,'' said Joe Trippi, who ran Howard Dean's presidential campaign in 2004 and is now advising Ms. Maloney. 
 A spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand scoffed at that suggestion, saying Democrats are getting behind the senator because they are impressed by her abilities.
 ''The argument that an incumbent senator is weak because she has built a broad coalition of supporters is certainly a novel tactic,'' said the spokesman, Matt Canter.
 At first blush, Ms. Maloney, who represents New York's wealthy silk-stocking district, does not seem to fit the profile of a rebel. But there has long been a boldness to her.
 In 1992, many told her it was a bad idea to challenge the incumbent congressman, Bill Green, a liberal Republican who had fended off formidable Democratic opponents like Bella Abzug and Mark Green. But Ms. Maloney ran, and won.
 Ms. Maloney was also one of the first New York lawmakers to sharply question President George W. Bush's commitment to paying for the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, even as senior members of the state's Congressional delegation sought to avoid antagonizing the White House.
 She has an impish side, too, once asking Meryl Streep to play her in a Lifetime movie about a rape victim who crusaded for a bill the congresswoman introduced to make it easier to convict rapists.
 There is no question Ms. Maloney, who would not be able to seek re-election to the House during a Senate run, would face a well-financed opponent in Ms. Gillibrand. As of March, Ms. Maloney had $1.3 million on hand, while Ms. Gillibrand had $2.2 million. 
 ''No one is kidding themselves here; we know Gillibrand will raise significant sums of money,'' Mr. Trippi said. But, he added, ''we think the issues and the record are on our side.'' 
 As she seeks to elevate her profile, Ms. Maloney has brought on Barry Nolan, a former host of the tabloid television show ''Hard Copy,'' to be director of communications for the Joint Economic Committee, which she leads.
 But one potentially important hire got away from Ms. Maloney.
 Josh Isay, a highly regarded consultant who set up the first meeting between Mr. Trippi and Ms. Maloney, was in negotiations to work on her campaign. But he backed out after his former boss, Mr. Schumer, expressed disapproval, according to two people briefed about the episode.
 Mr. Isay denied that Mr. Schumer had dissuaded him from working for Ms. Maloney. A spokesman for Mr. Schumer echoed that, saying his office had done nothing more than inquire about a news account that said Mr. Isay was joining Ms. Maloney's effort. 
 In Congress, Ms. Maloney sometimes seems to be in perpetual motion, presiding over hearings and grinding out bills, including one that Mr. Obama recently signed providing additional protections for credit card holders.
 Ms. Maloney said, with some pride, that the president gave her the pen. ''But consumers got more,'' she quickly added.
 But she is upset that an issue she had long been working on -- one that would provide millions of dollars to monitor the health of the Sept. 11 workers -- is now being championed by Ms. Gillibrand in the Senate.
 ''Here she takes my bill and introduces it,'' Ms. Maloney said. 
 Her determination to challenge Ms. Gillibrand has left her isolated in ways that few can understand.
 Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, decided not to run against Ms. Gillibrand after he realized he would be up against a White House bent on avoiding a primary.
 ''I can tell you from firsthand experience what it is like to want to run for office when the president doesn't want you to run,'' he said. ''My campaign slogan was going to be 'Yes, we can!' until the president said, 'No, you won't.' ''

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Warns of Side Effects for 2 Stop-Smoking Drugs

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS and DUFF WILSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal drug regulators warned Wednesday that patients taking two popular drugs to stop smoking should be watched closely for signs of serious mental illness, as reports mount of suicides among the drugs' users. 
 But officials emphasized that fear should not stop patients from taking the smoking-cessation medicines, Chantix, made by Pfizer, and Zyban, made by GlaxoSmithKline, which also sells it under the brand name Wellbutrin, for depression. 
 ''Stopping smoking is a goal we should all be working towards,'' said Dr. Curtis J. Rosebraugh, director of a drug evaluation office at the Food and Drug Administration. ''We don't want to scare people off from trying a medication that could help them achieve this goal. You should just be careful.'' 
 Pfizer will add a so-called black box warning -- the F.D.A.'s most serious caution -- to the packaging information for Chantix. 
 The Pfizer drug, introduced in 2006, has about 90 percent of the market for prescription smoking-cessation drugs, according to IMS Health, a health care information company. Even so, Chantix sales -- $846 million in 2008 -- had been less than Pfizer had hoped because of previous warnings of its side effects.
 Glaxo will expand its existing black box warning on Wellbutrin, citing suicidal thoughts by patients who use it for depression, to include Zyban, which has had only modest sales in the smoking cessation market. 
 Both companies will also be required to conduct clinical trials to assess the mental health risks associated with the drugs' uses. Pfizer is already enrolling schizophrenia patients in a trial. 
 Because smokers and people trying to quit are statistically more likely to be depressed and suicidal, officials for both companies said it was difficult to identify the specific impact of the drugs on those risks. ''Nicotine withdrawal itself can be very difficult for people to endure,'' Dr. Steve Romano, a Pfizer vice president, said Wednesday.
 Analysts said the F.D.A. action would have little effect on sales because of previous indications of the drugs' psychiatric risks. 
 ''I think the market and physicians have already been sensitized to this,'' said Catherine J. Arnold, an analyst for Credit Suisse.
 ''I'm not panicking,'' said Jami Rubin, an analyst for Goldman Sachs, ''Sales are already down a lot. It is and will remain a small niche product.''
 Chantix had already experienced a slight sales decline last year from the $883 million achieved in 2007. And this year's first-quarter sales of $177 million were 36 percent below the corresponding period last year.
 Ms. Arnold predicted that sales would probably continue falling to around $740 million for all of 2009, but that demand for smoking-cessation treatments would enable it to grow modestly after that -- to perhaps half of the $2 billion in annual sales Pfizer had originally hoped for the drug.
 European officials first alerted the F.D.A. in 2007 to problems associated with Chantix. In September of that year, Jeffrey Carter Albrecht, a keyboard player from the pop-music group Edie Brickell and New Bohemians, was killed by a neighbor who had complained that Mr. Albrecht was banging on his door, ranting. Mr. Albrecht's girlfriend blamed Chantix, which she said had made him hostile.
 The widely publicized event led to a cascade of similar reports and scrutiny by F.D.A. safety officials, who have now received 98 reports of suicides and 188 reports of suicide attempts among those taking Chantix. 
 As officials looked more closely, they found to their surprise that Zyban has similar associated risks. The agency received 14 reports of suicides and 17 reports of suicide attempts among those taking Zyban.
 No one knows why the drugs are associated with mental problems. In some cases, patients could be experiencing nicotine withdrawal, but some of the reports involved patients who had yet to stop smoking. And many of the events happened just as patients began or stopped therapy, officials said.
 ''If this is nicotine withdrawal, it really doesn't matter,'' said Dr. Robert Temple, an F.D.A. official. ''You need to pay attention to them.''
 The agency's action requires the drugs' makers to mention the risk of suicide in advertising, and it prevents the companies from using ''reminder'' ads, during which consumers are encouraged to talk to their doctors about a health issue but the product's name is not mentioned.

HEADLINE: How High Can They Go?

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Bounced check: $32. Stop-payment: $30. A.T.M. charge: as high as $3.
 Even now, after all those bailouts, banks never seem to tire of dipping a little deeper into your wallet. Despite the tough economic times and increased scrutiny from Washington, they are keeping most fees at record highs, and are eking out slight increases on others like overdraft charges -- a step they rarely took during past recessions.
 The result? Americans are paying more to save and spend their money. 
 And while the increases are still relatively small by historical standards, they illustrate how banks are looking for almost any nugget of income to help offset huge loan losses and lower revenue as consumers buckle down on spending. 
 The nation's biggest banks -- those that received the biggest bailouts from taxpayers, and are once again gaining strength -- charge fees that are on average at least 20 percent higher than those at smaller lenders, according to Moebs Services, a economic research firm used by banks and federal regulators.
 Some of the charges are getting more creative. Several big banks -- including JPMorgan Chase, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo & -- recently began billing some small-business customers for federal deposit insurance increases. Citigroup and PNC Financial assess around a 3 percent international transaction fee when customers swipe their debit cards overseas. 
 Bank of America recently introduced a raft of changes. In June, it raised the fees on its basic monthly checking account to $8.95 from $5.95. In April, the bank considered raising its overdraft charge to $39, nearly double what the typical bank charged a decade ago. It backed down only after an eruption of consumer complaints, tweaking its rules to keep its initial fee at $35. 
 And then there are credit cards: banks are scrambling to raise rates and fees before a credit card reform bill that President Obama signed into law last month takes effect. JPMorgan Chase recently announced it would raise some balance transfer fees to 5 percent, from 3 percent, in August. Citigroup, Bank of America and other lenders have also been raising the interest rates for millions of cardholders. 
 Over all, fees at the biggest banks are running at their highest levels on record. The average A.T.M. charge, which generates billions of dollars for banks annually, rose at the end of 2008 to $1.97, up from $1.78 the year before and nearly double the 89-cent average recorded in 1998, according to Bankrate.com. 
 Other charges are more eye-popping: today's typical $30 stop-payment fee is about twice as much as a decade ago, according to Moebs. 
 But the most unexpected change has occurred in overdraft fees -- the industry's most lucrative and controversial charge -- where the typical fee rose to $26 after five years at $25. 
 That is only a modest 4 percent increase, compared with the double-digit overdraft fee increases a few years ago, when charges rose to $25 from $22. But amid intense scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers, consumer advocates -- and even some bankers-- are surprised. 
 ''We've never seen a price increase during a recession,'' said Michael Moebs, the chief economist and founder of the research firm that analyzed the fee data at more than 2,200 lenders. ''What the bankers are saying is that I want to maintain my revenue.'' 
 Scott E. Talbott, a lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, said that the banks' fees reflect the cost of providing those services and the rise in overdraft charges reflects increased risk. ''There is an increased riskiness around repayment because of the recession,'' he added.
 Most banks have been reluctant to raise overdraft fees or have made subtle but potentially lucrative changes to how they are assessed. Bankers are worried about criticism from Washington and would rather find ways to bolster profits under the radar. 
 For instance, many banks already generate rich profits by charging consumers high interest rates for loans, while keeping interest rates paid on money market and checking accounts low -- a trend that has become more acute as the Federal Reserve keeps rates near zero to help stoke an economic recovery. 
 But that may not be enough. Large banks, which tend to charge the highest fees, incur a range of expenses that smaller banks do not, including high nationwide advertising bills and the costs of operating networks of A.T.M.'s and retail branches. Many smaller banks are also struggling now more than ever to offset losses and dwindling revenue. 
 And as consumers themselves rein in their finances, raising the overdraft fee has become an easy option. With fewer customers overdrawing their accounts, overdraft fees risk shrinking to a smaller income stream from what Moebs estimates is a $38.5 billion business this year. That is, unless banks raise fees on customers who run into trouble. 
 Aaron Fine, a retail banking consultant at Oliver Wyman, said that overdraft fee income could fall 5 to 20 percent for some banks in the second and third quarter. ''That is the multibillion-dollar question,'' he said. ''How do you replace those fees with something else?'' 
 Two large regional banks, which have been hit hard by the recession, appear to be struggling to find answers.
 KeyCorp, a regional lender based in Cleveland, raised its overdraft fee by 50 cents to a dollar for repeat offenders in the last few months, bringing its maximum charge to as much as $39. Comerica, which has big operations in Michigan and California, raised similar fees by approximately $2 to $3 when it introduced a tiered fee structure that charges $25 to $37 as the number of offenses increase. 
 Regulators and lawmakers say they plan to crack down on excessive service fees, just as they did with a new bill barring unfair credit card practices. Federal Reserve officials have proposed new rules that would let debit and A.T.M. customers ''opt in'' for overdraft protection, or allow existing customers to opt out of the service. 
 Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, introduced more stringent legislation this spring requiring banks to notify customers before they overdraw their accounts. 
 Of course, consumers do not have to be taken in. Consumer advocates suggest comparing the fees charged by big banks with those of credit unions and community lenders in a given area. When possible, use an A.T.M. in the bank's network. And if you do incur fees, ask your bank manager about waiving them. 
 Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at BankRate.com, said that as banking fees head into overdrive, consumers simply need to be more alert. ''We will have to be on our toes to avoid getting tripped up,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Industry Tightens Its Standards For Tracking Web Surfers

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
IN an effort to fend off federal regulation, major trade groups in the advertising industry have announced stricter guidelines on how their members use and collect online data.
 In a report to be released Thursday, a consortium of the trade groups intends to address a growing concern in Washington and among consumer advocates that people are being tracked too much online, with information about their Web surfing, shopping habits and overall interests being collected for advertising purposes.
 Congress held hearings on the subject in June, asking executives from Facebook, Google and Yahoo to testify, and the Federal Trade Commission issued a report in February that urged updated principles for self-regulation. All along, most advertisers, agencies and publishers have been arguing that they can keep an eye on their own practices, and don't need government intervention. 
 The jump in interest from Washington hastened the report's release, said Stuart P. Ingis, a partner at the Venable law firm and a lawyer for the trade groups.
 ''We believe that self-regulation, historically, it's proven to be far more dynamic and flexible in this area,'' Mr. Ingis said. ''Legislation is a pretty blunt instrument and we hope, legislation or not, these are the right standards.''
 The report, ''Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising,'' reflects several of the commission's suggestions from February. The principles are meant to go into effect in 2010, affecting the more than 5,000 companies that belong to the sponsoring organizations, including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Disney and Verizon. 
 In one big change, the report instructs members to provide notice, either in an ad or on a Web site (rather than hidden in the privacy policy), that behavioral information is being collected. 
 ''For years, consumer groups, and most recently the F.T.C. and people on the Hill, had been calling for transparency at the time of collection'' of data, Mr. Ingis said. ''So for the first time -- we think it's a monumental shift -- there will be transparency provided across the ecosystem.''
 Mr. Ingis said the exact form of the notice had not been decided on -- it could be a link that says ''Why did I get this?'' or ''interest-based advertising,'' meaning information on advertising based on Web visits and behaviors, he said. ''All that is to be determined following the rollout of the principles,'' he said. ''The requirement is that it be clear, meaningfully prominent and uniform.''
 The report also suggests an enforcement process, so that competitors or consumers can bring complaints if a company violates the principles. ''Programs will also, at a minimum, publicly report instances of noncompliance and refer entities that do not correct violations to the appropriate government agencies,'' the report says.
 It also says consumers must approve the collection of ''sensitive data'' -- mostly on finances or health.
 Some privacy advocates have been pushing for more stringent rules, saying, for instance, that consumers must explicitly approve all data collection.
 Mr. Ingis said that was not feasible.
 ''If you had that as a default, you would wind up undercutting significantly the economic underpinnings for all the stuff the public loves,'' he said. ''The way, operationally, that would work is every time a consumer's doing their Web surfing, you'd be requiring them to click through all these options. Consumers would hate that.''
 Another issue privacy watchdogs have raised is that consumers have no access to the data being collected about them -- it is all done behind the scenes.
 Giving consumers access to the data is ''an interesting concept,'' Mr. Ingis said, noting that what the companies collect shows up as ''a bunch of ones and zeros.'' 
 ''The data is in computer wording, programming speak, and to the consumer would mean nothing,'' he said. 
 (A handful of online companies, including Google, have translated the data, however, and have said they will give consumers access.) 
 ''Of course they can give the profile information, the profile information can be translated,'' said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group, when asked about Mr. Ingis's statement. ''People need to have access to their entire profile, and this is a thinly veiled excuse so that the companies can retain the data without giving consumers control over their information.''
 The announcement of the report includes an advertising campaign to publicize the new standards. Members of the consortium include the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the Association of National Advertisers (which represents companies that advertise, like McDonald's or General Electric) and the Interactive Advertising Bureau. Their members have pledged 500 million impressions, or views by readers, over the next year and a half to promote the changes.
 ''I am gratified that a group of influential associations -- representing a significant component of the Internet community -- has responded to so many of the privacy concerns raised by my colleagues and myself,'' Pamela Jones Harbour, a member of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement. The report has ''the potential to dramatically advance the cause of consumer privacy,'' she said.
 Charles H. Kennedy, a lawyer at Morrison & Foerster who focuses on communications and advertising and did not work on the report, gives it a mixed review.
 ''These principles are especially strong in the area of notice or transparency,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''It's a little less clear, I think, on consent and how it's going to be obtained and what it's going to consist of.''
 He said that although the Federal Trade Commission seemed to be increasing its enforcement in the online-marketing world -- last month, it settled with Sears over charges that its marketing software did not disclose all the information it collected -- he expected self-regulation would win out.
 ''What we will see at minimum is the F.T.C. will continue to bring individual enforcement actions, like the one they brought against Sears, that will be intended to signal to industry the kind of practices the agency wants to see,'' he said. ''It's sort of an informal way of making rules without making rules.'' 
 He added, ''I think self-regulation ultimately is going to be the solution, and this is a big step in the right direction.''

HEADLINE: A Guiding Hand From Big to Small

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
For a small business, especially in the current weak economy, a contract to supply goods or services to a large corporation can be a welcome lifeline. Some big companies, meanwhile, are seeking to expand their network of small suppliers. 
 To serve both their interests, some major corporations, including I.B.M., Wal-Mart, Procter & Gamble and Home Depot, offer programs to mentor small companies, particularly businesses owned by women, blacks, Hispanics and other groups. 
 Some corporations, including I.B.M., work with small suppliers who have good if modest track records by assigning an executive to give hands-on advice and guidance for periods of up to 18 months. 
 Alan Green Jr., co-owner of Green Ink Communications, a media production firm in Voluntown, Conn., said the nurturing ''is making a big difference for us to get off the ground.'' 
 He joined I.B.M.'s mentoring program after he failed to win a company contract to produce a series of employee education videos. The corporation concluded, based on his previous work, that he had a promising business and invited him to participate as part of its outreach to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual business owners. 
 Mr. Green, known as Chip, and his mentor, Carmen Rarden, an I.B.M. purchasing executive, spent two days in 2007 brainstorming at the corporation's diversity supplier program in Charlotte, N.C., to pinpoint Green Ink's capabilities and determine its short- and long-term goals -- a process assisted by Leonard Greenhalgh, a management professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.
 ''It's typical that companies like Chip's know how to do the work rather than know how to run a business,'' said Professor Greenhalgh, who is also director of the business school's programs for minority and women-owned business enterprises. 
 ''They tend to always be dealing with crises and meeting deadlines,'' Professor Greenhalgh said. ''But for two days, they sit down, reflect on what they're good at doing, whether it's strategy, marketing or figures -- and no one is good at all three.
 ''And the mentor is there to hold their feet to the fire -- in a nice way,'' he added.
 Since it began mentoring suppliers in 2003, I.B.M. has used volunteers from its ranks to guide 50 small companies, said Michael K. Robinson, the program's director.
 ''We identify those with good management, and match them with one of our executives to work with them on identifying and developing two or three business areas to focus on improving,'' Mr. Robinson said.
 Despite the economic downturn, Mr. Robinson said I.B.M. was continuing to focus on helping its suppliers because ''we spent nearly $2.5 billion in 2007 with 350 suppliers in the United States alone.'' I.B.M. is one of 16 major corporations -- Honda is the newest member -- that make up the Billion Dollar Roundtable. Each member corporation spends at least $1 billion annually with minority- or women-owned suppliers. 
 Corporations have a strong motivation to help smaller businesses, said Donna Long, of the National Minority Supplier Development Council, which provides a link between minority-owned businesses and corporations, universities, hospitals and similar institutions.
 ''They don't want to change suppliers every year,'' said Ms. Long, vice president for development. ''They would rather work with the supplier they have, but they also want them to be extensions of the corporation and to buy into its values.''
 At the same time, major companies ''don't want to be the only source of business for a small firm,'' Ms. Long said.
 Expanding his customer base was one of the goals that Mr. Green and Ms. Rarden set for their collaboration. But first, they worked extensively on refashioning Green Ink's image and message.
 Ms. Rarden, who had previously mentored a company owned by a woman, reviewed Green Ink's presentations -- which Mr. Green described as ''a lot of eye candy, but not a lot of substance'' -- and coached the company on how to make them better.
 ''I pretended I was the customer, and listened to a mock presentation,'' Ms. Rarden said. ''Then we improved on that.'' She also encouraged the three-person company to ''think through its values and mission'' and put them into a new marketing video. In addition, she offered guidance on nuts-and-bolts areas like the specifics that an I.B.M. purchasing department looks for in a contract bid.
 In Atlanta, Home Depot also selects promising young companies to mentor, and participates in the state's mentor-protege business program, where small businesses are paired with large companies.
 Gwen Thomas, president of HR Now in Atlanta, which advises companies on human resources management, headed Home Depot's first protege company. When the companies were matched in 2004, Ms. Thomas was not assigned one mentor, but rotated through a number of the corporation's departments, including legal and finance, and learned from their executives about Home Depot's policies and needs.
 The same year, Ms. Thomas renamed her company and, she said, she realized under Home Depot's tutelage that she needed to develop strategies to become better known nationally and connect with other suppliers.
 ''It was almost like getting an individual business degree,'' Ms. Thomas said of her mentoring. ''I had a wish list of what I wanted to learn, and they helped me with it.
 ''Even now, I can pick up the phone and ask, 'Hey, what do you think about this?' and I'll get a response.'' 
 Some small companies also can get corporate scholarships to attend weeklong programs for entrepreneurs at Tuck and Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. But Mr. Green said his workers were fully engaged in building on what they had learned in the brainstorming session. 
 ''It was like a steroid injection,'' he said. ''We came out of that session so charged and ready to go. It really helped us realize how we could develop our competencies, and how we could grow without hurting our core business.''

 More Information
 Details about the I.B.M. and Home Depot corporate supplier diversity programs can be found here and here. The Billion Dollar Roundtable lists the 16 large companies that spent $1 billion or more each annually with suppliers owned by minorities or women.
 The National Minority Supplier Development Council partners with the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University each June to provide the Advanced Management Education Program. Corporate members recommend small businesses to participate in the four-day program, which teaches the skills needed to expand and sustain a business.
 The Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth offers two-week programs. This year, it is offering ''Building a High-Performing Minority Business'' in July, August and December to teach skills like cost analysis, control systems, marketing and leadership.
 A second program, ''Growing the Minority Business to Scale,'' offered in November, builds on information learned in the initial program.
 Tuck provides a $4,000 scholarship to minority participants to defray the $8,500 cost. Information can be found here.

HEADLINE: A House in the Woods, After the Woods Are Gone

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

 BODY:
TWELVE years ago, my wife and I looked at 11 acres on the outskirts of Helena, Mont. We knew this was where we wanted to build our home. The land was covered with dense forest, including dozens of stately old-growth ponderosa pines. 
 The rolling property lay on the edge of a small 19th-century gold-mining village, with what was once one of the most productive mines in the state, and just four miles from downtown Helena, where we had lived for 20 years. We would be a 10-minute drive or an hourlong walk through thick woods and meadows on the thousands of acres of forested public land that surrounded the site. At $60,000 it was pricy, the high end of our range. But it would give us the best of both worlds. 
 So we bought the land, and built a house, and managed to have the full Montana experience. There were just a few neighbors in the small town below us, hidden by the forest. Deer grazed on the hill behind us. A moose ran through the backyard one day; a bobcat loped through the front yard. Early one morning we were awakened by what we thought was the scream of a child -- but it turned out to be an eerie, uncharacteristic wail coming from a coyote. 
 When we bought the land, the stands of timber were so dense and unruly you couldn't walk through parts of the property. I bought my first chainsaw, an orange beauty. I spent a lot of time thinning small trees, sawing up bigger ones for firewood, splitting and stacking the wood, and using it all to heat our house. We rarely used the propane furnace. Our masonry wood stove from Finland, a Tulikivi, has a mass of gray soapstone around the fire box that stores the warmth and radiates heat into the house for 24 hours, even in the coldest days of December.
 And we were ''fireproofing'' our property, thinning trees around the house should a wildfire break out. 
 Four years ago, the beetles came. First a couple of our oldest pine trees turned red. Alarmed, we quickly cut them down and covered them with black plastic. It's stomach-churning when the tree reaper comes to claim your forest. One day ivory-colored plugs that look like candle wax are plastered on the trunk, a sign the tree is pumping out resin to try to halt a drilling bug. Sometimes a tree wins by entombing a beetle; far more often the trees lose to the mob assault. 
 Then things went exponential. One dead tree turned to five and the next year five turned to 30, dying far faster than I could cut them down. Now the mortality count is in the hundreds, more than 95 percent of our forest, and many more in the national forest around us. 
 Last week we threw in the towel. A logging crew cut down all but a few of our trees, taking away our forest and leaving us a meadow. The trees, too damaged to be turned into lumber, were hauled off to a pulp plant, where they will be ground into an oatmeal-like slurry and turned into cardboard boxes. I won't make money; in fact it will cost me some $700 an acre to get rid of them. And good riddance -- the sooner they're gone the better. Dead trees are a fire waiting to happen.
 The beetles aren't just claiming our forest. A hike to the hilltop behind my house reveals an entire mountain valley covered with dead and dying trees. On weekends and in the evening the valley is filled with the angry hornet-whine of chainsaws and the sound of crashing trees. 
 Where there are too many trees to be removed economically they will stand until they blow down, inevitably to be consumed in a conflagration. One family up the road, in a particularly fire prone area, has buried two new septic tanks with an air supply in which to take refuge, should a fast moving fire overtake their home or block the road.
 It's beyond sad to watch your robust green forest turn red and dead in a matter of a few years. This phenomenon is going on all around the West, from Colorado to Alaska. The forest -- the reason many people moved to the small towns and rural areas of the West -- is disappearing. It's happened before, but never to this degree, and there is no end in sight. Scientists believe the proliferation of beetles is a consequence of a warming climate. Bitter cold temperatures are the only way to keep them in check, and our coldest winter temperatures are now as much as 10 degrees warmer than in the past, which allows the beetles to escape significant winter kill. Now all bets are off. The epidemic will likely be done, experts say, when the bugs run out of food -- when they kill all the trees. 
 Even though this climate-driven, bark beetle outbreak is unprecedented in scope, I understand that insects, like fire, are nature's way of regenerating a forest. What is good for the forest though, can be hard on a property owner.
 Living in a valley where the forest is dead is dislocating, even apocalyptic. Over the years I've written much about how the West is being affected by climate change. Now it's personal. 
 It's a shocker to look out our window these days, something like looking in the mirror after you first shave a beard. The forest we painstakingly thinned and managed is now a horror show. It looks like the Once-ler has come through, the mythical tree killing creature from Dr. Seuss's ''The Lorax.''
 The tang of pine pitch hangs in the air. The sky is much bigger. The forest's cloak of privacy has given way to very public open vistas, with mountains, neighbors and the small town suddenly visible in the near distance. The trees are either stacked like giant reddish-brown Lincoln Logs waiting for a logging truck, or lying in pieces and slivers on the ground, a wasteland of broken branches and stumps. ''It's like open heart surgery,'' said Levi Cheff, the contractor I hired, as we surveyed the project and the sound of falling trees continued to ring through the air. ''It's a good thing, but you don't want to watch it while it's going on.'' 
 In the end, there are silver linings, I suppose. The threat of forest fire left with the forest. From the bedroom I can see the indigo silhouette of the Big Belt Mountains and the glowing lights of Helena. Always the optimists, real estate agents in some places have dubbed land like ours ''emerging view lots.''
 As the land heals and a meadow grows up our grief will dissipate. We'll miss our forest. The fact, though, is that nature is constantly changing. It's a tough lesson to learn, especially with change this sudden. But a warming planet promises more of the same, so we'd better get used to it.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Last Month Gave Hope For Uptick

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Automakers had another difficult month in June, but sales figures released Wednesday included faint glimmers of hope for the industry. 
 The Ford Motor Company has been hoping to separate itself in consumers' eyes from its domestic rivals, General Motors and Chrysler, which have been forced to accept government lifelines and to file for bankruptcy.
 June sales suggest that is happening. Ford, which has not asked for a government bailout, said its sales were down 11 percent from June 2008. 
 By contrast, sales fell 33 percent for General Motors, which has temporarily shut many of its factories to pare inventories, and 42 percent for Chrysler, which closed all of its United States plants while it operated in bankruptcy protection. 
 Ford also outsold Toyota in June for the third consecutive month, and the company is regaining share while discounting its vehicles less than G.M. and Chrysler.
 Ford said its sales in more than half of the country were about even with or greater than a year ago. Stagnant demand in the West and Southeast, where the housing market has been hit hardest, dragged the company's overall sales lower.
 ''Ford is a much stronger brand than a lot of us give it credit for,'' said Jesse Toprak, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives car-buying advice to consumers. ''They're able to sell the car and not the deal.''
 The plant closings at G.M. and Chrysler cut sharply into both companies' sales to car rental companies and other business customers, but their bankruptcies have not scared away as many consumers as their executives say they had feared.
 ''Customers are cautiously coming back into the market, although the industry remains very weak,'' Mark LaNeve, G.M.'s vice president for North American sales, service and marketing, said.
 Asian automakers reported declines ranging from 32 percent at Toyota to 23 percent at Nissan.
 Over all, industry sales fell 28 percent compared with June 2008, a dismal figure on its own but the smallest decline since September.
 ''The last two months of improvements are showing signs of life in the market,'' said Mr. Toprak. ''If nothing else we can easily say that things are not getting worse, and this is happening at a time when we're dealing with so much volatility in the marketplace. Out of that mess we came out with a number that wasn't the worst of the year, and that's positive.''
 Ford said this week that it was increasing production in the third quarter, which starts Wednesday, to meet the rise in demand its dealers were seeing. The company now plans to build 67,000 more vehicles than it did in the third quarter of 2008, a 16 percent increase.
 ''We're making steady progress and are firmly focused on our plan to build a sustainable and exciting Ford,'' said James D. Farley, Ford's group vice president for marketing and communications. ''We remain grounded, however, given challenging industry and economic conditions.''
 Meanwhile, Ford's domestic rivals have had to spend time reassuring would-be customers that they are not going out of business, and have been taking a beating from late-night comics. (Conan O'Brien said President Obama should hire G.M.'s chief executive as warden of the Guantanamo Bay military prison to make sure it closes.)
 Even a modest recovery would not put the market anywhere near its levels for most of the last decade, when auto sales in the United States were about 17 million a year before plummeting in the second half of 2008. Fewer than five million vehicles were sold in the first half of 2009, a decrease of nearly 37 percent.
 But declining new jobless claims and higher consumer confidence ratings ''suggest to us that the worst is behind us,'' Ford's chief sales analyst, George Pipas, said this week. ''We may have seen the low point in auto sales.''
 Automakers are hoping for a modest jump in demand beginning later this month, when the so-called cash-for-clunkers program begins. Eligibility requirements and financing limitations will prevent the program from stimulating the market as much as automakers had hoped, but they are eager for any increase in showroom traffic it creates.
 Sales were on pace to be even higher in June, but they fell off in the final week of the month, after President Obama signed the cash-for-clunkers bill. The program, which starts in late July, lets consumers trade in an older vehicle for credit toward a new, more fuel-efficient model, and automakers say they believe many shoppers, upon hearing of the program, were waiting to see if they qualified before buying a car.
 ''I think it definitely put some people on the sidelines at the end of the month,'' said Mr. LaNeve at G.M. ''It softened up the last week of the month which is traditionally the week of the most sales.''

HEADLINE: When Our Brains Short-Circuit

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Our political system sometimes produces such skewed results that it's difficult not to blame bloviating politicians. But maybe the deeper problem lies in our brains.
 Evidence is accumulating that the human brain systematically misjudges certain kinds of risks. In effect, evolution has programmed us to be alert for snakes and enemies with clubs, but we aren't well prepared to respond to dangers that require forethought.
 If you come across a garter snake, nearly all of your brain will light up with activity as you process the ''threat.'' Yet if somebody tells you that carbon emissions will eventually destroy Earth as we know it, only the small part of the brain that focuses on the future -- a portion of the prefrontal cortex -- will glimmer. 
 ''We humans do strange things, perhaps because vestiges of our ancient brain still guide us in the modern world,'' notes Paul Slovic, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon and author of a book on how our minds assess risks.
 Consider America's political response to these two recent challenges:
 1. President Obama proposes moving some inmates from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to supermax prisons from which no one has ever escaped. This is the ''enemy with club'' threat that we have evolved to be alert to, so Democrats and Republicans alike erupt in outrage and kill the plan.
 2. The climate warms, ice sheets melt and seas rise. The House scrounges a narrow majority to pass a feeble cap-and-trade system, but Senate passage is uncertain. The issue is complex, full of trade-offs and more cerebral than visceral -- and so it doesn't activate our warning systems.
 ''What's important is the threats that were dominant in our evolutionary history,'' notes Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard University. In contrast, he says, the kinds of dangers that are most serious today -- such as climate change -- sneak in under the brain's radar.
 Professor Gilbert argues that the threats that get our attention tend to have four features. First, they are personalized and intentional. The human brain is highly evolved for social behavior (''that's why we see faces in clouds, not clouds in faces,'' says Mr. Gilbert), and, like gazelles, we are instinctively and obsessively on the lookout for predators and enemies.
 Second, we respond to threats that we deem disgusting or immoral -- characteristics more associated with sex, betrayal or spoiled food than with atmospheric chemistry. 
 ''That's why people are incensed about flag burning, or about what kind of sex people have in private, even though that doesn't really affect the rest of us,'' Professor Gilbert said. ''Yet where we have a real threat to our well-being, like global warming, it doesn't ring alarm bells.'' 
 Third, threats get our attention when they are imminent, while our brain circuitry is often cavalier about the future. That's why we are so bad at saving for retirement. Economists tear their hair out at a puzzlingly irrational behavior called hyperbolic discounting: people's preference for money now rather than much larger payments later.
 For example, in studies, most Americans prefer $50 now to $100 in six months, even though that represents a 100 percent return. 
 Fourth, we're far more sensitive to changes that are instantaneous than those that are gradual. We yawn at a slow melting of the glaciers, while if they shrank overnight we might take to the streets.
 In short, we're brilliantly programmed to act on the risks that confronted us in the Pleistocene Age. We're less adept with 21st-century challenges.
 At the University of Virginia, Professor Jonathan Haidt shows his Psychology 101 students how evolution has prepared us to fear some things: He asks how many students would be afraid to stand within 10 feet of a friend carrying a pet boa constrictor. Many hands go up, although almost none of the students have been bitten by a snake. 
 ''The objects of our phobias, and the things that are actually dangerous to us, are almost unrelated in the modern world, but they were related in our ancient environment,'' Mr. Haidt said. ''We have no 'preparedness' to fear a gradual rise in the Earth's temperature.''
 This short-circuitry in our brains explains many of our policy priorities. We Americans spend nearly $700 billion a year on the military and less than $3 billion on the F.D.A., even though food-poisoning kills more Americans than foreign armies and terrorists. We're just lucky we don't have a cabinet-level Department of Snake Extermination.
 Still, all is not lost, particularly if we understand and acknowledge our neurological shortcomings -- and try to compensate with rational analysis. When we work at it, we are indeed capable of foresight: If we can floss today to prevent tooth decay in later years, then perhaps we can also drive less to save the planet.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. to Issue Rules For Private Equity Deals

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation plans to issue new rules that could make it slightly easier for private equity firms to buy failed banks, according to people familiar with the agency's deliberations.
 Under a directive to be issued on Thursday, the agency is expected to demand that investment firms like the Carlyle Group or Kohlberg Kravis Roberts provide follow-up support to the banks they acquire if the banks get into more trouble and need additional capital.
 The new rules represent a difficult balancing act for the F.D.I.C, which is responsible for protecting depositors from losses. 
 On the one hand, government officials have been eager to recruit private investors and stretch out the limited money that Congress has approved for bailing out troubled financial institutions. On the other hand, bank regulators remain leery about letting comparatively high-risk investor groups take control of banks with billions of dollars in government-guaranteed deposits.
 The F.D.I.C., which is responsible for insuring bank deposits, is eager to find buyers for insolvent banks and minimize the cost to taxpayers. The agency has seized 45 failing banks this year, and more than 60 since last fall. 
 Private equity firms can tap into huge pools of capital and they have been yearning to buy banks at bargain prices.
 Federal regulators have allowed private equity investors to buy a handful of failing banks, notably the BankUnited Financial Corporation in Florida and IndyMac Bancorp in California.
 But the approvals have been made slowly, and on a case-by-case basis. Agency officials said the rules to be adopted on Thursday amounted to a clarification of their policy rather than a drastic change.
 Indeed, industry executives said on Wednesday evening that they were not sure if the new rules amounted to an easing or a tightening of longstanding restrictions that have kept most private equity investors out of the banking industry.
 Among the rules under discussion, according to industry executives and government officials, are higher capital requirements for private equity investors than for traditional banks. The agency will also demand that private equity firms document their sources of strength, a reference to their ability to provide follow-up financing.
 For investors that own several banks, the agency would require cross guarantees in which a strong bank owned by an investment group could be enlisted to shore up the capital of a weaker bank owned by the same group.
 Last but not least, the agency plans to include rules against flipping, to prohibit people from buying a bank and reselling it a few months later. Under the new rules, private equity firms would have to retain their investment in a bank for at least 18 months and possibly two years.
 H. Rodgin Cohen, a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell who represents some private equity firms, said he was not sure whether the new rules would speed up or slow down their investment in banks.
 ''It's always good to have an element of certainty,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''The question is whether this will put up barriers that are so discouraging economically that it will actually restrict private equity firms. We won't know until the details are out.''
 Regardless of the details, the new rules are not expected to change the main regulatory obstacle for private equity firms buying banks. That obstacle is the Federal Reserve, which requires that institutions holding more than 24.9 percent of a bank's voting shares be subject to regulation as bank holding companies. 
 Except for a handful of private equity firms that specialize in banks, most firms are loath to fall under those regulations. 
 To get around those restrictions, private equity firms have teamed up to form ''club'' deals in which no individual firm exceeds the Fed's threshold for control. But that arrangement is often unwieldy and cumbersome, because none of the investment firms is supposed to be in ''control.'' 
 ''The F.D.I.C. does not control what happens,'' said Joshua Siegel, managing principal at StoneCastle Partners, a private equity firm in New York. ''The Fed is in charge.''

HEADLINE: Crabtree & Evelyn Files For Bankruptcy Protection

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Crabtree & Evelyn, the purveyor of specialty soaps, fragrances and lotions, became the latest retailer to fall victim to the economic downturn, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Wednesday in the United States. 
 The company, a unit of Crabtree & Evelyn Holdings in Britain, said it would continue to operate its stores and would honor gift cards and returns as it reorganizes under bankruptcy protection.
 The company said it would close some stores and try to renegotiate leases for others. It currently operates 126 stores in 34 states and employs about 950 people.
 In a court filing, Crabtree & Evelyn's acting president, Stephen Bestwick, said a decline in the housing market and tightening of credit had reduced consumer discretionary spending, especially in shopping malls where many of its stores were located.
 He also said management changes at the company resulted in strategy shifts, including lower sales to wholesale accounts and a ''disconnect'' between executive pay and performance. 
 The retailer expects to lose $13.3 million on revenue of about $100 million in the current fiscal year, compared with a loss of $8 million on revenue of $107.5 million in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2008.
 Crabtree & Evelyn has $10 million to $50 million of both assets and debts, a court filing said. It has received a commitment for a $40 million debtor-in-possession financing facility from its owner, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad, a multinational company based in Malaysia.
 Crabtree & Evelyn companies outside of the United States are not affected by the Chapter 11 filing.

HEADLINE: Sharp Price Drops Found In Manhattan Apartments

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Manhattan apartment prices fell sharply during the second quarter of 2009, as the limited number of deals struck during the darkest months of the economic downturn began to close, according to a series of market reports released Wednesday.
 The number of closings fell more than 50 percent, and prices in some categories were reported down as much as 25 percent, compared with the same quarter in 2008. Sale prices were also down from those reported in the first quarter of 2009.
 One report, by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, put the average price of a Manhattan apartment in the second quarter at $1.26 million, a decline of 24 percent from the same period in 2008, and 16 percent below the previous quarter. It put the median sale price at $795,000, 19 percent below the figure in the first quarter of 2008. 
 Another report, by Prudential Douglas Elliman, found that the median sale price on the resale of existing apartments was down by 25.6 percent from a year earlier. The report, prepared by Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm, said that the number of sales was down 50.3 percent compared with the same period in 2008.
 The new figures on closed sales confirm the downward trajectory in the Manhattan market that brokers have been reporting for many months. But the report was issued at a time when brokers had begun to say that sales activity rebounded sharply in the last six weeks, though at prices well below the peak last year. 
 ''The market took a nose dive and business virtually stopped in September,'' said Dorothy Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''Now you are seeing people at least spending money again. I am not saying it is a different world; buyers are still looking for value.''
 The reports issued by the major brokerage firms show that the steepest declines in sales and prices occurred in the largest and most expensive apartments, where banks are requiring large down payments from buyers seeking mortgages. Sales were also off sharply in new condominium developments, which have been hit hard in the economic downturn. Mr. Miller put the decline in sales of new condos at 61.7 percent. 
 The strongest activity was reported in smaller, less expensive apartments, often bought by renters buying their first homes. They benefited by low mortgage rates available for loans that conform to federal guidelines, and a federal tax credit available to many first-time home buyers.
 The lag in time between the time a contract is signed and the time a deal closes is unusually long in Manhattan because many sales cannot close until a buyer is approved by a co-op board, or a sale is reviewed by a condominium board. Many of the sales reported in contract in the last few weeks will not close until later in the summer or the fall. 
 The Brown Harris Stevens report found that sales of trophy apartments had shriveled during the downturn, with sales of co-ops costing more than $10 million off by 82 percent from the same period a year ago. This contributed to a sharp weakening in average prices of all co-ops, off 29 percent to $918,795, the report found. 
 But sales of these larger co-ops have picked up along with the rest of the market. ''As 2009 has progressed we have continued to see a significant increase in activity and sales each month,'' said Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens. 
 A number of statistics supported this view. The inventory of apartments on the market, and the number of days an apartment lingered on the market before it sold, were up sharply from a year ago, but down a bit from the first quarter as the market strengthened. Streeteasy.com, a real estate Web site, said that 2,477 apartments went into contract during the second quarter, an 82 percent increase from activity in the first quarter.
 Still, there was very little optimism that sale prices would strengthen significantly from their current level. Pamela Liebman, the chief executive at the Corcoran Group, said she expected prices to stabilize and then perhaps rise ''a couple of points'' a year. Sellers are better off selling now than waiting, she said. 
 ''If I were a seller, I would take the risk out of the calculation,'' she said. ''Time does not necessarily equate to money here for the seller.''
 Mr. Miller said that at best, the market would move sideways. ''We will probably get a little worse before it is going to get better,'' he said, ''because unemployment is likely to continue to rise after the recession ends this year.''
 But Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said the economic outlook in New York had improved, with unemployment, so far, remaining below the national rate. ''A lot of things are bottoming out,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In a Recession Year, Less Flash for the Fourth

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Displays of patriotism and military pride will be robust at the Freedom Over Texas festival on Saturday in Houston. But when the sun goes down, the dazzling centerpiece of the Independence Day event, what organizers call ''the largest land-based fireworks show in the nation,'' will be a bit less large in this budget-slashed summer of recession. 
 Of course, even if the budget for the Houston event, about $850,000, is half what it was last year, the show's organizers point out that at least they are still having fireworks. 
 Several dozen smaller cities and groups, from New England to California to Florida and the Northwest, have eliminated money for fireworks, in some cases to save city jobs. Skies will be darker over some towns in Massachusetts. Fewer fireworks barges will float on the Columbia River separating Washington and Oregon. 
 In some cases, donors have rushed in to rescue fireworks displays. In others, neighborhood associations have taken it upon themselves to stage community displays. Yet the budget cuts have also brought something of a shift in message in some places in what can seem like an act of pyrotechnic one-upmanship. 
 ''It does not have to be bigger and better every year,'' said Susan Christian, who organizes the Houston event through the office of Mayor Bill White. ''What it has to be is creative and fun and entertaining. That's what it has to be.''
 Ms. Christian noted that the Houston event would emphasize recycling for the first time for the 100,000 people expected to attend and that, while there might be fewer fiery bursts in the sky, the fireworks show was not expected to be significantly shorter, around 20 minutes. Some of the bigger booms may linger longer, she said.
 ''I don't think the layman will notice anything different,'' Ms. Christian said.
 The same cannot be said for Vancouver, Wash., where for nearly half a century fireworks have been launched from a barge in the Columbia River across from historic Fort Vancouver, drawing 65,000 people last year and operating on a budget of about $500,000. This year there will be no show at all, while organizers look for ways to bring the event back in 2010 on a smaller scale. 
 Plans for the 2009 event collapsed last fall. Revenue from local fireworks stands had long paid for the event, but, in the declining economy of last summer, sales fell sharply. 
 ''It kind of took on a life of its own: 'That was good, but wait till you see what we've got next,' '' said Kim Hash, head of the nonprofit group that organizes the event in conjunction with the City of Vancouver, the National Park Service and other organizations. ''Now we're taking a look and saying, 'O.K., what's reasonable? What's good for families?' We definitely are going to be all about families. Sustainability is the key word here.''
 Ms. Hash said that past events had included big-name musical acts like the Oak Ridge Boys but that, in the future, organizers intended to put more emphasis on local culture and history, ''things that take us back to our roots,'' as well as three-legged sack races. And while there will be fireworks in 2010, they will be launched from land, which Ms. Hash said was significantly cheaper.
 What those 65,000 people do on Independence Day is another matter. Washougal, a few miles east of Vancouver, is bringing in more food vendors and bounce houses for kids. Its fireworks show, preserved in the city budget, is expected to last about 22 minutes, up from 20 in 2008, though for the same price.
 ''We've kind of planned on doubling our numbers,'' said Jinger Jacobson, who heads a group that promotes downtown Washougal.
 In Seattle, one of the city's most prominent fireworks shows, held over Elliott Bay, was canceled after its sponsor, Ivar's Seafood Restaurants, said there was too much competition from nearby displays. The chain said it would expand ''into other areas that really need help,'' including working with a local charity that feeds the hungry.
 The City of Lowell, Mass., said this spring that it was canceling its fireworks display on the Merrimack River. The city was facing an $18 million budget gap and going through layoffs of 48 employees. City officials explained at the time that the cost of the show, about $45,000 including the fireworks and overtime for police, fire and public works, equaled about one full-time job. 
 ''If we hadn't cut off the fireworks, we would have had to lay off 49,'' said Bernard Lynch, Lowell's city manager.
 Now, however, after news of the cancellation received widespread attention, the show is back on, although the city is not paying for it. A local bank, joined by a local nonprofit, raised the money, which is being donated to the city.
 ''We may even have a little left over,'' Mr. Lynch said.
 Jim Souza, president of Pyro Spectaculars in Rialto, Calif., which is putting on about 400 shows this Independence Day holiday, including the one in Houston (and the one sponsored by Macy's on the Hudson River in New York, which is expanding this year, not shrinking), said the company had received cancellations from several cities in California, including Montebello, Hesperia, Downey, Banning, Bellflower and others.
 The losses, Mr. Souza said, have been countered somewhat by increases in shows at events like Major League Baseball games. (He noted, however, that Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion in Beverly Hills had canceled its annual show.)
 Mr. Souza, whose family has produced fireworks displays for five generations, said that regardless of the recession and cutbacks in places like Houston, ''everybody still wants something bigger, better, louder.''
 ''The beautiful thing is we are artists and we're able to do that,'' Mr. Souza said. ''It's the same ingredients, but just a little less of them, and a little less money. No one will notice the difference.''

HEADLINE: Hong Kong's Pro-Democracy March Draws Thousands

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Thousands of people joined a pro-democracy march here on Wednesday, although the turnout fell short of a candlelight vigil held nearly four weeks ago to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing. 
 An enormous crowd for the annual June 4 candlelight vigil, the largest since 1990, had raised the hopes of Hong Kong democracy advocates that the same enthusiasm might carry over to their movement. The movement has been struggling after several small successes from 2003 to 2005, including winning support for blocking the government's planned introduction of stringent internal security legislation.
 The immediacy of democracy demands here has faded somewhat as Beijing officials have ruled out direct elections for the chief executive until 2017 and the legislature until 2020.
 The march on Wednesday, on the 12th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule after 156 years of British control, nonetheless drew a large crowd.
 Many marchers said they were dissatisfied with government policies to deal with the economy. Unemployment in Hong Kong rose sharply over the winter and leveled off this spring at 5.3 percent -- a little over half the rate in the United States, but a shock for a territory where the rate was 3.2 percent last summer.
 But the largest single issue seemed to be the limits on democracy in Hong Kong. ''The majority comes here for democracy, but there are other grievances against government policy,'' said Sin Chung Kai, vice chairman of the Democratic Party.
 When Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, the Chinese government initially held out the possibility of full democracy after 2007, including the concept in the Basic Law, Hong Kong's miniconstitution, but stopped short of an unequivocal promise of how and when to achieve universal suffrage.
 A committee of 800 people, most with connections to Beijing, chooses the chief executive here, who must then be appointed by leaders in Beijing before taking office. Half the legislature is chosen by the public and half by a variety of interest groups, including banks, chambers of commerce, trade unions and lawyers.
 The police estimated that 26,000 people had assembled in Victoria Park on Hong Kong Island as the march began. The organizers had said that they expected more to join the march along the way, and they estimated that 76,000 people took part.
 The police had estimated the crowd at the June 4 Tiananmen vigil, at the same location in Victoria Park, at 62,800, while organizers put it at 150,000.
 The vigil did have some carryover effect on Wednesday's march. Jupiter Chan, a 24-year-old graduate student, said that the vigil prompted him to come to the annual democracy march this year for the first time since 2003.
 ''I was touched by the Fourth of June ceremony, and I felt that if I didn't come this year, I would regret it later,'' he said.

Beware of Rallies
 In Uneasy Times
 Excitement in the financial markets has been in ample supply throughout the ages. The second quarter was no exception, with gains of 15 percent or so in Europe and the United States, almost 20 percent in Japan and more than 50 percent in some emerging markets. But investors should hope that the significant rise in most of the world's stock markets in the period is the end of the thrill ride. 
 Equities rallied because the world averted financial catastrophe. The heroic efforts by governments gave investors good reason to stop worrying about a free fall -- and plenty of money to move markets. 
 But the rally has not healed the scars left by the financial crisis. In dollar terms, world stock prices are still 36 percent below their level from a year ago, according to Societe Generale. 
 The credit market's scars are deeper. The 1.06 percentage point spread on the financial research company Markit's index of European investment-grade debt narrowed from 1.74 percentage points in the quarter, but is up from just one-tenth of a percentage point two years ago. 
 Debt buyers are still counting on a severe recession. Yet stocks seem to be looking toward normal economic times. 
 Stocks are trading at 15.6 times their recession-devastated 2009 expected earnings, Societe Generale reported. That is far above the bargain-basement levels that usually prevail when catastrophe looms. Prices are trading at 12.2 times estimated 2010 earnings, which looks like better value. But there must be considerable uncertainty over the pace of any earnings recovery. 
 The market swings have petered out for now. Equity investors' hope should be that the doldrums continue until the economic news catches up with the rally. More excitement -- in either direction -- could be dangerous. With a solid recovery already priced in, another big jump in shares over the next few months would probably be a sign that stimulus spending is inflating another asset-price bubble. 
 If all goes according to the plans of governments around the world, the wall of cheap money should prevent equities from collapsing. But the crisis could still take another turn for the worse, say through a major government failing to raise debt or a sudden lurch in inflation. 
 No amount of free money could absorb such a shock. It would be exciting, yes. But investors could end up devastated.
 Provincial Currency
 California is short on cash, so it plans to issue i.o.u.'s instead. The last time the state, now governed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, did so, most banks accepted them at face value. This time, in light of the budget woes and the economic crisis, banks may demand a discount, hurting anyone paid with these promises. 
 California doesn't have enough money coming in to cover outlays. Since the government refuses to borrow through municipal bonds to cover expenses, and the legislature can't agree on how to balance the budget, it simply can't pay all the bills. So the state's controller says it will issue an estimated $4.3 billion worth of i.o.u.'s this month alone.
 When this last happened in July 1992, banks happily bought the i.o.u.'s at par because the crisis was widely regarded as political theater and the notes paid interest. 
 The likes of Bank of America and Wells Fargo have yet to say how they will handle the new crop of i.o.u.'s. They have less capital than they did during the last crisis. 
 California's current budget woes are far more severe. Although it might annoy their customers, financial institutions might decide to pay less than par to compensate them for tying up limited capital in notes of uncertain maturity. 
 Moreover, such scrip is inferior to cash. Only dollars issued by the federal government are true legal tender, though i.o.u.'s can be issued by any municipality, business or person. And many do, in the form of casino chips, gift cards, virtual currencies in online games and promissory notes. 
 The problem is that, unlike dollars, i.o.u.'s are not necessarily accepted by banks. So these promises of payment tend to hold little value outside their user communities. A casino chip from Las Vegas is useless in Maine. Furthermore, a casino doesn't have the right to impose taxes to back up the promise. Similarly, California currently has a limited ability to raise taxes without a referendum. 
 If banks demand a discount, the unlucky recipients of this currency, including some employees and suppliers, will not find this funny money very humorous.

BORDER SONGS 
 By Jim Lynch 
 291 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95. 
 ''Let your hands see me,'' commands Brandon Vanderkool, the dyslexic Border Patrol agent who is the chief eccentric in ''Border Songs,'' Jim Lynch's promising second novel. ''Lock your heads on top of your fingers.'' Never mind how befuddling this is to the illegal immigrants caught by this preternaturally gifted law enforcement officer: Brandon is a mystery to everyone who knows him. And that includes small-town locals on both sides of the virtually invisible, ''thin as a rumor'' United States-Canada border. 
 What is anyone to make of Brandon? He is enormous, slightly over 6 feet 8 inches, with the look of an overgrown Boy Scout when he's dressed in uniform. He talks strangely and behaves even more so, being more in tune with avian life than with anything human. And he does not remotely fit in with his raucous colleagues, as one of them points out when discussing the difference between working on America's southern and northern borders. ''Down south you just react,'' he tells Brandon. ''Up here you have to think.'' And then, because Brandon grew up on a dairy farm in the region, ''But hey, you're from here, and you're plenty different too.''
 ''Border Songs'' positions Brandon in the midst of a volatile, threatening environment in ways that recall Russell Banks's handling of potentially tragic situations. On the American side, in Washington State, dairy farmers like Brandon's father, Norm, find themselves hanging on by a thread, while Canadian neighbors become rich growing cannabis or profiting from a real estate boom. In Norm's household troubles also loom large. His wife and Brandon's mother, Jeanette, has a rapidly deteriorating memory and worries him almost as much as Brandon does. Norm fears Brandon ''as an intruder sent to drive his wife crazy.'' 
 But the terrain of ''Border Songs'' isn't entirely grim. It also has the kind of ambling, provincial whimsy found in Richard Russo's small-town tales and the hard-bitten optimism that colors Larry McMurtry's. If you think that makes an uneasy mixture, you're right: Mr. Lynch does not seem entirely sure what kind of spirit he means to capture here. Do the smugglers and suspected terrorists, the maladies and afflictions that run through this novel give it a somber gravity? Or do they merely qualify as local color in a crackpot paradise?
 A strikingly eerie cover design by Chip Kidd, which features one of Walton Ford's beautifully rendered images of nature gone awry, is emblematic of this book's mixed message. A dense, phantasmagorical throng of passenger pigeons crowd onto a single falling bough, struggling for position even though a vast landscape stretches out beneath them. A book thus packaged suggests that intimations of menace are everywhere, prompting frissons of dread for local folk caught up in economic and political currents far beyond their control. The most substantial parts of ''Border Songs'' make insinuating use of the perils that haunt the border.
 Mr. Lynch does this so well that his strains of levity and good-heartedness feel misplaced. In a book that too often courts quirkiness, he is safest when hewing close to Brandon's oddly innocent perspective. ''So much about the job burned his stomach,'' he writes of Brandon's recent assumption of border patrol duties, after spending much of his young life on the dairy farm. ''But he'd always wanted to see the world without having to travel. And now, seemingly, amazingly, the world was coming to him.'' The book's taxonomy of aspiring immigrants from far-flung places runs parallel to its bird counts and dairy-farm particulars.
 Brandon's sharply attuned awareness of bird activity and his gift for making nature-based sculptural art reminiscent of Andy Goldsworthy's successfully transcend the book's inconsistencies. Otherwise Mr. Lynch creates a likeable and diverse cast of characters all destined to be undercut by the glib, facile redemption they share at the story's end. 
 Among these characters is Madeline Rousseau, the Canadian gardener (guess what she gardens) with whom Brandon has been in love since childhood. Madeline works for a swaggering drug dealer who threatens to enslave her. Then there's Sophie Winslow, who charms the aging male populace and apparently supports herself by giving massages. Is Sophie something else, like a prostitute or spy? 
 And Madeline's father, Professor Wayne Rousseau, is a dope-flaunting would-be genius who loves taunting Norm from across the borderline. ''C'mon, I can smell the oils from here,'' Wayne shouts, after Norm has had one of Sophie's massages. ''Let me guess: It was perfect, except she missed one little spot, eh?''
 The Canadians in this book can smirk; the Americans have more reason to worry. And ''Border Songs'' hints at threats to national security even as it mocks the paranoia that inflames this part of Washington. During the course of the story some of the most upstanding citizens Brandon knows (including his sixth-grade math teacher) turn out to be trying to profit by smuggling either drugs or people. 
 Impromptu Minutemen appear on the scene, determined to help enforce border restrictions. The president's warnings about ''evildoers'' cause genuine alarm, as does the prospect of terrorists sneaking in to poison America's milk supply. Security apparatuses are ramped up to the point that a cancer patient who had kept his illness a secret is outed because he has been undergoing radiation treatments. 
 Mr. Lynch has worked as a journalist, and his skills in that realm help him summon the complex cross-currents of border life. And he is such a gifted and original novelist that he can fuse bird imagery and seduction with startling ease. (When a woman undresses for the sexually naive Brandon, ''he couldn't have been more startled if an owl had flown out of her shirt.'') 
 But this book's international and local dramas seem like parts of two very different stories, one ominous and one blithe. Neither the towering figure of Brandon nor that of the Peace Arch uniting Blaine, Wash., with Surrey, British Columbia, is tall enough to bridge that particular border.

HEADLINE: Muted Recovery Seen in Asia, With a Long Way to Go

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER; Cat Contiguglia contributed from Paris.

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Gradual stabilization in some economies, a muted recovery in others and a long way to go over all -- that was the picture painted by a cluster of data from Asia on Wednesday after the remarkable slowdown of the last few months.
 In Japan, the closely watched Tankan survey of big manufacturers, conducted quarterly by the Bank of Japan, bounced back in June from a record low in March, coming in at minus 48, the bank announced Wednesday. 
 In China, an official purchasing managers' index rose for a fourth consecutive month in June.
 And South Korea reported that exports in June were 11.3 percent lower than a year earlier, a much smaller decline than the surprisingly poor 28.5 percent fall recorded in May.
 ''I believe the current recovery has been confirmed and can be sustained,'' said Fan Gang, an economist who advises the Chinese central bank, Reuters reported. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, however, said that the government remained cautious about the economic outlook.
 In Japan, the Tankan business survey rebounded, but to a much lower reading than economists had expected. While the reading was better than the minus 58 registered three months ago, it remained a negative reading indicating that pessimists still outnumbered optimists.
 Moreover, the survey also showed that businesses had become even warier about plans to purchase machinery and other items, suggesting that many would make more layoffs and cut costs as they braced for a prolonged downturn in foreign demand for goods.
 Big manufacturers surveyed in the June Tankan said they planned to cut capital spending by 24.3 percent in the year that began April 1. In the March survey, the estimate was 13.2 percent.
 ''The massive fall in capital expenditure plans has dispelled any optimism about the speed of recovery in Japan,'' said Glenn Maguire, an economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.
 At a briefing in Paris, Takatoshi Ito, a University of Tokyo economics professor and a former finance ministry official, said, ''We are nowhere near declaring that we are past the bottom -- that the worst is over.''
 Likewise, the recovery in the purchasing managers index in China was muted, while a similar index in India slipped to 55.3 in June, from 55.7 in May.
 Unlike the United States and Europe, the indexes have been above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction for several months, showing both countries' relative resilience in the face of the global downturn. The June index for the euro zone, also released Wednesday, rose to 42.6, from 40.7 in May. 
 In China, the June reading moved up only slightly, to 53.2 in June, from 53.1 in May. A separate index compiled by the brokerage firm CLSA rose to 51.8, from 51.2 in June, its highest level since July 2008.
 The rises reflect big stimulus expenditures in China, which has more leeway than governments elsewhere to pump money into the economy.
 In November, Beijing announced a two-year spending program worth 4 trillion renminbi ($585 billion) which, combined with rate cuts and soaring lending by banks, have propped up the economy and helped offset the impact of falling exports.
 ''It was the third straight month in which firms' order books have improved, following a period of contraction that lasted eight months,'' CLSA said in a note accompanying its survey Wednesday, adding that the data also showed that foreign orders had risen for the first time in 11 months.
 But CLSA also struck a note of caution, echoing many economists' warnings that recent global data signaled mere stabilization at this stage, rather than all-out recovery.
 Many economists also worry that recent signs of improvement in parts of Asia may be tied to one-time effects like improved credit conditions and the restocking of inventories by companies.
 ''The unfreezing in credit conditions helped provide a boost in recent months,'' said Mr. Maguire of Societe Generale. ''But we will need a recovery in final demand in Western economies for that to be sustained.''

HEADLINE: Defend America, One Laptop at a Time

BYLINE: By JACK GOLDSMITH. 
Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School who was an assistant attorney general from 2003 to 2004, is writing a book on cyberwar.

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
 OUR economy, energy supply, means of transportation and military defenses are dependent on vast, interconnected computer and telecommunications networks. These networks are poorly defended and vulnerable to theft, disruption or destruction by foreign states, criminal organizations, individual hackers and, potentially, terrorists. In the last few months it has been reported that Chinese network operations have found their way into American electricity grids, and computer spies have broken into the Pentagon's Joint Strike Fighter project.
 Acknowledging such threats, President Obama recently declared that digital infrastructure is a ''strategic national asset,'' the protection of which is a national security priority. 
 One of many hurdles to meeting this goal is that the private sector owns and controls most of the networks the government must protect. In addition to banks, energy suppliers and telecommunication companies, military and intelligence agencies use these private networks. This is a dangerous state of affairs, because the firms that build and run computer and communications networks focus on increasing profits, not protecting national security. They invest in levels of safety that satisfy their own purposes, and tend not to worry when they contribute to insecure networks that jeopardize national security. 
 This is a classic market failure that only government leadership can correct. The tricky task is for the government to fix the problem in ways that do not stifle innovation or unduly hamper civil liberties.
 Our digital security problems start with ordinary computer users who do not take security seriously. Their computers can be infiltrated and used as vehicles for attacks on military or corporate systems. They are also often the first place that adversaries go to steal credentials or identify targets as a prelude to larger attacks. 
 President Obama has recognized the need to educate the public about computer security. The government should jump-start this education by mandating minimum computer security standards and by requiring Internet service providers to deny or delay Internet access to computers that fall below these standards, or that are sending spam or suspicious multiple computer probes into the network.
 The government should also use legal liability or tax breaks to motivate manufacturers -- especially makers of operating systems -- to improve vulnerability-filled software that infects the entire network. It should mandate disclosure of data theft and other digital attacks -- to trusted private parties, if not to the public or the government -- so that firms can share information about common weapons and best defenses, and so the public can better assess which firms' computer systems are secure. Increased information production and sharing will also help create insurance markets that can elevate best security practices. 
 But the private sector cannot protect these networks by itself any more than it can protect the land, air or water channels through which foreign adversaries or criminal organizations might attack us. The government must be prepared to monitor and, if necessary, intervene to secure channels of cyberattack as well. 
 The Obama administration recently announced that it would set up a Pentagon cybercommand to defend military networks. Some in the administration want to use Cybercom to help the Department of Homeland Security protect the domestic components of private networks that are under attack or being used for attacks. Along similar lines, a Senate bill introduced in April would give the executive branch broad emergency authority to limit or halt private Internet traffic related to ''critical infrastructure information systems.'' 
 President Obama has tried to soothe civil liberties groups' understandable worries about these proposals. In the speech that outlined the national security implications of our weak digital defenses, the president said the government would not monitor private sector networks or Internet traffic, and pledged to ''preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties we cherish as Americans.'' 
 But the president is less than candid about the tradeoffs the nation faces. The government must be given wider latitude than in the past to monitor private networks and respond to the most serious computer threats. 
 These new powers should be strictly defined and regularly vetted to ensure legal compliance and effectiveness. Last year's amendments to the nation's secret wiretapping regime are a useful model. They expanded the president's secret wiretapping powers, but also required quasi-independent inspectors general in the Department of Justice and the intelligence community to review effectiveness and legal compliance and report to Congress regularly. 
 Many will balk at this proposal because of the excesses and mistakes associated with the secret wiretapping regime in the Bush administration. These legitimate concerns can be addressed with improved systems of review. 
 But they should not prevent us from empowering the government to meet the cyber threats that jeopardize our national defense and economic security. If they do, then privacy could suffer much more when the government reacts to a catastrophic computer attack that it failed to prevent.

HEADLINE: A Win for Bank Customers

 BODY:
In the Bush years, federal regulators not only failed to protect borrowers, they aggressively prevented the states from doing it. New York's attorney general sued, challenging the regulators' interference. This week, the Supreme Court ruled that federal regulators cannot prevent the states from enforcing consumer protection and fair lending laws against national banks. 
 As the current mortgage crisis was building, banks engaged in a wide array of bad practices. They lent to borrowers who could not afford to pay off the loans. They misrepresented loan terms, and they employed deceptive ''teaser'' rates to mislead their customers.
 State attorneys general opened investigations and filed lawsuits. In 2005, then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York asked several national banks about lending practices to determine whether blacks and Hispanics had been charged higher interest rates than whites -- and whether the banks had violated fair lending laws.
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, part of the Treasury Department, sued to block Mr. Spitzer. It claimed that a regulation it issued under the National Bank Act barred the states from enforcing state fair-lending laws. Two lower courts agreed.
 The Supreme Court sided with the states by a vote of 5 to 4. In an opinion by Antonin Scalia -- one of the most conservative justices, who voted with the court's four liberals -- the court ruled that the comptroller had exceeded its authority under the National Bank Act. 
 The bank act, which dates to 1864, prohibits state officials from having ''visitorial'' powers over national banks. ''Visitorial'' powers, Justice Scalia explained, have to do with directly overseeing corporate affairs. Even though the states cannot supervise banks, he said, they do have the right to enforce their own laws. 
 The ruling sends a clear message that state officials have the power to rein in banks that behave badly. It was especially timely, since the banking and mortgage industries are trying to kill a proposal by the Obama administration to create a new agency to regulate consumer finance -- a job now scattered around the government.
 Congress should support that proposal and keep in mind the court ruling by making it clear that any rules the new agency sets are a minimum, and that states may impose more stringent standards.

HEADLINE: An Affair To Remember

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Before everyone finishes piling on Gov. Mark Sanford, let me say that all of us in New York were happy to learn that he has been scheduling his assignations in our state.
 Really, times are tough, and we need all the business we can get. Although it is true that our hotels can be somewhat pricey, there are lots of discounts, and the airfare to New York is way, way cheaper than it is to Argentina.
 Plus, you can see ''South Pacific.'' 
 Sanford, as the whole world now knows, went missing in action when he secretly snuck off to Buenos Aires to see his lover. Ever since he got caught at the airport coming home, he has been confessing and apologizing and talking and talking and talking.
 Some of his allies back in South Carolina have made a commendable, if self-interested, attempt to draw a line between Sanford's private sins and his public role as chief executive. 
 But the governor himself, in an interview with The Associated Press, seemed more interested in what he called ''the sex line,'' which apparently exists to divide his ''soul mate,'' Maria Belen Chapur, from other women whom he's lusted after in his heart -- and possibly with his hands. 
 The whole ''sex line'' business called up memories of my Catholic girlhood, where the nuns could delineate the exact moment at which making out with your boyfriend advanced from venial to mortal sin territory. If Sanford has been reading from the same guidebook, it's possible that he was listing every female he had ever bumped into in the hallway. 
 But we digress. In South Carolina, the debate started with the question of whether the real issue was the governor's romantic life or his failure to leave anybody in charge when he vanished without so much as call-forwarding.
 But Sanford was so clearly in the wrong on that count that his supporters quickly turned to matters of finance and whether he had traveled to Argentina on his own dime. He said he had -- although he backtracked on a promise to prove it. And he agreed to reimburse the state for an earlier economic development trip to South America that he re-routed to Buenos Aires in the name of love.
 Talking about money was familiar ground for South Carolina conservatives, and for a while it looked as if they might settle on a rule that sex is irrelevant unless it leads to a tax increase.
 Then Sanford, who has been in an extremely peculiar mode ever since his return, gave that interview in which he described his trips to New York with Chapur. He said the most recent one occurred earlier this year and was approved by his wife, Jenny (Not the Soul Mate) Sanford under the theory that her husband only wanted to see his lover in order to break up with her.
 Serving as chaperone was a ''spiritual adviser,'' who I hope was given enough downtime to enjoy a nice dinner and take in some sights. Chinatown is fun. 
 The revelations about that New York trip throw a new and interesting light on Sanford's jaunt to Buenos Aires, for which he apparently also sought his wife's blessing. I think I speak for us all when I say that no spouse is allowed more than one officially sanctioned goodbye visit to his mistress. Especially since there was apparently no spiritual counselor invited on the Argentina leg, an oversight that I'm sure was because of the expense.
 Yet another reason why it is better to schedule all these get-togethers in the Big Apple. (Broadway tickets sold at a discount near Times Square!)
 Having affairs in New York is a longtime American political tradition. The late, great R.W. Apple Jr. once told me that when he was a metro reporter for The Times in 1963, he was assigned to stake out the lobby of a hotel in Manhattan where President John F. Kennedy was spending the night. While on the lookout for official visitors, Apple said he saw ''a young woman of a Hollywood nature'' heading for the presidential suite. He quickly called his editor, who informed him ''I was there to report the comings and goings of statesmen, not starlets.''
 If that happened now, of course, the only question would be whether Apple could avoid being run over by a crew from TMZ. 
 Meanwhile, back in South Carolina, Sanford's continued yammering started to weird out his fellow Republicans. State Senator John Courson, who had been in the vanguard of the just-show-me-the-money cadre, called Sanford's crossing-the-line remark ''troubling.''
 ''I would need further explanation of that from him,'' the senator said. Although one would think the last thing Sanford's career needs is further explanation.
 The state party chair delicately suggested that the governor might want to free up his schedule so he could ''devote his efforts full time to repairing the damage in his personal life.'' Perhaps with a reconciliation weekend. We could offer some excellent deals on the honeymoon suite at the Plaza.

HEADLINE: President Pushes Health Plan as an Economic Boon

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: ANNANDALE, Va. 

 BODY:
President Obama returned to the familiar trappings of a political campaign on Wednesday, holding a town-hall-style meeting where he sought to heighten the urgency surrounding the health care debate and dismissed critics who say the issue is too complex to tackle during his first year in office.
 ''Next thing you know, another 10 years has gone by and we still haven't done anything,'' Mr. Obama said, stopping just shy of mocking the Congressional work pace. ''That's not what's going to happen this time. I am going to keep on pressing until we get it done this year.'' 
 With members of Congress away for the week, the president had the stage to himself as he promoted his plan to lower the cost of health care and make coverage more accessible. He cast his proposal as a cost-saver, rather than a giant expenditure, saying the economy was not likely to rally without reversing ''the crushing cost of health care.'' 
 For weeks, the administration and Congressional leaders have struggled to reach a compromise on comprehensive health care legislation. So the White House sought to rally public support by staging a friendly forum here, just outside Washington, which was billed as an hourlong question-and-answer session from a live audience, as well as from people following along online.
 But 20 minutes into the meeting, Mr. Obama suddenly seemed to notice that he had been doing all of the talking and none of the listening. So before fielding his first question, he apologized for slipping into the policy details, saying, ''I'm almost done here, but this is a big, complicated topic, so I hope you forgive me.''
 The president ultimately took seven questions, including four that had been selected by aides who waded through hundreds of videos submitted through the White House Web site. (One, though, came from a Republican congressman from Texas asking about medical malpractice.) Three questions were from members of the audience, all of whom were associated with groups close to the Democratic Party. 
 Asked whether a government-run, single-payer health care system could work, Mr. Obama said no, explaining that most people are insured through employers that are private companies. But he renewed his push for a so-called public option, which could compete with private insurers and, Mr. Obama said, ''keep insurers honest.''
 On a sleepy week in Washington, with the Fourth of July holiday approaching, the reach of the event was unclear. But the Republican National Committee was watching, setting up its own blogging operation that provided a running commentary.
 ''WOW! A question from a guy who works for Health Care for America Now, an organization promoting President Obama's government-run plan. Coincidence?'' wrote Matt Moon, a deputy research director at the committee.
 Later, Mr. Moon added, ''President Obama doesn't have an answer to these questions, he has a speech for each of these questions.''
 The policy and politics, though, was interrupted for a moment when Debby Smith, 53, of Appalachia, Va., rose to address the president. She explained how she was struggling to get treatment for cancer in her right kidney, saying, ''I have a new tumor and have no way to treat it.''
 The president walked over to Ms. Smith, who was fighting back tears, and summoned her into the aisle. He listened to her story, briefly embraced her and offered his thoughts, as photographers circled into capture the moment.
 ''I don't want you to feel like you're alone on this,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Without knowing all the details, I'm not going to give you an answer right now about exactly how we can help.''
 As she spoke to reporters later, Ms. Smith said she was active in Organizing for America, a Democratic group that grew out of the Obama campaign. The White House said it was a coincidence that the president called on her. He did not seem to know her because after he extended a hug, he said awkwardly, ''What was your name again?''

HEADLINE: A Trend With Teeth

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
THE symptoms are unnerving: a taste for fresh meat -- rare, if you please; an aversion to sunlight; and a passion for spectral-looking, fine-boned rakes. All are indications that the sufferer has been bitten by the vampire bug. 
 Sookie Stackhouse, the feisty young heroine of ''True Blood'' on HBO, risks doom whenever she visits with her otherworldly beau. And Oskar, the adolescent misfit of the Swedish art film ''Let the Right One In,'' a favorite in fashion circles, courts extinction each time he ventures out with Eli, the eerily ageless shape-shifter he befriends. 
 Sookie and Oskar are in the throes of vampire lust, a pop-culture contagion being spread via television, films and fiction. What began with the Twilight Saga, the luridly romantic young-adult series by Stephenie Meyer, followed by ''Twilight,'' the movie, has become a pandemic of unholy proportions. 
 Is it a wonder? 
 Rarely have monsters looked so sultry -- or so camera-ready. No small part of this latest vampire mania seems to stem from the ethereal cool and youthful sexiness with which the demons are portrayed. Bela Lugosi they are not. 
 ''The vampire is the new James Dean,'' said Julie Plec, the writer and executive producer of ''The Vampire Diaries,'' a forthcoming series on the CW network based on the popular L. J. Smith novels about high school femmes and hommes fatales. ''There is something so still and sexy about these young erotic predators,'' she said.
 This generation of undead prowls high school hallways and dimly lighted dance clubs as menacing -- and as seductive -- as they have ever been. The June premiere of the second season of ''True Blood,'' in which Sookie, played by Anna Paquin, is reunited with her imperious fanged suitor, drew 3.4 million viewers, making it HBO's most-watched program since the ''Sopranos'' finale in 2007. 
 Charlaine Harris has just published ''Dead and Gone,'' the ninth novel in her Sookie Stackhouse series, variations on Southern Gothic fiction on which ''True Blood'' is based. The publishing world has been intrigued by ''The Strain,'' a first installment in a planned trilogy written by the film director Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan, about bloodthirsty predators run amok in Manhattan. 
 The style world, too, has come under the vampire's spell, in the shape of the gorgeous leather- and lace-clad night crawlers who have crept into the pages of fashion glossies. 
 Vampires, of course, are part of a hoary tradition that harks back to Nosferatu and Bram Stoker's ''Dracula'' at least. Anne Rice updated the genre, introducing the ghoulishly aristocratic vampire Lestat. But the undead are returning with a vengeance, in part because they ''personify real-world anxieties,'' said Michael Dylan Foster, an assistant professor in the department of folklore at Indiana University in Bloomington. 
 ''Especially during these post-9/11 times of increased vigilance, representations like the 'Twilight' series reflect a kind of conspiracy-theory mentality, a fear that there is something secret and dangerous going on in our own community, right under our noses.'' 
 Given all that baggage, what keeps vampires so alluring? 
 One might point to their combination of deathless good looks and decadent sexuality. Their faces, as described in ''Twilight,'' ''were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine.'' 
 Vampirelike glamour figures strike come-hither poses in a flurry of recent fashion publications. Portrayed as androgynous creatures in the June issue of W, they affect killer glares, their menace accentuated by their chalky pallor. In the magazine's current issue, Bruce Willis appears about to be raked by the talons of his new wife, Emma Heming, in a series of photographs by Steven Klein.
 Italian Vogue has also succumbed to the vampire's cold charms: In the June issue, the latest to arrive on American newsstands, models pose as willfully spooky night crawlers like those who once haunted Manhattan clubs; one image captures a female stalker whose supper, the smear of scarlet on her cheek suggests, has just been interrupted. 
 The vampire's attraction is ''all about the titillation of imagining the monsters we could be if we just let ourselves go,'' suggested Rick Owens, a fashion bellwether whose goth-tinged collections sometimes evoke the undead. ''We're all fascinated with corruption, the more glamorous the better'' and, he added, with the idea of ''devouring, consuming, possessing someone we desire.'' 
 That sort of predatory glamour is personified by Catherine Deneuve in ''The Hunger.'' In that morbidly stylish 1983 cult classic, directed by Tony Scott, Ms. Deneuve is Miriam, a bloodsucking seductress in sharp-shouldered suits married to a pallid David Bowie and drawn to Susan Sarandon, a tomboyish specialist in sleep and longevity. (According to Mr. Scott, a sequel is in the writing stage.) 
 The undead of ''The Hunger'' were blessed -- or cursed -- with riches, hauteur and the kind of indestructible good looks aspiring glamazons can only dream of. Their modern counterparts come from every stratum of society and appeal to an array of psycho-sexual preferences.
 Comely upper-crust demons haunt the corridors of Duchesne, the Upper East Side private school of ''Blue Bloods,'' a young-adult vampire series by Melissa de la Cruz. In ''The Strain,'' Mr. del Toro's gory tale, which is framed like a police procedural, the vampires are lowlifes, unremittingly vile. Saya, the eternal schoolgirl of ''Blood: The Last Vampire,'' a supernatural action film that will open July 10, is a reluctant monster in a middy blouse, living a Spartan existence. Eli, the bloodsucking waif of ''Let the Right One In,'' based on a much-talked-about novel of the same name, is gorgeous but apparently destitute and needs only the occasional sanguinary fix to keep from shriveling. (Vampires, too, can be done in by their addictions.) 
 The most up-to-date -- and least menacing -- of this nocturnal breed are, well, deathless romantics who pine like their mortal companions for a love that lasts through eternity. Stefan, the handsome archfiend of ''Vampire Diaries,'' which will be broadcast on the CW network in September, keeps his lust for the human Elena resolutely in check.
 In ''New Moon,'' the ''Twilight'' sequel that will open in November, the lead vampire Edward is a noble swain, performing feats of valor usually reserved for Superman. Seductive as he is, he, too, is a model of restraint. More than once in the original film Edward stops short of draining Bella, his mortal girlfriend. ''I don't want to be a monster,'' he tells her urgently (though it seems she wouldn't mind). 
 ''Edward has rejected all humanity, but he is struggling to be human,'' Ms. Plec said, adding: ''There is always the question, 'Does this person have it in him to be good, to make the right decision?' It's a theme that works like gangbusters in films and television.'' 
 Impulse-control is an especially resonant theme in the current era of conflicts and cutbacks. ''Periods of war, economic downturns and cultural turmoil all give rise to the production of vampire and fantasy fiction,'' said Thomas Garza, chair of the department of Slavic and Eurasian studies at the University of Texas at Austin, and a specialist in vampire lore. ''With a recession and war, the conflict has indeed seemed to turn inward, aswe question our fiscal, political and moral status. 'Have we been too excessive? Do we need to be more restrained?' We seem once again to be questioning these very fundamental values.'' 
 And, at the same time, renewing a flirtation with the dark side. Emily Rose, a performance poet in Chicago, is a devotee, she said, of ''the wantonness, the gorgeousness that is the vampire.'' She went on to catalog its exquisite charms: ''eternal youth, invulnerability and, of course, the night life -- staying up way past your bedtime.''
 Surely there are worse things. ''There are monsters so much bigger and more realistic in our day-to-day lives,'' Ms. Rose said. ''Having somebody clamp onto your neck and drain you -- that doesn't seem so scary anymore.''
 ''It wouldn't be on my top 10 list of ways not to die,'' she added, ''especially if that vampire is at all attractive.''

HEADLINE: Compromise Is Sought To Standoff In Honduras

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY and GINGER THOMPSON; Marc Lacey reported from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and Ginger Thompson from Washington. Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras 

 BODY:
As the public standoff between Honduras and the rest of the world hardened, quiet negotiations got under way on Wednesday to lay the groundwork for a possible return of the nation's ousted president, Manuel Zelaya.
 After a marathon session that stretched close to dawn, the Organization of American States ''vehemently'' condemned the removal of Mr. Zelaya over the weekend and issued an ultimatum to Honduras's new government: Unless Mr. Zelaya is returned to power within 72 hours, the nation will be suspended from the group. 
 Diplomats said they had rarely seen the hemisphere's leaders unite so solidly behind a common cause. 
 The new Honduran government was equally resolute, warning that there was no chance Mr. Zelaya would be restored to office and that the nation would defend itself by force. 
 But on Wednesday, as the two sides seemed to dig in their heels, O.A.S. officials said they had begun informal discussions with ''political actors'' close to the new government to find common ground for a peaceful resolution. Beyond that, the organization's secretary general, Jose Miguel Insulza, was headed to the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, on Thursday for further talks, an official with the organization said. 
 The proposals that have been floated include an offer of amnesty for those responsible for Mr. Zelaya's ouster in return for his reinstatement and a guarantee that he will not seek another term. Fears that Mr. Zelaya had been plotting to undermine the Constitution and extend his tenure were among the driving forces behind his expulsion from the country at the hands of the military over the weekend. 
 Some members of the Honduran Congress, which voted in a new president on Sunday, said Wednesday that they were also discussing ways of reaching a compromise among themselves that would reinstate Mr. Zelaya, a central demand of the United NationsGeneral Assembly. The lawmakers cautioned, however, that such a deal could be a hard sell, given the widespread opposition to Mr. Zelaya in Congress. 
 Despite their extensive ties to the Honduran military and government, American officials said they were giving Honduras a cold shoulder to increase pressure on the new government to cede power. American officials said that they had not had any official or unofficial contact with the interim government, and that they supported the O.A.S. in taking the lead in negotiating a resolution to the crisis. 
 The Pentagon announced that it had stopped all joint operations with its counterparts in Honduras. Obama administration officials held out the possibility of cutting off millions of dollars in aid to Honduras if the O.A.S. diplomatic efforts failed. Senior administration officials said their goal was to give Honduras a taste of isolation, and to show that they stood solidly with the rest of the region.
 The sharply divided political climate in Honduras may make any quick resolution difficult. But a senior Obama administration official predicted that Honduras's interim government would not be able to withstand the mounting international pressure very long.
 ''In the 21st century, these kinds of coups don't last long,'' the official said. ''It's very hard for a country like Honduras to maintain this kind of position in the face of overwhelming rejection by the world, and especially by the region and its major trading partners.''
 Even so, a resolution appeared to be a long way off in Honduras on Wednesday. Demonstrations for and against the new government continued in Tegucigalpa and other cities across the country. Then, in a move to crack down on the opposition, the nation's Congress approved a decree on Wednesday that applies during the overnight curfew and allows security forces to arrest people at home and hold them for more than 24 hours. 
 ''It's for the tranquillity of the country,'' said the new president, Roberto Micheletti.
 The government has accused pro-Zelaya demonstrators of vandalism and violence, noting that a grenade, which did not explode, was hurled at the Supreme Court on Tuesday. Those who oppose the government, meanwhile, accuse the security forces of stifling dissent through brutality.
 Mr. Micheletti suggested Wednesday that he was open to negotiations, but gave up no ground. 
 ''We are open to dialogue,'' he told a group of international journalists, adding in the next breath that the courts would insist on Mr. Zelaya's arrest if he returned. Mr. Zelaya had initially vowed to go back to Honduras on Thursday, but he agreed to postpone his return at least 72 hours after the O.A.S. set a deadline for his reinstatement. 
 Pressure has already been put on the new Honduran government to reach a compromise. The World Bank has said it will suspend $270 million it approved for Honduras, one of the poorer countries in the region, and hold off pursuing any new projects there until the crisis is resolved. The Inter-American Development Bank has also paused its programs in Honduras.
 But Mr. Micheletti said he did not feel isolated by the scorn that had been heaped upon him by so many governments in the world. ''I'm not going to permit that this is called a coup d'etat,'' he said.
 Most governments disagree. Calling Mr. Zelaya's overthrow an ''old-fashioned coup,'' Mr. Insulza of the O.A.S. said: ''We need to show clearly that military coups will not be accepted. We thought we were in an era when military coups were no longer possible in this hemisphere.''
 In a sharply worded resolution, the organization called the ouster an ''unconstitutional alteration of the democratic order.''
 The expressions of unity outside the meeting rooms, however, masked disagreements playing out behind closed doors. There was discord over Mr. Zelaya's initial plan to go back to Honduras on Thursday, which raised concerns that it would only aggravate the situation.
 There was also discussion over how to proceed with suspension if diplomatic efforts failed, with some countries wanting an immediate suspension and others wanting to convene another meeting first. And there were calls by Venezuela and Nicaragua for the United States to impose tough economic sanctions.
 The United States, which provides millions of dollars in aid to Honduras, is the only country in the region that has not withdrawn its ambassador from Honduras. France, Spain and Italy have recalled their ambassadors. 
 ''There is a lot of concern about hurting the people of Honduras any more than they have already been hurt,'' said a senior administration official, referring to American reluctance to impose sanctions. ''There's enough trouble and poverty in Honduras already.''

HEADLINE: Government Charges Beazer Homes With Mortgage Fraud

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors filed criminal conspiracy charges on Wednesday against one of the nation's 10 largest home builders and reached a deal that allows it to clear its record after it pays millions of dollars to compensate borrowers who were defrauded by its former mortgage arm. 
 The charges against Beazer Homes USA, detailed in a criminal information filed in federal court in Charlotte, N.C., involve the company's loan origination practices, which came under federal scrutiny in March 2007 after a series of articles in The Charlotte Observer.
 Beazer Homes, based in Atlanta, said on Wednesday that it had closed its mortgage unit in February 2008 and revised its financial reports in May 2008 to correct improper accounting practices.
 Under a deferred-prosecution agreement negotiated with federal prosecutors, the company must accept responsibility for its offenses and pay up to $50 million in restitution to affected home buyers by its 2014 fiscal year. 
 If Beazer complies with the agreement, the criminal charges will be dropped. 
 ''We deeply regret these matters and have used what we learned to strengthen our control and compliance culture,'' Ian J. McCarthy, Beazer's president and chief executive, said in a statement.
 Prosecutors contend that the Beazer Mortgage Corporation, the company's former lending subsidiary, used fraudulent practices to originate loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
 The court filings accuse the company of charging illegal fees, making improper ''gifts'' to purchasers to cover down payments and then secretly increasing the home price to offset the expense, conspiring to hide its high default rates from the F.H.A. and deliberately making loans to unqualified buyers. 
 The omnibus agreement also resolved a civil investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. North Carolina bank regulators closed a state investigation after the company agreed to a $2.5 million settlement in May.
 The acting United States attorney, Edward R. Ryan, said the government agreed to the settlement in part because Beazer had cooperated with the investigation and taken remedial measures, including dismissing the employees it held responsible for the misconduct.
 But the deal also recognizes the reality of today's economy. A statement announcing the agreement noted that harsher penalties ''would jeopardize the solvency of Beazer.'' As conditions in the housing market have worsened over the last year, Beazer's share price has fallen nearly 70 percent.
 In conjunction with the criminal case, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint accusing Michael T. Rand, Beazer's former chief accounting officer, of using improper accounting procedures from 2000 to 2005 to make sure that the company's earnings met Wall Street expectations. He was also accused of improperly inflating company revenue in the 2006 fiscal year and the first half of the 2007 fiscal year.
 A lawyer for Mr. Rand, Tony G. Powers of Rogers & Hardin in Atlanta, did not respond to a request for comment on the complaint.

HEADLINE: Insurgents Hail Pullout Of Troops From Cities

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; Mohammed Hussein, Anwar J. Ali and Riyadh Mohammed contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
A day after Iraqis celebrated the formal withdrawal of American combat troops from towns and cities, leaders of some of the most high-profile insurgent and opposition groups had their say on Wednesday.
 Statements were released by a former senior ally of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni clerical association that has sanctioned armed resistance and Moktada al-Sadr, the anti-American Shiite cleric, all of which hailed the withdrawal as a victory for the resistance and compared it to the beginning of the revolt against the British occupation in 1920. 
 Iraqi opposition and insurgent leaders consider themselves to have as much legitimacy as, or more than, Iraqi government officials, and formal statements on such a symbolic occasion are expected. 
 The statements all commanded Iraqis to continue fighting the American military until it had left the country completely; nearly 130,000 troops remain. The statements also insisted, in unusually clear language, that Iraqis not turn their violence on one another. 
 This appears to be a noteworthy change for the former Hussein ally, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, who was deputy chairman of Mr. Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council and who American officials say has been financing and organizing Baathist insurgents. 
 We ''have decided in this blessed day to direct all combat effort towards the invaders,'' Mr. Douri's statement said, ''and forbid absolutely the killing of Iraqis or fighting them in all the formations and organs of the agent's authority -- in the so-called army, police, Awakening and the administration agencies -- except for what is required in self-defense, if some spies in these agencies try to stop the resistance or harm them.''
 As recently as April, Mr. Douri had called upon people to attack the Iraqi government, which he considers a puppet of the United States.
 If Mr. Douri holds to this new stance it could bolster the possibility, raised by some Iraqi and American officials, that the withdrawal of American troops removes a justification that many insurgent groups used to carry out attacks, even if those attacks disproportionately killed and injured Iraqis.
 The Association of Muslim Scholars, a Sunni clerical group that has condoned attacks against the American military, issued a statement in which it condemned sectarianism and urged Iraqis to avoid harming other Iraqis. ''Resistance is for all Iraqis, across the spectrum, from the north to the south,'' the statement read.
 Mr. Sadr, who has increasingly distanced his movement from the use of violence, was less celebratory in his statement, expressing concerns that the withdrawal was a mere ''media announcement.'' It would be ''a bright page in the honest Iraqi resistance's history'' if it were real, he said, but he highlighted the continuing presence of American military advisers, who are allowed to stay in the cities under the security agreement between Iraq and the United States, as evidence that June 30 may not be the symbolic victory the government has suggested it is. 
 Mr. Sadr also said that a military withdrawal was not sufficient, mentioning the continued presence of American intelligence agencies and security contractors in particular. ''We want a withdrawal, and not interference, on all fronts -- political, social, economic, judicial, and ministerial,'' he said in his statement. ''Not only the military front.''
 Also on Wednesday, the Iraqi cabinet approved one bid from a public auction on Tuesday for the rights to develop Iraqi oil fields, a government spokesman announced. A consortium of BP and China National Petroleum Company has agreed to increase output of the enormous Rumaila oil field to 2.85 million barrels a day, and will receive a $2 premium for every barrel the field produces over a baseline established by the Iraqi government. 
 Rumaila, in Iraq's south, is the largest of the oil fields that were part of the auction, and its development could be a significant contribution to Iraq's economy.
 The cabinet officially rejected six other bids from the auction that asked for larger amounts than the government was willing to pay, the spokesman said.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 6, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A reporting credit on Wednesday with an article about the withdrawal of American combat troops from Iraqi cities misstated the surname of a New York Times reporter who contributed. He is Campbell Robertson, not Robinson.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: The Shifting American Footprint in Iraq: The withdrawal of American troops from Iraqi cities, which was celebrated Tuesday, has been an evolving process, growing out of the success of the American force buildup and the Sunni Awakening movement in 2007. The process continues as American forces take on an advisory role.
JANUARY 2007: Before the Surge: After months of escalating sectarian violence, President Bush announces a plan to add more than 20,000 soldiers and Marines to the United States military presence in Iraq. Insurgents are using the rural belt around Baghdad to stage attacks, but there are not enough American forces to fight them outside the city.
SEPTEMBER 2007
At the Height Of the Surge: The last of the surge forces arrive in June. In August and September, American forces clear much of the insurgent activity out of the rural belt around Baghdad. With violence coming under control, American troops establish numerous outposts throughout the city, from which they make daily patrols.
OCTOBER 2008: A Year Later: The last of the surge units leave Iraq in the summer of 2008. American forces have already started pulling out of cities around the country, particularly in Anbar Province, where troop levels are drastically reduced. There is still active fighting in Mosul, Baghdad and Diyala Province.
 JUNE 2009: Withdrawing and Changing Roles: Battalions that were living in outposts among the population move to bases at the outskirts of neighborhoods. In Baghdad and other cities, American troops are switching to an advisory role, supporting Iraqi units as requested, following the process started in Anbar Province.(Source: Wesley Morgan, Institute for the Study of War)

HEADLINE: Fashions of a Postcolonial Provocateur

BYLINE: By KAREN ROSENBERG

 BODY:
Yinka Shonibare loves to make fun of Victorian repression, but the art in his first major survey is just as stuffy in its own way.
 ''Yinka Shonibare MBE'' is an important show for Mr. Shonibare, the British-Nigerian artist, and for the Brooklyn Museum, which is counting on accessible contemporary art to give its bottom line a boost. It has some of the multicultural flair and libidinal energy of ''$;Murakami,'' last year's big midcareer survey at the museum. It even has a trademark of sorts: the honorific M.B.E., which stands for Member of the Order of the British Empire, has accompanied Mr. Shonibare's name since the title was awarded to him in 2005.
 But with few exceptions, Mr. Shonibare serves his postcolonialism straight up. Once you grasp the essential conceit of his art -- that his costumes for the 19th- or 18th-century ruling class are made from 20th-century fabrics associated with Africa -- the rest is window dressing. 
 That's not to say that his art stints on the visual. The Dutch wax-print fabrics he uses are riotously colorful and feverishly patterned. And while his mannequins are headless, their gestures -- sometimes copied from famous paintings, sometimes improvised -- invariably command attention. 
 It doesn't hurt that he is attracted to scenes of frivolity and excess, some of which resonate in the current economic climate. The figures in his installation ''Scramble for Africa'' are meant to be heads of state divvying up a continent, but they might as well be corporate titans at an investment bank board meeting.
 Organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney, where it originated, ''Yinka Shonibare MBE'' will travel in the fall to the National Museum of African Art at the Smithsonian. The installation at the Brooklyn Museum, spread across the first- and fourth-floor galleries as well as the period rooms, was coordinated by Judy Kim, the curator of exhibitions.
 Mr. Shonibare was born in Britain to Nigerian parents, who later moved the family to Lagos, on the Nigerian coast. He returned to England during summers and later for art school, emerging around the same time as the Y.B.A. (Young British Artists) group that included Damien Hirst. As is often noted, his background has parallels to the history of the Dutch wax-print fabrics, so named because they were made in Europe, and marketed to and identified with Africans.
 The fabrics are gorgeous, but the way he deploys them has become routine. This quickly becomes apparent in an opening salvo of sculptural tableaus, inspired by rococo art and the Age of Enlightenment.
 ''The Swing (After Fragonard),'' from 2001, based on the famous painting of a woman gaily tossing her shoe into the air as her lover looks on, was a breakout piece for Mr. Shonibare and looks spectacular in a lighted alcove. But it is followed by two mannequins from 2008, depicting the Enlightenment figures Adam Smith and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, that confirm how little Mr. Shonibare's approach to sculpture has changed.
 When he isn't reacting to a specific artwork, as in the Fragonard, he can be embarrassingly literal. In the sprawling installation ''Gallantry and Criminal Conversation'' (2002), which fills a giant fourth-floor gallery, costumed mannequins in groups of two and three are arranged in sexual positions. They're meant to be dissipated Grand Tourists, as evidenced by the steamer trunks that surround them and the ostentatious carriage suspended from the ceiling.
 For all the action the installation depicts, it is oddly inert, especially compared with nearby photographs of Mr. Shonibare playing the Victorian dandy among costumed admirers. (In a related and just as compelling series, he portrays Oscar Wilde's protagonist Dorian Gray.)
 The show is rescued by smart integration with the permanent collection. The series of installations ''Mother and Father Worked Hard So I Can Play'' leads viewers on a kind of scavenger hunt through the museum's American period rooms, where Mr. Shonibare's costumed figures of children at play inhabit historical settings. (He has designed a similar tableau to be installed in the dining room of the 1885 Ballantine House, a wing of the Newark Museum.)
 Atypical for Mr. Shonibare, the placement of figures is understated. One child sits under the dining table with a doll; another fiddles with marbles on the periphery of a fussy parlor. Everything works: the collision of the British class structure with American social mobility; the upstaging of the Dutch wax fabrics by chintzes, brocades and jacquards; and the identification with the small children lost in these grand interiors.
 As decorative as it is, Mr. Shonibare's art is most engaging when it has a hint of a narrative, even a secondhand one. Sculpture is his primary medium, but from time to time he branches out into photography and video. The exhibition includes two cinematic works made this decade. Both are pretentious but satisfying, in that they show the Dutch wax prints in motion and indulge Mr. Shonibare's appetite for exaggerated gesture.
 His 2004 video ''Un Ballo in Maschera (A Masked Ball)'' takes its title, and story line, from the Verdi opera about the assassination of King Carl Gustav III of Sweden. But it's really an unlikely marriage of a BBC costume drama and a French New Wave film, with Mr. Shonibare's luscious fabrics as the star. Skirts rustle and capes swish as the characters perform elaborately choreographed dances and exchange meaningful gazes from behind Venetian masks.
 The other video, ''Odile and Odette'' (2005), is as pared down as ''Un Ballo in Maschera'' is puffed up. Two ballerinas, one black and one white, divvy up the dual role from Tchaikovsky's ''Swan Lake'' (traditionally performed by one person). Each dancer appears, through a mirror, as the other's reflection. The concept takes precedence over the costumes (relatively simple tutus), suggesting that Mr. Shonibare might not need to rely so heavily on the Dutch wax-print fabrics.
 Mr. Shonibare's genuine fascination with the Victorian period, and the affectations of its elite, comes through in this show, particularly when he inserts himself into the picture, as he does in some of his photographs, or tucks his sculptures into historical settings, as in the period rooms. At the least, he's an extremely clever custodian of the era's fashion, decor and mores.
 But this artist, now on a world stage, needs to challenge himself and his audience. Curators love his art, because the wall labels practically write themselves. Museum directors love it because it's colorful and theatrical. Viewers may need more persuasion.
 ''Yinka Shonibare MBE'' runs through Sept. 20 at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park; (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

HEADLINE: Markets Fall Sharply on Report of 467,000 Job Losses in June

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
Fears that rising unemployment will prolong what is already a deep, painful recession sent stocks tumbling on Thursday and pushed the broad market into the red once again for the year.
 Stocks fell sharply from the outset after a weak June jobless report, but the decline accelerated in the final hour as traders worried that a rush of quarterly results due next week also might prove disappointing. There was growing concern on Wall Street that investors have been overly optimistic in bidding up stocks in recent months. 
 ''These green shoots are turning brown,'' said Tom Di Gamola of Guggenheim Partners. ''That's what the equity markets are keying off of.'' 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 26.91 points, or nearly 3 percent, to 896.42. The decline wiped out the final vestiges of the broad market's stunning rally since March, leaving the S.& P. 500 down 0.76 percent for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 223.32 points, to 8280.74, while the Nasdaq composite index declined 49.20 points, to 1796.52. United States markets are closed on Friday in observance of the Fourth of July.
 The June jobs report underscored the serious challenges confronting the economy. The Labor Department reported that the economy lost 467,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate rose to 9.5 percent, the highest it has been since August 1983.
 After a report in May that showed the pace of deterioration was moderating, some economists expressed hopes that a recovery might finally be emerging. But the highly anticipated June report put most of those thoughts aside. Manufacturing bore the brunt of the decline, losing 136,000 jobs.
 ''It looks shockingly bad compared to last month,'' but it is better than April when the economy shed 504,000 jobs, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at Jefferies & Companies. ''The trend is much better than when we started the year'' losing 700,000 and 800,000 jobs a month. 
 Besides competing for fewer jobs, Americans are also working fewer hours a week on average and thus have less expendable income to funnel into the economy.
 Like New York exchanges, those in Europe declined on unemployment numbers from the Continent. According to Eurostat, unemployment in the euro zone in May also rose to 9.5 percent -- the highest level in a decade -- from 9.3 percent in April. The European Central Bank on Thursday also kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 1 percent, and said that it expected to maintain its course for the immediate future. The news underwhelmed some investors who hoped that the bank would cut rates to spur lending. 
 The FTSE 100 index in London settled down 2.45 percent, or 106.44 points, while the DAX in Frankfurt fell 3.81 percent or 186.95 points. The CAC 40 in Paris was 3.1 percent lower, or 100.59 points.
 In a second economic report on Thursday, American factory orders rose 1.2 percent in May, the largest jump since June 2008. Economists had expected a 0.8 percent increase.
 But the increase was largely attributed to new Boeing aircraft orders, according to Joseph Brusuelas, a director at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''I would not put too much stock in a single factory orders number and extrapolate it to the entire economy,'' Mr. Brusuelas said. ''We're not in recovery yet.''
 After the jobs report, all eyes are now shifting back to the equity markets to see whether the business environment is improving. Companies begin to report second-quarter earnings next week, led by the metals giant Alcoa, which is scheduled to report on Wednesday. Alcoa was one of the biggest blue-chip losers on Thursday, falling 4.73 percent to $9.86 a share. 
 Thursday capped a generally downbeat two-week period in which the market struggled to break through its mid-June highs, and nagging doubts about a brittle macroeconomy have left investors feeling somewhat bearish. 
 The New York Stock Exchange pushed back its closing time by 15 minutes after technical problems disrupted trading earlier in the day. ''There is a very significant barrier at 870 on the S.& P.,'' said Bruce Bittles of Robert W. Baird & Company. 
 ''If we broke that level our confidence on the economy would have to be downgraded,'' Mr. Bittles added.
 Crude oil futures fell by $2.58 to settle at $66.73 a barrel in New York trading after the payroll data depressed the overall economic outlook for the United States, the world's largest oil consumer. High levels of unemployment are expected to restrain gasoline demand for the summer driving season.
 The Treasury bond market steadied as investors pulled out of equities for safer alternatives. The 10-year Treasury note rose 11/32, to 98 27/32 and the yield slipped to 3.49 percent, from 3.54 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: More Jobs Lost

 BODY:
The jobs report for June should put a chill on hopes for an economic recovery anytime soon. And it makes a compelling case for more government stimulus, as unpopular as that idea may be in Washington. Americans all over the country are struggling. 
 Last month, another 467,000 positions disappeared. In all, the economy is now coming up short by some 8.8 million jobs: since the recession began at the end of 2007, 6.5 million jobs have been lost and 2.3 million new jobs that were needed to keep up with population growth never materialized. 
 Most of the $787 billion in stimulus spending approved in February -- for education, health care, building projects and other fiscal relief -- has yet to be spent. Over time, it is expected to preserve or create three million to four million jobs. But with job losses already far exceeding four million, that is unlikely to be enough to create a true recovery. President Obama and his advisers must start preparing now for what is sure to be a tough legislative fight over more stimulus. 
 In the nearer term, the unemployed will need more help. The jobless rate ticked up to 9.5 percent in June, from 9.4 percent in May, and it appears headed inexorably higher. For adult men, the rate is already 10 percent. The numbers are even worse for teenagers (24 percent), African-Americans (14.7 percent) and Hispanics (12.2 percent). The most alarming subset, however, is made up of the long-term unemployed. Of the 14.7 million jobless workers, 4.4 million -- nearly 30 percent -- have been out of work for 27 weeks or more. 
 Unemployment compensation was wisely extended in the stimulus bill, to a maximum of 53 weeks. But benefits will begin to expire in September for roughly 650,000 jobless workers. Congress should not wait until the last minute to extend those benefits. The traditional argument -- that extended benefits encourage idleness -- is especially weak in today's severe recession. Uncertainty and lack of income are a much greater threat to the economy than the ''threat'' that someone might freeload off of unemployment benefits. 
 The Obama administration must also address a deeper anxiety. How will the economy be rebuilt so that growth is not dependent on excessive borrowing, by the government or by households? Emergency stimulus and safety-net benefits are a must. But so is a vision -- and an agenda -- for creating good jobs with good pay.

The Seven & I Holdings Company, which operates the 7-Eleven convenience stores, said profit fell 28 percent on slumping supermarket and department store sales amid the recession. Net income fell to 23.7 billion yen ($247 million) in the three months that ended in May from 33.1 billion yen, the company said. Sales fell 11 percent to 1.24 trillion yen, from 1.39 trillion yen. Falling gasoline prices in North America, where 7-Eleven outlets sell fuel, and a stronger yen cut Seven & I's sales in the quarter by 110 billion yen, the company said. The average price of gas in the United States dropped 42 percent to $2.1 a gallon in the three months that ended May 31 from $3.49 a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Joblessness Hits 9.5%, Deflating Recovery Hopes

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN; Jack Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The American economy lost 467,000 more jobs in June, and the unemployment rate edged up to 9.5 percent in a sobering indication that the longest recession since the 1930s had yet to release its hold.
 ''The numbers are indicative of a continued, very severe recession,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. ''There's nothing in here to show that the economy and the market are pulling out of the grip of recession.''
 The Labor Department's monthly snapshot of employment, released Thursday, challenged visions of a recovery already taking root. The numbers intensify pressure on the Obama administration to show returns on programs aimed at improving national fortunes -- not least its $787 billion stimulus plan.
 Some economists are now calling for another dose of government spending to stimulate the economy, though the White House maintains that enough money is in the pipeline already. 
 ''Not all the recovery money has been put to work yet,'' said the labor secretary, Hilda L. Solis. ''We're making progress.''
 But Ms. Solis acknowledged that joblessness was already much worse than the administration projected in January when it created its stimulus spending bill, suggesting then that joblessness would peak at about 8 percent.
 Asked why the unemployment rate is already much higher, Ms. Solis noted that much of the stimulus money was moving slowly, with construction projects in particular requiring time-consuming government permits.
 ''Over all, it's been a challenge,'' Ms. Solis said. ''We still have a ways to go.''
 That explanation echoed criticism that some initially leveled at the spending package when it was debated in Congress: many of the projects would take too long to get going, creating too few jobs in the near term. Still, Ms. Solis portrayed the program as a success.
 ''We would have done much worse had we not put the recovery plan in place,'' she said.
 In recent weeks, positive signs have emerged that automakers are beginning to see stronger sales, factories are gaining more orders, and housing prices have stopped falling in some markets. But the jobs report injected the sense that paychecks are disappearing so swiftly that consumer spending is likely to be tight, limiting economic activity. The gloomy news caused the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to tumble more than 2 percent.
 Indeed, the report reinforced a consensus that high levels of unemployment are likely to afflict American life for many months and perhaps much longer. That will dump more jobless people into a weak job market, making it harder for those already unemployed to find work and pressing down wages and hours. 
 After a May report that showed the pace of deterioration was moderating, some economists expressed hopes that an economic recovery might finally be emerging. But the June report tempered such thoughts.
 For another month, manufacturing jobs disappeared, dipping by 136,000, while construction jobs shrank by 79,000 and retail by 21,000. Health care remained a rare bright spot, adding 21,000.
 The losses for June lifted net jobs shed since the beginning of the recession to 6.5 million -- equal to the net job gain over the previous nine years.
 ''This is the only recession since the Great Depression to wipe out all jobs growth from the previous business cycle,'' Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said in a research note. She called this fact ''a devastating benchmark for the workers of this country and a testament to both the enormity of the current crisis and to the extreme weakness of jobs growth from 2000 to 2007.''
 The June figures did show continued slowing in the pace of job losses. From November to March -- after the collapse of some prominent financial institutions -- the labor market lost an average of 670,000 jobs each month. From April to June, the decline slowed to 436,000 a month.
 The Obama administration seized on those numbers to argue that its stimulus spending plan was gradually working.
 ''We're seeing a kind of leveling off here,'' said Ms. Solis, the labor secretary.
 Some economists contend that a recovery is indeed in its early stages, cautioning that the job market tends to lag behind progress in other areas. 
 Michael T. Darda, chief economist at the research and trading firm MKM Partners, pointed to a recent rally in the corporate bond market as a sign that normalcy was returning to the financial system. He asserted that this presaged the resumption of economic growth in the second half of this year and vigorous activity next year.
 ''The labor market is going to lag the recovery process to a certain degree,'' he said.
 But other experts argued that employment was a more crucial source of spending power than in downturns past, given how many alternate sources of cash had been lost. 
 Consumer spending amounts to 70 percent of overall American economic activity. In recent times, Americans found myriad ways to fuel spending even as incomes for many households stagnated, borrowing against the once-rising value of homes and tapping credit cards. 
 Now, the paycheck has returned as the primary source of spending. Yet pay is eroding even for those who have jobs.
 The average workweek for rank-and-file employees in the private sector -- roughly 80 percent of the work force -- slipped by a fraction to 33 hours, the lowest level since the government began tracking such data in 1964.
 The so-called underemployment rate -- which captures not only the jobless but also those working part time because their hours have been cut or they cannot find a full-time job -- increased to 16.5 percent.
 Some economists contend that while unemployment remains high, millions of Americans will continue to watch their spending.
 ''It looks really bad,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ''There are no green shoots here. People can't spend when they don't have the money.''
 For another month, the average length of official unemployment increased, this time to 24.5 weeks -- the highest level since the government began tracking such data in 1948. The unemployment rate, 9.5 percent, is the highest since 1983. 
 Layoffs have slowed in recent months, but hiring has yet to pick up, meaning that jobless people face a more frustrating search.
 In the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, Jeffrey Jones, 40, has found no work since losing his job as a cook at a senior center in October. He worries about paying rent and caring for his four children. 
 ''I know I'm not supposed to be letting it stress me out,'' he said. ''The way I'm going now, I won't be able to make it too much longer. I can't go this long without doing something for my family.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Gets Tough on Funds Trying to Buy Failed Banks

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal bank regulators toughened policies on Thursday that have allowed private equity firms to buy up failing banks, saying they were worried if such investors would have enough capital and the willingness to run the banks in a ''prudent manner.'' 
 The surprisingly tough rules came as a blow to high-rolling private equity firms, which control vast amounts of capital and have been pushing for greater ability to buy up failed banks at bargain prices from the government.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted tentative rules that would require banks owned by private equity firms to have three times as much capital as ordinary banks. 
 Private equity firms also would not be able to sell their stakes for three years. Firms would also have to make commitments about providing subsequent financing if the banks need it, and they would have to disclose much more than many do right now about their own ownership structures.
 The F.D.I.C. has seized 45 banks and thrift institutions so far this year and 70 in the last year, more than in any year since the Great Depression. The wave of bank failures is seen as far from over. 
 The F.D.I.C., which insures customer deposits, is responsible for seizing insolvent banks and usually tries to find new buyers for them in order to minimize the potential losses to taxpayers.
 But officials said they had numerous concerns about whether private equity firms would provide additional capital if a bank's problems deepened. They also expressed discomfort with the sometimes opaque ownership structures that some investment firms have been proposing.
 ''Obviously, we want to maximize investor interest in failed bank resolutions,'' said Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C. However, she said, she did not want to see the same institutions fall into a failed state again. 
 Ms. Bair said she was also concerned that the ownership proposed by some private investment firms was murky. ''We have seen bids where it has been difficult to determine actual ownership. We have seen bidders who have wanted permission to immediately flip ownership interests.'' 
 In the rules outlined on Thursday, private equity firms that own more than one bank would have to provide ''cross-guarantees,'' under which they would use capital from a healthier bank to shore up a weaker one. The investment firms would also have to accept limits on their ability to extend credit to other affiliates, and they would have to make sure that their banks remain well capitalized.
 Industry executives said the new rules would be unworkable and prevent their putting new money into deals that might alleviate the banking crisis. But they held out hope that the F.D.I.C. would relax its requirements after it received public comment on its proposals.
 ''We believe that the F.D.I.C.'s proposed guidance would deter future private investments in banks that need fresh capital,'' said the Private Equity Council, a trade association for firms like the Carlyle Group, J. C. Flowers and Stone Castle Partners, all of which have been actively seeking to acquire banks.
 The new guidelines will go into effect immediately, but the F.D.I.C. asked for comment on its requirements and said it would consider changes based on the reaction it received.
 ''I remain open-minded on many aspects of this proposal,'' Ms. Bair said.

HEADLINE: Deals With Dodgers Sometimes Include Dose of Heartache

BYLINE: By BILLY WITZ

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
From his seat next to the third-base dugout at Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers' owner, Frank McCourt, can glance to his right and often see Scott Boras sitting nearby, in one of the seats he owns behind home plate.
 It is not necessarily a comforting sight.
 For the last decade, the Dodgers have regularly done business with Boras, negotiating contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars with the man widely viewed as the most powerful agent in baseball. In a number of instances, it has not worked out that well for them.
 Manny Ramirez's 50-game suspension for violating baseball's drug policy is the latest example. The suspension, which ends Friday, came just months after he agreed to a two-year, $45 million free-agent contract with the team.
 There have been Boras pitchers -- Kevin Brown, Eric Gagne and Darren Dreifort -- to whom the Dodgers gave a lot of money, only to see them develop arm trouble. There has been a draft pick represented by Boras who went unsigned, with Luke Hochevar turning down a $3 million offer. 
 There have been free agents represented by Boras who indicated they wanted to stay with the Dodgers -- Adrian Beltre and J. D. Drew -- only to leave. And there have been outright busts, like Andruw Jones.
 Not all of Boras's clients have turned out poorly for the Dodgers. Derek Lowe, who signed a four-year, $36 million contract before the 2005 season, was the staff workhorse during his stint. The acquisitions of Ramirez, Greg Maddux and Jeff Weaver -- who was obtained from the Yankees in exchange for Brown -- all helped, with Ramirez, in particular, putting a jolt in the Dodgers in the second half of 2008.
 In addition, the Dodgers have proved capable of making perfectly foolish deals without Boras's involvement. General Manager Ned Colletti signed Jason Schmidt (three years, $47 million) despite concerns about his pitching arm. He has had one victory since he arrived for the 2007 season. The team also vastly overpaid for Juan Pierre (five years, $44 million).
 But the number of interactions with Boras that disappointed the Dodgers is hard to ignore. 
 Naturally, Boras disagrees. He contends that Brown's seven-year, $105 million contract was good for the Dodgers, in part because it helped them acquire Weaver, who helped Los Angeles get to the playoffs in 2004. Still, in the end, Brown, as a Dodger, ended up missing large parts of two seasons with injuries (he also had several good years), although that was not as bad as Dreifort, who obtained a five-year, $55 million deal during which he won nine games. And Gagne, after signing a two-year, $19 million contract in the wake of three great seasons as the Dodgers' closer, made only 16 appearances. 
 In addition, Boras said the $7 million the Dodgers did not have to pay Ramirez during his suspension could be used to acquire a starting pitcher -- though he backtracked when asked if that meant he considered the suspension beneficial to the Dodgers.
 McCourt and Colletti declined to comment, and Boras declined to discuss how the various deals had affected his relationship with the Dodgers.
 Because Boras's offices in Irvine, Calif., are not far away, and because he is a regular at Dodger Stadium, any deal he arranges with the Dodgers tends to stay front and center.
 ''He's at nearly every Dodger game,'' said Bob Daly, a chairman of the Dodgers when the team was owned by Fox and whose dealings with Boras included the contract for Dreifort. If there has been a common denominator to Boras's Dodger deals, it is his skillful reading of the team's circumstances and his ability to perhaps exploit the decision-makers' lack of experience. McCourt and Daly were new to baseball when they assumed control of the Dodgers. Colletti, Paul DePodesta and Dan Evans were first-time general managers, and Kevin Malone's previous experience as a general manager came in Montreal, where he did not pursue expensive players. 
 It was Brown who became baseball's first $100 million player, reaching a deal with the Dodgers after the 1998 season. He was signed by Malone, who had lost out to Arizona in the bidding for Randy Johnson, and then stunned baseball by offering Brown twice as much as Johnson received.
 ''There was only one No. 1 pitcher, that's what you need to be a championship club, and he knows that,'' Malone said of his dealings with Boras on Brown. ''It's not a matter of being suckered. It's a matter of knowing what it is you need and wanting it too badly -- for the owner, for the fans -- and you overextend yourself.''
 It was during that period that Boras developed a close relationship with Malone and Daly, often watching games with them. By the time Malone was fired, early in the 2001 season, the Dodgers had nine Boras clients on their roster. That team finished third.
 Malone was replaced by Evans, who began to emphasize scouting and development. The Dodgers also began to deal some of Boras's clients. But when McCourt bought the Dodgers in 2004, he fired Evans and replaced him with DePodesta, and subsequent dealings with Boras left the Dodgers bruised anew. 
 One case involved Beltre, a third baseman who had a breakout season in 2004. The Dodgers felt confident they would re-sign him. Instead, Beltre signed a five-year, $64 million deal with Seattle, with Boras saying that the Dodgers' offer of $60 million came too late. 
 Still, a month after Beltre bolted, the Dodgers signed two other Boras clients -- Lowe, and Drew, who received a five-year, $55 million contract with an opt-out clause after the second season.
 Drew was injured most of 2005 but rebounded with a strong 2006. In the final week of that season, Drew told The Orange County Register he had no intention of opting out.
 ''Ultimately, it's my decision and we're happy where we're at,'' Drew told the paper.
 Just over a month later, Drew signed a five-year, $70 million contract with Boston.
 After Drew left, the Dodgers scrambled for a replacement. Eventually, they turned to Jones, who was coming off a bad season in Atlanta. They signed him for two years and $36.2 million, but he played so poorly -- batting .158 -- that the Dodgers bought out his final year.
 In the case of Ramirez, the Dodgers knew that he and Boras were looking for a new deal in the neighborhood of four years and $100 million.
 But for a combination of reasons -- including the recession and the suspicion that Ramirez forced Boston to trade him -- those kinds of offers never emerged. In the end, Ramirez signed for less than he wanted as McCourt stood his ground.
 Malone, who knew how challenging it could be to deal with Boras and who now operates a car dealership not far from Dodger Stadium, watched it all unfold and ended up impressed that numerous teams made it clear they were not interested in Boras's terms for Ramirez.
 ''I wish teams would have done that years ago,'' he said.

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE TREASURE OF ULYSSES DAVIS,' through Sept. 6. Ulysses Davis (1914-1990) was a Savannah, Ga., barber who whittled and carved wooden sculptures in his shop when business was slow. Organized by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, this show is by far the largest presentation of Mr. Davis's sculpture to be seen outside Savannah and the first to reveal the full scope of his imagination. His best-known works, carvings of historical figures, take a backseat to hybrid beasts and hydra-headed figures. It makes clear that he wasn't just a patriotic folk artist, or an African-American artist affirming his heritage, or an inward-looking, visionary artist. He was all of these, which is to say that no single cliche of ''outsider'' art quite fits him. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org (Karen Rosenberg). 
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'PORTRAITS, PASTELS, PRINTS: WHISTLER IN THE FRICK COLLECTION,' through Aug. 23. This summer's refurbishment of the Frick's East Gallery, where four full-length portraits by James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) normally hang, has occasioned a small celebration of Whistler's art. The four portraits have been moved into the Oval Room, where they are joined by a seascape; etchings and pastels of Venice are on view in the Cabinet Room. Both displays reinforce a suspicion about Whistler: that despite his oft-professed regard for the abstract qualities of music -- all those ''symphonies,'' ''arrangements'' and ''nocturnes'' -- he had a rare talent for conveying specific places and personalities. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org (Rosenberg). 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AVEDON FASHION: 1944-2000,' through Sept. 20. The first museum retrospective devoted to Richard Avedon's fashion photography exudes a contagious joie de vivre. With postwar Paris as a stage set, Avedon made fashion photography new by adding movement and then narrative to his images, along with ironic self-awareness and a buoyant exuberance. The best of his early images are as perfect as the best work of Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns from this period and as profoundly representative of it. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Roberta Smith) 
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'RECLAIMED: PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JACQUES GOUDSTIKKER,' through Aug. 2. This show of paintings returned to the family of Goudstikker, a prominent Dutch gallery owner who died while fleeing the Nazis, is many exhibitions in one. It's a portrait of an enormously successful art dealer who shaped tastes and markets between the wars. It's a marriage of Northern Baroque and Southern Renaissance painting. Most of all, it's an extraordinary, continuing tale of looting and restitution. At the center of all these stories is a small black notebook, used by Goudstikker to catalog his inventory of some 1,400 works and now on display, in actual and digitized form, at the Jewish Museum. Other highlights include a landscape by Salomon von Jacobsz Ruysdael and a portrait by Rembrandt's pupil Ferdinand Bol. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AFGHANISTAN: HIDDEN TREASURES FROM THE NATIONAL MUSEUM, KABUL,'through Sept. 20. The 200 pre-Islamic objects in this important and moving show date from the Bronze Age to the first century A.D. They dropped from sight during the country's recent turmoil, which was deadly for both people and artwork alike. Courageous curators were their salvation; the rediscovery of the pieces was a moment of national thanksgiving. Consisting of vessels, sculpture, architectural ornaments, jewelry and furniture decoration made of bronze, stone, glass, ceramic, ivory, gold and gemstone, they attest to an astounding cosmopolitanism and diverse cultural heritage. Once, many trade routes led through Afghanistan, and proof of its former centrality is both dazzling and heartening.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) 
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PAGES OF GOLD: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through Sept. 13. This quietly compelling show assembles ''orphan'' leaves (illuminated pages separated from medieval manuscripts and sold, individually, to collectors). Organized geographically, the show allows a comparison of illumination styles in England, Italy, Spain and other countries and regions. It also highlights the figures who created and participated in the market for single leaves. They include an Italian abbot, an English art historian and a mysterious artist known as the Spanish Forger. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg) 
 MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'SCRIPTURE FOR THE EYES: BIBLE ILLUSTRATION IN NETHERLANDISH PRINTS OF THE 16TH CENTURY,' through Sept. 27. Abounding in sex, violence and supernatural happenings, the Bible has been a great source of inspiration for visual artists. This superb show features pieces by some of the biggest names in the history of Western printmaking. Woodcuts and engravings by Lucas van Leyden and Hendrick Goltzius alone would make a visit to the museum worthwhile, but among the 79 works on view there are lots more wildly imaginative and technically amazing feats of printmaking. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Ken Johnson) 
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,'through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke to today's inane material excesses.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) 
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'HARLEM, 1970-2009: PHOTOGRAPHS BY CAMILO JOSE VERGARA,' through July 12. From the time he arrived in the United States from Chile as a college student in 1965, the photographer Camilo Jose Vergara has been haunting, and haunted by, American cities. Some -- Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York -- he has revisited and rephotographed repeatedly in the past 40 years to record changes over time. The people and places of Harlem are the subject of this small show about alteration and continuation. A similar exhibition, ''Storefront Churches: Photographs by Camilo Jose Vergara,'' runs through Nov. 29 at the National Building Museum in Washington. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org (Holland Cotter). 
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/ OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Never-Neverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter) 
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SADIE BENNING: PLAY PAUSE,'through Sept. 20. A new stop-action animation by this former film prodigy uses an avalanche of simple, almost naive gouache drawings, sometimes tinted with color, to prowl the margins of urban society. The result is low-key with undercurrents: a picture of the everyday sublime riddled with suggestions of longing, otherness and the difficulties of connection. Solveig Nelson has provided its beautifully accurate (yet largely electronic) soundtrack of city sounds, whether a subway singer or squirrels rifling through a garbage can, people talking in a bar or gates being called in an airport.(212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith) 
 Galleries: 57th Street
 TIM HAWKINSON, through July 24. Great expectations are aroused by the prospect of a Tim Hawkinson show. At his best, this mercurial Los Angeles sculptor can be astoundingly inventive. This is a relatively modest and spotty exhibition, however. Works included range from almost beautiful to hideous. A life-size motorcycle made entirely of eight different kinds of dark feathers is lovely and poetic. A bronze sculpture of a nude adolescent boy and his dog is drop-dead ugly. Pace Wildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, pacewildenstein.com. (Johnson) 
 JACK YOUNGERMAN: 'TRIADS/QUADRADS,' through July 26. Mr. Youngerman's new paintings have an exhilarating punch. In bright Playskool colors and with a direct, slightly brushy touch, he has been creating centered, hard-edged abstractions on star-, diamond-, three-leaf-clover- and oval-shaped plywood panels. They have a numinous vibe, like altar paintings for a pagan cult or heraldic emblems for a mystical knighthood. Washburn Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780, washburngallery.com. (Johnson) 
 Galleries: Chelsea
 MARK FLOOD: 'CHELSEA WHORES,' through next Friday. Works by this Houston-based artist mock American culture and the contemporary art world. A found Exxon sign has the words ''Take Drugs'' crudely stenciled across the bottom. Paintings on cardboard bear messages like ''Another Painting'' or ''2 More Paintings.'' Having it both ways, Mr. Flood also produces almost beautiful, traditional canvases by applying paint over old lace and then pulling away the fabric, leaving intricate, multihued, all-over patterns. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24th Street, (212) 989-7700, zachfeuer.com (Johnson). 
 CHARLES RAY, through next Friday. More than 20 years ago Mr. Ray created a piece of kinetic sculpture that became famous, even though hardly anyone saw it: ''Ink Line'' (1987), a fine stream of black ink flowing from a little hole in the ceiling to another in the floor. It is here publicly exhibited for the first time, along with two other pieces from the '80s: ''Moving Wire,'' in which the ends of a length of wire snake in and out of fine holes drilled into the wall, and ''Spinning Spot,'' a circular section of the floor, 24 inches in diameter, spinning at 33 r.p.m. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Johnson) 
 Galleries: SoHo
 UNICA ZURN: 'DARK SPRING,' through July 23. A fiction writer and poet, Zurn (1916-1970) suffered a series of mental breakdowns during the last decade of her life, and it was during that time that she produced most of the playfully improvised, sometimes hallucinatory nightmarish drawings in this fascinating show. Wandering, loopy lines enfold intricate patterns of dots, petals and serpentine stripes punctuated by eyes, faces, birds, fish, snakes and flowers. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Johnson) 
 Galleries: Other
 JOHN WOOD: 'ON THE EDGE OF CLEAR MEANING,' through July 18. Beginning in the 1950s, Mr. Wood made unique objects with combinations of drawing, collage, printmaking and early forms of photography (cyanotype, photogram, cliche-verre). This retrospective at the Grey Art Gallery (with additional work at the International Center of Photography) explores his long career as an artist and a teacher at Alfred University. Organized by Mr. Wood's former student Nathan Lyons, it includes more than 210 photographs, artist's books and works that fall under the catchall heading of mixed media, many of them as topical as they are technical. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart (Rosenberg). 
 Public Art
 'PLOT/09: THIS WORLD & NEARER ONES,'through the summer. The big draw in the city's first quadrennial of public art -- an exhibition of 19 site-specific artworks organized by Creative Time on Governors Island -- is the beautiful, haunted, car-free island itself. Standouts among the uneven melange of artworks include videos by Guido van der Werve, Adam Chodzko, Judi Werthein and the ingenious Bruce High Quality Foundation. Outdoors, beyond the dark rooms, Susan Philipsz, Teresa Margolles, Tue Greenfort, Mark Wallinger and especially Klaus Weber also add substance. But the degree of site-specificity fluctuates wildly, and the concept as a whole is inadvertently called into question.(212) 206-6674, creativetime.org. (Smith) 
 Out of Town
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHEPARD FAIREY: SUPPLY AND DEMAND,' through Aug. 16. The surprise of the first museum retrospective for the creator of the Obama ''Hope'' poster is that almost everything he does, from abstracted images of Andre the Giant to his album covers for Led Zeppelin and other bands, is visually arresting. But in tracking his 20-year evolution from aesthetic anarchist to savvy, all-purpose designer and illustrator, the exhibition inadvertently casts doubt on his authenticity as a radical street artist. 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, (617) 478-3100, icaboston.org (Johnson). 
 YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART: 'PAINTINGS FROM THE REIGN OF VICTORIA: THE ROYAL HOLLOWAY COLLECTION, LONDON,' through July 26. Though often sappy, moralistic and formally unadventurous, the best British painting of the late 19th century still delivers a rich mix of visual imagination, narrative intrigue and social commentary. Drawn from a collection created in the early 1880s for students at the Royal Holloway College in England, at the time for women only, this exhibition presents pictures that can make you wish painting today were as tuned in to the real world. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-2800, yale.edu/ycba. (Johnson) 
 Last Chance
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GUSTAVE CAILLEBOTTE: IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS FROM PARIS TO THE SEA'; closes on Sunday. Thirty-some years ago, the museum had a big success with a Caillebotte retrospective that more or less introduced American audiences to an artist who was an Impressionist by association rather than by style or temperament. His three best-known pictures, ''The Floor Scrapers,'' ''The Pont de l'Europe'' and ''Paris Street, Rainy Day,'' all grand urban scenes from the late 1870s, are absent from this show, which is a more modest enterprise than a survey, with emphasis falling on less-focused late work. But Caillebotte was a painter as interesting for his weaknesses as for his strengths, and any exposure is valuable. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter) 
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'THE GENERATIONAL: YOUNGER THAN JESUS'; closes on Sunday. The latest local survey to challenge the pre-eminence of the Whitney Biennial is big, international in scope and age-specific. As the title implies, only artists 33 or younger were considered for inclusion. The result is a serious, carefully considered show, but one that with a few magnetic entries aside -- a video by Cyprien Galliard; an animation by Wojciech Bakowski; a madcap Ryan Trecartin installation -- feels sedate for a youthfest. Despite the global reach, it's oddly familiar, like a more-substantial-than-average weekend gallery hop in Chelsea and the Lower East Side, right down to token African and Asian imports. Still, there are many intriguing artists to look (and listen) for, among them the filmmakers Keren Cytter and Luke Fowler; the digital whiz-kid Mark Essen; and Guthrie Lonergan. There is also, as it happens, a much livelier survey to be found in an accompanying book called ''Younger Than Jesus: Artist Directory,'' which features nearly 500 artists who didn't make the final exhibition cut. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: Russia's Neighbors Resist Wooing and Bullying

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
This was supposed to be Russia's round in the battle over its backyard. All year, despite its own economic spasms, Moscow has earmarked great chunks of cash for its impoverished post-Soviet neighbors, seeking to lock in their loyalty over the long term and curtail Western influence in the region. 
 But the neighbors seem to have other ideas. Belarus -- which was promised $2 billion in Russian aid -- is in open rebellion against the Kremlin, flaunting its preference for Europe while also collecting money from the International Monetary Fund. Uzbekistan joined Belarus in refusing to sign an agreement on the Collective Rapid Reaction Forces, an idea Moscow sees as an eventual counterweight to NATO. 
 There are other examples, like Turkmenistan's May signing of a gas exploration deal with a German company, and Armenia's awarding of a major national honor to Moscow's nemesis, President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia. But the biggest came last week when Kyrgyzstan -- set to receive $2.15 billion in Russian aid -- reversed a decision that had been seen as a coup for Moscow, last winter's order terminating the American military's use of the Manas Air Base there. 
 ''A game of chance has developed in the post-Soviet space: Who can swindle the Kremlin in the coolest way?'' wrote the military analyst Aleksandr Golts, when news of the Manas decision broke. ''Such a brilliant result of Russia's four-year diplomatic efforts!''
 There are few projects that matter more to Russia than restoring its influence in the former Soviet republics, whose loss to many in Moscow is still as painful as a phantom limb. Competition over Georgia and Ukraine has brought relations between Moscow and Washington to a post-cold-war low, and the matter is bound to be central to the talks that begin on Monday between Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, and President Obama. 
 Russia's ability to attract its neighbors to its side and keep them there is unimpressive. The Kremlin's methods have been reactive and often bullying, combining incentives like cheap energy or cash disbursement with threats of trade sanctions and gas cutoffs.
 The war in Georgia seems to have hurt Moscow in that regard. Rather than being cowed into obedience, as most Western observers feared, the former republics seem to have grown even more protective of their sovereignty. Moreover, the leaders themselves have thrived by playing Russia and the West and, in some cases, China off against one another, although that has not brought stability or prosperity to their countries.
 In Moscow's so-called zone of privileged interests, in other words, Russia is just another competitor. 
 ''There is no loyalty,'' said Oksana Antonenko, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, based in London. ''Rivalry is the persistent dynamic. They have to play in that game, to compete.'' 
 Kyrgyzstan's reversal on Manas is a case study in canny horse trading. Russian officials, including Mr. Medvedev, have said they blessed the decision, and that may be true, but President Kurmanbek S. Bakiyev is the one who walked away with what he wanted. 
 Moscow wanted the base, a key transit hub for the United States' war in Afghanistan, shut down; Kyrgyzstan wanted more money. In February, Moscow seemed to have achieved a master stroke -- at a news conference announcing the pledge of $2.15 billion in Russian aid, Mr. Bakiyev said the United States would have to leave Manas in six months. 
 The first Russian payments -- a $150 million emergency grant and a $300 million low-interest loan -- arrived in April, allowing Mr. Bakiyev to pay wages and pensions as he began his re-election campaign. Then Kyrgyzstan shocked the region by announcing a new agreement with the United States. Washington will pay more than triple the rent for the base -- now called a ''transit center'' -- increasing its annual payment to $60 million from $17.4 million, while kicking in upwards of $50 million in grants to the government. No one knows if the Kremlin will make good on the rest of its pledge.
 Mr. Bakiyev ''played the Russians, then he played us,'' said Alexander A. Cooley, an associate professor of political science at Barnard College who addressed the Manas dispute in a recent book, ''Base Politics.'' ''It's all about getting as much as they can.'' 
 This should be easier for Russia, which dwarfs its Eurasian neighbors in both size and wealth. Russia retains a military presence in more than half the former Soviet countries, and huge swaths of their populations rely on Russian media for their news. Russia can offer muscular assistance in elections, as in Moldova, which has just received a Russian pledge of $500 million four weeks before voters go to the polls to elect a new Parliament. 
 But Russia's strategy for consolidating support in neighboring capitals can hardly be called a strategy. Belarus's president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, who is avidly pursuing Western partners, has been barraged with carrots and sticks from Moscow -- first promised $2 billion in Russian aid, then bitterly chastised for his economic policy, then punished with a crippling ban on the import of milk products, then rewarded by a reversal of the import ban. Russia regards Mr. Lukashenko's truculence as a bluff. 
 ''He is imitating a quarrel with Russia until the West demands serious changes from his regime, at which point, he will, of course, surrender,'' said Parliament member Konstantin F. Zatulin, a standard-bearer for Russia's ambitions in former Soviet space. ''It's just his greedy line of behavior.'' 
 But the examples extend much farther. Every post-Soviet country that can manage it is pursuing a ''multivector policy,'' Mr. Zatulin acknowledged. Mr. Zatulin said he was not upset by these tacks away from Russia, but there was an edge to his answer. 
 ''What is the point of being disappointed?'' Mr. Zatulin said. ''Pride comes before a fall. These are weak, dependent and poor countries which want to attract attention to themselves -- not only attention, but aid. I cannot criticize them for that. But there are some red lines that shouldn't be crossed.''
 Herein lies the problem: Russia's appeal to them just does not sound very seductive. Ideally, it would present an attractive model for its neighbors, politically and economically. Young generations would learn Russian because they wanted to, and the post-Soviet alliances would be clubs its neighbors are lining up to join. 
 In any case, Moscow will have to use tools other than wire transfers if it hopes to emerge from the financial crisis with a solid political bloc. As Alexei Mukhin, director of the nonprofit Center for Political Information, put it, ''Love bought with money will not last long. 
 ''That is purchased love,'' he said. ''It's not very reliable.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Fireworks Display

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
On July Fourth, we think about our country and its future. But these days it's impossible to think about America and its future role in the world without also thinking about China. This was the subject of a combative discussion this week at the Aspen Ideas Festival.
 The agent provocateur was Niall Ferguson of Harvard. China and the U.S., he argued, used to have a symbiotic relationship and formed a tightly integrated unit that he calls Chimerica. 
 In this unit, China did the making, and the United States did the buying. China did the saving, while the U.S. did the spending. Between 1995 and 2005, the U.S. savings rate declined from about 5 percent to zero, while the Chinese savings rate rose from 30 percent to nearly 45 percent.
 This savings diversion allowed the Chinese to plow huge amounts of capital into the U.S. and dollar-denominated assets. Cheap Chinese labor kept American inflation low. Chinese efforts to keep the renminbi from appreciating against the dollar kept our currency strong and allowed us to borrow at low interest rates.
 During the first few years of the 21st century, Chimerica worked great. This unit accounted for about a quarter of the world's G.D.P. and for about half of global growth. But a marriage in which one partner does all the saving and the other partner does all the spending is not going to last.
 The frictions are building and will lead to divorce, conflict and potential catastrophe. China, Ferguson argued, is now decoupling from the United States. Chinese business leaders assume that American consumers will never again go on a spending binge. The Chinese are developing an economy that relies more on internal consumption.
 Chinese officials are also aware that the U.S. will never get its fiscal house in order. There may be theoretical plans to reduce the federal deficit and the national debt, but there is no politically practical way to get there. Depreciation is inevitable and the Chinese are working to end the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency.
 Chinese nationalism is also on the rise. The Internet has made young Chinese more nationalistic. The Chinese are acquiring resources all around the world and with them, willy-nilly, an overseas empire that threatens U.S. interests. The Chinese are building their Navy, a historic precursor to expanded ambitions and global conflict. 
 Think of China, Ferguson concluded, as Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany in the years before World War I: a growing, aggressive, nationalistic power whose ambitions will tear through pre-existing commercial ties and historic friendships.
 James Fallows of The Atlantic has lived in China for the past three years. He agreed with parts of Ferguson's take on the economic fundamentals, but seemed to regard Ferguson's analysis of the Chinese psychology as airy-fairy academic theorizing. At one point, while Fallows was defending Chinese intentions, Ferguson shot back: ''You've been in China too long.'' Fallows responded that there must be a happy medium between being in China too long and being in China too little.
 Fallows pointed out that there is no one thing called ''China'' or ''the Chinese,'' and that many of the most anti-American statements from Chinese officials are made to blunt domestic anxiety and make further integration possible. That integration, Fallows continued, is deep and will get deeper. Many, many Chinese leaders were educated in the U.S. and admire or at least respect it. If you go to cities like Xian, you find American and European aviation firms fully integrated into the commercial fabric there.
 Fallows's main argument, though, was psychological. When he lived in Japan in the 1980s, he said, he sometimes felt that the Japanese had a chip-on-their-shoulder attitude in which their success was bound to U.S. decline. He says he rarely got that feeling in China. Instead, he has described officials who are thrilled to be integrated in the world. Their mothers had bound feet. They themselves plowed the fields in the Cultural Revolution. Now they get to join the world.
 Some of the officials interviewed by Fallows believe the U.S. is following unsustainable fiscal policies that will lead to decline, but they view this with frustration, not joy. Fallows doesn't know what the future will hold, but he believes that Chinese officials still see the dollar as their least risky investment. Domestically, China will not turn democratic, but individual liberties will expand. He agreed that China and the U.S. will dominate the 21st century, but he painted the picture of a more benign cooperation.
 I came to the debate agreeing more with Fallows and left the same way, but I was impressed by how powerfully Ferguson made his case. And I was struck by their agreement about what to do. This conversation, like many conversations these days, gets back to America's debt. Until the U.S. gets its fiscal house in order, relations with countries like China will be fundamentally insecure.

HEADLINE: Taking Steps to Fight Global Warming

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Climate in the Senate'' (editorial, July 1):
 While it's encouraging to see Congress taking steps to reduce global warming, the approach championed at the moment -- cap and trade -- is fraught with perils and ineffectiveness. The biggest drawback is the creation of a trillion-dollar market in carbon futures and derivatives, a speculator's playground that has economic disaster written all over it.
 Your admonishment to the Senate notwithstanding, the bill that was passed in the House appears dead on arrival. A simpler, more effective and politically viable option is a tax on carbon, with revenues returned to Americans through income and payroll taxes to offset higher energy costs. Such proposals have already been introduced by both Republicans and Democrats in the House, making it a solution both parties appear willing to support. 
 Come late fall, when the Waxman-Markey bill has languished in the Senate, lawmakers will see the need to move on to Plan B -- the carbon tax.
 Steve Valk Atlanta, July 1, 2009

 To the Editor:
 The claim that giving away permits keeps the price of emissions low reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how cap-and-trade programs work (''House Backs Bill, 219-212, to Curb Global Warming,'' front page, June 27).
 The price of emissions, and therefore the effect of the program on fuel and energy prices, will be determined by the total supply of permits (the cap), not by how they are initially allocated. Consumers will have to pay the price either way, as well they should, for their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.

 To the Editor:
 Re ''In Climate Change Bill, What May Become an Election-Year Issue'' (Congressional Memo, June 27):
 It is clear to me, having watched the climate bill debate in the House, that many Republicans simply do not believe that global warming is real, is caused by burning of fossil fuels and will lead to devastating consequences in a matter of decades if the status quo is maintained or actions to lower greenhouse gas emissions are inadequate.
 This is reinforced in your article, describing Republicans ''almost in a celebratory mood'' at the close of the debate, believing they had gained a trump card to be used in future elections.
 I can only hope that voters will take the time to read what the scientists are saying and see through the hot air offered by those politicians who deny global warming and deny the urgency of the situation.
 Michael Yellin Montclair, N.J., June 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 ''Betraying the Planet,'' by Paul Krugman (column, June 29), recognizes that we can no longer afford to deny global warming, particularly in light of heavy Republican opposition to the Waxman-Markey bill that was passed in the House on June 26. Refuting global warming certainly constitutes betraying the planet, yet, surprisingly enough, so does supporting the bill. 
 A minority of the 212 representatives who voted against the bill did so because they considered the bill too weak. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that countries should cut their emissions by 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Yet the short-term target in the bill offers only a 4 percent reduction by 2020, which just begins to signal the numerous problems with the bill.
 Supporting this bill is a step backward and would only further betray the planet and give in to these global warming deniers.
 Brian Howe Manlius, N.Y., June 30, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 Having done scientific research for four decades about possible environmental effects of global warming, and having been one of the earliest ecologists to be concerned about such possibilities, I am shocked and affronted by Paul Krugman's column ''Betraying the Planet.''
 I read the scientific literature carefully and analyze data that my colleagues and I obtain. Contrary to Mr. Krugman's claim that ''the fact is that the planet is changing faster than even pessimists expected,'' most of the dire pronouncements are computer forecasts, not empirical facts.
 But even if this were not the case, a subject as complex and important as global warming must be open to scientific analysis. There has been a longstanding attempt to learn which policy mechanisms work best to achieve environmental goals, and the answer is far from in. While Mr. Krugman may be reacting to unfounded opinions by politicians, the effect of his article is to suppress any open discussion of global warming.

HEADLINE: Green Power Takes Root in China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DUNHUANG, China 

 BODY:
As the United States takes its first steps toward mandating that power companies generate more electricity from renewable sources, China already has a similar requirement and is investing billions to remake itself into a green energy superpower. 
 Through a combination of carrots and sticks, Beijing is starting to change how this country generates energy. Although coal remains the biggest energy source and is almost certain to stay that way, the rise of renewable energy, especially wind power, is helping to slow China's steep growth in emissions of global warming gases.
 While the House of Representatives approved a requirement last week that American utilities generate more of their power from renewable sources of energy, and the Senate will consider similar proposals over the summer, China imposed such a requirement almost two years ago.
 This year China is on track to pass the United States as the world's largest market for wind turbines -- after doubling wind power capacity in each of the last four years. State-owned power companies are competing to see which can build solar plants fastest, though these projects are much smaller than the wind projects. And other green energy projects, like burning farm waste to generate electricity, are sprouting up. 
 This oasis town deep in the Gobi Desert along the famed Silk Road and the surrounding wilderness of beige sand dunes and vast gravel wastelands has become a center of China's drive to lead the world in wind and solar energy.
 A series of projects is under construction on the nearly lifeless plateau to the southeast of Dunhuang, including one of six immense wind power projects now being built around China, each with the capacity of more than 16 large coal-fired power plants.
 Each of the six projects ''totally dwarfs anything else, anywhere else in the world,'' said Steve Sawyer, the secretary general of the Global Wind Energy Council, an industry group in Brussels.
 Some top Chinese regulators even worry that Beijing's mandates are pushing companies too far too fast. The companies may be deliberately underbidding for the right to build new projects and then planning to go back to the government later and demand compensation once the projects lose money.
 ''The problem is we have so many stupid enterprises,'' said Li Junfeng, who is the deputy director general for energy research at China's top economic planning agency and the secretary general of the government-run Renewable Energy Industries Association.
 HSBC predicts that China will invest more money in renewable energy and nuclear power between now and 2020 than in coal-fired and oil-fired electricity.
 That does not mean that China will become a green giant overnight. For one thing, Chinese power consumption is expected to rise steadily over the next decade as 720 million rural Chinese begin acquiring the air-conditioners and other power-hungry amenities already common among China's 606 million city dwellers.
 As recently as the start of last year, the Chinese government's target was to have 5,000 megawatts of wind power installed by the end of next year, or the equivalent of eight big coal-fired power plants, a tiny proportion of China's energy usage and a pittance at a time when China was building close to two coal-fired plants a week. 
 But in March of last year, as power companies began accelerating construction of wind turbines, the government issued a forecast that 10,000 megawatts would actually be installed by the end of next year. And now, just 15 months later, with construction of coal-fired plants having slowed to one a week and still falling, it appears that China will have 30,000 megawatts of wind energy by the end of next year -- which was previously the target for 2020, Mr. Li said.
 A big impetus was the government's requirement, issued in September 2007, that large power companies generate at least 3 percent of their electricity by the end of 2010 from renewable sources. The calculation excludes hydroelectric power, which already accounts for 21 percent of Chinese power, and nuclear power, which accounts for 1.1 percent.
 Chinese companies must generate 8 percent of their power from renewable sources other than hydroelectric by the end of 2020. 
 The House bill in the United States resembles China's approach in imposing a renewable energy standard on large electricity providers. But the details make it hard to compare standards. The House bill requires large electricity providers in the United States to derive at least 15 percent of their energy by 2020 from a combination of energy savings and renewable energy -- including hydroelectric dams built since 1992.
 Chinese power companies are eager to invest in renewable energy not just because of the government's mandates, but because they are flush with cash and state-owned banks are eager to lend them more money. And there are few regulatory hurdles.
 At the same time, the Ministry of Environmental Protection has temporarily banned three of the country's five main power companies from building more coal-fired power plants, punishment for their failure to comply with environmental regulations at existing coal-fired plants. China's renewable energy frenzy has been accelerating recently, especially in solar energy. 
 Last winter, winning bidders for three projects agreed to sell power to the national power grid for about 59 cents a kilowatt hour. 
 But this spring, when the government solicited offers to build and operate the 10-megawatt photovoltaic solar power plant here in Dunhuang, the lowest bid was just 10 cents a kilowatt hour -- so low the government rejected it as likely to result in losses for whatever state-owned bank lent money to build it.
 The winning bidder was China Guangdong Nuclear Power Company, an entirely state-owned business that bid 16 cents a kilowatt hour. (That was still far below last winter's price, but a two-thirds drop in raw material costs because of the global financial crisis has started to drive down the cost of solar panels, the chief expense for the winning bidder.)
 Zheng Shuangwei, the company's general manager for northwest China, said that 22 or 23 cents would be more fair. The bid of 16 cents ''is not a proper price,'' he acknowledged. ''It's a bidding rate that is the result of competition.''
 By comparison, the grid buys electricity from coal-fired power plants for 4 to 5 cents a kilowatt hour. Wind turbine rates have dropped to 7 cents from 10 cents over the last couple of years because of fierce competition and declining turbine costs.
 The solar project still must go ahead, Mr. Zheng said, because China has limited coal reserves -- 41 years at current rates of production -- and the potential for hydroelectric power is leveling off as most eligible rivers have already been dammed.
 But technical obstacles to renewable energy are popping up. Sandstorms in Dunhuang in the spring, for instance, will cover solar panels and render them useless until they are cleaned after each storm by squads of workers using feather brushes to avoid scratching the panels, a process expected to take two days.
 And wind turbines are being built faster here than the national grid can erect high-voltage power lines to carry the electricity to cities elsewhere. On the windiest days, only half the power generated can be transmitted, said Min Deqing, a local renewable energy consultant.
 Nonetheless, city officials are pushing for more projects. 
 ''It's the Gobi Desert,'' said Wang Yu, the vice director of economic planning. ''There's not much other use for it.''

HEADLINE: Keep the Music, Add the Views

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
LAST summer a sad but hopeful question made its way through Brooklyn: Where will the Pool Parties go?
 It was the third year of concerts in McCarren Park Pool, the disused 1930s public swimming hole on the Williamsburg-Greenpoint border, and they had begun to feel like an institution. Each Sunday afternoon the shows drew thousands of the young and fashionably dressed, yet the buzz-kill of mortality hung over them: McCarren was destined to become a real pool again, so the parties needed to find a new home. But where?
 After months of scrambling with city and state authorities, Jelly, the promotion company behind the Pool Parties, has just announced this summer's series, at East River State Park, an appropriately raw seven-acre stretch of the Williamsburg waterfront. The shows -- all of them free, thanks to the very visible participation of corporate sponsors -- will begin July 12, with Mission of Burma as the headliner, and continue each Sunday through Aug. 30. 
 The bad news: no more Slip 'N Slide. 
 The good news is that there's more good news about this summer's concert season. In addition to the long-running, blue-chip series like Central Park SummerStage and Celebrate Brooklyn!, which have already begun, this week funkier events like Seaport Music at South Street Seaport return. Thanks to the ingenuity and one-upmanship of local concert promoters, yet more concerts are turning up in the most unusual and amazing places. 
 Perhaps the most amazing, and certainly most unusual, is Governors Island, the former military base that has been under gradual transformation into an arts and recreation area. A major new concert space begins there this summer: the Beach at Governors Island, which opens July 11, with the Dark Star Orchestra, a fastidiously faithful Grateful Dead tribute band. Bookings continue into October, with the B-52s, Mos Def and Erykah Badu.
 The Beach, on the north side of Governors Island, features an actual beach, or at least a kind of sandbox, with 300 tons of sand imported from Long Island. Its biggest attraction, however, is the view, one of the most awesome in the city, with the towers of Lower Manhattan shooting into the sky just a few thousand feet away and the full expanse of New York Harbor all around.
 For a certain kind of music fan, though, the biggest news is the return of the Pool Parties, which for three years functioned as both an important concert series and a social nexus. With the help of the Open Space Alliance for North Brooklyn, a nonprofit group that works in partnership with the Parks Department, East River State Park was secured for the concerts as part of a broader plan to keep the indie and eclectic spirit of McCarren alive. 
 The riverside park and its surrounding area, like McCarren Park, is emblematic of the area's cultural and economic evolution. A former shipping terminal, the lot fell into neglect and squalor, and was eventually acquired by the state. Half green and half concrete, it still has the feel of an industrial-era ruin, but all around it are luxury apartment buildings, so new that some are still under construction. 
 For the concerts there will be room for 6,000 on two long concrete slabs, plus space for 1,500 or more on the surrounding grass, said Stephanie Thayer, the executive director of the alliance. The bookings are strong, with indie-rock stars like the Black Lips, Dirty Projectors, Fiery Furnaces, Girl Talk and Grizzly Bear. Unlike previous years, though, there will not be ticketed shows by big promoters like Live Nation and AEG Live. And this year's concerts arrive with an expiration date: after this summer another spot must be found.
 For months the lineup for this year's Pool Parties has been the worst-kept secret in the local music scene. But most fans don't know the difficulties that stood in the way, and how close the concerts may have come to not happening. 
 In an interview Sarah Hooper, 28, and Alexander Kane, 33, the owners of Jelly (formerly known as JellyNYC), explained their plans for the Pool Parties. When they put the first season together in 2006, they had experience with club shows but nothing on such a scale. They knew they had a phenomenon on their hands midway through the first summer once they checked Craigslist the day after a packed Deerhoof show. ''There were all these missed connections from people at the pool: 'I saw you by the Slip 'N Slide,' '' Ms. Hooper said with a hearty laugh.
 They had an ambitious plan to expand to San Francisco this summer and booked eight weekends there. But those shows were abruptly canceled, and Ms. Hooper and Mr. Kane say they lost $150,000. They blame prohibitively high expenses, but also hint at conflicts with local promoters in San Francisco. ''We were definitely the new kids on the block,'' Ms. Hooper said, ''and that doesn't always go so well.''
 The cancellations raised red flags with booking agents, who became concerned about Jelly's ability to pay. That, along with the delay in announcing the Brooklyn series, fueled rumors that the shows were off. Mr. Kane and Ms. Hooper insist that the Brooklyn shows were never in danger, and that the delay was caused only by procedural red tape. State and city parks officials also confirmed recently that they fully expected the shows to go on.
 But Jelly also acknowledges that the economy has posed new problems for a series of free concerts that are entirely dependent on corporate sponsorship. ''Even now it would be great to get a company to cut you a check for half a million dollars,'' Mr. Kane said. ''But you're lucky if they cut you a check for a tenth of that.'' The budget for the Brooklyn series, they said, is about $500,000, and their sponsors this year include Converse and Bud Light.
 Securing East River State Park was arduous, said Ms. Thayer of the Open Space Alliance, involving state and city officials who were engaged not only in the basic permit process but in screening the bands -- YouTube videos, lyrics, everything, according to Jelly -- to make sure the entertainment was suitable for a state park. But the one season there will be worth it, she said, if it helps the Open Space Alliance and Jelly achieve their larger goals of finding a permanent spot for concerts in the Williamsburg-Greenpoint area.
 ''The concerts are a way of seeing that the music continues in our neighborhood, a neighborhood that's built in part by artists and other creative people,'' Ms. Thayer said. ''It's part of our neighborhood, and we want to see a place for it.''
 The Pool Parties will have a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline, but in that regard they can't compete with the new Beach at Governors Island, an outdoor stage operated by Harbor Experience, the company behind New York Water Taxi. It has a five-year permit to present concerts in a prime spot, where 3,000 concertgoers will be able to take in the music and the skyline all at once. 
 It's barely a five-minute ferry ride from the Battery Maritime Building, and beyond the stage is all of Governors Island to explore, with its centuries-old forts and peaceful, green quads of vacant military barracks. Harbor Experience has already set up one Water Taxi Beach at Long Island City, Queens, sponsoring a successful dance-music series there for five years. Now, with Governors Island and a new Water Taxi Beach at South Street Seaport, the company is counting on music to draw people to the island -- which, not coincidentally, can be reached by taking Harbor Experience ferries.
 ''The reason we started the Water Taxi Beach in Long Island City was that the residents wanted us to provide continuous weekend ferry service,'' said Travis Noyes, the company's chief operating officer. ''But we really weren't getting the ridership. So what we created was a there there.'' 
 This week workers were busy preparing the concert space for the Beach at Governors Island. The sand was still arranged in enormous piles, waiting to be spread; the food service counter was being built. (Some food for sale at the shows will come from a farm on the island, with food waste returned to the farm for composting.) 
 Tickets for many of the Governors Island concerts are not cheap -- Dark Star Orchestra is $40, and Erykah Badu is $52 -- but the price includes round-trip ferry service. (There is free municipal ferry service from the Battery Maritime Building, but it ceases at 5 p.m. on Fridays and 7 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays; thereafter the only ferries are operated by New York Water Taxi.)
 The Beach is not the first concert series on Governors Island. Folks on the Island, run by Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan, has been putting on shows there since 2007, and this year that series features Judy Collins on July 26. But those concerts and others have been held inland, where the view has more trees than skyline.
 Last year Dark Star Orchestra played there, and John Kadlecik, its lead guitarist and singer (''I'm the guy who sings and plays all the Jerry Garcia parts,'' he explained), said that what he remembered was the energy of the crowd, not the view.
 ''It's not so much about the venue for me,'' he said. ''As long as the venue facilitates a good connection between the crowd and the music, I'm happy.''
 Then he added, ''But I look forward to seeing if there is better scenery.''

HEADLINE: Sanford Did Not Spend Improperly, Official Says

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Motoko Rich contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A review of travel and financial records showed that Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina did not spend public money improperly while conducting an extramarital affair, the chief of the State Law Enforcement Division said Thursday.
 Since Monday, the governor's continuing revelations about the affair, including his admission that he had seen his lover more times than he initially acknowledged, have stepped up calls for his resignation and heightened support for an investigation into his travel records. 
 The chief of the State Law Enforcement Division, Reginald Lloyd, said that the review of Mr. Sanford's records was not a criminal inquiry, that the governor had cooperated and that there was no evidence of any crime. 
 ''Until we get some fact suggesting a criminal violation or the possibility of a violation,'' Mr. Lloyd said, ''SLED's done. We don't intend to be used in a political battle about the governor.''
 The governor's spokesman, Joel Sawyer, said Mr. Lloyd's report ''confirms what we've said from Day 1.'' 
 ''No public money was used in relation to the governor's admitted marital infidelity,'' said Mr. Sawyer, who released the travel records after Mr. Lloyd's news conference. ''This issue is behind us once and for all.''
 Also Thursday, Mr. Sanford's wife, Jenny, issued her first statement since the governor's detailed statements this week, saying that her husband's actions had been ''inexcusable'' but that she was willing to forgive him. 
 ''Mark showed a lack of judgment in his recent actions as governor,'' Mrs. Sanford said. ''However, his far more egregious offenses were committed against God, the institutions of marriage and family, our boys and me. 
 ''Mark has stated that his intent and determination is to save our marriage, and to make amends to the people of South Carolina,'' she added. ''I hope he can make good on those intentions, and for the sake of our boys, I leave the door open to it. In that spirit of forgiveness, it is up to the people and elected officials of South Carolina to decide whether they will give Mark another chance as well.''
 Mr. Sawyer said Mr. Sanford planned to spend the Fourth of July weekend in Florida with his wife and four sons. He restated that the governor, a Republican, did not intend to resign. 
 The governor revealed the affair on June 24, but he told The Associated Press early this week that his mistress, Maria Belen Chapur, was his ''soul mate'' and that he was trying to fall back in love with his wife. 
 After the interviews were published, several powerful Republican state senators called for Mr. Sanford's resignation, and in Washington, Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, strongly implied that he should resign. At least seven South Carolina newspapers have called for his resignation.
 At a news conference Thursday, Mr. Lloyd said that between an economic development trip to Brazil and Argentina a year ago, which is when the governor has said the affair turned sexual, and the governor's secret trip to Argentina over Father's Day weekend that led to his confession, Mr. Sanford saw his lover three times in New York. The trips were paid for by either the governor or a third party, Mr. Lloyd said. 
 In September, Mr. Lloyd said, Mr. Sanford visited Washington on a trip paid for by a third party, which the governor's staff later identified as the Republican Governors Association. From there he paid out of pocket to go to New York. He saw Ms. Chapur, and the next day he paid for Mrs. Sanford to join him there. In November, an overseas trip paid for by the governors association, of which Mr. Sanford was the chairman, stopped in New York, Mr. Lloyd said. And in February, Mr. Sanford flew to New York with Warren Culbertson, a spiritual adviser who was supposed to chaperone what had been intended to be the last meeting between the governor and Ms. Chapur. 
 Mr. Lloyd said the governor had paid for that trip out of pocket. The governor has reimbursed the state for the Argentina part of the economic trip in June 2008.
 Mr. Sanford's admission of an affair has apparently cost him a book deal. He had a contract to write about fiscal responsibility for Sentinel, a conservative imprint of Penguin Group USA. The book, to be titled ''Within Our Means,'' was scheduled for publication in March 2010.
 In a statement, Adrian Zackheim, Sentinel's publisher, said the company had agreed to release Mr. Sanford from his contract by ''a mutual decision.'' In 2000, the governor wrote a book about his stint as a congressman and on term limits. It was called ''The Trust Committed to Me.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. May Reinstate Rules For Short-Selling Stocks

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
They have been reviled as the bad hats of Wall Street, nefarious traders who cashed in on the market collapse and, some insist, helped precipitate it. 
 Now short-sellers, the market skeptics who correctly called last year's downturn, are coming under even more unwanted scrutiny, this time from federal regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission appears poised to reverse itself and reinstate rules that would make shorting stocks -- that is, betting their prices will decline -- somewhat more difficult. 
 Whether the S.E.C. will go far enough to satisfy the many critics of short-sellers is far from certain. The controversial role of these investors has divided not only the financial industry, but also federal regulators. As the S.E.C. considers its options, the debate is heating up. 
 Hedge funds and big pension funds argue that short-selling is vital to modern markets. Such trading not only enables investors to hedge their risks but also to ferret out weak companies or, as in the case of Enron, outright frauds. 
 But many banks, whose stocks came under attack last autumn, maintain that unfettered short-selling is dangerous. The shorts, their argument goes, helped bring down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers last year. 
 Many people on Wall Street and in Washington dismiss such claims, arguing that while short-sellers may have accelerated some stock declines, the real problem was the precarious state of the companies' own finances. 
 Given the climate in Washington, as well as the running suspicion of Wall Street, new rules seem inevitable, analysts say. Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the S.E.C., has said that considering new rules restricting short-selling is a priority. Members of Congress like Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House financial services committee, are calling for quick action. 
 For the moment, the most likely outcome may be for the S.E.C. to reinstate a rule that the commission itself abolished with a unanimous vote in 2007, under its previous chairman, Christopher S. Cox. Known as the uptick rule, it would bar investors from shorting a stock until its price ticks at least a penny above its previous trading price. 
 But current and former S.E.C. staff members appear to doubt that reinstating the uptick rule would have much of an effect on trading. Some say the change would be merely cosmetic. 
 ''The government wants a confidence measure right now, and that's all this is,'' said Lawrence E. Harris, a former S.E.C. chief economist. 
 Traders, he said, will simply find ways to circumvent the rule, but the commission probably will make the move if only to deflect outside pressure. 
 ''Every crisis requires action,'' he said. ''It's not worth fighting over.''
 In March, Mr. Frank urged Ms. Schapiro to reinstate the uptick rule. That same month, Senator Edward E. Kaufman, Democrat of Delaware, introduced a bipartisan bill to reinstate the rule, saying its demise in 2007 ''added fuel to the fire of distressed stocks and markets.'' 
 But a more radical solution -- a so-called circuit breaker that would halt trading in a stock for an entire day if its price fell by a certain percentage -- appears to be off the table. 
 The S.E.C. first enacted the uptick rule during the Depression, after the market crashed in 1937-38. It then voted to repeal the rule in mid-2007, after internal studies showed that removing the restrictions would not have a ''deleterious impact on market quality or liquidity.''
 To some, the issue is clear-cut. The American Bankers Association, a trade group representing the vast majority of American banks -- whose equity values have been especially battered in the last 18 months -- recently submitted an opinion in favor of reinstating the short-sale restrictions.
 Sally Miller, a spokesman for the A.B.A., said the member banks thought there was a clear link between the market turmoil and the rule change. 
 ''All of a sudden subsequent to 2007 they can see all their stocks going haywire,'' Ms. Miller said. ''It's cause and effect.''
 Traders and fund managers, however, say the rule is a part of a broader opposition to short-selling, a tool investors need to bring overvalued stocks back into line. Short-sales, they say, are a frequent scapegoat for companies of exaggerated fundamental strength. Others say that the rule will have little meaningful impact. ''I don't mind what I see as minor inconveniences,'' said Whitney Tilson, an author and managing partner of T2 Partners, ''if it will get rid of the critics who like to blame short-sellers every time a stock goes down.''
 Duncan Niederauer, the chief of NYSE Euronext, which runs the New York Stock Exchange, said in March that while ''there was no economic benefit'' from having the uptick rule, ''it would go a long way to adding confidence.''
 The exchange has since officially voiced its support. Joseph M. Mecane, the chief administrative officer for United States markets at the NYSE, said that the exchange was not trying to curb traders' ability to sell short but was wary of the ''kind of herd mentality'' that gripped the markets during the few most staggering days of the fourth quarter last year.
 ''You want some sort of a dampener in those periods,'' Mr. Mecane said, ''and let the stock breathe a bit.''

HEADLINE: A New Strategy On Illicit Work By Immigrants

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Immigration authorities had bad news this week for American Apparel, the T-shirt maker based in downtown Los Angeles: About 1,800 of its employees appeared to be illegal immigrants not authorized to work in the United States. 
 But in contrast to the high-profile raids that marked the enforcement approach of the Bush administration, no federal agents with criminal warrants stormed the company's factories and rounded up employees. Instead, the federal immigration agency sent American Apparel a written notice that it faced civil fines and would have to fire any workers confirmed to be unauthorized. 
 The treatment of American Apparel, which has more than 5,600 factory employees in Los Angeles alone, is the most prominent demonstration of a new strategy by the Obama administration to curb the employment of illegal immigrants by focusing on employers who hire them -- and doing so in a less confrontational manner than in years past.
 Unlike the approach of the Bush administration, which brought criminal charges in its final two years against many illegal immigrant workers, the new effort makes broader use of fines and other civil sanctions, federal officials said Thursday.
 Federal agents will concentrate on businesses employing large numbers of workers suspected of being illegal immigrants, the officials said, and will reserve tough criminal charges mostly for employers who serially hire illegal immigrants and engage in wage and labor violations.
 ''These actions underscore our commitment to targeting employers that cultivate illegal work forces by knowingly hiring and exploiting illegal workers,'' said Matt Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security.
 On Wednesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency known as ICE, said it had sent notices announcing audits of hiring records, like the one it conducted at American Apparel, to 652 other companies across the country. Officials said they were picking up the pace of such audits, after performing 503 of them in 2008. 
 The names of other companies that received notices have not been made public. American Apparel became a window into the new enforcement tactics because, as a publicly traded company, it issued a required notice on Wednesday about the hiring audit.
 The Obama administration's new approach, unveiled in April, seems to be moving away from the raids that advocates for immigrants said had split families, disrupted businesses and traumatized communities. But the outcome will still be difficult for illegal workers, who will lose their jobs and could face deportation, the advocates said. 
 Immigration officials have not made clear how they intend to deal with workers who are unable to prove their legal immigration status in the course of inspections, but they said there was no moratorium on deportations. 
 Executives at American Apparel were both relieved and dismayed after receiving the warning from the immigration agency of discrepancies in the hiring documents of about one-third of its Los Angeles work force. The company has 30 days to dispute the agency's claims and give immigrant employees time to prove that they are authorized to work in the United States, immigration officials said. If they cannot, the company must fire them, probably within two months. 
 But no criminal charges were lodged against the company and no workers have been arrested, American Apparel executives and immigration officials said. 
 The fines followed discussions over 18 months between federal officials and American Apparel, after immigration agents first inspected the company's files in January 2008, said Peter Schey, an immigration lawyer representing the company. Mr. Schey said a raid had been averted because the company cooperated with the audit and because immigration agents had not found any labor abuses. 
 ''There is no evidence of any exploitation of workers or violation of labor laws,'' he said. ''And there is not a single allegation that the company knowingly hired an undocumented worker.''
 American Apparel and its outspoken chief executive, Dov Charney, have waged a campaign, emblazoned on T-shirts sold across the country, criticizing the immigration crackdown of recent years and calling on Congress to ''Legalize L.A.'' by granting legal status to illegal immigrants. 
 Most garment workers in American Apparel's huge shop in Los Angeles work directly for the company, not for subcontractors, its records show. They earn at least $10 to $12 an hour, well above minimum wage, and receive health benefits. 
 At a news conference last year, Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles publicly lauded Mr. Charney for helping the city with its faltering economy by providing ''the dream of a steady paycheck and good benefits for countless workers.''
 While it has been no secret that American Apparel's largely Latino work force probably included many illegal immigrants, Mr. Schey said the company had been careful to meet legal hiring requirements. Many illegal immigrants use convincingly forged Social Security cards or other fake documents when seeking work. 
 In a statement, Mr. Charney said that many of his workers cited by the immigration agency were ''responsible, hard-working employees'' who had been with the company for more than a decade. Mr. Charney, an immigrant from Canada, said he hoped they would be able to prove their legal status. But because of the recession, the company said, it will not be hurt financially if it has to replace them.
 Mr. Schey said the hiring audit at American Apparel had been ''professionally done.'' By contrast, Mr. Schey has brought more than 100 damage claims against the immigration agency on behalf of American citizens who said they were illegally arrested last year in Los Angeles in an immigration raid at a different company, Micro Solutions Enterprises. 
 Immigration officials, who asked not to be identified because the case is continuing, said the fines to American Apparel so far were about $150,000.
 Kelly A. Nantel, a spokeswoman for the immigration agency, said it had taken steps to limit negotiations with employers that in the past had resulted in steep reductions in fines the employers ultimately paid.
 Representative Brian P. Bilbray, a California Republican who heads an immigration caucus in the House, said the amount of the fines was crucial.
 ''If this is a truly conscientious effort to get tough with employers to say the days are over of profiteering with illegal immigrants, that's fine,'' said Mr. Bilbray, who opposes any effort to give legal status to illegal immigrants. ''But if the fine will be so low that it's just part of doing business, there's no deterrent.'' 
 Angelica Salas, the executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, an advocacy group, said she welcomed the end to ''showboat enforcement raids.'' But in the end, Ms. Salas said, ''there is still enforcement of laws that are broken,'' adding, ''The workers will still lose their jobs.''

HEADLINE: Coffers Empty, California Pays With I.O.U.'s

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
An ever-widening budget gap joined with intractable political paralysis to deliver California its biggest fiscal blow in decades on Thursday, when the state's controller began printing i.o.u.'s in lieu of cash to pay taxpayers, vendors and local governments. 
 It was only the second time the state had adopted the emergency payment method since the Great Depression. The National Conference of State Legislatures had no record of any other state's ever using them.
 It was unclear whether the i.o.u.'s, known as warrants, would be accepted by all of the banks in California, which were caught off guard by the move and seemed hesitant to entrust the state to repay the them -- at an interest rate of 3.75 percent -- in October, as promised.
 The controller, John Chiang, issued 28,742 warrants totaling $53.3 million. If state lawmakers fail to reach a budget agreement by the end of August, the amount would grow to $4.8 billion. 
 While the emergency move resulted from California's combination of outsized budget gaps, unusual budget rules and a morass of financial obligations approved at the polls, the action was seen as a warning flag to other states that have failed to close their budgets this fiscal year because of the economic downturn. 
 ''In the past, there haven't been many opportunities for states to have to issue them,'' Brian Sigritz, a staff associate at the National Association of State Budget Officers, said of the i.o.u.'s. ''But now some other states may have to look at it.''
 So far, other states with lingering budget holes have tried different methods: Connecticut, for instance, has a temporary budget under executive order, and Pennsylvania is considering partial payments to employees. 
 In California's misery, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, has found some opportunity in standing his ground. Mr. Schwarzenegger has not only refused to sign off on stopgap measures like those proposed this week by Democratic lawmakers, but has also demanded that lawmakers adopt substantive changes in policy as part of any budget deal. 
 Democrats indicated Thursday that they were beginning to submit to Mr. Schwarzenegger's demands, taking proposed tax increases that he opposes off the table as they worked to close a budget gap estimated to have grown to $27 billion.
 H. D. Palmer, spokesman for the California Finance Department, said Mr. Schwarzenegger had called the i.o.u.'s ''the short-term consequence of not getting a long-term solution.'' 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger, weighing the discomfort and embarrassment of the i.o.u.'s against a short-term budget deal, apparently reached the conclusion that the i.o.u.'s were a price worth paying to force policy changes he pushed as early as 2005, even if it meant the budget crisis dragged on. 
 Among the changes Mr. Schwarzenegger insists be included in a budget agreement are the fingerprinting of recipients of certain state services for the poor and infirm, tighter checks on the job status of those who receive welfare benefits and changes to the state pension program.
 ''The governor is playing brinksmanship in the middle of the most serious economic crisis since the '30s with possible consequences for the nation's recovery as a whole,'' said Bruce Cain, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger and state lawmakers repeatedly failed to agree on how to close the budget hole by the start of the fiscal year on Wednesday. 
 So California is now just like a family that spends more than it takes in and holds off on the cable bill while paying the mortgage: its expenses are greater than its revenues. The state, which previously used i.o.u.'s in 1992 and 1933, will issue them rather than checks to those it can get away with not immediately paying. 
 Most warrants will go to Californians waiting for tax refunds, vendors doing business with the state and local governments, especially in social service areas. Federal and state laws prohibit i.o.u.'s from being issued to state employees, schools or Medicaid recipients. 
 While it is against federal law for a state to declare bankruptcy, California's move Thursday will not go unnoticed by Wall Street or escape consequences. 
 The state's credit rating is already shaky, and any further downgrades from rating agencies could send interest rates on its bonds soaring, forcing deeper service cuts. 
 Furthermore, if California comes up short on cash this fall, other creditors will have to wait behind the warrant holders, who would most likely end up in superior credit positions.
 In a news conference here Thursday, Mr. Schwarzenegger did not apologize for the state of California's fiscal affairs and instead stood defiantly against the people he had alternatively battled and wooed for the better part of six years -- chiefly Democratic lawmakers, public employee unions and so-called special interests.
 ''At the end of the day, they haven't accomplished anything,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said, speaking of an effort by the Legislature to stave off the i.o.u.'s with stopgap measures to cut education financing. ''So I sent the budget back, doing it forcefully and without any hesitation.''
 Lawmakers, who plan to work over the weekend and into next week to resolve the budget, were beyond peeved by Mr. Schwarzenegger's stance but said they would try to resolve the problems without tax increases and would consider his policy reform measures.
 ''We did everything in our power to avert the i.o.u.'s,'' Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tempore of the State Senate, said in a news conference in Sacramento. ''This was a strategic move by the governor and the Senate Republicans.'' 
 Mr. Steinberg called Mr. Schwarzenegger's comments in Los Angeles ''stale rhetoric.'' 
 On Thursday, a few banks -- including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Bank of the West -- indicated they would accept the i.o.u.'s but only through the middle of the month. The California Bankers Association offered less-than-overwhelming optimism that more banks would step up, citing the technical difficulties in managing the warrants coupled with fear of getting paid in early October, when the warrants are to mature. If California's fiscal situation significantly improved before then, however, the state could repay the warrants earlier at a lower rate.
 ''In evaluating potential registered warrant acceptance, banks have been advised by regulatory authorities to consider such issues as credit quality, capital requirements and concentration limits,'' the bankers' association president, Rod Brown, said in a statement. ''Given the poor credit rating of California, the worst in the nation, banks may be hesitant to extend credit to the state.''
 At the White House, which has seemed flummoxed by California's woes, President Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said Thursday, ''We're going to continue to watch the situation in California and in other states throughout the country.''

HEADLINE: That '30s Show

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
O.K., Thursday's jobs report settles it. We're going to need a bigger stimulus. But does the president know that?
 Let's do the math.
 Since the recession began, the U.S. economy has lost 6 1/2 million jobs -- and as that grim employment report confirmed, it's continuing to lose jobs at a rapid pace. Once you take into account the 100,000-plus new jobs that we need each month just to keep up with a growing population, we're about 8 1/2 million jobs in the hole. 
 And the deeper the hole gets, the harder it will be to dig ourselves out. The job figures weren't the only bad news in Thursday's report, which also showed wages stalling and possibly on the verge of outright decline. That's a recipe for a descent into Japanese-style deflation, which is very difficult to reverse. Lost decade, anyone? 
 Wait -- there's more bad news: the fiscal crisis of the states. Unlike the federal government, states are required to run balanced budgets. And faced with a sharp drop in revenue, most states are preparing savage budget cuts, many of them at the expense of the most vulnerable. Aside from directly creating a great deal of misery, these cuts will depress the economy even further.
 So what do we have to counter this scary prospect? We have the Obama stimulus plan, which aims to create 3 1/2 million jobs by late next year. That's much better than nothing, but it's not remotely enough. And there doesn't seem to be much else going on. Do you remember the administration's plan to sharply reduce the rate of foreclosures, or its plan to get the banks lending again by taking toxic assets off their balance sheets? Neither do I.
 All of this is depressingly familiar to anyone who has studied economic policy in the 1930s. Once again a Democratic president has pushed through job-creation policies that will mitigate the slump but aren't aggressive enough to produce a full recovery. Once again much of the stimulus at the federal level is being undone by budget retrenchment at the state and local level.
 So have we failed to learn from history, and are we, therefore, doomed to repeat it? Not necessarily -- but it's up to the president and his economic team to ensure that things are different this time. President Obama and his officials need to ramp up their efforts, starting with a plan to make the stimulus bigger.
 Just to be clear, I'm well aware of how difficult it will be to get such a plan enacted.
 There won't be any cooperation from Republican leaders, who have settled on a strategy of total opposition, unconstrained by facts or logic. Indeed, these leaders responded to the latest job numbers by proclaiming the failure of the Obama economic plan. That's ludicrous, of course. The administration warned from the beginning that it would be several quarters before the plan had any major positive effects. But that didn't stop the chairman of the Republican Study Committee from issuing a statement demanding: ''Where are the jobs?''
 It's also not clear whether the administration will get much help from Senate ''centrists,'' who partially eviscerated the original stimulus plan by demanding cuts in aid to state and local governments -- aid that, as we're now seeing, was desperately needed. I'd like to think that some of these centrists are feeling remorse, but if they are, I haven't seen any evidence to that effect.
 And as an economist, I'd add that many members of my profession are playing a distinctly unhelpful role. 
 It has been a rude shock to see so many economists with good reputations recycling old fallacies -- like the claim that any rise in government spending automatically displaces an equal amount of private spending, even when there is mass unemployment -- and lending their names to grossly exaggerated claims about the evils of short-run budget deficits. (Right now the risks associated with additional debt are much less than the risks associated with failing to give the economy adequate support.)
 Also, as in the 1930s, the opponents of action are peddling scare stories about inflation even as deflation looms.
 So getting another round of stimulus will be difficult. But it's essential.
 Obama administration economists understand the stakes. Indeed, just a few weeks ago, Christina Romer, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, published an article on the ''lessons of 1937'' -- the year that F.D.R. gave in to the deficit and inflation hawks, with disastrous consequences both for the economy and for his political agenda.
 What I don't know is whether the administration has faced up to the inadequacy of what it has done so far. 
 So here's my message to the president: You need to get both your economic team and your political people working on additional stimulus, now. Because if you don't, you'll soon be facing your own personal 1937.

HEADLINE: Europe's Central Bank Holds Rate Steady

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank left its main interest rate steady for the second consecutive month on Thursday, appearing to adopt a wait-and-see approach to additional stimulus.
 In recent months, the bank has reduced its main refinancing rate, to 1 percent in May from 4.25 percent in October, cut its other policy rates and announced unconventional steps to try to bolster bank lending and lift economic activity. Major initiatives now appear unlikely unless the financial crisis reintensifies, as the bank assesses whether the much-discussed ''green shoots'' in recent data releases will wither or take root.
''We do not envisage anything at the present moment,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank's president, said at a news conference after a meeting of the Governing Council in Luxembourg. ''Of course we continue to monitor the situation very, very closely.'' 
 He described the level of interest rates as appropriate and said the decision to hold them steady was unanimous.
 George Magnus, senior economic adviser at UBS in London, said, ''What they've done so far looks pretty much complete.'' 
 ''The remaining issues for the euro area look to be outside their remit,'' he added, referring to the need for further recapitalization of banks, particularly in Germany, where the process seems to be lagging behind that of the United States. 
 The central bank chief reiterated his call for financial institutions to strengthen their capital bases, either via the market or by taking full advantage of the various government programs. 
 Asked about unwinding the stimulus, Mr. Trichet said merely that policies had been ''designed to permit an easy exit strategy.'' 
 Mr. Trichet said recent data had ''broadly confirmed our previous expectations'' that activity would decline over the remainder of 2009, but at a slower rate than was seen during the first quarter.
 As part of its stimulus measures, the central bank will initiate a 60 billion euro ($84 billion) program of buying covered bonds -- securities created from either mortgage loans or public sector loans -- from Monday until the end of June 2010. The program will focus on bonds with a minimum rating of AA and a minimum size of 500 million euros, in the three- to 10-year sector. 
 The bank did not rule out accepting some assets originating outside the euro area. In a separate operation, the central bank also said last week that it would extend one-year loans of more than 442 billion euros to banks at 1 percent interest as it sought to thaw lending in the 16 countries that use the euro.
 The allotment was the largest ever by the European monetary authorities and the first time the bank had offered refinancing loans for a 12-month period.
 The European statistics agency, Eurostat, said this week that prices in the region fell 0.1 percent in June from a year earlier, the first such decline since the euro was created in 1999. Prices in May were unchanged from a year earlier.
 That decline was anticipated, reflecting base effects resulting from past swings in global commodity prices, Mr. Trichet said, adding that the negative inflation rate would be short-lived. 
 Eurostat also said Thursday that the industrial producer price index -- a broad gauge of price pressure within industry -- fell 0.2 percent in the euro zone in May from the previous month.
 Data released on Wednesday showed that German retail sales increased by 0.4 percent in May from a month earlier, after being adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings and excluding car sales. And the purchasing managers index for the euro zone's manufacturing sector -- a gauge of business activity --rose for the fourth month, climbing to 42.6 in June, from 40.7 in May.
 Still, Eurostat said the recovery had yet to filter through to the labor market. For May, the unemployment rate in the euro area rose to 9.5 percent -- the highest level in a decade -- from 9.3 percent in April, it said.

HEADLINE: For Banks, Wads of Cash and Loads of Trouble

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and ANDREW MARTIN

DATELINE: MACON, Ga. 

 BODY:
H. Averett Walker used hot money to turn Security Bank from a sleepy Southern lender into a regional powerhouse. Darrell D. Pittard used hot money to jump-start his brand-new MagnetBank, allowing it to lend hundreds of millions of dollars even though it did not have a single drive-up window or even a customer with a checking account.
 It is a formula being replicated at banks across the United States.
Rather than simply wooing local customers, they have turned to out-of-state brokers who deliver billions of dollars in bulk deposits, widely known as ''hot money,'' from investors nationwide. In fast-growing regions like this one in central Georgia, the money produced record bank profits and financed whole new communities, built at a phenomenal rate. 
 But the hot money also came with a high cost. To lure the money from brokers, banks typically had to offer unusually high rates. That, in turn, often led them to make ever riskier loans, leaving them vulnerable when the economy collapsed. Magnet failed early this year and Security Bank is barely hanging on.
 Though few people have heard of it, hot money -- or brokered deposits, as it is also known in the industry -- is one of the primary factors in the accelerating wave of failures among small and regional banks nationwide. The estimated cost to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over the last 18 months is $7.7 billion, and growing. 
 Hot money has bedeviled regulators for three decades and they are starting to fight back, albeit tentatively, devising new restrictions to keep the practice from taking more banks down. But in one of the hidden lobbying battles in Washington this year, the banks are pushing hard to keep the money flowing.
 So far the banks are winning, and the hot money continues to fuel bank growth. The industry has even invented variants to get around the few rules that have been put in place by regulators. 
 Banks defend the use of brokered deposits as an important tool to bring in money to help communities grow. But even some industry executives acknowledge that certain banks became too dependent on the deposits, and that this abuse caused banks to fail. The consequences can be seen across the country.
 The 79 banks that have failed in the United States over the last two years had an average load of brokered deposits four times the national norm, according to an analysis performed for The New York Times by Foresight Analytics, an industry research firm based in California. And a third of the failed banks, the analysis shows, had both an unusually high level of brokered deposits and an extremely high growth rate -- often a disastrous recipe for banks.
 The data also shows that the problem isn't likely to go away. The 371 still-operating banks on Foresight's ''watch list'' as of March held brokered deposits that, on average, were twice the norm. Even this year, in the depth of the recession, a number of struggling banks have been piling up hot money in a desperate effort to survive.
 It is the same mix -- rapid increases in hot money and heavy lending for risky real estate development -- that brought down many of the savings and loans in the late 1980s. 
 Warnings and Resistance
 Regulators now acknowledge that they saw the warning signs during the most recent boom, but failed to take aggressive action. ''We went through this golden age of banking and I just think that everybody lost their compass,'' said Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 Their indifference has been costly. Even brokered deposits are insured, up to $250,000 for each customer account. But once a bank fails, these deposits become an albatross to the F.D.I.C., which often looks for a healthy bank to take over the failed bank. Most new owners refuse to accept the brokered money -- it doesn't bring branches or real customers -- forcing the F.D.I.C. to repay it. The fight over brokered deposits, though far less public than other struggles over the nation's regulatory system, is one of many in Washington that will help determine the shape of industries ravaged by the economic crisis.
 To make their case, a delegation of nearly 50 Georgia bankers assembled at the F.D.I.C.'s headquarters in May to plead with regulators to ease restrictions on brokered deposits.
 ''It is a bullet to their head,'' Joe Brannen, president of the Georgia Bankers Association, recalled members of the group telling senior agency officials. ''This is insanity.''
 Brokered deposits, industry players and regulators agree, are not inherently a bad thing. Many institutions have relied on brokered deposits for years without troubles. Without brokered deposits, small regional banks in fast-growing parts of the country would not have been able to keep up with the demand for construction loans. 
 The brokers receive much of the money from investment firms like Merrill Lynch, which are looking to park high-interest certificates of deposits they have sold to clients. Merrill customers get two things out of the arrangement: high returns on their investments and a haven because the money is placed in a bank insured by the F.D.I.C. One brokerage firm, Finance 500, in Irvine, Calif., started a hot money program in 1997 with seven bank customers. A decade later, it delivered $14 billion to more than 1,500 banks. 
 But the money is volatile. It can be easily shifted from one bank to another as brokers seek the highest interest rates. Thus the term hot money.
 Some banks prosper by supplementing their accounts with these deposits, but try not to rely too much on them because the interest payments are high and the brokers can be fickle. ''It's simple, really,'' Michael Hobbs, the chief executive of First Commercial Bank in Missouri wrote to the F.D.I.C. late last year, in defending the industry's practices. ''If brokered deposits are managed accordingly, they provide a safe alternative funding source.''
 But William M. Isaac, chairman of the F.D.I.C. from 1981 to 1985, said he became wary nearly three decades ago after watching the spectacular fall of Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City, which had grown astronomically by gorging on brokered deposits. Alarmed by the practice, Mr. Isaac moved to eliminate F.D.I.C. insurance for most brokered deposits -- a rule that provoked an industry revolt and was ultimately overturned. Congress later made a similar attempt, but it too was defeated. 
 ''I have a lot of scars on my back,'' Mr. Isaac said in an interview, recalling the fight over the rules. ''I don't have any doubt that tens of billions were lost in the S.& L. crisis because of brokered deposits. And we were on our way to shutting that practice down.''
 By 1991, Congress prohibited weak banks from obtaining brokered deposits unless they were adequately capitalized. But because approximately 97 percent of the banks in the United States are considered ''well capitalized,'' the limit has little impact. Three years later, the F.D.I.C. watered down that rule by repealing the requirement that banks looking to grow rapidly with brokered deposits seek special permission from the agency. 
 The Frenzy in Georgia
 The risks and rewards of brokered deposits played out visibly here in Georgia, where a red-hot real estate market in metropolitan Atlanta drove a lending frenzy that was heavily financed by hot money. 
 Mr. Pittard built MagnetBank solely on brokered deposits, eschewing even traditional branches. ''It was very simple,'' he said. ''It was clean.'' And the F.D.I.C. approved it. 
 The bank was chartered in Utah, but did much of its lending in Georgia. When the real estate market here turned in 2007, many borrowers fell behind and Magnet began to crumble. Its failure in January 2009 cost the F.D.I.C. an estimated $129 million.
 Magnet is the extreme example: 100 percent of its deposits were brokered. The story of Security Bank is more typical of the risks.
 For years it stayed out of the brokered deposit trade. Mr. Walker, its president and chief, who was known to everyone here in Macon as Rett, bragged to the newspaper about how much he valued local customers.
 ''The more accounts they have with you -- from a child's savings account to a safety deposit box -- the more loyal the customer is and less likely to leave,'' Mr. Walker said in 2001, the same year he dressed up in a tuxedo shirt and jacket, jeans and boots to cook up a quail dinner for employees at a branch that had met a sales goal.
 But even as he spoke, suburban Atlanta was booming, and Security wanted to take advantage. 
 It bought small banks to ramp up its lending. But that did not satisfy its ambitions, government records show. So, despite Mr. Walker's faith in small depositors, Security called the brokers. 
 At the start of the decade, Security held just $693,000 in brokered deposits. By last year it had $798 million, or 33 percent of its overall deposit base. 
 It transformed the bank.
 To attract the wholesalers, Security had to offer interest rates that, as of 2007, averaged 5.28 percent, or 20 percent higher than what local banking customers got. 
 To generate the profits to pay such rates, Security began concentrating its lending in the riskiest corners of the market: acquisition of raw land and construction of housing developments. These loans can bring higher profits from fees and higher interest rates. In 1999, construction lending was 8 percent of Security's loan portfolio. By 2007, it peaked at 53 percent, including prominent projects like converting 230 acres of a former plantation into an upscale new neighborhood called the Highlands. 
 For a while, the hot money strategy seemed to be working; Security's profits soared, as did its stock price. Then the economy went sour. Now Mr. Walker has been forced out of his job, and the bank acknowledges it is struggling to survive. It built itself a sprawling new headquarters here in Macon, but it is no longer putting its name atop the tower. Instead, it is trying to find someone to lease the empty space. The Highlands project, like many others it financed, sits unfinished.
 Thomas D. Woodbery, the bank's senior vice president, defended the strategy as a ''proven and reliable'' way to get more money for loans. But he said the bank was now reducing its allowance on brokered deposits -- under orders from the F.D.I.C., which only in April placed heavy restrictions on Security by issuing a cease-and-desist order. 
 Through this hot-money explosion, the regulators largely watched from the sidelines, offering warnings at times, but declining to intervene forcefully, officials in Washington now acknowledge. The F.D.I.C. allowed many banks that lost their ''well capitalized'' status to keep taking brokered deposits, approving waivers for about 65 percent of the applicants over the last five years. 
 ''Don't get in the way, don't take away the punch bowl,'' Ms. Bair said, describing the approach taken by regulators, including her own agency. 
 Regulation Battles
 At the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, part of the Treasury Department, bank examiners in 2005 found that ANB Financial of Arkansas relied heavily on brokered deposits to fuel rapid growth, an audit shows. Yet the regulators did not take ''forceful action'' for two more years, the audit says, just before ANB was shut down.
 At the Office of Thrift Supervision -- a Treasury agency that President Obama wants to eliminate -- regulators advised BankUnited of Coral Gables, Fla., to backdate financial records, allowing it to continue to lure brokered deposits, the department's inspector general reported in May 2009.
 In recent years, even some brokers became concerned about the dependence on hot money that certain banks had developed, said Paul T. Clark, an industry lawyer in Washington. They shared those concerns with regulators at the F.D.I.C. last year, hoping to head off a crackdown. ''We looked at this and we were very nervous,'' he said. ''We are going to get blamed because these banks failed. It is not our fault. Where were the regulators?''
 Looking back on the reluctance to slow the growth, Timothy W. Long, chief national bank examiner in the comptroller's office, asked: ''When do you tap on the brakes versus slamming on the brakes? It is a hard thing to do sometimes, particularly when management is pushing back hard.''
 Late last year, the F.D.I.C. proposed a new rule. Banks that rely too heavily on brokered deposits to accelerate their growth will have to pay a higher insurance premium to help cover losses if they fail. The proposed limit was 10 percent brokered deposits and a growth rate of 20 percent over four years.
 Just as it did in the early 1980s, industry opposition emerged almost overnight. 
 ''Brokered' is not a 4-letter word!'' Dennis M. King, chief credit officer of North County Bank in Washington State, wrote in one of hundreds of letters the agency received condemning Ms. Bair's plan. ''They are especially important to community banks in our present economic environment.''
 The banks won important concessions. The regulator relaxed the part of the rule that required higher premiums if banks grew too fast with brokered deposits, allowing a growth rate of up to 40 percent over four years. And it left open a loophole that lets banks -- even those considered unsound -- turn to a ''listing service,'' a source of hot money by another name. Instead of paying a broker, banks pay to subscribe to an electronic bulletin board of credit unions with money to park.
 One listing service, QwickRate, based in Marietta, Ga., has just 18 employees crammed into a tiny second-floor office. But it delivered $1.6 billion in hot money to banks in May, up from $450 million last May. The growth is coming partly because banks on the edge of failure are coming to the service for a lifeline. 
 Bank regulators are just learning how popular these unregulated services have suddenly become -- and are already worried that they will be the next source of hot money abuses. 
 Ms. Bair said she planned to ask Congress for greater powers to limit the role of hot money in banking -- be it brokered deposits, listing services or simply Internet sales by banks offering unusually high interest rates. 
 ''We have seen the error of our ways,'' she said.

A12) CHARTS: The Rise of Brokered Deposits: The use of brokered deposits, in which banks pay brokers to bring in large chunks of money from investors who typically receive higher-than-average interest rates, has grown rapidly since 1999. Banks that have failed since September 2007 relied disproportionately on brokered deposits, grew faster than their peers and lent more to high-risk real estate projects.
Growth and Risk at One Georgia Bank: At Security Bank, based in Macon, Ga., brokered deposits jumped to one-third of all deposits by 2008, helping fuel rapid growth. At the same time, construction and land loans -- with potentially high reward but also high risk -- surged. (Sources: Call Reports

HEADLINE: After U.S. Jobs Data, Subdued Trading in Asia and Europe

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
European stock markets traded in a narrow range Friday as investors caught their breath after big losses the day before on American jobs data. Wall Street's closure for the Independence Day holiday kept trading volumes exceptionally light. 
 The FTSE 100 index in London closed up 2.01 points, or 0.1 percent, at 4,236.28, while the DAX in Frankfurt fell 10.28 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,708.21. The CAC-40 in Paris was 3.10 points, or 0.1 percent, higher at 3,119.51.
 Earlier, Asian markets mostly fell but the losses were tame compared with those recorded on Wall Street on Thursday after the payrolls data, which showed that American employers slashed 467,000 jobs in June -- 100,000 more than anticipated.
 That was also the first increase in monthly job losses since January.
 ''Yesterday's U.S. jobs data contained plenty of bad news and put a big question mark over the 'green shoot' thesis that we are through the worst and that economic recovery is around the corner,'' said Neil Mackinnon, chief economist at ECU Group.
 Equities rose from the middle of March until the start of June in the hope that the American economy in particular would recover from recession sooner than anticipated. Many investors saw stock valuations as particularly cheap and started buying. But bad economic news over the last few weeks brought an abrupt end to the rally and altered the general mood prevailing among investors.
 Nevertheless, stocks around the world still managed to achieve one of the best quarters in years during the second quarter. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the United States rose about 16 percent during the quarter, its best performance since 1998, amid hopes of a global recovery despite worries about the banking system, public finances and the length and depth of the recession.
 Trading was subdued as the United States had a day off ahead of Saturday's Independence Day celebrations and many people in London were more focused on the Wimbledon tennis championships semifinals, where Andy Murray, a Scotsman, faced the American Andy Roddick, than on the market. 
 ''With New York shut for Independence Day, the boys and girls in equity trading rooms are levitating two inches above the carpet in anticipation of the two Andys swapping rackets at 50 paces,'' said David Buik, a markets analyst at BGC Partners, ''and care little about the vagaries of the marketplace.''
 Earlier, the Nikkei 225 stock average in Tokyo dropped 60.08 points, or 0.6 percent, to 9,816.07, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong closed up 25.35 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,203.40 after trading in the red most of the day.
 Australia's index fell 1.4 percent, and Singapore's main index finished down 1 percent.
 China's Shanghai composite index was largely flat. In Korea, the Kospi rebounded to close up 0.6 percent.
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 96 yen, while the euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3992.

HEADLINE: For Soccer to Flourish in the U.S., Its Doors Must Open

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In the aftermath of a strong performance by the national team in the Confederations Cup, U.S. Soccer officials are confident that the sport's time has arrived here. 
 They are excited about the prospect of bringing young Hispanic and African-Americans into the mainstream. But any discussion about the future of soccer in the United States is like turning over a gigantic stone that has been in place for decades. Underneath is a colony of issues, involving race, ethnicity and economics.
 Talking about attracting a new demographic to soccer is fine, but the reality is, the cost of participation puts soccer beyond the reach of many. As in so many other sports, we have created a system that produces not so much the best players, but the best players who can afford to play. 
 ''One of the issues we have in the United States is that elite-level soccer at a youth level is and has been for the most part pay to play,'' said Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation. ''Clearly then, when you are talking about economically disadvantaged inner city, you've got a problem.''
 The challenge of attracting Hispanics and African-Americans is vastly different. Young Latinos have already embraced soccer. The issue is bringing them into federation programs, ''knowing where they are and identifying them,'' Gulati said.
 ''African-Americans,'' he said, ''represent longer-term challenges because soccer is not as popular in the same way.''
 The challenges soccer faces are not new, but perhaps more can be done at a time when football and basketball have saturated poorer neighborhoods. The question is how to persuade young athletes to make soccer their sport of choice. 
 ''If we can get the star athletes when they are 13, 14, 15, 16 to stay with soccer rather than play other sports where the economic payday down the road may be greater, that would be a plus for us,'' Gulati said. ''If we can get the best athlete interested in soccer, that's a plus. We've got to do more in that community.''
 Irv Smalls, the executive director of Harlem Youth Soccer, said the key to tapping the raw resources of economically disadvantaged communities was supporting local youth leagues. These leagues, he said, must become part of the social fabric of the community, as natural a part of life as the corner grocery store.
 Smalls was part of the traditional sports pipeline. He grew up in Pennsylvania and played football for three seasons at Penn State. Before Harlem Youth Soccer, he worked for Major League Soccer, primarily to gain sports administration experience.
 After watching the 2002 World Cup, Smalls said, he became so turned on to the sport that he became dedicated to spreading the gospel of soccer in Harlem. It hasn't been easy and it hasn't been cheap, but Smalls is convinced that the only way the sport will blossom in communities like Harlem is if the teams are operated and run primarily by African-Americans.
 Harlem Youth Soccer was founded in 1990 by Dwight and Iris Raiford, who also founded Harlem Little League.
 ''We're the ones who really know what is in the best interest of our kids,'' Smalls said. ''It has to be a grass-roots initiative and the movement has to come from the inner city.''
 Luis Montoya, who founded the Big Apple Youth Soccer League in Queens 11 years ago, made a similar point about Hispanic youth. Local involvement, he said, is essential. 
 ''If you are a white man with blue eyes and you are coming to my Latino community, what do you think the parents of my kids are going to think about you?'' he said. ''The first question will be, What does the white guy want? If I go to the Latino community, I speak to them in their own language. There's a different approach.''
 Then there's Don Sheppard. ''I'm a different kind of Latino,'' Sheppard said. ''I'm Canadian.''
 Sheppard walked into a Hispanic community in Los Angeles four years ago with resources and a vision. He had just retired and sold his business, and he had a dream: He founded the Los Angeles Futbol Club, which has become one of the most highly regarded youth soccer leagues in the country.
 Sheppard eliminated the fees that most clubs use to support themselves but which also serve as barriers to wide participation.
 ''Some of the best soccer players, Latino youth, have been left out of the mainstream of soccer because they couldn't pay,'' Sheppard said. ''We changed that because we removed the pay-to-play. That's been a huge barrier.''
 Last year, the Los Angeles Futbol Club formed an alliance with Chelsea, a club in the English Premier League that has an alliance with two other youth clubs in the United States. Chelsea will provide additional financial support as well as coaching and, for some, an opportunity to train in England once a year.
 This is all well and good, but the key for soccer to be what it really can be in the United States is local initiative.
 ''We've got to build those leagues in the communities,'' Sheppard said, ''run by people that they trust, coached by people that they trust but supported by people like L.A.F.C., who want to help them get into soccer.''
 United States soccer officials say the sport's time is finally here. The question is, do they know how to seize the moment?

HEADLINE: European Union Proposes To Police Derivatives Trading

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The European Union called on Friday for the use of clearinghouses for some over-the-counter derivative trades to ''ensure they do not harm financial stability.'' 
 As part of a response to the global economic crisis, the European Union will also study shifting more trades to exchanges and consider the creation of a data warehouse to heighten the transparency of trades and to promote the standardization of contracts, the European Commission said.
 The proposals, which could lead to legislation later this year, are an attempt to cut risk in the $592 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. President Obama released a similar plan last month that would require standardized over-the-counter derivatives to be guaranteed by clearinghouses.
 ''From 10,000 feet it all looks fine, but for us what matters is how it looks much closer to the ground,'' Andre Allee, a derivatives lawyer at Simmons & Simmons in London, said in a telephone interview. ''It's really similar to what was proposed in the U.S. to the extent that it does look like there was coordination. Our clients are really happy with that.''
 The European Union plans come after Timothy F. Geithner, the United States Treasury secretary, sent a proposal to Congressional leaders laying out his plan to police over-the-counter derivatives trading, the unregulated market where swaps based on interest rates, currencies, commodities and a company's ability to pay back debt are exchanged.
 ''Derivatives markets play an important role in the economy, but the crisis has shown that they may harm financial stability,'' Charlie McCreevy, the European Union financial services commissioner, said in a statement Friday.
 Central counterparties ''have proven their worth during the financial crisis'' as illustrated by their role in managing the consequences of Lehman Brothers' default, the commission said.
 Standardization could be achieved by encouraging broader use of standard contracts and electronic affirmation and confirmation services, central storage, automation of payments and collateral management processes, the commission said.
 The creation of standardized contracts will be the main problem, said Karel Lannoo, chief executive of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ''There are thousands of products.''
 The commission said moving trades onto exchanges would improve price transparency and strengthen risk management.
 Still, the regulator said, this may ''come at a cost in terms of satisfying the wide diversity of trading and risk management needs.'' 
 Robert Pickel, chief executive of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, said that exchanges might ''remove flexibility'' for banks and institutional investors.
 ''Forcing bilateral participants to trade on an exchange or otherwise limiting the availability of customized risk management solutions, would be a step backwards,'' Mr. Pickel said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Congressional Race In California Draws A High-Profile Cast

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: WALNUT CREEK, Calif. 

 BODY:
With competitive races in Congress a rarity in California, the unexpected availability of a seat here has set off a sudden and furious chase, with at least a dozen candidates and a melange of political styles and personal storylines.
 California's 10th Congressional District, a sprawling inkblot made up of a collection of suburbs east of San Francisco, has been represented since 1997 by Ellen O. Tauscher, a Democrat who resigned after being confirmed on June 25 to a top post in the State Department.
The field to succeed her includes the lieutenant governor, two state lawmakers, a decorated Iraqi war veteran who is openly gay and a former newspaper reporter. And that does not even include the Republican candidates in this Democratic-leaning district. 
 The crush of hopefuls, said Henry Brady, a professor and dean of the public policy school at University of California, Berkeley, might stem in part from the diversity of the district, which extends from the liberal Bay Area to more conservative territory inland.
 ''These seats don't come available very much, and the reason is very simple: geography,'' Dr. Brady said. ''The Democrats are primarily on the coast, and the Republicans are in the Central Valley and the mountains, so it's very hard to build a competitive district. But this has the potential to be one.''
 The lieutenant governor, John Garamendi, is considered the early favorite to replace Ms. Tauscher. Mr. Garamendi, a Democrat who had considered running for governor next year, said he opted instead for Congress in large part because of the abbreviated campaign. A primary, followed by a special election, to complete Ms. Tauscher's term must be held within 126 days of the governor setting the date. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a proclamation Friday declaring Nov. 3 the date for the special election.
 ''I thought, How am I going to spend two valuable years of my life?'' said Mr. Garamendi, 64, who previously served as the deputy secretary of interior in the Clinton administration as well as the California's first elected insurance commissioner. ''Am I going spend two years dialing for dollars, or am I going to spend four months out ringing doorbells and campaigning person to person and the other 20 months working on issues?'' 
 Mr. Garamendi's principal challengers among the Democrats, some polls show, are State Senator Mark James DeSaulnier and Assemblywoman Joan Buchanan. Both were elected to their current posts last fall. 
 Mr. DeSaulnier, 57, is a former mayor, city councilman and assemblyman, who says his career comes in spite a devastating personal experience with politics: a scandal involving his father, Judge Edward J. DeSaulnier Jr., who was removed from the bench of the Massachusetts Superior Court and disbarred in 1972 after being accused of rigging a sentence for the Mafia. The older Mr. DeSaulnier was never charged with a crime but was disgraced nonetheless and committed suicide in 1989. 
 ''I've been very affected by my father's journey,'' said Mr. DeSaulnier, who worked as a restaurateur before running for office. ''And I've loved my public life.'' 
 Ms. Buchanan, 56, says she has practical and personal experience -- including raising five children -- and a successful career as an executive at a dental company. Like several of her Democratic opponents, Ms. Buchanan says the election of President Obama helped convince her that now was a prime time to run, despite her serving less than a year in the Assembly. 
 ''I think it's a good time to be a Democrat,'' she said. ''I believe many of the challenges we face are going to be solved in Washington, D.C.'' 
 The rest of the Democratic field is not as well known, though one candidate has attracted some national attention: Anthony Woods, a 28-year-old graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and a veteran of the Iraq war who was awarded the Bronze Star for two tours of duty. Shortly after his return from combat, while at Harvard working toward his master's degree, Captain Woods told military superiors that he is gay, resulting in an honorable discharge. 
 While considered a long shot for the Congressional seat, Mr. Woods would be the first openly gay black man in Congress, though he has been careful on the campaign trail to trumpet more than his sexuality.
 ''The first thing I talk to voters about is their priorities, universal health care and economic security,'' he said. ''I'm not hiding who I am, but they're just as interested in talking about the issues as I am.'' 
 Others in the Democratic field include Tiffany Attwood, a local planning commissioner and self-described ''mom who plays soccer'' -- do not call her a soccer mom -- and Adriel Hampton, a former reporter for The San Francisco Examiner who said he was entering politics because of a ''Howard Beale moment,'' referring to the fictional insane anchorman from the 1976 film ''Network.''
 ''I got tired of being objective,'' Mr. Hampton said. 
 Republicans have usually been solidly trounced by Ms. Tauscher since she first won election in 1996, including last year, when she won 65 percent of the vote over the Republican candidate, Nicholas Gerber, who won 31 percent. Mr. Gerber has said he might consider running again.
 Other Republican candidates include David Harmer, a lawyer and the son of a former California lieutenant governor, John Harmer; and Catherine Moy, a city councilwoman. 
 Dr. Brady, of the University of California, said the Democrats would probably retain Ms. Tauscher's seat, though the primary could be bruising. Mr. DeSaulnier, a divorced father of two boys, has already turned his attention to Mr. Garamendi, accusing him of not living in the district he seeks to represent. 
 It is an accusation that Mr. Garamendi, who says he lives in Walnut Grove on the district border, does not completely deny.
 ''My front yard is in the district,'' he said. ''My bedroom is not.''

HEADLINE: In Public Housing, Spreading Gospel of the Recycling Bin

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Wearing a purple sweatsuit and leaning on a cane, Gloria Allen, 82, was hobbling down a hallway in a public housing project in Morningside Heights, knocking on doors and shouting, ''Recycling education!''
 There was no answer at the next apartment, but as soon as she detected movement inside, Ms. Allen, a retired printing-company worker, began her pitch.
 ''Please come out, baby,'' she purred. ''Please come out so we can educate you on how to recycle.'' 
 The typical neighborhood environmentalist is often pictured as young and affluent, the kind of person who can afford a hybrid car and screen-printed hemp fabrics. But at General Grant Houses, a sprawling public housing development off West 125th Street in Manhattan, the eco-conscious are mainly people like Ms. Allen and Sarah Martin, who as leaders of the residents' association fret as much about backed-up pipes as they do about recycling.
 Proselytizing on the issue in housing projects is an enormous challenge but crucial, environmentalists say, given the incentive to cut back on energy and garbage disposal costs and a housing authority's power to impose recycling rules building by building. 
 In New York, the incentive may be greatest of all. Only 17 percent of the city's household waste makes it into recycling bins, and New York has the largest public housing system in the country, with 2,600 buildings, 174,000 apartments and more than 400,000 residents in five boroughs.
 Yet the effort initiated by Ms. Allen and Ms. Martin originated as a grass-roots crusade of their own. 
 Margarita Lopez, the city housing agency's environmental coordinator, said that residents who step up and organize the efforts defy cynical cliches about public housing. ''There are people who think we're not able to do this, who look at public housing as second-class citizens,'' she said. ''People would be surprised about how in tune the residents are.''
 Polls show that concern about the environment is sometimes broadest in low-income communities because residents bear the brunt of problems like air pollution. 
 Ms. Allen and Ms. Martin say they see recycling as a way to address the health and quality-of-life issues associated with trash, including the emissions from abundant garbage-truck pickups. 
 ''If we could reduce the amount of garbage in our community, it would reduce the diesel in the air,'' said Ms. Martin, 72, a former medical assistant and school food preparation manager who wears hoop earrings under a baseball cap.
 So she and Ms. Allen, who each live alone but have 6 children, 14 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren between them, have taken time from their full plate of tenant complaints to introduce, or reintroduce, the development's 4,500 denizens to recycling, building by building. 
 While recycling is required by law, it had failed to take root at General Grant because the bins were not conveniently located and residents found it easy to ignore recycling signs, the women say. 
 Education is crucial, they insist, so they recruit volunteers and train them in which kinds of metal, glass and plastic items can be recycled. Then they guide them from door to door, distributing color-coded bags as they impart the fundamentals to neighbors who can be welcoming, indifferent or hostile.
 ''It's not easy,'' Ms. Martin said. ''It's not like you slap a flier on a door and say: 'Recycle. It's the law.' It takes time, patience and energy.'' 
 Some residents refuse to budge when Ms. Allen and Ms. Martin knock. And some object to their campaign. During one of their rounds, they were berated by a neighbor who insisted that recycling bins would attract vermin and should not be placed in front of the buildings.
 ''People are going to put garbage in there,'' the neighbor warned.
 But many readily embrace the effort. ''This saves public housing work and money and it contributes to the general hygiene,'' said Jose Morales, 51, an unemployed plumber and widower with two children who correctly chose a green recycling bag when Ms. Allen tested him with a flattened cereal box.
 On other environmental fronts, efforts are under way by the city housing authority to make the apartment units more energy-efficient, using federal stimulus money to replace old boilers, water heaters and appliances. More than two dozen resident ''green committees'' have also been formed to help with projects like planting trees and recruiting workers for green jobs.
 The recycling project at General Grant Houses got under way in 2007 under the auspices of the Morningside Heights/West Harlem Sanitation Coalition, a partnership that was founded in 1994 when residents of Grant and nearby co-ops realized they shared the same problems, from uneven trash collection to substandard grocery stores. 
 Ms. Martin and Joan Levine, an 80-year-old former teacher from Morningside Gardens, a six-building co-op just across the street on Amsterdam Avenue, are the coalition's co-chairwomen.
 Ms. Levine, who wears her gray hair in a Beatles bob and carries a handbag made of recycled juice box labels, said she was motivated partly by a resolve to confound stereotypes. ''I've heard comfortable white middle-class people say, 'Oh, public housing. They'll never recycle. They don't care,' '' she said. ''That really galled me because that wasn't the case.''
 Two years into the recycling program, General Grant Houses has five buildings down, one in training and three more to go. It has also evolved from a grass-roots effort into a pilot program with city and state financing that the city housing authority plans to expand to other residential projects.
 Ms. Martin and Ms. Allen report promising results in the five buildings that are already recycling. Each now produces at least 10 fewer bags of trash a day, they said. Residents no longer leave mousetraps or car tires in recycling bins, as they did in the past when the city instituted recycling without an education program.
 As president and vice president of the residents' association, the two women also organize collections of electronic waste, from computers to TV sets, and lead workshops on topics like nontoxic cleaning products. Next on their agenda is finding a way to pay a stipend to resident monitors who will make sure that only recyclables go into the bins.
 While they have to plead with the city to fix broken door locks and drafty windows, Ms. Martin said, ''recycling we can control.''
 ''We don't need to have a million dollars to do that and improve our environment,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Gaps in Aid for Non-English Speakers in State Civil Courts

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
When Maythe Ramirez went to Superior Court in Contra Costa, Calif., for a child custody hearing in 2006, she wanted to tell the judge that her husband beat her and should not be allowed broad visitation rights. The court did not provide an interpreter for her, however, and Ms. Ramirez, who speaks almost no English, could not follow the arcane proceeding, much less participate. 
 ''It is really as if you are doing nothing in court,'' she said in Spanish through an interpreter, ''standing still and not being able to explain what's really happening.''
 Ms. Ramirez, who came to the United States from Mexico, later divorced her husband and had the visitation rules modified with the help of a lawyer from Bay Area Legal Aid, who got her interpreters for other hearings. 
 The court system can be a bewildering place for anyone, but it can be terrifying for those who do not understand English. Federal law requires civil and criminal courts that receive federal financing to provide free interpreters for those with limited proficiency in English. But while interpreters are commonly offered in criminal cases, many states do not require the services in all civil cases. The state of California, where Ms. Ramirez's case was heard, provides interpreters in some civil cases and not others. 
 A new study of civil courts, from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University law school, examined the 35 states with the highest immigrant populations and found that interpreter services are not always provided, or not provided well, and are not keeping up with growing demand. Of those states, 46 percent do not require that interpreters be provided in all cases, and 80 percent fail to guarantee that the courts will pay for the interpreter, as the Department of Justice's view of the law requires.
 Thirty-seven percent of those states do not require that the interpreters have proper credentials. The result is a national patchwork of varying rights from state to state. 
 ''This must change,'' the report concluded. ''Federal law, principles of fundamental fairness, and our need for equal access to the justice system all demand it.''
 The disparity in services for non-English speakers between civil and criminal cases makes little sense in light of the high stakes also in civil court, said Richard S. Brown, a state appellate judge in Wisconsin. 
 ''Civil cases can involve denial of constitutional property rights, termination of parental rights, statutory rights to be free from harassment and stalking, consumer transactions, foreclosures and a host of other matters,'' Judge Brown said. ''If a person cannot understand what is happening in the courtroom proceeding, an unfair result might occur. And that is contradictory to what we want our courts to do: administer justice, fairly and impartially.''
 In family law cases, which deal with issues like divorce, child custody and abuse, the lack of language help ''can mean the difference between justice and injustice,'' said Purvi Shah, executive director of Sakhi for South Asian Women, an organization concerned with domestic violence among South Asians in the United States. 
 ''Your testimony on the experience of abuse is what needs to be articulated to be able to access remedies,'' Ms. Shah said.
 States that do not provide interpreters in civil court are violating federal law, said Laura Abel, deputy director of the Justice Program at the Brennan Center and the author of the new report. ''The law is very clear,'' Ms. Abel said, adding that while some states have made progress in the last decade, ''the state courts are just slow to comply.''
 Wanda Romberger, manager of court interpreting services at the National Center for State Courts, said states were trying to rise to the challenge, but were struggling to find enough qualified interpreters. Forty states have joined a consortium that promotes language access to the courts and sets standards for training and testing interpreters. But progress is uneven, Ms. Romberger said, and many states have barely begun.
 Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, introduced a bill last week to provide $15 million a year in seed money for states to develop or improve their court interpreter programs. 
 The federal requirement to provide interpreters in federally financed programs goes back to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and was underscored by the Clinton administration in an executive order in 2000 requiring agencies to take ''reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access'' to services. It was followed up with guidelines issued two years later by the Department of Justice. 
 Loretta King, acting assistant attorney general for civil rights, restated the policy in April at a federal meeting devoted to language skills issues. ''Even in tough economic times,'' Ms. King said, ''assertions of lack of resources will not provide carte blanche for failure to provide language access. Language access is essential and is not to be treated as a 'frill' when determining what to cut in a budget.'' 
 The states, however, face daunting costs and challenges to bring language aid to their courts. In New York, where state law requires interpreters to be offered in all civil and criminal cases, costs have been rising, from nearly $18 million in the 2004-5 fiscal year to more than $24 million in the 2008-9 fiscal year, with 282,000 hours of interpretation in nearly 90 languages, including Kurdish, Wolof and Cajun French. According to a recent article by Ms. Romberger from the National Center for State Courts, California civil courts provided more than 160,000 days of court interpreter services in 2004-5 in Spanish alone, and provided thousands of days in more than 20 other languages, including Samoan, Romanian and Jhindu. 
 California's costs for interpreter services have risen 12 percent a year since 2004. Arkansas's costs have risen by 74 percent a year since 2003, according to the state courts group. 
 Federal court costs are rising as well, with $23 million spent on interpreters in the 2007 fiscal year, up from $18 million in 2004, according to the administrative office of the federal courts.
 Such figures gall those who oppose permissive immigration policies. ''We accommodate for language too much, and that sends a very clear message that it's O.K. not to learn English,'' said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, a nonprofit group that seeks to limit immigration. ''This is an inevitable cost of massive immigration that is never taken into account when making policy.'' 
 The idea that immigrants should simply learn English, however, does not sit well with Judge Brown. 
 ''I wonder aloud how many immigrants from the 1840s through the 1920s lost their liberty, lost their property, lost their homes, their livelihood, all because they could not yet understand the English language to the fullest,'' he said in an e-mail interview. 
 Judge Brown, who is deaf, said, ''I think we are a better country because we are now acknowledging what we did not acknowledge in the 19th and early 20th centuries.''

HEADLINE: For Australian Winemakers, More Turns Out to Be Less

BYLINE: By MERAIAH FOLEY

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia 

 BODY:
Just a few years ago, Australia was being hailed as the great international success story of the wine business, challenging the dominance of France, Italy and Spain. From 1999 to 2007, foreign sales grew more than threefold, making Australia the world's fourth-largest exporter. 
 But even as its star appeared to be rising, the Australian wine industry was sliding, selling a greater volume of wine at increasingly lower prices. Last year, the average price per liter of Australian wine sold overseas was about 25 percent lower than it was a decade ago, a level many say is unsustainable. 
 The industry is also facing increased competition from lower-cost rivals and changing consumer tastes. Last year, exports fell 9 percent by volume, the first such drop in a decade. Many vintners are hanging by a thread.
 ''The industry is in crisis -- anything less than that is avoiding reality,'' said Jeremy Oliver, an Australian winemaker and critic. ''It is interesting that nobody really saw this coming.'' 
 The reversal of fortune is prompting tough questions about what went wrong, and stimulating efforts by the industry to reinvent itself. Some vintners say Australian wine needs an image makeover; others are shifting their sights to the relatively undeveloped Asian market.
 Australians have been making wine almost since the first convict settlers arrived in 1788. With a few exceptions, local winemakers toiled in relative obscurity until the late 1980s, when some entrepreneurs and government officials spotted an opportunity in the growing demand for wine in Britain and the United States. Encouraged by tax incentives, investors planted vines and opened wineries at breakneck speed. 
 Australia took the British market by storm, surpassing Italy and France as the country's top seller in 2004. What many suppliers did not foresee was the extent to which their sales in Britain would be dominated by a few large supermarkets, which would use their influence to push down prices, especially as competition increased from newcomers like Chile, Argentina and South Africa.
 About 85 percent of Australian wine sales in Britain are made through supermarkets. Though the volume of Australian wine sold to Britain has more than doubled over the last decade, the price per liter has fallen to 2.95 Australian dollars, or $2.36, in the year that ended March 31, from 4.36 Australian dollars in 1999. 
 ''Australia can't even bottle air and make money selling at that price,'' Mr. Oliver said. ''It's not sustainable for Australia to be trying to produce the world's cheapest wine; we're totally unsuited to it.'' 
 Producers in several of Australia's major wine regions have seen irrigation costs soar in recent years because of a prolonged drought. Australia's higher labor costs and its distance from major markets have also made it harder for the country to compete globally. 
 In the United States, where Australian wine imports have fallen 4 percent by volume and 25 percent by value from their peak in 2007, the industry's troubles are more complicated. 
 From the late 1990s, top-end Australian wines rode a wave of enthusiasm led by the influential critic Robert Parker, who extolled shiraz from South Australia. His high marks made those wines fly off shelves, with little extra marketing, said Chuck Hayward, owner of the Jug Shop in San Francisco, which specializes in Australian vintages. 
 But that wave soon turned into what Mr. Hayward described as ''a perfect storm of laziness'' in which no one -- neither wine media nor importers nor the top United States sommeliers -- felt the need to learn much about Australia besides South Australian shiraz. And wineries were making so much money peddling South Australian shiraz that they, too, failed to educate consumers about other regions or varieties. 
 Thus, at the upper end of the market, Australia became identified by ''one grape and one region,'' Mr. Hayward said -- a strategy doomed to fail when that variety inevitably fell from fashion. 
 At the bottom end of the market, some have blamed the runaway success of Yellow Tail -- with its distinctive wallaby logo, and hoards of ''critter label'' imitators -- for giving consumers the impression that Australian wine is a mass-market commodity. Others say it is glib to dismiss Yellow Tail, which is extremely successful in its niche, but they concede that the emphasis on low-cost, high-volume exports has damaged the rest of the sector. 
 ''That generic reputation has created a problem for the country because partly we are dependent on heavy growth in the low end of the market,'' said Kym Anderson, a wine economist at the University of Adelaide. ''Whereas there is a lot of very high-quality wine here that struggles to find markets in the U.S. because people aren't very familiar with those particular labels.'' 
 These troubles have been compounded by a recent rise in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar, which went to near parity against the United States dollar last year from about half that value in 2002, erasing profit margins on many wines.
 While Australian wine sales at home grow about 4 percent each year, the industry's problems overseas have brought an era of downsizing. The Winemakers' Federation of Australia recently predicted that the industry would have to reduce the amount of wine it produced by as much as 20 percent to stay profitable, meaning many wineries would close or consolidate, vines would be ripped out and jobs would be lost. 
 ''In the early long term, our vision for the Australian wine industry is a smaller industry at higher quality,'' said Lawrie Stanford, the manager of information and analysis with Wine Australia, the government body that helps direct Australia's overseas wine marketing. ''We've done the volume growth, and we overdid it a bit -- the industry is recognizing that. What we're doing now is pulling back a bit.'' 
 The biggest challenge there, according to the British wine writer Andrew Jefford, will be to convince consumers that Australia can offer more than just the ''cheap and cheerful'' wines they have grown accustomed to seeing. 
 That will require new efforts to educate consumers about Australian wine regions and a push by winemakers to accentuate those differences, Mr. Jefford said. 
 Wine Australia says it will shift the marketing focus away from what it calls ''brand champions'' -- recognizable labels that sell at rock-bottom prices -- toward smaller producers that highlight the differences among regions and varieties. The result, officials hope, will be fewer Australian bottles in the bargain bin and more labels pitched at the $20 price point. 
 In the Asian market, Australian brands are still novel and ''don't have the baggage'' they have in Britain and the United States, according to Mr. Oliver, who recently introduced a Chinese-language book about Australian wine. 
 Wine exports to China have risen from 502,000 liters in 2000 to 19 million liters in the year to March 31. And the average price per liter in China was 4.23 Australian dollars last year, compared with 2.91 dollars in Britain and 3.22 dollars in the United States. In Japan and Singapore, the average price per liter was more than 5 Australian dollars. 
 Many winemakers are keeping these figures in mind as they move to reposition the industry. 
 ''Our focus is on the longer term,'' Mr. Stanford said. ''There's always going to be another growth phase. Where is it going to come from? Well, these things are hard to predict, but you can be pretty sure that a strong prospect for a new growth phase is going to come from China.''

HEADLINE: Fans Rally, and Officials Brace to Honor Jackson

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Rebecca Cathcart and Ana Facio Contreras contributed reporting.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Fans made a mad dash on the Internet on Friday for tickets to a Tuesday memorial service here for Michael Jackson, stirring worries among city officials over the expected throng and the city's resources to police it.
 After days of talks with the authorities, Mr. Jackson's family and business representatives announced a memorial at the downtown Staples Center arena but imposed what they promoted as a stringent lottery for fans to get the 17,500 free tickets reserved for them in the arena and an adjacent theater. 
 As fans raced to sign up, the Web site the Staples Center set up for the lottery failed several times in the first hours after the announcement. By late afternoon, some 500,000 people had registered for tickets, the only way to get them, with winners to be notified on Sunday. 
 ''You might want to consider watching this from the comfort of your own home,'' said Jan Perry, a city councilwoman who is serving as acting mayor while Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa is away on vacation through next week.
 But despite the pleadings of the organizers and city officials, some fans without tickets seemed intent on going.
 ''I'm going to come anyway,'' said George Badilla, 28, who flew in from Guadalajara, Mexico, this week to visit sites associated with Mr. Jackson, 50, who died June 25 of undetermined causes.
 Mr. Badilla, like several dozens fans, had rushed to the Staples Center on Friday believing tickets would be available there and now, uncertain if he would get a ticket online, thought about how close he could get to the arena.
 Los Angeles police officials, bracing for tens if not hundreds of thousands of people, have not given an estimate of what it may cost to control the event, whose lineup and other details have not been announced. Plans for Mr. Jackson's burial, expected to be private, have not been disclosed, and it was unclear if the police would help secure it as well.
 The city is struggling to close a recession-fueled $530 million deficit in its operating budget. Ms. Perry said the city considered the memorial an ''extraordinary event'' and would tap into a fund set aside for such occurrences.
 But Ms. Perry promptly went on local and national television to urge private donors to help; private donors, the Los Angeles Lakers and AEG Live, the company that owns the arena, covered the nearly $1 million in city costs for a parade honoring the team's championship last month.
 ''Any company, entity, individual who would have such great love, the city would welcome the support,'' she said in an interview, adding that so far no one had come forward.
 Councilman Dennis P. Zine said that next week the City Council would discuss asking AEG, which had promoted a series of concerts Mr. Jackson planned to give this summer, to reimburse the city's costs.
 The police and organizers have taken steps to limit the crowds, aside from the lottery. The memorial will not be shown on the giant video screens in the Staples Center plaza, and arrangements have been made for a worldwide TV broadcast and live feed on the Internet.
 The Staples Center has a capacity of nearly 20,000 for sporting events. The organizers said 11,000 fans would be admitted to the arena, with the remainder reserved for Mr. Jackson's family, friends, guests and the news media. At the Nokia theater next door, 6,500 fans will be let in.
 AEG restricted the lottery to United States residents, out of unspecified legal concerns. 
 Although tickets are free, AEG officials have not said whether there are plans to distribute recordings of the event.
 AEG had invested $25 million to $30 million in Mr. Jackson's planned concerts and could be responsible for $85 million in ticket refunds. Company officials have said they expected many fans would keep their tickets as souvenirs and suggested films or recordings of Mr. Jackson's rehearsals might also soften the financial blow.
 It may recoup losses through insurance if Mr. Jackson's death is ruled accidental. Investigators have said he was taking prescription medicine, and Mr. Jackson had admitted to addiction to painkillers and other drugs in the past, but it was unclear whether drugs played a role in his death.
 The California attorney general, Jerry Brown, said Friday that his office, which maintains a database of prescriptions filled in the state, was assisting the Los Angeles police in tracking down Mr. Jackson's medicines and the doctors who might have prescribed them.
 Citing an unnamed law enforcement source, The Associated Press reported that propofol, a powerful anesthetic used most often in surgery, was found in Mr. Jackson's rented home in Los Angeles. A police spokesman declined to comment on the case.
 A spokeswoman for Dr. Conrad Murray, Mr. Jackson's physician, said she would not comment on ''rumor or innuendo,'' though his representatives have denied the doctor gave Mr. Jackson painkillers or other medicine that might explain his death.

HEADLINE: 'Family Friendly' White House Proves Less So for Many Aides

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When President Obama talks up the family-friendly vibe at the White House -- the nightly family dinners, the flexibility to attend school presentations and join impromptu plunges in the pool with his girls -- his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, sets him straight. ''Family friendly to your family,'' Mr. Emanuel counters. 
 The schedule of Christina D. Romer, the president's chief economist, is so packed, for example, that her first visit to her son's school this year came at 10 p.m. on a Friday. ''It felt wretched, just wretched,'' Ms. Romer said of the evening that her 12-year-old boy pointed out his classroom in the dark. 
 Peter R. Orszag, the White House budget chief who is a divorced father of two, works so many weekends that he often imports his parents to help care for his 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son. ''We're still sort of groping here,'' Mr. Orszag said. 
 As for Mr. Emanuel, he recently squeezed in a swim with his two daughters, 9 and 11, at 5 a.m. ''No matter how much the president tries -- and he and Michelle try, they do -- the White House is brutal on family life,'' said Mr. Emanuel, who has struggled to make time for his wife and three children since they moved here from Chicago. 
 The Obamas have vowed to create an accommodating workplace for their employees. For many advisers, though, the work-family balance that the Obamas enjoy remains elusive. 
 White House advisers often work 60 to 70 hours a week and bear the scars of missed birthdays and bedtimes, canceled dinners and play dates, strained marriages and disgruntled children, all for prestigious posts that offer a chance to make an impact and unparalleled access to the president. At a time when the nation is in recession and at war, the public expects no less, many argue.
 Still, the Obamas, who also have young children, remain committed to making life more manageable for their aides who are parents, officials say.
 Those aides include Robert Gibbs, the press secretary, who has a 5-year-old son; Mona Sutphen, the deputy chief of staff, who has a 4-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old son; Nancy-Ann DeParle, the chief health adviser, who has two sons, 8 and 9; and Cynthia Hogan, the vice president's general counsel, who is leading the administration's efforts to get Judge Sonia Sotomayor confirmed to the Supreme Court, as she raises her 12-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son. 
 To support working parents, the Obamas distributed laptops to aides with families -- before those without children -- so they could work from home. They invited the children of some advisers to a White House screening of the film ''Madagascar'' and a Take Your Kids to Work Day hosted by the first lady. They have created some flexible work schedules and encourage their aides to take their children to work when child care arrangements fall through, as well as to swim in the White House pool or play outside. 
 ''Part of the reason that we built the swing set out there was to say, you know, on weekends or after school, bring the kids here, set them loose, because, you know, we want to make sure that you're staying in contact with your family,'' Mr. Obama said in an interview on ''NBC Nightly News.'' ''That, ultimately, I think, makes people work better.''
 Mr. Obama takes that thinking to heart. The president, who often cheers his girls at sporting events, interrupted an economics briefing to call his daughter Sasha, who was celebrating her eighth birthday in London. (Her sister, Malia, turns 11 on Saturday.)
 His aides say they are encouraged by his example. Jay Carney, communications director for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., accompanied his 4-year-old daughter on a school trip to Annapolis, Md., even though the trip came shortly before Mr. Biden was to appear on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC.
 Mr. Orszag, who watches his son's soccer matches, dashed out to see his daughter's play, which started at 6:45 p.m. And for families, there are giddy encounters with the president, vice president or first lady. ''You have so upped our cool factor,'' Ms. Romer's 23-year-old daughter told her.
 Even so, two aides with young children -- Ellen Moran, Mr. Obama's former communications director; and Jackie Norris, the first lady's former chief of staff -- have left the White House for administration jobs kinder to their families. 
 Those who remain recount stories of scrambles to the pediatrician before meetings, conference calls on the drive to day care, family dinners delayed or discontinued. They rely on extra hours from nannies, help from parents and in-laws and the forbearance of their spouses. They know that many working families face tougher challenges, but that does not ease the ache that settles in around sunset.
 ''There's this daily tug in the evening when inevitably, at about a quarter to 8, you ask yourself: 'Can I get this done? Can I get out of here in time to get home?' '' said Lisa Brown, the White House staff secretary, who has a 6-year-old son. 
 Mr. Orszag, who has missed his children's doctor appointments and school trips, said reconciling the demands of work and fatherhood remained difficult despite the president's support. 
 ''There are moments when the concept that I can sort of keep everything functioning well and the kids happy and the job working well -- it all comes crashing down,'' said Mr. Orszag, confessing that he would rather not recall the instances ''when the kids are in meltdown and there's a crisis in the office.''
 So family time is savored in increments.
 Courtney O'Donnell, communications director for Jill Biden, the vice president's wife, kisses her 11-month-old son outside the White House gates when her baby sitter strolls by on sunny afternoons.
 Ms. Romer has taken to sightseeing with her family around 10 p.m. on Fridays when she can count on free time. ''It has been longer and harder than I ever dreamed,'' she said. 
 These days, Ms. Romer's husband, an economist, does laundry and grocery shopping. Claire Shipman, Mr. Carney's wife and a correspondent on ''Good Morning America'' on ABC, often handles bath time and bedtime for their daughter and son, 7.
 ''The first few months, we all thought, 'This is so exciting!' -- and it is exciting,'' Ms. Shipman said. ''But I have to say, starting about a month ago, it really kicked in that I could really use a little more help.'' 
 Mr. Emanuel said he knew the Obama-mania was waning in his household when he told his son recently that they would again be savoring father-son bonding time at the White House on a Saturday.
 The 12-year-old did not jump for joy. He set conditions. 
 ''I'll go,'' his son said, ''but I don't want to sit through another Iranian meeting.''

HEADLINE: Behind The Facade

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Meeting Michael Jackson in the mid-1980s was one of the creepier experiences of my life. I was an editor at The Daily News and had to present him with an award in a large room with just a handful of onlookers and a photographer at Madison Square Garden. 
 I wasn't put off by the fact that Jackson, then in his mid-20s, couldn't make small talk. Lots of people have trouble with that. There was something about his overall behavior that weirded me out. He seemed, even then, to be a person who was trying with all of his being to step outside of reality and leave it behind. 
 Emmanuel Lewis, the child star of the hit TV series ''Webster,'' was with Jackson that evening. The undersized Lewis was probably 13 at the time, but he looked much younger, maybe 7 or 8.
 Jackson seemed to relate only to Lewis. He made faces at the tiny boy and giggled as Lewis hopped around and climbed over furniture, much to Jackson's delight. I remember thinking as I left the Garden that Jackson had treated Lewis almost as a pet.
 I've never heard any suggestion of anything improper about the relationship between Jackson and Lewis. But what I wish I had thought more about in those long-ago days of Michael-mania was the era of extreme immaturity and grotesque irresponsibility that was already well under way in America. The craziness played out on a shockingly broad front and Jackson's life, among many others, would prove to be a shining and ultimately tragic example.
 Ronald Reagan was president, making promises he couldn't keep about taxes and deficits and allowing the readings of a West Coast astrologer to shape his public schedule. The movie ''Wall Street'' would soon appear, accurately reflecting the nation's wholesale acceptance of unrestrained greed and other excesses of the rich and powerful.
 In neighborhoods through much of black America, crack was taking a fearful toll. Young criminals were arming themselves with ever more powerful weapons, and prison garb was used to set fashion trends. 
 Motown was the label that gave us the Jackson 5. But when Michael and his brothers released their first album in 1969, the label had already reached its creative peak and most of the best work -- the stunning originality of the Miracles, the Marvelettes, Mary Wells, Martha and the Vandellas, the Supremes, the Temptations, and others -- had been done. Hip-hop would soon appear, and then the violence and misogyny of gangsta rap.
 All kinds of restraints were coming off. It was almost as if the adults had gone into hiding. The deregulation that we were told would be great for the economy was being applied to the culture as a whole. Women could be treated as sex objects again as misogyny, hardly limited to hip-hop, went mainstream. (Have you looked at network television lately, or listened to the radio?) Astonishing numbers of men abandoned their children with impunity. Most of the nation seemed fine with the idea of going to war without a draft and without raising taxes.
 In many ways we descended as a society into a fantasyland, trying to leave the limits and consequences and obligations of the real world behind. Politicians stopped talking about the poor. We built up staggering amounts of debt and called it an economic boom. We shipped jobs overseas by the millions without ever thinking seriously about how to replace them. We let New Orleans drown. 
 Jackson was the perfect star for the era, the embodiment of fantasy gone wild. He tried to carve himself up into another person, but, of course, there was the same Michael Jackson underneath -- talented but psychologically disabled to the point where he was a danger to himself and others.
 Reality is unforgiving. There is no escape. Behind the Jackson facade was the horror of child abuse. Court records and reams of well-documented media accounts contain a stream of serious allegations of child sex abuse and other inappropriate behavior with very young boys. Jackson, a multimillionaire megastar, was excused as an eccentric. Small children were delivered into his company, to spend the night in his bed, often by their parents.
 One case of alleged pedophilia against Jackson, the details of which would make your hair stand on end, was settled for a reported $25 million. He beat another case in court.
 The Michael-mania that has erupted since Jackson's death -- not just an appreciation of his music, but a giddy celebration of his life -- is yet another spasm of the culture opting for fantasy over reality. We don't want to look under the rock that was Jackson's real life.
 As with so many other things, we don't want to know.

HEADLINE: Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev

 BODY:
By the time President George W. Bush left office, Russian-American relations had deteriorated alarmingly. Russia bore a good part of the blame, harassing opponents, stifling a free press and bullying its neighbors. But Mr. Bush both enabled former President Vladimir Putin's worst impulses and ignored his occasionally legitimate complaints. 
 With President Obama scheduled to meet President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia in Moscow on Monday, both sides say they are eager to ''reset'' the relationship. One welcome sign: Officials said on Friday that Russia had agreed to let American planes fly over Russian territory to re-supply forces fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.
 There are certainly a lot of other difficult issues that need their joint attention. 
 We are especially eager to see them make progress on reducing their nuclear arsenals -- Mr. Bush disdained arms-control negotiations and treaties. Two decades after the fall of Communism, the two countries -- astonishingly and frighteningly -- still have more than 20,000 nuclear weapons. 
 In five months, the 1991 Start I treaty -- which contains the basic rules for verifying the size and location of each others' nuclear forces -- expires. It must be extended. We, along with the rest of the world, are also eager to see the two leaders commit to further reductions in the number of deployed weapons. 
 Under the 2002 Moscow treaty -- Mr. Bush's only arms-reduction treaty -- the two sides agreed to go down to between 1,700 and 2,200 deployed warheads. There is talk that they are now looking to reduce that ceiling to 1,500 warheads. 
 We think 1,000 would send an even clearer message to Iran and North Korea -- and others who have been far too tolerant of their nuclear misbehaviors -- that the world's two main nuclear powers are placing a lot less value on their nuclear weapons. 
 Instead of waiting for a treaty, both sides could demonstrate their good will right now, and make the world a lot safer, by jointly committing to taking their entire arsenals off hair-trigger alert. And they should pledge to quickly destroy all of their short-range weapons. The United States has 200 to 300; Russia has at least 3,000. These weapons are not covered by any treaty, and they are too vulnerable to theft. 
 The two leaders should not let their disagreements over American plans (left over from Mr. Bush) to build a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic stand in the way of an agreement. 
 We are skeptical that the technology is anywhere near ready for prime time. We are also certain that the system, which Mr. Obama says is intended to stop Iranian missiles, poses no threat to Russian security. A healthy dialogue is clearly in order.
 Russia was pivotal in winning recent approval of tougher United Nations Security Council sanctions on North Korea. But it has been less helpful with Iran. Moscow has strong economic ties with Tehran. But Mr. Obama must do all he can to persuade Mr. Medvedev that he is playing with fire. 
 The biggest challenge for Mr. Obama will be finding a balance between enlisting Russia's support on international issues without appearing to endorse its anti-democratic behavior at home or its ongoing threats to neighbors, most notably Georgia. Mr. Bush never managed that. Mr. Obama needs to do better.

HEADLINE: Swine Flu Death Toll in Argentina Climbs

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Charles Newbery contributed reporting from Buenos Aires.

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
The death toll from swine flu in Argentina continued to rise as President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said she would not rule out closing major public venues where the virus could spread more quickly.
 Dr. Juan Manzur, the new health minister, said Friday that 44 people had died from swine flu and that the country had 2,800 confirmed flu cases. The numbers reflected a sharp increase compared with a week earlier, when there were 26 deaths and 1,587 cases.
Swine flu has killed more people in Argentina than in any other country in South America, where the winter flu season is just beginning. The death rate of 1.6 percent is more than three times the world average, Claudio Zin, the health minister of Buenos Aires Province, said Friday. 
 Argentina passed Canada this week as the country with the third-highest death toll from the flu, but it remains behind Mexico and the United States. Dr. Manzur said that officials now suspect that there are 100,000 cases of swine flu in the country, compared with 320,000 cases of other types of flu.
 The government has been slow in confirming cases, doctors said, because it only has one state laboratory doing the testing.
 Mrs. Kirchner tried Friday to calm an anxious public but did not discount the possibility that officials would close movie theaters, discos and other public places to try to contain the flu's spread.
 ''We cannot rule out anything,'' she said. ''Measures will be taken as they are deemed necessary.''
 Argentina was ill-prepared for the global swine flu pandemic, and some private health officials have said that Mrs. Kirchner's government should have declared a state of emergency before national congressional elections last Sunday.
 That would probably have entailed delaying the elections, which Mrs. Kirchner had moved up by four months in a bid to increase the chances that her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, could prevail in his race for Congress. He failed to come in first, hurting the couple's chances that one of them could win the presidency in 2011.
 Several doctors, including some who were advising the health ministry, have said that Graciela Ocana, the former health minister, had recommended calling a national state of emergency and delaying the elections, but was overruled. Ms. Ocana resigned Monday and has yet to discuss the issue publicly.
 Some private doctors said declaring a national state of emergency would allow the health authorities to put together a coordinated plan to contain the spread of swine flu as Mexico did.
 Mrs. Kirchner has resisted making a national declaration, but the city and province of Buenos Aires have declared health emergencies to give officials greater access to funds and free rein to close schools and other public places.
 Even as some officials are closing schools and extending winter vacations to keep young people isolated and indoors, huge public gatherings continue to be held. 
 In Buenos Aires, people waited in long lines on Friday to purchase 3,500 available tickets for a championship soccer match on Sunday. The match is scheduled to be played in a packed 48,000-seat stadium.
 Several media outlets reported that two more people died Friday, identified only as young adults in the city of Rosario, increasing the unofficial total to 46. Dr. Manzur said more deaths than the 44 confirmed were being studied to see if they were caused by swine flu.
 The outbreak is expected to cost the economy up to $2.9 billion this year, deepening an economic contraction to 3 percent from 2.2 percent, according to estimates by economists at HSBC bank in Buenos Aires.

HEADLINE: Steak and Seafood, With a $14 Million Dessert

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
A Chinese businessman named Zhao Danyang paid a record $2.1 million in a charity auction on eBay last year to win a lunch date with one of his heroes: Warren E. Buffett, the so-called Oracle of Omaha. 
 This was a chance to get close to the world's greatest stock picker, Mr. Zhao says, and to pick his brain about investing, the global financial crisis and philanthropy.
 But a day before the lunch, which took place on June 24 at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in New York City, Mr. Zhao told the media he would offer Mr. Buffett a stock tip of his own: a little-known Chinese retailer called WuMart.
 ''I didn't want to influence the market,'' Mr. Zhao, 37, said in a telephone interview Friday. ''It was just a tip from a friend.''
 But that's not how the market reacted to it. Even before Mr. Zhao arrived for lunch, shares of WuMart were climbing. By the time he returned to China, the shares were about 25 percent higher and Mr. Zhao's stock holdings in WuMart (which he insists will some day be China's Wal-Mart) were worth about $16 million more.
 Bloggers in China are now feasting on Mr. Zhao, who runs several investment funds in Hong Kong, pointing out how he cleverly turned what looked like an expensive $2.1 million lunch date into a short-term gain of $14 million.
 ''Zhao Danyang is very smart at manipulating the media,'' a blogger named Lao Pi said earlier this week. ''He made his own stock go up dramatically.''
 But Mr. Zhao plays down the tip, saying he simply slipped Mr. Buffett a few copies of WuMart's annual reports during a three-hour lunch of seafood and steak, with about seven or eight other guests he was allowed to bring along, including his young son.
 He said Mr. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, was friendly and curious about China, but probably thought nothing of the annual reports.
 ''I don't think Buffett will invest in this company,'' Mr. Zhao said, ''Every day, he can look at thousands of companies.''
 Clearly annoyed at the questions about the stock rise, Mr. Zhao insisted he had no intention of quickly dumping his WuMart shares, since he followed Mr. Buffett's idea about investing for the long run.
 But in China, at least, everyone is now talking about the $14 million lunch winnings of Mr. Zhao.
 Mr. Buffett, the Oracle, could not be reached for comment Friday.

HEADLINE: Europe Tests Banks, and Worries

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Stress tests? Yes, Europe has stress tests. 
 But as European financial supervisors carry out simulations to determine how well their most important banks can weather future shocks, politicians are wondering what to do with the findings once they are available. 
 While many outside observers say the exercise is not likely to accomplish much, the critical question for the authorities is whether to publish the results, as United States regulators recently did with similar tests, or whether they should remain secret. 
 Officials are weighing the risks associated with each possibility, although most governments, after initially preferring to keep them under wraps, now favor releasing an overview of the data without breaking it down by individual banks or countries. 
 That is the perspective of several officials, from finance ministries within the European Union and from the European Central Bank, who were not permitted to speak publicly on the matter. 
 But before there can be a final agreement to publish, the officials said, misgivings in two countries must be overcome. Germany is reluctant to release potentially embarrassing findings before its general election in September, while Spain has expressed concern about how data on its lenders might be used. 
 Just how meaningful the tests are also remains a matter of debate, with a number of analysts already calling into question their methodology and reliability. 
 In the United States, regulators released their own stress test results at the start of May, saying 9 of the 19 largest banks were adequately protected, while the remaining 10 were ordered to raise a combined $75 billion as a buffer against potential losses. The United States process added to pressure on Europeans to disclose their own results. 
 Barbara C. Matthews, a former United States Treasury attache to the European Union who runs a consulting firm based in Washington, said the complex European regulatory structure, the closer ties between banks and governments and the larger role banks play within the credit system made it hard to compare the two approaches. 
 ''It's a more politicized process in Europe,'' she said. 
 A negative result for a European bank could be ''more politically and fiscally significant,'' she added. ''The only way to release this information is if you know there's an exit strategy for the banks.'' 
 National supervisors have been carrying out bank stress tests for years, intensifying those efforts since the financial storm exploded last year. Some have already published their findings. 
 The Committee of European Banking Supervisors, a little known regulators' panel based in London, was recently asked by governments to collate national data covering 22 lenders operating across European borders. 
 In a brief statement in May, the committee confirmed that it was ''carrying out an E.U.-wide forward-looking stress testing exercise on the aggregate banking system'' based on common guidelines and situations. It said it would not identify individual banks that might need recapitalization, as that remained the responsibility of national governments. 
 Efstathia Bouli, a spokeswoman, declined to comment further. 
 Those tests are expected to be concluded in late August, and results will be passed to finance ministries. According to officials, ministers could then release a summary of the findings at a meeting in early October in Gothenburg, Sweden. 
 A number of outside players -- including the United States, Canada, international institutions and European countries with stronger banks -- have advocated releasing more data, saying the European Union should then be prepared to recapitalize weak banks. 
 The International Monetary Fund estimated in April that European banks still required $375 billion in capital to cover losses, compared with $275 billion for United States lenders. That forecast disturbed European officials, who were not informed of its release and were unclear on the methodology. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development added last week that it was ''important to be transparent about the underlying assumptions.'' 
 Partly in response to pressure for information, the European Central Bank recently took the unusual step of releasing its own estimate of the losses for euro-area banks, saying they were likely to reach $283 billion from 2009 through 2010. 
 ''We are not trying to hide things under the carpet,'' the French economy minister, Christine Lagarde, said last month. ''We are debating it currently among Europeans to see if it would be by country, if we do it all at the same moment, if we publish only the criteria, if we do the criteria and the results.'' 
 Ms. Lagarde can be fairly confident about French banks. Christian Noyer, the governor of the Bank of France, said last week that stress tests on domestic banks had been positive so far. 
 By contrast, Peer Steinbruck, the German finance minister, has said that he does not plan to perform stress tests on individual domestic banks, and that even if he did, he would not publish results. 
 One reason, according to Hans-Joachim Dubel, a banking expert at Finpolconsult in Berlin, is that many politicians, especially Mr. Steinbruck, do not want the extent of the troubles at Germany's regional banks, known as the Landesbanken, being highlighted before a general election in late September. 
 ''It would be disastrous politically,'' Mr. Dubel said, adding that it would bring pressure for further bailouts. 
 The regional banks, controlled by state governments, gorged on risky securities at the top of the market after politicians, including Mr. Steinbruck, negotiated a deal with Brussels in 2001 to extend an unlimited state guarantee for debt issued by Landesbanken until 2005, Mr. Dubel said. 
 The authorities have not released data on their current assumed debts. The newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung published a leaked report from the supervisor BaFin in late April that said German banks held 816 billion euros ($1.15 trillion) in troubled assets, other loans and investments earmarked for disposal. 
 The figures were described by the government as inaccurate, although soon after the report, Standard & Poor's cut its credit rating on five Landesbanken. 
 Analysts estimate that four of the banks -- BayernLB, WestLB, LBBW and HSH Nordbank -- are carrying 100 billion to 150 billion euros of potentially toxic assets. 
 In Spain, there also appears to be considerable reluctance to disclose too much. Propping up banks in Spain is still at a delicate stage. Many of the boards of smaller savings banks are filled with local politicians. 
 The government has established a support fund of 99 billion euros. But ''it's not our intention that everyone survives,'' Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, the governor of the Bank of Spain, said last week. ''The banks that survive must be competitive.'' 
 Beyond the specific political sensitivities, the whole exercise is fraught with peril. ''If you do things that aren't accurate or believable,'' said Graham Bishop, an independent financial analyst, ''what have you gained?'' 
 Comparisons are also difficult because national accounting systems are far from harmonized. The definition of nonperforming loans, for instance, differs from one nation to another, while exposure to off-balance sheet vehicles is consolidated only in some countries. 
 Indeed, without a stringent approach, Europe risks doing more harm than good. In June, the Bank for International Settlements, the main forum for central bankers, cautioned against ''heavy reliance on the current generation of macro stress tests,'' arguing that they ''can lull policy makers into a false sense of security.''

HEADLINE: What's Beyond Those Bargains?

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
MOST people I know love Ikea. Many of us have bought furniture from Ikea stores, and even if it falls apart we keep going back. Say what you will about Ikea, its stuff is always stylish. And so inexpensive!
 But in ''Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture'' (Penguin), Ellen Ruppel Shell argues that Ikea has engaged in many questionable business practices to maintain its low prices. She says it buys much of its wood in Eastern Europe and far eastern Russia, ''where wages are low, large wooded regions remote, and according to the World Bank, half of all logging is illegal.'' The author writes that such deforesting contributes to global warming, threatening the planet. That is a steep price to pay for cheap bookshelves, she says. 
 This is an inflammatory accusation. But ''Cheap'' is a jeremiad. Ms. Ruppel Shell, a contributing editor for The Atlantic Monthly and a journalism professor at Boston University, is disgusted with retailers who she says have abandoned their principles in pursuit of rock-bottom prices. And she is angry with the rest of us for supporting them. 
 Ms. Ruppel Shell argues that our national obsession with bargains has lowered our standard of living and hurt the environment and the quality of American products. 
 ''Cheap'' has plenty of targets, and many are usual ones. Ms. Ruppel Shell lambastes Wal-Mart, saying it underpays its workers and enables other retailers to do the same. She criticizes China as tolerating sweatshops with dangerous working conditions. And if you have a weak stomach, you may not get past the chapter entitled ''Cheap Eats.'' The author goes into wrenching detail about the foul and environmentally noxious conditions at some of the world's largest factory farms, suppliers to the fast-food industry. 
 She castigates Red Lobster, saying it patronizes Thailand's shrimp farms. The Thai shrimp industry has been accused of environmental, child labor and human rights abuses; it attracts migrant workers from Vietnam and Cambodia who labor for next to nothing, Ms. Ruppel Smith writes. 
 She also writes that Thai shrimp farmers have clear-cut the country's coastal mangrove forests -- a protective wall between land and sea -- to make way for more breeding grounds. She cites a United Nations report that says their disappearance exacerbated the effects of the Southern Asian tsunami in 2004 that killed more than 5,300 people in Thailand alone. In other words, many have paid a terrible price so Americans can feast on cheap crustaceans. 
 (In an interview, a Red Lobster spokesman said the company monitors its Thai suppliers and doesn't buy shrimp from the ones engaged in the kind of practices that ''Cheap'' highlights.)
 But most of all, Ms. Ruppel Shell indicts all of us for supporting these discounters -- particularly those of us who consider ourselves politically and socially aware. 
 ''We rail against exploitation of low-paid workers in Asia'' but still drive long distances to save a little money on tube socks, she writes. ''We fume over the mistreatment of animals by agribusiness but freak out at an uptick in food prices. We lecture our kids on social responsibility and then buy them toys assembled by destitute child workers on some far-flung foreign shore.''
 ''Cheap'' isn't perfect. Ms. Ruppel Shell makes some glaring errors. She refers to the convicted fraudster Bernard Madoff as ''Michael Madoff'' (who she says has contributed to consumer cynicism) and at one point refers to the former Wal-Mart C.E.O. Lee Scott as ''Lee Jones.'' 
 She is a bit too eager to spread blame. The author chronicles her visit to Ikea headquarters with way too much snark. She is unimpressed when Ikea's chief, Anders Dahlvig, describes the steps his company is taking -- among them employing 11 monitors led by a woman whom the author herself describes as ''deeply knowledgeable'' -- to avoid doing business with illegal foresters. She still doesn't think that Ikea is doing enough; then again, she doesn't offer any original reporting that suggests the company is doing anything wrong.
 And she is too quick to paint the men she describes as the founders of today's discount culture as black-hearted. She infers that Sylvan Goldman, owner of the Humpty Dumpty supermarket company, introduced the shopping cart in 1937 to fool his consumers into buying more goods. But how many of us can stand in the checkout line with a week's worth of groceries in our arms? Mr. Goldman deserves gratitude, not scorn, for his consumer-friendly innovation.
 Still, it's hard to argue with Ms. Ruppel Shell's overriding thesis and her grudging conclusion that it won't be easy to reverse the ravages of discount culture against which she rails.
 She concedes that America can't seal off its borders to keep out low-cost Thai shrimp and Swedish bookshelves. ''Tariffs to keep out foreign-made goods may offer a short-term fix,'' she writes, ''but over the long term United States would be poorer and weaker were we to snub international markets.'' 
 In the end, she calls for a consumer revolution. She says that we must spend in a way that is consistent with our principles.
 That won't be easy in a recession. Before he retired last year, Mr. Scott predicted that his company would thrive during a downturn. ''In my mind there is no doubt that this is Wal-Mart time,'' he told a group of analysts. 
 But what if the crisis does cause people to rethink their spending habits? They might if they read ''Cheap.'' Maybe Ms. Ruppel Shell's disgust will be contagious.

HEADLINE: Street Farmer

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH ROYTE. 
Elizabeth Royte is the author of ''Bottlemania: Big Business, Local Springs, and the Battle over America's Drinking Water.''

 BODY:
Will Allen, a farmer of Bunyonesque proportions, ascended a berm of wood chips and brewer's mash and gently probed it with a pitchfork. ''Look at this,'' he said, pleased with the treasure he unearthed. A writhing mass of red worms dangled from his tines. He bent over, raked another section with his fingers and palmed a few beauties. 
 It was one of those April days in Wisconsin when the weather shifts abruptly from hot to cold, and Allen, dressed in a sleeveless hoodie -- his daily uniform down to 20 degrees, below which he adds another sweatshirt -- was exactly where he wanted to be. Show Allen a pile of soil, fully composted or still slimy with banana peels, and he's compelled to scoop some into his melon-size hands. ''Creating soil from waste is what I enjoy most,'' he said. ''Anyone can grow food.'' 
 Like others in the so-called good-food movement, Allen, who is 60, asserts that our industrial food system is depleting soil, poisoning water, gobbling fossil fuels and stuffing us with bad calories. Like others, he advocates eating locally grown food. But to Allen, local doesn't mean a rolling pasture or even a suburban garden: it means 14 greenhouses crammed onto two acres in a working-class neighborhood on Milwaukee's northwest side, less than half a mile from the city's largest public-housing project.
 And this is why Allen is so fond of his worms. When you're producing a quarter of a million dollars' worth of food in such a small space, soil fertility is everything. Without microbe- and nutrient-rich worm castings (poop, that is), Allen's Growing Power farm couldn't provide healthful food to 10,000 urbanites -- through his on-farm retail store, in schools and restaurants, at farmers' markets and in low-cost market baskets delivered to neighborhood pickup points. He couldn't employ scores of people, some from the nearby housing project; continually train farmers in intensive polyculture; or convert millions of pounds of food waste into a version of black gold. 
 With seeds planted at quadruple density and nearly every inch of space maximized to generate exceptional bounty, Growing Power is an agricultural Mumbai, a supercity of upward-thrusting tendrils and duct-taped infrastructure. Allen pointed to five tiers of planters brimming with salad greens. ''We're growing in 25,000 pots,'' he said. Ducking his 6-foot-7 frame under one of them, he pussyfooted down a leaf-crammed aisle. ''We grow a thousand trays of sprouts a week; every square foot brings in $30.'' He headed toward the in-ground fish tanks stocked with tens of thousands of tilapia and perch. Pumps send the dirty fish water up into beds of watercress, which filter pollutants and trickle the cleaner water back down to the fish -- a symbiotic system called aquaponics. The watercress sells for $16 a pound; the fish fetch $6 apiece.
 Onward through the hoop houses: rows of beets and chard. Out back: chickens, ducks, heritage turkeys, goats, beehives. While Allen narrated, I nibbled the scenery -- spinach, arugula, cilantro. 
 If inside the greenhouse was Eden, outdoors was, as Allen explained on a drive through the neighborhood, ''a food desert.'' Scanning the liquor stores in the strip malls, he noted: ''From the housing project, it's more than three miles to the Pick'n Save. That's a long way to go for groceries if you don't have a car or can't carry stuff. And the quality of the produce can be poor.'' Fast-food joints and convenience stores selling highly processed, high-calorie foods, on the other hand, were locally abundant. ''It's a form of redlining,'' Allen said. ''We've got to change the system so everyone has safe, equitable access to healthy food.''
 Propelled by alarming rates of diabetes, heart disease and obesity, by food-safety scares and rising awareness of industrial agriculture's environmental footprint, the food movement seems finally to have met its moment. First Lady Michelle Obama and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack have planted organic vegetable gardens. Roof gardens are sprouting nationwide. Community gardens have waiting lists. Seed houses and canning suppliers are oversold. 
 Allen, too, has achieved a certain momentum for his efforts to bring the good-food movement to the inner city. In the last several years, he has become a darling of the foundation world. In 2005, he received a $100,000 Ford Foundation leadership grant. In 2008, the MacArthur Foundation honored Allen with a $500,000 ''genius'' award. And in May, the Kellogg Foundation gave Allen $400,000 to create jobs in urban agriculture. 
 Today Allen is the go-to expert on urban farming, and there is a hunger for his knowledge. When I visited Growing Power, Allen was conducting a two-day workshop for 40 people: each paid $325 to learn worm composting, aquaponics construction and other farm skills. ''We need 50 million more people growing food,'' Allen told them, ''on porches, in pots, in side yards.'' The reasons are simple: as oil prices rise, cities expand and housing developments replace farmland, the ability to grow more food in less space becomes ever more important. As Allen can't help reminding us, with a mischievous smile, ''Chicago has 77,000 vacant lots.'' 
 Allen led the composting group to a pair of wooden bins and instructed his students to load them with hay. ''O.K., you've got your carbon,'' he said. ''Where are you going to get your nitrogen?'' 
 ''Food waste,'' a young man offered, wiping his brow. Allen pointed him toward a mound of expired asparagus collected from a wholesaler. As the participants layered the materials in a bin, Allen drilled them: ''How much of that food is solid versus water weight?'' ''Why do we water the compost?'' The farmers in training hung on every word.
 If Allen at times seems a bit weary -- he recites his talking points countless times a day -- he comes alive when he's digging, seeding and watering. His body straightens, and his face brightens. ''Sitting in my office isn't a very comfortable thing for me,'' he told me later, seated in his office. ''I want to be out there doing physical stuff.'' 
 Which includes basic research. Warned by experts that his red wrigglers would freeze during Milwaukee's long winter, Allen studied the worms for five years, learning their food and shelter preferences. ''I'd run my experiments over and over and over -- just like an athlete operates.'' Then he worked out systems for procuring wood chips from the city and food scraps from markets and wholesalers. Last year, he took in six million pounds of spoiled food, which would otherwise rot in landfills and generate methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Every four months, he creates another 100,000 pounds of compost, of which he uses a quarter and sells the rest.
 Uncannily, Allen makes such efforts sound simple -- fun even. When he mentions that animal waste attracts soldier flies, whose larvae make terrific fish and chicken feed, a dozen people start imagining that growing grubs in buckets of manure might be a good project for them too. ''Will has a way of persuading people to do things,'' Robert Pierce, a farmer in Madison, Wis., told me. ''There's a spirit in how he says things; you want to be part of his community.''
 Allen owes part of his Pied Piper success to his striking physicality and part to his athlete's confidence -- he's easeful in his skin and, when not barking about nitrogen ratios, incongruously gentle. He told me about his life one afternoon as we drove in his truck, which was sticky with soda and dusted with doughnut powder, to Merton, a suburb of Milwaukee where Growing Power leases a 30-acre plot. ''My father was a sharecropper in South Carolina,'' Allen said. ''He was the eldest boy of 13 children, and he never learned to read.'' In the 1930s, he moved near Bethesda, Md. ''My mother did domestic work, and my father worked as a construction laborer. But he rented a small plot to farm.'' 
 A talented athlete, Allen wasn't allowed to practice sports until he finished his farm chores. ''I had to be in bed early, and I thought, There's got to be something better than this.'' For a while, there was. Allen accepted a basketball scholarship from the University of Miami. There, he married his college sweetheart, Cyndy Bussler. After graduating, he played professionally, briefly in the American Basketball Association in Florida and then for a few seasons in Belgium. In his free time, Allen would drive around the countryside, where he couldn't help noticing the compost piles.
 ''I started hanging out with Belgian farmers,'' Allen said. ''I saw how they did natural farming,'' much as his father had. Something clicked in his mind. He asked his team's management, which provided housing for players, if he could have a place with a garden. Soon he had 25 chickens and was growing the familiar foods of his youth -- peas, beans, peanuts -- outside Antwerp. ''I just had to do it,'' he said. ''It made me happy to touch the soil.'' On holidays, he cooked feasts for his teammates. He gave away a lot of eggs.
 After retiring from basketball in 1977, when he was 28, Allen settled with his wife and three children in Oak Creek, just south of Milwaukee, where Cyndy's family owned some farmland. ''No one was using that land, but I had the bug to grow food,'' Allen said. As his father did, Allen insisted that his children contribute to the household income. ''We went right to the field at the end of the school day and during summer breaks,'' recalled his daughter, Erika Allen, who now runs Growing Power's satellite office in Chicago. ''And let's be clear: This was farm labor, not chores.''
 Allen grew food for his family and sold the excess at Milwaukee's farmers' markets and in stores. Meanwhile, he worked as a district manager for Kentucky Fried Chicken, where he won sales awards. ''It was just a job,'' he said. ''I was aware it wasn't the greatest food, but I also knew that people didn't have a lot of choice about where to eat: there were no sit-down restaurants in that part of the city.''
 In 1987, Allen took a job with Procter & Gamble, where he won a marketing award for selling paper goods to supermarkets. ''The job was so easy I could do it in half a day,'' he says now. That left more time to grow food. By now, Allen was sharing his land with Hmong farmers, with whom he felt some kinship after concluding that white shoppers were spurning their produce at the farmers' market. Allen was also donating food to a local food pantry. ''I didn't like the idea of people eating all that canned food, that salty stuff.'' When he brought in his greens, he said, ''it was the No. 1 item selected off that carousel -- it was like you couldn't keep them in.''
 After a restructuring in 1993, P&G shifted Allen to analyzing which products sold best in supermarkets. He was good at that too: ''I won sales awards six times in one year.''
 Driving across his Merton field, Allen smiled. Suddenly, I got it: Allen was a genius at selling -- fried chicken, Pampers, arugula, red wrigglers, you name it. He could push his greens into corporate cafeterias, persuade the governor to help finance the construction of an anaerobic digester, wheedle new composting sites from urban landlords, persuade Milwaukee's school board to buy his produce for its public schools and charm the blind into growing sprouts. (''I was cutting sprouts in the dark one night,'' Allen said, ''and I realized you don't need sight to do this.'')
 After parking his truck at the field's edge, Allen made an arthritic beeline for a mound of compost. ''Oh, this is good,'' he said, digging in with his hands. ''Unbelievable.'' He saluted a few volunteers, whom he had appointed to pluck shreds of plastic from the compost under the hot noonday sun. He turned to scan the field, dotted with large farm-unfriendly rocks. 
 The rocks gave me pause: didn't millions of Americans leave farms for good reason? The work is hard, nature can be cruel and the pay is low; most small farmers work off-farm to make ends meet. The appeal of such labor to people already working low-wage, long-hour jobs -- the urban dwellers Allen most wants to reach -- is not immediately apparent. And there is something almost fanciful in exhorting a person to grow food when he lives in an apartment or doesn't have a landlord's permission to garden on the roof or in an empty lot.
 ''Not everyone can grow food,'' Allen acknowledged. But he offers other ways of engaging with the soil: ''You bring 30 people out here, bring the kids and give them good food,'' he said, ''and picking up those rocks is a community event.'' 
 Of course, if rock picking or worm tending -- either here or in a community garden -- doesn't attract his Milwaukee neighbors, it's easy enough for them to order a market basket or shop at his retail store, which happens to sell fried pork skin as well as collard greens. ''Culturally appropriate foods,'' Allen calls them. And the doughnuts in his truck? ''I'm no purist about food, and I don't ask anyone else to be,'' he said, laughing. ''I work 17 hours a day; sometimes I need some sugar!''
 This nondogmatic approach may be one of Allen's most appealing qualities. His essential view is that people do the best they can: if they don't have any better food choices than KFC, well, O.K. But let's work on changing that. If they don't know what to do with okra, Growing Power stands ready to help. And if their great-grandparents were sharecroppers and they have some bad feelings about the farming life, then Allen has something to offer there too: his personal example and workshops geared toward empowering minorities. ''African-Americans need more help, and they're often harder to work with because they've been abused and so forth,'' Allen said. ''But I can break through a lot of that very quickly because a lot of people of color are so proud, so happy to see me leading this kind of movement.''
 If there's no place in the food movement for low- and middle-income people of all races, says Tom Philpott, food editor of Grist.org and co-founder of the North Carolina-based Maverick Farms, ''we've got big problems, because the critics will be proven right -- that this is a consumption club for people who've traveled to Europe and tasted fine food.''
 In 1993, Allen, looking to grow indoors during the winter and to sell food closer to the city, bought the Growing Power property, a derelict plant nursery that was in foreclosure. He had no master plan. ''I told the city I'd hire kids and teach them about food systems,'' he said. Before long, community and school groups were asking for his help starting gardens. He rarely said no. But after years of laboring on his own and beginning to feel burned out, he agreed to partner with Heifer International, the sustainable-agriculture charity. ''They were looking for youth to do urban ag. When they learned I had kids and that I had land, their eyes lit up.'' Heifer taught Allen fish and worms, and together they expanded their training programs. 
 Employing locals to grow food for the hungry on neglected land has an irresistible appeal, but it's not clear yet whether Growing Power's model can work elsewhere. ''I know how to make money growing food,'' Allen asserts. But he's also got between 30 and 50 employees to pay, which makes those foundation grants -- and a grant-writer -- essential. Growing Power also relies on large numbers of volunteers. All of which perhaps explains why other urban farmers have not yet replicated Growing Power's scale or its unique social achievements.
 So no, Growing Power isn't self-sufficient. But neither is industrial agriculture, which relies on price supports and government subsidies. Moreover, industrial farming incurs costs that are paid by society as a whole: the health costs of eating highly processed foods, for example, or water pollution. Nor can Growing Power be compared to other small farms, because it provides so many intangible social benefits to those it reaches. ''It's not operated as a farm,'' said Ian Marvy, executive director of Brooklyn's Added Value farm, which shares many of Growing Power's core values but produces less food. ''It has a social, ecological and economic bottom line.'' That said, Marvy says that anyone can replicate Allen's technical systems -- the worm composting and aquaponics -- for relatively little money. 
 Finished with his business in Merton, Allen sang out his truck window to his plastic-picking volunteers, ''Don't y'all work too hard now.'' The future farmers laughed. Allen predicts that because of high unemployment and the recent food scares, 10 million people will plant gardens for the first time this year. But two million of them will eventually drop out, he said, when the potato bugs arrive or the rain doesn't cooperate. Still, he was sanguine. ''The experience will introduce those folks to what a tomato really tastes like, so next time they'll buy one at their greenmarket. And when we talk about farm-worker rights, we'll have more advocates for them.'' 
 At a red light on Silver Spring Drive, Allen stopped and eyed the construction equipment beached in front of a dealership. ''Look at that front-end loader,'' he said admiringly. ''That thing isn't going to sell.'' He shook his head and added: ''Maybe we can work something out with them. We could make some nice compost with that.''

HEADLINE: So Many Foreclosures, So Little Logic

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
LAST week, the stock market tumbled on news that housing foreclosures and delinquencies rose again in the first quarter. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said that among the 34 million loans it tracks, foreclosures in progress rose 22 percent, to 844,389. That figure was 73 percent higher than in the same period last year. 
 But the comptroller's office also said that amid the gloom, there was promising data about loan modifications: they rose 55 percent in the quarter. That growth came on a very low base, of course, but the move encouraged John C. Dugan, head of the comptroller's office. 
 ''As the administration's 'Making Home Affordable' program gains traction and helps offset the impact of this very difficult economic cycle,'' he said in a statement, ''we should continue to see progress in future reports.'' 
 A glimpse of second-quarter mortgage data, however, indicates that the progress Mr. Dugan and his colleagues in Washington are hoping for may take longer to emerge -- raising questions about whether policymakers and banks are moving quickly or intelligently enough on the foreclosure problem. 
 Foreclosures remain one of the great financial ills for the economy. The Bush administration largely overlooked foreclosures affecting average homeowners, focusing instead on propping up elite, troubled financial institutions with taxpayer funds. The Obama administration has said it wants to wrestle the foreclosure issue to the ground by encouraging mortgage loan modifications, but its efforts have gotten little traction.
 Loan modifications occur when a lender agrees to change terms of a troubled borrower's mortgage; the most common approach is to reduce the loan's interest rate. Cutting the amount of principal owed -- an option that could be of more help to a borrower -- is rare because it means homeowners pay less money back to the bank over time. 
 Lenders and their representatives, however, don't like to modify loans through interest rate cuts or principal reductions because, of course, it reduces the income they receive from borrowers. No surprise, then, that loan modifications have been a trickle amid the recent foreclosure flood. 
 Enter the government, with the program it announced in March to encourage modifications. It offers incentives to loan servicers to change mortgage terms, providing $1,000 for each loan they modify. The program focuses on making payments more affordable through lower interest rates, but delinquent amounts and late fees are typically tacked onto the mortgage balance. ''Making Home Affordable'' does not compel lenders to reduce mortgage balances.
 Servicers signed on to the program in April. The program's early months were not covered by the O.C.C.'s first-quarter report. But other figures on modifications conducted in April, May and June are available. And they show a decline in modifications, not an increase as the government hoped. 
 Alan M. White, an assistant professor at the Valparaiso University law school in Indiana, analyzed data on 3.5 million subprime and alt-A mortgages in securitization pools overseen by Wells Fargo. The loans were written in 2005 through 2007; data on their performance is provided to the trusts' investors. Mortgages handled by five of the nation's largest loan servicing companies -- Bank of America, Chase Home Finance and Litton Loan Servicing among them -- are contained in the Wells Fargo data.
 Mr. White found that mortgage modifications peaked in February and have declined in all but one month since. While servicers modified 23,749 loans in these trusts in February, they changed only 19,041 in May and 18,179 in June. This is exactly when servicers were supposed to be responding to the government's loan modification urgings. 
 Foreclosures, meanwhile, keep rising. In June, 281,560 were in process, slightly above the 277,847 in May. Last January, there were about 242,000 foreclosures in the pipeline among the Wells Fargo trusts. 
 ''I was hoping we would see some impact in June of the government's program,'' Mr. White said. ''Is 'Home Affordable' working? My short answer is no.''
 To be sure, the government's data differs from that which Mr. White analyzed, and its loan modification figures for the second quarter may look better as a result. The O.C.C. includes prime loans as well as subprime, for example, while the Wells Fargo data contains no prime loans.
 Nevertheless, Mr. White has collected the figures since November 2008, and he said that in the months since, the performance of the 3.5 million mortgages that he analyzes tracked the O.C.C. data pretty closely. 
 THE Wells Fargo data is illuminating. It shows that in June, 58 percent of modifications cut the payments that the borrower has to pay, a slightly smaller percentage than in April or May. The average reduction in June was $173 a month.
 But the most fascinating, and frightening, figures in the data detail how much money is lost when foreclosed homes are sold. In June, the data show almost 32,000 liquidation sales; the average loss on those was 64.7 percent of the original loan balance. 
 Here are the numbers: the average loan balance began at almost $223,000. But in the liquidation sale, the property sold for $144,000 less, on average. Perhaps no other single figure shows how wildly the mortgage mania pumped up home prices. It also bodes poorly for the quality of the mortgage-related assets lurking in banks' books.
 Loss severities, like foreclosures, are rising. In November, losses averaged 56.1 percent of the original loan balance; in February, 63.3 percent. 
 Given losses like these, Mr. White said he was perplexed that lenders and their representatives were resisting reducing principal when they modify loans. His data shows how rare it is for lenders to reduce principal. In June, for example, 3,135 loans -- just 17.2 percent of the total modified -- involved write-downs of principal, interest or fees. The total loss from these write-downs was just $45 million in June. 
 And yet, the losses incurred in foreclosure sales involving loans in the securitization trusts were a staggering $4.59 billion in June. ''There is 100 times as much money lost in foreclosure sales as there was in writing down balances in modifications,'' Mr. White said. ''That is not rational economic behavior.''
 If banks have written down the value of these loans to the 40 cents on the dollar that they are fetching on foreclosures -- the only true value for these homes right now -- then why don't they bite the bullet and reduce the loan amount outstanding for the troubled borrowers? That type of modification would be far more likely to succeed than larding a borrower who is hopelessly underwater with yet more arrears. 
 ''You can reduce payments with a lot of gimmicks similar to those built into subprime loans -- temporary rate reductions that defer a lot of principal, balloon payments,'' Mr. White said. ''To me that leads to a situation where American homeowners are paying 50 to 60 percent of their incomes for mortgages which reset in 2011 and 2012. That is not solving the problem.''
 Certainly not for borrowers, that is. And because many of these losses will ultimately be passed on to taxpayers, it's not solving our problem, either.

HEADLINE: How to Make the Best Of a Delayed Retirement

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN. 
E-mail: ccouch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Q. You had been planning to retire very soon, but the value of your portfolio has declined too much for you to do so now. How can you get over your disappointment?
 A. It might help to know that you are not alone. The recession has caused many baby boomers to rethink retirement, leading them to accept that they will probably work longer and retire later than planned. 
 ''You have to understand this is not going to be your parent's retirement,'' said Cali Williams Yost, president of Work + Life Fit, a workplace flexibility consulting firm in Madison, N.J., and author of ''Work + Life.'' 
 That said, your future doesn't have to be the same old job with the same old schedule.
 ''You don't have to go to an office from 9 to 5 every day,'' Ms. Yost said. ''You could take a lower salary and less responsibility, work from home, job-share. This will give you time for other parts of your life -- like pursuit of an avocation, time with family or philanthropy.'' 
 In fact, research shows that gradual retirement is healthier than sudden retirement, said Lynn Berger, a career coach and licensed mental health counselor in Manhattan and author of ''The Savvy Part-Time Professional.'' 
 Ms. Berger said that working less -- but still working -- keeps people physically, mentally and socially active. ''Many people experience a rapid decline in physical and mental health soon after retirement, due to lack of activity and purpose,'' she said. ''Before you complain about having to continue working, understand the benefits, besides the paycheck.''
 Q. Although you can't stop working, you don't want to continue working the way you have been. What options do you have? 
 A. You have many options, including working part time instead of full time, serving as a consultant or in taking on a different role at your current employer or at another company. 
 To figure out what suits you best, write down your ideal work situation and move backward from there, Ms. Yost said. 
 ''You are creating a vision of your future,'' she said. ''It might be you want to switch from vice president of sales to working three days a week coaching new sales people, and two days a week you do volunteer work.'' 
 Then determine what you have to give up to make that vision real -- it may be a prestigious title, a portion of your salary or the corner office. It may also involve giving up a certain amount of security, if you decide to change employers or to start your own business.
 Once you establish what you value and what your goals are, consider your financial situation, said Tommy Grella Jr., a certified financial planner and partner in Grella Financial Services in Methuen, Mass. 
 Look at your finances with those values and goals in mind and decide what changes you must make to achieve them, Mr. Grella said. 
 ''It could be instead of having to work full time you decide to sell a highly appreciated asset or change your retirement plans -- giving up the boat or the place in Florida,'' he said. 
 Q.Management at your company assumes that you intend to retire as expected. How do you let it know that you're staying but want to change your schedule and role? 
 A. Arrange a meeting and prepare a formal, written proposal that outlines your plan, Ms. Berger said. Detail how you will ease into your new role, perhaps by gradually cutting back your hours or days at the office. You can also include plans for shifting some of your current responsibilities to others at the company.
 Address every issue that will concern your manager, from who will run meetings to how accessible you will be to clients when you are not in the office, Ms. Berger said.
 It's also important to highlight your accomplishments and to show how the organization will benefit from your plan -- by reducing labor costs without losing a senior employee to retirement, Ms. Yost said.
 Q.What about all those wonderful activities you had been planning for your retirement?
 A. Although some of them may have to be postponed, many others can be part of your life if you simply cut down on your work hours and scale back your level of responsibility.
 ''I have found that when my clients cut back they are actually more productive and are able to schedule in the golf games they wanted or the yoga classes,'' said Sharon Lamm-Hartman, a career coach and president of Inside-Out Learning, a Phoenix leadership development firm.
 Another option is to take some time off, in lieu of or in addition to starting a new work schedule. If you can afford a few months off without pay, in the form of a sabbatical, you can spend that time doing some of the things you wanted to do in retirement, like visiting friends and traveling.
 ''You will come back with your batteries recharged, because we all need some downtime,'' Ms. Lamm-Hartman said.
 ''But the idea of spending the rest of your life doing nothing is an outdated illusion.''

HEADLINE: Securing a Jumbo: No Small Task

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
EVEN as the federal government works to help loosen consumer credit, one home loan product is becoming more expensive and difficult to obtain: the nonconforming ''jumbo'' mortgage.
 These mortgages exceed the conventional ''conforming'' loan limit of $729,750 set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-owned companies. 
 Interest rates on jumbo mortgages have typically been higher than rates on conforming loans, in large part because they are considered riskier without a guarantee that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will buy them. 
 But mortgage executives say the spread has been growing, forcing some borrowers to accept riskier adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs. Qualifying for jumbo loans has also become more difficult, they say.
 ''Two years ago these loans could be accommodated very easily, but today the requirements to get those loans are much more stringent,'' said David Adamo, the chief executive of Luxury Mortgage in Stamford, Conn.
 Mr. Adamo likened the current mortgage market to a barbell, with pockets of availability for borrowers at both ends of the income spectrum but less for those in between. Those with annual incomes up to about $250,000 have access to mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration, while the very affluent can obtain loans from private banking institutions.
 For borrowers with household incomes between $250,000 and $500,000, however, mortgages are not as easy to get, Mr. Adamo said. ''These people are living in places where starter homes might be $1 million,'' he said, ''and it's really affecting them.''
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will accept only loans below $729,500 in the highest-cost markets like New York City and northern New Jersey. For mortgages larger than that, mortgage brokers and bankers must find other investors who want to take the loans. (Mortgage brokers process the applications on a lender's behalf, while mortgage bankers will finance the loan and sell it shortly thereafter.)
 When the mortgage market collapsed last year, investors wanted nothing to do with conventional home loans, much less jumbo mortgages, which represented greater risk in a slumping economy and crippled housing market.
 Jumbo loans are still available, but they often come with stringent qualifications. They are offered by so-called community banks, like Astoria Federal and Hudson City Savings Bank, which make the loans and keep them on their books rather than sell them to investors.
 Mr. Adamo said that before the market's collapse, borrowers of jumbo mortgages could qualify for loans with a 5 percent down payment, credit scores of 620 and enough cash in the bank to cover two months of payments. Now, they must generally have six months' reserves, a 700 credit score and a down payment of at least 20 percent.
 According to Monte N. Redman, Astoria Federal's president, the bank has tightened its jumbo-mortgage lending requirements not just because it is logical to do so in a bad economy, but also because it has so little competition. ''We've tightened things significantly, because we can,'' he said.
 To buy a home with a jumbo mortgage of less than $1 million, Astoria's borrowers must have a down payment of at least 25 percent; and for mortgages above $1 million, borrowers must have 30 percent. Astoria's jumbo borrowers must also have more cash on hand than a year ago, Mr. Redman said. On loans below $1 million, borrowers need 25 percent of the loan's amount in reserves, and that figure increases as the loan amount grows.
 The difference between interest rates on jumbo and conventional loans has recently been around 1.5 percentage points, compared with less than a percentage point in July 2008, according to Mr. Adamo of Luxury Mortgage. Last week, a 30-year fixed-rate jumbos loan averaged 6.47 percent, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher. The average rate on a similar conventional loan was 5.32 percent, according to Freddie Mac.
 Astoria Federal does not offer fixed-rate jumbo mortgages. But Mr. Redman said that rates are particularly attractive for 5/1 jumbo ARMs, where rates hold steady for the first five years, then adjust in accordance with Treasury bill rates. Last week, Astoria Federal's rate was 4.5 percent. Borrowers who take these loans are essentially betting that interest rates will remain modest in five years.

HEADLINE: States of Play

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
At the St. Paul Civic Center in 1982, what should have been a routine re-election convention for the Republican Gov. Albert Quie was underway, but he had dropped out before it had begun.
 A newbie reporter to Minnesota politics, I watched as democracy broke out in earnest on the convention floor over the fight to replace him. There were walkouts, prayer meetings, candidacies that came and went in the blink of an eye, all perpetrated by delegates who had the stamina of Marines. Their various causes righteous, their faces flushed with excitement, they went into extra innings, deep into the night. My head spinning, I climbed up into the bleachers and sat near a shaggy-looking guy in a shiny hockey jacket from Anoka. We watched the full pageantry of electoral politics silently and then I finally looked down the row and spoke. ''Is it always like this?'' 
 ''Yes,'' the man said, turning toward me. I recognized him as someone who should know: Garrison Keillor. 
 Mr. Keillor was already on his way to legend as the host of ''A Prairie Home Companion,'' but there he was staring in fascination at one of the most rococo expressions of state democracy in the land. Lately, everyone else has been watching Minnesota politics as well because the race between the Republican senator Norman Coleman and Al Franken, the comedian and radio host, ended in a deadlock. (A third-party candidate, a frequent feature of Minnesota elections, altered the math.) After a ruling of the Minnesota Supreme Court on Tuesday, more than seven long months after the election, Mr. Franken will become Senator No. 60 for the Democrats, a significant number because it could help make the Senate filibuster-proof.
 It may not be a stretch to say that the nation's governance hinges, in part, on the arrival of the man who played Stuart Smalley, a simp who was a bit too eager to put the self in self-help on ''Saturday Night Live.'' On Wednesday, a question I knew was coming arrived from a friend on the bus: ''What is up with Minnesota politics, anyway?''
 To which I say, as opposed to what? New York? Florida? California? And as a former Minnesotan who lives in New Jersey, don't even get me started about politics, Garden State-style.
 Yes, Minnesotans vote like crazy. At 77.8 percent, the state had the highest turnout in last year's very busy presidential election. But yes, sometimes Minnesotans' votes seem just plain crazy as well.
 Other states, other voters, express alienation by staying home on Election Day. But Minnesotans take a more civic approach to their estrangement, showing up at the polls and replacing the bums with some choices that scan as odd from a distance. (We might mention that the Minnesota state bird is actually a loon, but there is other less avian evidence of Minnesotans' idiosyncrasy.)
 In Minnesota, there is a kind of populist approach that is less progressive than a reflex, a notion that politics belongs to citizens, and politicians only rent their positions.
 The civic entitlement-engagement of Minnesotans has produced lions on the national political scene -- Hubert H. Humphrey and Eugene J. McCarthy -- but is fungible enough to produce singular leaders of another sort. There is not only Mr. Franken, but Jesse Ventura, a former pro wrestler who ran as independent in 1998 on the Reform Party and won, dumbfounding the rest of the nation. There was also a dentist from the Iron Range, in the northeast part of the state, Rudy Perpich, who both preceded and followed Mr. Quie and was dubbed ''Governor Goofy'' by Newsweek for his suggestion that the governor's mansion be sold and that a chopstick factory be built in northern Minnesota.
 Even Senator Paul Wellstone, with his hippy bus of a campaign and outre commercials that took out a sitting senator in 1990, stretched the definition of what constitutes electability. And in the last election in adjoining Congressional districts, Minnesotans elected Keith Ellison, a liberal Democrat who happens to be both black and the first Muslim to be elected to Congress, and Michele Bachmann, a conservative who is an advocate of intelligent design and once entreated a rally against same-sex marriage to ''cry out to a holy God.'' 
 Here's the thing about most of those folks: in the main, it could be argued, they did a pretty good job. Governor Ventura hired a talented crew of state commissioners and came flying off the turnbuckle when he needed to. Governor Perpich was one of the first governors in the nation to realize that international economic efforts by states were increasingly important. Senator Wellstone came swinging out of left field with a raging populist agenda, but promptly made peace with Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican from North Carolina, who made a much better friend than enemy when it came to getting things done. 
 Behind the state's unpredictability, there are some political fundamentals at work. 
 Minnesota was settled by agrarian, church-going folks -- Norwegians and Swedes, with many Germans as well, whose subsequent generations continue to take a dim view of political corruption and vote accordingly. The habits of civic life are baked in at early age, with churches and unions -- historically strong in Minnesota -- reminding members that voting is both an obligation and an opportunity. The presence of distinct regions with separate needs and political agendas -- the average union member from the Iron Range has very different expectations from government than a mother from the populous suburbs that ring the Twin Cities -- means that each regional constituency shows up at the polling place to make sure its interests are seen to. 
 In terms of process, Minnesota is deeply married to the precinct caucus approach, which means the grass roots flourish and frequently overwhelm would-be kingmakers. The state's system of public financing means that anybody who gets organized enough to be in a race will have the wherewithal to campaign. And perhaps most important, Minnesota has same-day registration, which means that a walk-up vote can tilt an election, as it did when Governor Ventura won.
 ''There are numerous state laws, institutions, and processes that contribute to the highly engaged electorate that often votes independently,'' said David Schultz, who teaches election law at Hamline University in St. Paul. ''Yes, party membership is high, but there is a sufficiently large enough independent or swing voting bloc that no one party can win elections in a statewide election unless it wins crossover votes.''
 Demographics provide very few clues. Overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly Protestant and Lutheran, the state has elected four Jews to the United States Senate in recent times. (Jews makes up less than 1 percent of the state's population.) 
 ''Because we think we're such shrewd judges of human nature we're intensely skeptical of everyone who looks and sounds like us and because we're so proud of our broad-mindedness, we make a big show of embracing everyone who doesn't seem like us,'' said Brian Lambert, a radio personality and former media critic at The St. Paul Pioneer Press.
 Remember that when Ross Perot ran for president as an independent in 1992 he received 24 percent of the state's vote. Bill Hillsman, a political-advertising savant who helped invent Paul Wellstone, said that this kind of independent showing is less about third party than a third way into politics.
 ''The reason that different people break through in Minnesota politics is that there is a willingness to entertain a notion,'' Mr. Hillsman said. ''They look at candidates regardless of the conventional wisdom and orthodoxy.''
 ''Minnesota Nice'' is real. It's why you see seed art at the Minnesota State Fair, a popular local art form, expressing all kinds of political and cultural thinking. It's hard to think of another state in the union where you'd see gay-themed art made out of mix of flax and corn seed.
 ''It is a state of deep contradictions,'' said John Rash, an editorial board member of The Star Tribune of Minneapolis and a contributor to WCCO-AM, a radio beacon of all things Minnesotan. ''There is a kind of prickly progressivism here. We are extremely reserved right up until we walk up to the ballot box.''
 In 2005, I went back to Minnesota with Mr. Franken while he tested the waters for a run. In the past, he had been incredibly impolitic around a microphone --once suggesting that the only person with a lower poll rating than Newt Gingrich was the Unabomber -- and had written an indelicately titled book called: ''Lies (and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them).'' But I found him remarkably skilled at retail politics: I watched him exchange jumper-cable stories with voters from northern Minnesota at a so-called ''bean feed'' fund-raiser. Still, as I dropped him off at the condo in downtown Minneapolis, I watched this short man with a backpack and no relevant political experience amble toward the front door and thought: ''Could this wiseacre be the next senator from Minnesota?'' The answer turned out to be yes.
 And yes, Mr. Franken's fast mouth carries with it the possibility of embarrassment, but as people who have to wear the equivalent of a spacesuit to go outside five months a year, Minnesotans are used to the mix of wonder and amusement their state engenders. 
 Like other curveballs thrown by the Minnesota electorate, Mr. Franken might figure it all out, because, as Stuart Smalley used to say: ''I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and dog-gone it, people like me.'' At least in Minnesota.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 2, 2009

HEADLINE: That Long, Long Road From Idea to Success

BYLINE: By VINDU GOEL

 BODY:
SAVE paper, save ink, save money, save the planet. Marketing doesn't get any better than that.
 When Hayden Hamilton and James Kellerman started batting around the idea for their printing software in May 2005, it seemed that simple and brilliant.
 Roughly one out of five pages that people print are wasted -- the stray lines at the end of a Web document, the boilerplate at the bottom of an airline e-ticket, the endless PowerPoint slides before the page with the important conclusions. 
 Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Kellerman wanted to create software that would make it easy to eliminate the junk: When users hit ''print,'' a preview of the document would pop up and allow them to quickly choose which pages they really wanted.
 Four years later, the two men and the company they founded, GreenPrint Technologies, are still struggling. About 168,000 people have tried the company's free consumer version, but only about 25,000 are using it on any given workday, by the company's estimate. Corporations, the gold mine for software like this, have been reluctant to buy it until GreenPrint worked out a host of technical issues.
 ''It's more difficult than you'd think it would be,'' said Mr. Hamilton, chief executive of the start-up, which is based in Portland, Ore. ''We had zero insight into what challenges would be in place for an organization of 50,000 users.''
 GreenPrint's travails are all too common for small technology companies. ''The gulf between invention and innovation is often a huge one that many entrepreneurs can't cross,'' said Scott D. Anthony, president of Innosight, a consulting firm.
 In other words, it's not easy to turn a bright idea into a genuine business.
 GreenPrint might finally hit its stride with Version 2 of its software. The updated consumer software was released last month (downloadable versions are at www.printgreener.com), and the corporate version is due in a few weeks. 
 The new software is faster and offers network administrators more reports on who's printing what and how much money a company is saving. GreenPrint has already landed one big customer -- an Asian conglomerate that ordered 50,000 licenses -- and says that several more are interested, including the HSBC Group, the big banking company.
 But if the past four years have taught GreenPrint anything, it's that progress can be slow. 
 Mr. Kellerman, the chief technical officer at GreenPrint, said the company had listened closely to early customers, like the International Finance Corporation, a unit of the World Bank Group.
 I.F.C. tested the original version of the software with about 190 people. The verdict was that it was too slow and choked on large documents like PowerPoints. A lot of users turned it off.
 ''It was preventing them from doing work they needed to get done,'' said Sarah Raposa, who runs I.F.C.'s internal sustainability program. 
 MR. KELLERMAN said GreenPrint hadn't realized how hard it would be to create a universal ''translator'' that could handle every application and printer. Ultimately, GreenPrint had to overhaul the entire software engine, switching to Microsoft's XPS document standard, which is tuned to run especially fast in Windows Vista and the coming Windows 7.
 In the meantime, the environmental consciousness that prompted I.F.C. and other early users to support GreenPrint has become commonplace.
 GreenPrint's biggest deal so far is with Xerox, which has distributed 150,000 copies of the software with its line of solid-ink printers as part of a broad, eco-friendly marketing campaign. ''It increases the 'reduce waste' message,'' said Deb Koehler, director of sustainability of the Xerox Office Group.
 Ms. Koehler said that Xerox had been patient with the 28-person start-up. Despite the initial sluggishness of the software, ''we also had a lot of feedback that if someone really cares about reducing the waste, it's worth the wait.''
 It may be worth the money, too. GreenPrint says its software, which costs about $70 per corporate user, will shave an average of 17 percent from the cost of paper and ink -- about $100 annually for a typical employee printing 10,000 pages at 6 cents a page. In the case of Savills, a British real estate brokerage firm whose agents briefly tested the software, the projected savings were more than $800 per user a year, GreenPrint said.
 With that kind of money at stake, a successful GreenPrint could nip at the profits of the big printer makers, like Hewlett-Packard and Canon. 
 H.P., the leading maker of printers, makes a 40 percent operating profit on ink, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. As a result, H.P. is trying to bolster, not reduce, consumption of printer ink, which costs customers $40 to $80 an ounce (making Dom Perignon Champagne look cheap at about $5 an ounce).
 ''We're seeing this explosion of digital content,'' said Stacey Wueste, a vice president for environmental strategy in the imaging and printing group of H.P. ''That all drives a set of printable opportunities we didn't have a few years ago.''
 H.P. deflects talk about the cost of ink, preferring to discuss carbon footprints. The company has directed its conservation efforts toward cutting the energy used by its printers, recycling ink and toner cartridges and making it easier for machines to print on both sides of a sheet. 
 As GreenPrint tries to establish its niche among the giants, its attitude is promising, said Mr. Anthony, who is also author of ''The Silver Lining: An Innovation Playbook for Uncertain Times.''
 ''You see again and again the companies that succeed are not the ones that have the brilliant strategy,'' he said, ''but the ones that course-correct along the way.''

HEADLINE: Running Out Of Options, Afghans Pay For an Exit

BYLINE: By ADAM B. ELLICK; Abdul Waheed Wafa contributed reporting.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Through two decades of war, Abdul Ahad never contemplated leaving Afghanistan. But as his country started to deteriorate rapidly in 2007, so did his life. He was laid off from his full-time driving job and forced to take the only work he could find: a once-a-week driving gig through Taliban territory.
 In the past eight months, a suicide bomb and a firefight nearly took his life. Now, Mr. Ahad, 26, has had enough. He has begun scouting potential smugglers to take him to Europe, he said, looking to join the surge of young Afghans who are abandoning their country, frustrated by endless war, a lack of prospects and the slow pace of change. 
 While foreign diplomats hold out hope that the August presidential elections and President Obama's new troop deployments could change things here, Afghans are voting with their feet. 
 Last year about 18,000 Afghans applied for asylum in Europe, a figure nearly double the 2007 total. The spike was the highest increase for any major country in 2008, according to the United Nations. By comparison, applications from Iraqis fell 10 percent. 
 ''People can't find jobs here,'' Mr. Ahad said. ''And if you go to a place where there's work, you'll be killed in a week. 
 ''I'm desperate,'' he added. ''It's not a big dream. I just want to finish my studies and live normally.''
 Willing to gamble on the risks, young men like him are turning over their savings -- up to $25,000 in some cases -- and their lives to smugglers, who arrange routes over seas to Australia or over land to Europe, where the Afghans then try to seek asylum.
 Finding a smuggler is not as difficult as it might seem. In interviews in the capital, Kabul, several smugglers, all of whom requested anonymity because their work is illegal, estimated that business was up 60 percent over last year. One said he was turning away customers for the first time in his 11-year career.
 ''It's out of my power to deal with the demand,'' he said. ''I never imagined it would get like this.''
 The country's dire situation has even prompted some privileged Afghans to leave. They include the host of ''Afghan Star,'' an ''American Idol''-style television series, who disappeared after a documentary based on the show won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival; as well as a media officer who worked for President Hamid Karzai and deserted his delegation during an official visit to the United States in September. 
 Just a few years ago optimism abounded here, as the American-led invasion seemed to have ousted the Taliban, and wooed more than 3.5 million Afghan refugees back home while setting off a series of promising reconstruction projects.
 But since 2006, waves of Afghans have fled the Taliban resurgence, endemic corruption and the government's inability to provide basic services like electricity. They are turning up in perilous waters near Australia, in Turkish prisons, at Rome's main railway station and in Le Petit Kabul in Paris, or Little Kabul.
 In Calais, France, an immigration detention complex dubbed the Jungle is keeping about 600 Afghans in conditions that are ''very, very bad compared to two years ago,'' said Jean-Philippe Chauzy of the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental agency based in Geneva, who visited the camp in May. French officials have vowed to close the center by the end of 2009. 
 Migration officials and recent deportees said many other Afghans abroad just disappear, are sexually exploited by truck drivers or are forced into labor. Applications for asylum often fail, too.
 ''It's death or destination,'' said Shuja Halimi, who expressed no regrets after he was deported back to Afghanistan from the United Kingdom, after a two-month journey across 12 countries, including Bulgaria, where he says he eluded gunfire at the border. 
 He said living conditions in Europe were awful ''but not as bad as Afghanistan.'' Now in Kabul, Mr. Halimi, who has three children, has not found a job.
 ''We've got a president called Hamid Karzai who has done nothing for Afghan people,'' he said, echoing the sentiment of many young Afghans. 
 On a recent day at the Kabul airport, 30 young deportees from England returned home for the first time in several years. Equipped with only a plaid canvas bag, Akbar Khan, 20, vowed to try again. ''We'll try to go back in about a month after we save some money,'' he said.
 In an attempt to curb the migration, the International Organization for Migration ran a media campaign here warning against the hazards of smuggling. The Italian government, which noted a 202 percent rise in Afghan asylum applications last year, financed the initiative.
 Pakistan and other neighboring countries historically offered Afghans refuge during crises like the Soviet occupation. But today Pakistan faces an internal refugee crisis of its own. Iran, too, is cracking down, now deeming the Afghans economic migrants rather than victims of war and deporting about 700,000 last year. 
 As other avenues close, Afghans are now engaged in ''what has become an intercontinental migration,'' said Mr. Chauzy of the International Office of Migration. 
 The most common route out for Afghans, then, is by road -- from Iran via Turkey to Greece -- and costs around $16,000, the smugglers said. They said that for about $25,000, they could guarantee an air journey eased by forged documents or prepaid bribes to immigration officials.
 Once in Europe, Afghans apply for asylum most often in the United Kingdom, Turkey, Greece and Italy. Scandinavian countries and Switzerland receive far fewer applicants but accept a significantly higher rate of Afghans, according to data from the European Commission.
 Migration experts say the widening and tight-knit Afghan diaspora in Europe has encouraged the trend, anchoring new arrivals and providing increasingly sophisticated advice on the asylum process. 
 European officials trying to curb illegal migration have broken up several high-profile smuggling operations recently. In June, British officials convicted an Afghan man calling himself ''the smuggler of Europe,'' who claimed his multimillion-dollar operation served thousands of young men, according to phone conversations recorded by authorities. Some men were forced to work at a chain of pizza restaurants to pay off their debt. 
 But officials in Afghanistan have been slower to crack down on smugglers. One smuggler chuckled when asked if he feared being arrested, saying his business operated much like a travel agency, and almost as openly. 
 ''In this government, three things work very well: relations, money and acquaintances,'' the smuggler said. ''When these three exist, anyone can get what they want.''
 Noor Haidiri, an adviser to the Minister of Refugees, placed some of the blame on Afghanistan's regional neighbors. Many Afghans, he said, leave legally and hire smugglers in Iran or Dubai. As for the networks that exist here, he said, ''only five years ago we had our first elected government, and it goes slowly.''
 But many Afghan youths feel that, given the danger in the country, legality is a secondary concern. 
 ''I love this country, but it's totally going in the wrong direction,'' said a teary-eyed 26-year-old man, who did not want to give his name because he was planning to leave. ''I want to live like a normal person: wake up, go to work, and be with a wife -- or a girlfriend, preferably.''

 BODY:
METHLAND
 The Death and Life of an American Small Town
 By Nick Reding
 255 pp. Bloomsbury. $25
 Think globally, suffer locally. This could be the moral of ''Methland,'' Nick Reding's unnerving investigative account of two gruesome years in the life of Oelwein, Iowa, a railroad and meatpacking town of several thousand whipped by a methamphetamine-laced panic whose origins lie outside the place itself, in forces almost too great to comprehend and too pitiless to bear. The ravages of meth, or ''crank,'' on Oelwein and countless forsaken locales much like it are shown to be merely superficial symptoms of a vaster social dementia caused by, among other things, the iron dominion of corporate agriculture and the slow melting of villages and families into the worldwide financial stew. 
 The book, wrought from old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting of a type that's disappearing faster than nonfranchised lunch counters on Main Street, isn't chiefly a tale of drugs and crime, of dysfunction and despair, but a recession-era tragedy scaled for an ''Our Town,'' Thornton Wilder stage and seemingly based on a script by William S. Burroughs. The madness stalking tiny, defenseless Oelwein may eventually come for all of us, we learn, and once again, as happens in America whenever our collective attention wanders from the gray struggles of the little guy to the purple capers of the big wheels, attention must be paid. Right now. Or else.
 ''Methland'' begins quietly and solemnly, with a ballad of cultural invisibility. Reding, a loyal native of the Midwest who's frankly sentimental about its past and starkly lucid about its likely future, invites his rushing readers to gaze down at the ''flyover country'' of America and see not a grid of farms and county roads but a patchwork of failed institutions and aspirations. There's the hospital, groaning under a load of uninsured patients with minimum-wage jobs and maxed-out household budgets. There's the school, imperiled by dwindling tax receipts and students with ever more grown-up problems. And there, on a street in a district of drab houses not far from the faltering central business district, is a passel of latter-day Tom Sawyers on bikes, riding along not for the summertime heck of it but to shake up batches of low-grade speed contained in plastic soda jugs lashed to their back fenders. 
 It's magnificently potent stuff, this meth, whose crudest versions are concocted from a mash of over-the-counter cold pills and flesh-eating bulk industrial chemicals. Just a few grains of it, snorted through scarred nostrils and allowed to saturate stressed synapses, can keep a person awake and going for days. And that's not an entirely bad thing here, where survival means working harder for less each year, from late shift to day shift, until perception blurs.
 Soon, Reding brings us even farther in, introducing a cast of local characters whose trust it must have been a feat to gain, so wobbly and troubled are their lives. Nathan Lein, the crusading county prosecutor, is the 28-year-old son of pious farmers who's come back to Oelwein to help clean up the meth mess after obtaining degrees in philosophy, law and environmental science. Lein, a big guy, but not quite big enough given the monstrous foes confronting him, is afflicted by a nervous ''habit of slowly raising his hand to his face and then rubbing the tip of his nose in one quick motion, as if to remove a stain that only he can perceive.'' 
 Manning another fortress against the siege is Dr. Clay Hallberg, Oelwein's leading physician and a chain-smoking, trembling alcoholic who likes to swill cheap canned beer in his garage. Oddly, like Lein, he's an amateur philosopher, given to quoting Kant and reading Chomsky and trying to fit his hometown's woes -- ghoulish orgies of domestic violence, toxic explosions of backyard crank labs, psychotic episodes at Do Drop Inn -- into overarching historical patterns. He and Lein share a longing, perhaps even a mania, to achieve an enlightened perspective on decline, if only because it lifts them temporarily out of their harsh grass-roots struggle with its effects. 
 The effects themselves are hardly abstract. In the tradition of James Agee's writings on Depression-era share-croppers, Reding displays the faces of the damned in broken-capillary close-ups. In the grisliest passage of ''Methland,'' which deserves to be quoted at some length so as to convey its hellish momentum, he invites us to share in the torments of Roland Jarvis, a paranoid small-time meth cook, in the Dante-like interlude after the combustion of his improvised home lab (just one of hundreds in the area). ''Jarvis looked down and saw what he thought was egg white on his bare arms. It was not egg white; it was the viscous state of his skin now that the water had boiled out of it. Jarvis flung it off himself, and then he saw that where the egg white had been he could now see roasting muscle. His skin was dripping off his body in sheets. . . . He'd have pulled the melting skeins of skin from himself in bigger, more efficient sections but for the fact that his fingers had burned off of his hands. His nose was all but gone now, too, and he ran back and forth among the gathered neighbors, unable to scream, for his esophagus and his voice box had cooked inside his throat.'' 
 Too many scenes of sulfurous agony might chase away the most calloused, ambitious reader, so Reding recounts these nightmares sparingly, surrounding them with stretches of patient journalism tracing the convergence of social vectors that made the meth plague nearly inevitable and its eradication well-nigh impossible. He details, with blunt statistics and apt anecdotes, the vanishing of educated young males from rural Iowa, as well as the butchering of middle-class jobs at the local packing plant.
 The agricultural conglomerates that have gobbled up Oelwein and similar farm towns may feed the world, but they starve the folks who work for them, breeding a craving for synthetic stimulants that conveniently sap the appetite while enlarging the body's capacity for toil. These offal-streaked Dickensian mills are also magnets for desperate immigrant laborers who, in some cases, blaze the smuggling trails that run up into the Corn Belt from Mexico, home to the gang lords who own the superlabs that, increasingly, dominate the meth trade.
 ''Vicious cycle'' is not an adequate term. As Reding painstakingly presents it, the production, distribution and consumption of methamphetamine is a self-catalyzing catastrophe of Chernobylish dimensions. The rich, with their far-off, insulated lives, get richer and more detached, while the poor get high and, finally, wasted. In the meanwhile, the traffickers fatten in their dens, expanding their arsenals and their private armies, some of whose troops are recruited from the ranks of the pale zombies their business spawns. 
 A photon of cheer at the end of this grim tunnel emerges toward the end of ''Methland'' when, thanks to tireless efforts by a new mayor, a shaky economic revitalization succeeds in sprucing up the town and brightening its prospects. At the same time, the embattled Lein and Hallberg manage to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps just as they're about to plunge over sheer emotional cliffs.
 How all are faring in the current downturn isn't revealed, and perhaps that's for the good, because readers who've followed Reding into the underworld deserve a measure of hope for their devotion. What's clear is that the golden rolling heartland that Americans used to think symbolized stability beats fitfully and irregularly still and almost certainly remains inclined to seek out sources of chemical optimism. And no one, least of all Reding, who knows what's what on an intimate, human level as well as on the astral plane of globalism, can tell us where it will all end -- only that, all things being equal in an increasingly unequal land, it doesn't have far or very long to go.

HEADLINE: New Jersey: Feeding the Children

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
New Jersey served free lunches to an average of 45,522 students each weekday last July, a 15 percent increase from the 39,466 students in 2007. The number of meal sites also increased, to 1,020 from 940 the previous July. 
 This summer, state officials are expecting to add at least 14 new sites and serve an additional 2,000 children a day. There are 10 new sponsors of the summer meal programs, including the Harrison school district and the municipal governments in Roselle and Prospect Park. 
 ''We all recognize in working with these programs that hunger doesn't take a summer vacation,'' said Emma Davis-Kovacs, who, as director of the New Jersey Department of Agriculture's Division of Food and Nutrition, oversees the school nutrition program.
 The Newark school district, which runs one of the largest programs in the state, is expecting to serve 10 percent more meals this summer because of the economic downturn.
 Last summer, it served a daily average of 2,552 free breakfasts and 3,360 free lunches, a 19 percent increase from the previous year, said Tonya Riggins, the district's director of food and nutrition. 
 Currently, 82.5 percent of Newark's 39,500 students qualify for free- and reduced-price lunches.
 The free meals will be served at 39 schools -- the same number as last year -- from Monday through Aug. 14. WINNIE HU

BYLINE: By MARC FITTEN. 
Marc Fitten, the editor of The Chattahoochee Review, is the author of the novel ''Valeria's Last Stand.''

DATELINE: Atlanta 

 BODY:
 A FTER taxes this year, I found myself in the curious position of having a decent-sized refund and absolutely no idea what do with it.
 See, I'm one of the hundreds of millions of Americans without a degree in finance. I also live in a state where foreclosures are high and 14 community banks have closed since the economic crisis began. If you look, you can see the seams tearing -- empty houses and vacant stores beginning to rot because their owners have lost their shirts, the cost of using public transportation going up, and Atlanta's property taxes being raised just to keep from having to close more fire stations. 
 I hear people saying it's time to get out, especially after that tax increase was announced, but where are they going to go? California? Who is going to buy their houses? They're stuck. 
 I know I'm one of the lucky ones: I have a spouse, a child, a dog, a car, a mortgage and, thankfully, I still have a job. And all I want is to grow -- or at least, not shrink -- my nest egg.
 Easy? Not easy. Not when you add the rest of the story:
 The country's soaring deficit is making the dollar less valuable. State budgets are collapsing. The unemployment rate is steadily rising. And in banking, financial institutions may be out of the woods ...or not. Whatever was or wasn't the problem that engendered the recession has either been fixed ... or hasn't. The chaos is over ... or isn't.
 So what should I do with my money? Go to Costco and shore up for lean times? Pay down the mortgage on my depreciating house? Sock it away in my sock drawer? Maybe just use it for kindling?
 Oh, the problems of being middle class! If I were rich, none of this would matter. If I were poor, none of this would matter. But this recession is an absurd kind of middle-class-only limbo. So in an attempt to salvage my economic status I spent a couple of days calling and visiting banks around the state, asking them why I should bank with them. It didn't help.
 ''Aren't most of the same folks who started this mess the ones working on fixing it?'' I kept wondering. ''Aren't those bad loans still out there? Why isn't anybody talking about the 45 banks that have closed in the United States this year? Is your bank safe?'' 
 Most people I met scoffed or shrugged when I asked my questions. Almost all parroted the line that my money was covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It seemed this was the best they could do, but finally a few bankers sat down with me and assured me that they hadn't made risky loans, hadn't needed bailout money, that their institutions were stable and drama-free.
 Which is how I ended up using my nest egg to buy a couple of low-interest certificates of deposit. By low, I mean abysmally low. But in the most stable, most conservative places I could find -- Georgia Federal Credit Union and an Atlanta branch of the Royal Bank of Canada. 
 However, I still felt a fool to believe anything anybody in the banking industry told me about making, not losing, money; so my anxiety-fueled mind kept churning. 
 Where does the F.D.I.C. get all that money to do its insuring? Does it have a vault with enough cash in it to cover everybody? According to its Web site, F.D.I.C. funds come from premiums paid by banks (that have no money) and from interest on its own investments in securities at the Treasury.
 And just like that, it hit me -- as long as there is a United States of America, there will be a Treasury. Can't I keep my money at the same place that the F.D.I.C. does? There's a Federal Reserve Bank right here in Atlanta. They have money. They make money. Can't I cut out the middleman and deal with the Man myself?
 Lo and behold! It turns out, I can. No intermediaries, just me and Uncle Sam. All I have to do is open a free account at the Treasury's Web site. Hey, it's as good a deal as any to be had at the banks, and it's safer. I can invest my dollars directly into the busy goings-on of the government. I can buy and sell securities. I can be my own F.D.I.C.

HEADLINE: No Rest for the Wealthy

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross, a columnist at Newsweek and Slate, is the author of ''Dumb Money: How Our Greatest Financial Minds Bankrupted the Nation.''

 BODY:
The financial meltdown has sent the literary-minded scurrying back to the classics for insight and succor. The dastardly exploits of the Ponzi artist Bernie Madoff call to mind ''The Great Gatsby'' or ''The Way We Live Now.'' At a time when hard-core free-marketeers like Richard Posner are questioning the efficacy of capitalism, the works of Karl Marx are being fished out of the dustbin of history. Most classic critiques of capitalism are much-mentioned but little-read, the sort of books people routinely cite without really knowing what's in them. In the interest of understanding our suddenly imperiled passion for private jets and $5,000 handbags, I recently dusted off -- literally -- one of those classics, Thorstein Veblen's ''Theory of the Leisure Class,'' published in 1899. 
 In the book, Veblen -- whom C. Wright Mills called ''the best critic of America that America has ever produced'' -- dissected the habits and mores of a privileged group that was exempt from industrial toil and distinguished by lavish expenditures. His famous phrase ''conspicuous consumption'' referred to spending that satisfies no need other than to build prestige, a cultural signifier intended to intimidate and impress. In this age of repossessed yachts, half-finished McMansions and broken-down leveraged buyouts, Veblen proves that a 110-year-old sociological vivisection of the financial overclass can still be au courant. Yet while Veblen frequently reads as still 100 percent right on the foibles of the rich, when it comes to an actual theory of the contemporary leisure class, he now comes off as about 90 percent wrong. 
 Like most great American think pieces, from the Federalist Papers to ''The End of History,'' ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' was less the product of a cloistered thinker pondering timeless verities than one of a keen observer attuned to a rapidly changing world. Born into a Norwegian-speaking farm family in Wisconsin, Veblen bounced around elite universities -- Johns Hopkins, Yale, Cornell, the University of Chicago, Stanford -- in the 1880s and 1890s, a career path that gave him a firsthand view of the emergence of a new America and a new class of Americans, symbolized by staggeringly profitable trusts like Standard Oil; the first billion-dollar corporation (U.S. Steel); the collected architectural works of McKim, Mead and White; and the nouveau riche palaces springing up on Fifth Avenue and in Newport, R.I. 
 To Veblen, the rise of a conspicuously consuming leisure class wasn't a sign of progress. It was a relic of barbarism, an evolutionary step from feudalism, and, hence, un-American. The equation of luxury with British tyranny and decadence, which took hold in the revolutionary era, persisted through much of the 19th century. Since primogeniture had been abolished in America early on, and there wasn't much point in possessing huge tracts of land when vast territories were available to the adventurous, the nation had little in the way of dynastic wealth or large enterprises. The Civil War crushed the one peculiar institution that had enabled a small-scale leisure class in the slaveholding South. But by the 1880s and 1890s, the new technologies -- telegraph, steam, railroad, electricity -- that had forged a national market in goods and services, and the rise of Wall Street as a financial center, were allowing businesspeople to amass great wealth practically overnight. For the first time, America had individuals capable of single-handedly conjuring into existence institutions like Rockefeller's University of Chicago, where Veblen taught political economy. 
 Stout Scandinavian Midwesterner that he was, Veblen hated waste and loved efficiency. And leisure, which he defined as ''nonproductive consumption of time,'' was wasteful. But ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'' is more than a polemic; it's one of the first works of pop sociology, and one that sold well despite a distinct lack of Gladwellian zing. There's a little Darwin -- ''life in a modern industrial community . . . acts by a process of selection to develop and conserve a certain range of aptitude and propensities'' -- and plenty of Marx. There's also a healthy measure of anthropology. We learn of Polynesian kings who would starve rather than use their own hands to feed themselves, and why college football players seem to be inordinately devout. At times Veblen is a proto-Seinfeld, unintentionally dabbling in Victorian-era observational humor: ''No explanation at all satisfactory has hitherto been offered of the phenomenon of changing fashions.'' 
 Although the book was written in the infancy of American social science, chunks of it anticipate more sophisticated arguments made by present-day economists. As some people grow so wealthy that they can't spend all their money on themselves, ''the aid of friends and competitors is therefore brought in by resorting to the giving of valuable presents and expensive feasts and entertainments'' -- which pretty much explains Stephen Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group inviting friends and frenemies to his $5 million 60th birthday party. But it's not just hedge-fund guys who are driven to spend for the sake of display. The Cornell economist Robert H. Frank has argued that the demand for ''positional goods'' like bigger houses and private-school education has created a financial arms race from the top down. Here's Veblen: ''The members of each stratum accept as their ideal of decency the scheme of life in vogue in the next higher stratum, and bend their energies to live up to that ideal.'' 
 Veblen called out the domestic leisure class for mimicking their decadent European antecedents. My work as an economics journalist occasionally takes me into the private lives of billionaires, and it's amazing the degree to which tough, self-made businessmen still mimic the habits of the fey European nobility. Once, as I entered the office of one magnate, a generation removed from the shtetl, my eyes were drawn to a photo of him, clad in tweed and boots, rifle on his shoulder, dead ducks fanned out at his feet under a gray British sky. 
 Yet other parts of Veblen's argument simply clang. ''The leisure class is in great measure sheltered from the stress of those economic exigencies which prevail in any modern, highly organized industrial community,'' he writes. Back then, an industrial baron could embark on a leisurely European Grand Tour without worrying that his company would be disintermediated before he crossed the Atlantic. But today, Wall Street billionaires can be reduced to mere millionaires in a few months, and dot-com entrepreneurs can go from flip-flops to Gucci loafers and back again in a single business cycle. 
 In addition, Veblen saw the economy as a zero-sum game, as ''the accumulation of wealth at the upper end of the pecuniary scale implies privation at the lower end of the scale.'' But he wrote before the income tax, before the minimum wage and Social Security, and just before Andrew Carnegie threw himself into the kind of industrial-scale charity now embraced by many tycoons. The same human pressures that push the wealthy to consume conspicuously also impel them to make large, showy philanthropic gestures. These days, prestige accrues not just to those who jet off to Africa on safari, but to those who jet off to Africa to build a school in an impoverished village. 
 In the contemporary money culture, to be at leisure, to be idle, is to be irrelevant. After Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch, John Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill, was pushed out, in part because he insisted on going skiing at Vail over Christmas and wanted to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos amid the company's continuing crisis. A great many people can afford not to work and could spend their time shuttling between multiple homes, eating fabulous meals and playing golf. Yet they continue to work around the clock. Of course, the private jet, the BlackBerry and the Internet allow people to do all of the above. But among Type-A, self-made members of the leisure class, there's a sort of reverse prestige associated with leisure. At Davos, which is filled with conspicuous consumers, the only people who ski are the journalists.

HEADLINE: His 50 First Dates (Or in Her Case, 3)

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: generationb@nytimes.com

DATELINE: COPAKE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 IN July 2006, Ron James's marriage of 13 years ended, and that same month, he joined JDate, an online matchmaking site for Jewish singles. ''I'd fallen off the horse and felt the best strategy was trying to get right back on,'' he said.
 Mr. James, 48, was a social worker at a nursing home, and he threw himself into JDating as if he were one of his clients in need of intensive case management. He signed up to meet all women ages 30 to 50 who lived within 50 miles of his Westchester apartment, including Manhattan. ''I was maximizing my search,'' he said. ''I'd work at it two to three hours a night.'' He described himself in his Web profile as ''warm, honest and authentic,'' as striving to exercise his body and mind, and as wanting marriage, ''but no game players please.''
 On his first JDate, he was sure he'd found Miss Right. They met at a diner. She was attractive, artistic, easy to talk to. ''I was so excited, I thought 'My JDate days are over.' '' Their second date, ''she turned on me, snapped at me, I didn't even know what I did wrong.'' 
 ''I was discouraged but not discouraged,'' he said. ''That was part of managing this like a business. Never put all your eggs in one basket.''
 In 18 months, he e-mailed 500 to 600 women and dated 40 to 50. On a social worker's salary, it became expensive: the train to Grand Central Terminal, the dates, a $39.99 monthly JDate fee. 
 So he used economies of scale. He'd do as many as three dates on a Sunday at three Starbucks within a few blocks of Grand Central. ''I was trying to make it affordable, yet retain some sense of integrity,'' Mr. James said. ''I'd do the first one at 10 or 11, then break for lunch.'' He'd eat alone to hold down costs, then go to a second Starbucks for a second date. ''I didn't want to bump into the first woman again,'' he said. ''I didn't want anyone feeling bad.''
 He followed this routine every other week. ''I needed time off for rejuvenation,'' he said. ''It was pretty stressful.''
 Over that year and a half, he said, there were women he met who lied about their age, posted photos that were 10 years old, misrepresented their jobs and pretended to be more successful than they were. ''A lot of the photos didn't look like them,'' he said. ''I learned to watch out for sunglasses.''
 He dated one woman several times. ''She was funny, reasonably attractive, we did a lot of Starbucks. I kept hoping a bolt of lightning might strike and I'd be in love.''
 A few became friends. ''Internet dating in the 21st century is a hard process,'' he said. ''We'd communicate and support each other.'' Through the worst, he never let his JDate membership lapse. ''I was addicted,'' he said. ''I kept getting back on the horse.''
 Spark Networks, the owner of JDate, runs 32 dating sites -- for Greek singles, Catholics, African-Americans, Asians, Seventh-day Adventists -- but none does as well as JDate. In the first quarter of 2009, JDate's national and international sites accounted for $7.6 million of the company's $12 million revenue.
 JDate is the oldest of the company's services, which partly explains its success. But it has also been embraced by Jewish leaders, fearful of the high rate of intermarriage -- 47 percent of Jews who married from 1996 to 2001 married outside their faith, according to the most recent figures available from the National Jewish Population Survey.
 JDate offers group discounts to rabbis buying memberships in bulk.
 And while the company's home page photos mostly depict 20-somethings, the reality is that one-quarter of users are baby boomers.
 Karen Shore, 54, a medical school administrator in New York City, was a pioneer, first using JDate in 1997. ''It was something you kept secret, an embarrassment,'' she said. For years, she wouldn't post her photo. ''You didn't want wackos coming after you.''
 Now, it's so mainstream that Cheryl Rosenhack, 57, a quality systems manager from New Jersey, received a six-month subscription as a gift. Optimism helps. Michael Blattman, 58, a Westchester businessman, has been on three years, signing up for 30 days at a time, though he'd save by buying a six-month package. ''Every month I think I'll find someone by the 31st day,'' he said. ''Call me delusional, but I don't want to be a pessimist.''
 Sheryl Daija, now 44, divorced in 2006 after 13 years of marriage, but didn't JDate until late 2007. She enjoyed being single and was changing. She left a 6-figure, 60-hour-a-week job in Internet advertising to start a Web site on global social activism, the Power of Peace. She rented out her Manhattan apartment and moved here to Columbia County, to her three-bedroom country home up a dirt road and overlooking a small lake.
 During three months on JDate, she was surprised by how many 20-somethings contacted her, seeking an older woman. She was tempted, until they exchanged e-mail messages. ''They'd say things like, 'I can't believe how drunk my friends and I got last night.' '' She heard from retired men who sounded tired. She even spoke to a few JDaters who confessed to not being Jewish. 
 She spoke to many by phone, eliminated most, met two in person, and saw one a half-dozen times. ''He wanted commitment, but I just couldn't put my finger on what he did for a living ...''
 She planned her third JDate for Jan. 13, 2008. She felt his profile wasn't as braggy as many, thought his photo looked cute. He seemed to have lots of energy, and she liked that he worked in a helping profession -- most men she'd known were in business. She apologized for having just an hour before seeing a show and he said an hour was perfect.
 He suggested a Starbucks.
 Ms. Daija didn't know it, but she was Mr. James's second JDate that day. The first did not go well. In a moment of weakness, he'd agreed to see a woman who wore sunglasses in her photo.
 At Starbucks, Mr. James was struck by Ms. Daija's looks. Her JDate photo was taken swimming, with no makeup.
 ''You look exactly like your picture,'' he said.
 ''Is that a good or bad thing?'' she asked.
 ''That's a very good thing,'' Mr. James said. The hour flew. ''I was with somebody who brought out the old bohemian in me, that I lost after I got married,'' Mr. James said. She wore torn jeans. ''A very cool look,'' Mr. James said. ''I said this is my kind of granola head.''
 ''We just spoke and spoke,'' Ms. Daija said. Later, she told a friend, ''It exceeded my expectations.''
 ''There was a freshness in the air,'' Mr. James said. He watched those torn jeans sway as she walked away and thought, ''Mmm-mmm.''
 He was flying to Florida to see his parents, so they didn't get together again for a few weeks. She called and wished him a safe flight. ''That was it,'' Mr. James said. ''That anyone cares that I got somewhere safe ...''
 By the second date, nothing was off limits. ''We just spoke for hours,'' Ms. Daija said. ''We sat on a couch and he asked if he could hold my hand -- it was so cute.''
 He e-mailed when he got home that evening: ''Hope you thought the date was decent.''
 She did. By the third date he brought the guitar he hadn't played for years, and by the fifth date they knew they'd marry. At some point they discovered that they'd both been married the first time on the same date -- May 30, 1993. This time they were married on the same date, Jan. 13, 2009, but to each other.
 They live in the house by the lake. She does her Web work from home, he's taken a new job, as a psychotherapist, a half-hour commute away.
 ''Every day when I leave for work, she says, 'Drive safely,' '' Mr. James said. ''It warms my heart.''
 ''Does it really?'' Ms. Daija asked.
 ''That anyone cares,'' Mr. James said.

HEADLINE: Safety Net Is Fraying for the Very Poor

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Government ''safety net'' programs like Social Security and food stamps have pulled growing numbers of Americans out of poverty since the mid-1990s. But even before the current recession, these programs were providing less help to the most desperately poor, mainly nonworking families with children, according to a new study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a private group in Washington.
 The recession is expected to raise poverty rates, economists agree, although the impact is being softened by the federal stimulus package adopted this year, which temporarily expanded measures like food stamps, child tax credits, unemployment benefits and housing and tuition aid. 
 In view of the gloomy employment report last week, economists are debating whether to increase stimulus funds over all. But in a side argument, poverty experts are also asking whether elements of the package aimed at the most vulnerable Americans should be extended beyond their scheduled expiration in two years or even made permanent. 
 The new safety-net study found that federal aid programs had helped tens of millions of Americans stay afloat in recent years, especially those with low-end jobs who benefited from rising tax credits. 
 Going into the recession that began in late 2007, however, ''the safety net was already enfeebled for jobless families,'' said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the center on budget priorities and author of the new study. 
 ''It's a good thing we have the stimulus package,'' Mr. Sherman said. ''But what happens to the most vulnerable families in two years, when most of the provisions expire?''
 On Thursday, the Labor Department announced that unemployment had crept to 9.5 percent. The rate is far higher among blacks and Hispanics. 
 Even after growth resumes, all signs are that the recession's impacts will be protracted, said Harry J. Holzer, a labor economist at Georgetown University. ''We'll not only see an increase in poverty and unemployment, but those numbers are not going to improve quickly,'' Mr. Holzer said. ''I think it will be important to extend some of the provisions of the stimulus plan beyond 2010.'' 
 The recession and the stimulus package have brought ''a new focus on the need for expanding and modernizing the social safety net,'' said Sheldon Danziger, an economist and professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. 
 Mr. Danziger said the overhaul of cash welfare since 1996, aimed at pushing single mothers into jobs, ''makes sense when unemployment is 5 percent.'' 
 ''But if you are out of work, the welfare system in a time of recession doesn't have anything to offer,'' he said. 
 In a recent paper, Mr. Danziger and Maria Cancian, professor of public affairs and social work at the University of Wisconsin, argued that because of changes in the economy, in the population and in social policy, economic growth per se did less to reduce poverty than it used to. Specific efforts to raise low-end wages, support working parents with child care and tax credits and raise education levels will be vital to reducing poverty, they said. 
 In the new study of the safety net, the center on budget priorities used a broader method for calculating poverty rates than is used by the federal government in its annual assessments, including the value of food stamps, housing subsidies and tax credits as income, but also adjusting for the local cost of housing. 
 The study found that federal aid in 2005 had reduced the number of Americans living in poverty, under this expanded definition, by 44 percent -- lifting 31 million people above the poverty line. But it also found that as aid programs were increasingly aimed at supporting work, fewer of the worst-off, jobless families were pulled out of the deepest poverty, defined as an income below half the poverty line. 
 Douglas Besharov, an economist at the University of Maryland, said that while aid programs had undeniably reduced poverty, the 31 million number was overstated. Noting that the largest group helped was retirees receiving Social Security, Mr. Besharov said that in the expectation of benefits, some cling to larger houses or transfer assets to children, making their incomes lower than they would otherwise be. 
 The figures for families in ''deep poverty,'' too, may be misleading, Mr. Besharov and others say. In surveys, it appears that some people are eking by on almost nothing. But some have off-the-books income or receive aid from housemates or relatives that is never recorded.

HEADLINE: Twice as Much Art as Last Year

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
Lesser-known and less established art fairs have not been well patronized of late, given the state of the economy. But ArtHamptons hopes to defy the odds, returning for a second year to a two-acre field behind the Bridgehampton Historical Society on Montauk Highway. Here the fair's organizers have created a temporary exhibition hall for galleries and guests using large temperature-controlled modular buildings. 
 This year's fair, July 10 through 12, is slightly larger than the inaugural event, with more than 60 high-end dealers from the United States, Canada and Europe showing paintings, drawings, sculpture and photography from the late 19th century to the present. 
 The organizer, Rick Friedman, estimates that this year dealers are bringing $200 million worth of art, twice as much as last year. There were sales of $20 million in 2008, Mr. Friedman said. 
 Highlights this year include one of Andrew Wyeth's ''Helga'' paintings, priced at $15 million at Peter Marcelle Contemporary, of Southampton, and works by Joan Miro and Fernand Leger at Waterhouse & Dodd, a London dealer. 
 In addition to such trophy pieces, dealer displays will include group and solo shows, with the work ranging from relatively inexpensive pieces by young artists to minor but generally more costly ones by established and historical figures, including William Glackens, Childe Hassam, Robert Henri, Georgia O'Keeffe, Fairfield Porter, Larry Rivers and Augustus Saint-Gaudens. 
 This year the fair is presenting a Lifetime Achievement Award for painting to the artist Jane Wilson, who lives in nearby Water Mill, and photography awards to Elliott Erwitt and Lillian Bassman. Ms. Wilson's landscapes are inspired by the beaches of the East End of Long Island; her work is represented at ArtHamptons by DC Moore Gallery, of New York. 
 More than 5,000 visitors attended the inaugural fair, and the organizers say they expect a similar number this year. Free parking is available in an adjacent field.
 ArtHamptons will run July 10 and 11 from noon to 7 p.m. and July 12 from noon to 6 p.m. Admission is $20. Bridgehampton Historical Society, 2368 Montauk Highway (corner of Corwith Avenue). Information: (631) 283-5505 or arthamptons.com.

HEADLINE: Tax Appeals Taking a Toll On Localities

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Homeowners across the country are challenging their property tax bills in droves as the value of their homes drop, threatening local governments with another big drain on their budgets.
 The requests are coming in record numbers, from owners of $10 million estates and one-bedroom bungalows, from residents of the high-tax enclaves surrounding New York City, and from taxpayers in the Rust Belt and states like Arizona, Florida and California, where whole towns have been devastated by the housing bust. 
 ''It's worthy of a Dickens story,'' said Gus Kramer, the assessor in Contra Costa County, Calif., outside San Francisco. ''These people are desperate. They know their home's gone down in value. They've watched their neighborhoods being boarded up. They literally stand in there and say: 'When can I have my refund check? I need to feed my family. I need to pay my electric bill.' ''
 The tax appeals and reassessments present a new budget nightmare for governments. In a survey conducted by the National Association of Counties, 76 percent of large counties said that falling property tax revenue was significantly affecting their budgets, said Jacqueline Byers, the association's research director. 
 Officials in some states say their property tax revenue is falling for the first time since World War II.
 The recession has already taken a significant toll on states' budgets, as rising joblessness, a weak business climate and a drop in consumer demand have cut sharply into receipts from taxes on sales, personal income and business earnings. 
 The pain at the state level is trickling down to county and local governments. To compensate, about 10 percent of large counties are raising the tax rates associated with home values to minimize the revenue loss, the county association said. 
 Even so, most counties simply have to absorb the lost revenue. Municipalities are laying off workers, renegotiating labor contracts, freezing salaries and cutting services.
 The revenue losses are coming as homeowners prod towns for new assessments, and as municipalities conduct regular revaluations of their real estate. While declining residential values weigh heaviest on many governments, the value of commercial real estate is also sliding as businesses shut down and move out of storefronts or shopping malls.
 Property taxes are meted out by a disparate patchwork of cities, towns, counties, and school and fire districts, all with their own rules. Because tax formulas vary widely county to county, not every decrease in assessed values automatically lowers a household's property taxes.
 But officials across the country say there is no question that the number of appeals has risen from the usual trickle to a flood.
 In suburban Atlanta, thousands of people lined up at government offices to file their requests for reassessments before a March 31 deadline. In parts of Ohio, appeals have multiplied fivefold. Tax lawyers in the northern suburbs of New York say they have never been so busy, and some towns have hired extra employees to sift through the paperwork and are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees to deal with the cases in tax courts.
 The call for counties to acknowledge the falling price of homes is loudest in states where taxes are highest, or the housing crisis has hit the hardest.
 ''We've been absolutely getting killed,'' said Robert W. Singer, the mayor of Lakewood Township, N.J., and a state senator, whose town is setting aside $2 million to pay tax refunds to homeowners. ''We've never had this before. Usually they're undervalued. Now, everyone's overvalued.''
 The appeals are not just coming from individual homeowners. Condominium associations and entire subdivisions are pushing for new tax assessments, as are companies that own office towers, industrial parks and shopping malls. 
 New Jersey, which has the nation's highest property taxes, has been besieged by tax appeals from homeowners like Peggy Tombro, whose rambling home in Bound Brook is assessed at a value of $1.8 million but is languishing on the market with an asking price of $1.3 million. Her taxes are increasing to $53,000 a year.
 ''I don't know what else to do,'' said Ms. Tombro, 63, who has gone back to work selling antiques to pay her tax bill.
 In the Inland Empire of California, near Los Angeles, Joylette Lynch, 70, is challenging the assessed value of her home as she tries to scrape together $1,158 a month to pay her mortgage, taxes and other bills. Her two-bedroom house in a community for older residents was worth as much as $280,000 three years ago, but houses on her block are now selling for less than $100,000.
 ''If the house is not worth what I bought it for, why am I paying the same amount in taxes?'' she asked.
 Ms. Lynch, meanwhile, lost her job at a Bed, Bath & Beyond this year, and is behind on her mortgage payments. Shaving a few hundred dollars off her annual tax bill of $4,300 might not keep her out of foreclosure, but it would help, she said.
 ''Everything's in God's hands now,'' she said.
 Officials say stories like these are common as unemployment hits 9.5 percent and people seek to trim their budgets. Appraisers and assessors, normally concerned with land values and comparable sales, are becoming ersatz crisis counselors.
 Jeff Furst, the appraiser in St. Lucie County, Fla., said a 62-year-old man recently walked into his office and described how his wife had been laid off and his salary had been cut in half. He was struggling to pay his taxes and looking for relief, Mr. Furst said.
 ''We're hearing from people like this every day,'' Mr. Furst said. In St. Lucie, which sits along the Atlantic, property tax revenue is expected to fall 20 percent, and tax appeals are 10 times as high as they are normally. ''Most people are going to see a significant decline in their tax bill.''
 Mr. Kramer, the assessor in Contra Costa County, said homeowners started swamping his office with requests for new assessments in December. As many as 500 people would call in one day. His voice mail message now begins: ''If you're calling to request an informal review of your property value due to the declining real estate market.''
 Contra Costa has now reduced the recorded value of more than a third of the 350,000 privately owned properties in the county.
 Lisa Driscoll, the county's budget director, said property tax revenue had been growing about 8 to 9 percent a year but was now projected to decline 5 percent next year. The county has cut $50 million from its budget to offset the decline in real estate and other taxes.
 Bonnie Grassley's house in Fort Pierce, Fla., reflects the rise and fall of the broader economy. Its assessed value topped $153,000 in 2006, as Florida's housing market caught fire. Now, it is worth $77,500. 
 Though her tax bill is only $150 a month, Ms. Grassley is out of work, spending her savings, and says she hopes a reassessment will save a couple hundred dollars a year.
 ''My home means everything to me, and it's all I really have,'' Ms. Grassley said. ''I'm determined to keep it, come hell or high water. It's a terrible way to lose your home, just over taxes.''

HEADLINE: Connecticut: Feeding the Children

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Connecticut students were served nearly 1.4 million free breakfasts, lunches and suppers last summer, a record 11 percent increase from 2007. Now, state education officials are bracing for what could be their busiest season yet as the recession continues to shrink household budgets. 
 ''We began seeing an increase last summer,'' said Susan Bohuslaw of the Connecticut Department of Education, who oversees the summer food program. ''But this year we started getting calls from towns we've never heard from before.''
 Ms. Bohuslaw said there are more than 475 meal sites at schools, camps, parks and community centers across the state, compared with 443 last month. 
 There are also five new sponsors to run the summer food programs, including three school districts -- Bloomfield, West Hartford and Plainfield.
 In Bloomfield, where 46 percent of the 2,100 students qualify for the federal free and reduced-price lunch program, summer meals are being served at Metacomet Elementary School through Aug. 21. Dana Tice, Bloomfield's food services director, said that the district serves a daily average of 110 breakfasts and 160 lunches. 
 End Hunger Connecticut!, a statewide advocacy group, is also helping to open five new sites in the northeastern part of the state, where limited bus service has prevented some students from getting free meals in past years. The sites include the Putnam Town library and several low-income housing projects.

HEADLINE: It Takes a City To Help Open a Hotel

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
AS a child in the 1970s, Robert J. Lowe Jr., now the chief executive of the Lowe Hospitality Group, went with his parents to Marineland of the Pacific, an ocean-themed attraction in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.
 The park closed in 1987. Ten years later, Mr. Lowe, then working for his father, a real estate investor, returned to the 100-acre Marineland site, on a peninsula about 20 miles south of Los Angeles International Airport. 
 ''All the old parking lots were there, with weeds growing up and rusty old buildings,'' the younger Mr. Lowe recalled. 
 He and his father began making plans to replace the rotting hulks with a luxurious resort. 
 Last month, their $480 million hotel, the Terranea Resort, opened for business.
 But how much business remains to be seen. After 12 years of planning, the hotel, with 400 rooms and extensive recreational facilities, made its debut in what Mr. Lowe called ''the most challenging market since World War II.''
 ''People are still traveling,'' he said, ''but they're shopping very carefully.'' 
 According to Smith Travel Research, hotels in Los Angeles had an average occupancy of 63.6 percent in May, down 14 percentage points from a year earlier.
 To gain a foothold in that market, Terranea is offering rooms for as little as $145 a night.
 As the economy declined last fall, Mr. Lowe knew that there could be cash-flow challenges for the new hotel, and he began planning ahead. ''We weren't going to put ourselves in a position where we were going to open and then run out of cash a week later,'' he said in a recent telephone interview.
 In the months leading up to the opening, Mr. Lowe said he explored a number of ways ''to create some additional liquidity to fund operating losses in this tough environment.''
 As it turned out, the usual sources were not forthcoming. ''It's difficult and expensive to borrow in this market,'' Mr. Lowe said. 
 So Mr. Lowe looked for help closer to home. Rancho Palos Verdes, a city of about 40,000, had expected to collect a room tax of 10 percent, which it hoped would create a revenue stream of more than $4 million a year. 
 Lowe Hospitality asked the city to rebate the tax -- known as the transient occupancy tax -- for 10 years. Unless it received the rebate, company officials suggested, Terranea might not be able to open.
 After weeks of negotiation, the City Council approved a deal to rebate four-fifths of the hotel tax revenue to Terranea over 34 months, up to a total of $8.2 million. The agreement requires Lowe to repay the rebated tax, as well as interest, by the end of 2013, with a possible one-year extension.
 Douglas Stern was one of the council members who voted in favor of the rebate plan. ''In my mind, it was a very close call,'' Mr. Stern said, adding, ''We're not a bank.''
 Not everyone favored the arrangement. 
 Dennis McLean, the director of finance for Rancho Palos Verdes, wrote in a report that the deal was ''not fiscally prudent.'' He based his recommendation, in part, on a study by HVS, a hotel consulting company hired by the city. HVS told the city that ''economic recovery in the hospitality industry is not expected until 2013 at the earliest.'' That could mean at least four lean years for Terranea.
 Mr. Lowe said he agreed with HVS that the hotel industry ''won't completely stabilize'' until 2012 or 2013. But he predicted that ''things will begin turning around long before that.'' 
 The Lowe Hospitality Group, a division of Lowe Enterprises, where Robert J. Lowe Sr. is the chief executive, operates more than 30 hotels, including the Inn and Spa at Loretto in Santa Fe, N.M., and the Driskill Hotel in Austin, Tex.
 Residents who spoke at the council meetings were largely in favor of the rebate, according to Ken Dyda, a former mayor of Rancho Palos Verdes. ''At each meeting, two or three people opposed it, mainly on philosophical grounds,'' he said. But most people, he said, ''wanted Terranea to get off to a good start.''
 Mr. Dyda says he thinks that Terranea would have opened even without the rebate. ''You can't take a $480 million facility and just close it down,'' he said. 
 BUT he said he was worried that the hotel might be making its debut without all the services that guests expected, including formal and informal restaurants and a 50,000-square-foot spa. ''And that wouldn't have helped Terranea or the city,'' he said. (The hotel did, in fact, open with all the amenities.)
 As part of the deal, which the council approved on a 4-to-0 vote, Lowe agreed to give Rancho Palos Verdes residents a 25 percent discount at the hotel.
 At the same time it is working to fill hotel rooms, Lowe is trying to sell the 82 condominiums on the resort property. Mr. Lowe said 49 of the units had been reserved, at prices from $2 million to $4.5 million. But closings have yet to begin and, he conceded, ''there will be some fallout.''
 ''A lot of people don't have the same financial capability they had three years ago,'' he added. ''Including me.'' 
 Still, Mr. Lowe said, he is glad that Terranea opened this spring instead of a year ago. 
 ''If we had opened in 2008, we would have been caught off guard by the market,'' he said. ''At least we had a year of preparing ourselves for the market that we were in, rather than being surprised.''

HEADLINE: Fish Store Out of Water

BYLINE: By LAN SAMANTHA CHANG. 
Lan Samantha Chang, the director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, is the author of the story collection ''Hunger.''

DATELINE: Iowa City 

 BODY:
 A YEAR ago, the Iowa River broke through a levee three blocks from Ed Fisher's tropical fish store and wiped him out.
 Ed had opened Coralville Bay five years earlier. The store was named for its location off Highway 6, which links the town of Coralville to Iowa City. Coralville itself is named for the Devonian-era fossils in its foundation, reminders of another water-covered time long ago.
 Until last June, business was fine. Local doctors peered into his tanks for the fish that calmed their waiting rooms. Parents sought ''bread and butter'' fish -- guppies, goldfish. College boys bought piranhas. 
 Then there were customers whom Ed affectionately calls ''fish geeks.'' Some cultivate saltwater fish far from the ocean. ''It's a nice accomplishment,'' he explained, ''to say, 'I'm in the middle of Iowa and I can raise fish that thrive in South America.''' Among the fish geeks of Eastern Iowa, Ed was ''a bit known for carrying unusual and rare stuff.'' 
 Then the Flood of 2008 rolled in and left Ed and his neighbors under several feet of water.
 For business owners like Ed, last year's floods have virtually eclipsed the recession. He was unable to enter the building for two weeks. Without electricity to pump oxygen, most of his stock perished, including a tank of Amazonian discus fish valued at almost $2,000. Like many local business owners, Ed had no flood insurance. And to complete his desolation, the flood had left him homeless. Since he focused his efforts on trying to save his store, he managed to salvage only a few armfuls of clothing from his apartment. 
 But in the aftermath of the flood and even in this recession, Ed has found a way to survive. In Ed's case, recovery arose from the atypical business elements of luck, human kindness and a personal resilience borne of what he calls ''silver lining thinking.'' 
 ''You keep looking for silver linings,'' he said. ''You think, maybe this is the best time to get flooded. The economy did tank and you don't have the lost sales. Maybe, by the time you can get it put back together, the worst is over.''
 After all, some of the bread-and-butter fish did manage to survive. So did an outdoor tub of koi, buoyed up by floodwater and set down again without a drop of contamination. Ed considered these survivors signs of hope. 
 Ed's best friend put him up in her basement. The same friend helped him find a site to build a new store. It is a foot deeper into the flood plain, ''but the price was right.''
 Ed applied for emergency food stamps, which kept him going through the worst weeks. Friends as well as strangers heard the story of his bad luck. They sent small sums of money in the mail, no strings attached. Ed's sister's church took up a collection and sent him $1,500. The Iowa Chamber of Commerce gave him $2,500. 
 And then, around Thanksgiving, Ed found help that surpassed his imaginings. A United Way worker, Mark Martin, took Ed under his wing and asked what he needed to build a new store. The answer was human labor. Mark called in volunteers for a ''barn-raising.''
 ''They came from everywhere,'' Ed said. ''Tennessee, Michigan, Illinois, Colorado, Indiana. The first group was a bunch of college girls. The first day they didn't know one end of a hammer from another and by the end of the week they were like, 'You want this wall down? O.K.' It just lifted your spirits.''
 A few weeks ago, he began to stock fish in the new store. ''We've been ringing the register. We're seeing old customers, through word of mouth.'' Outside sits Ed's familiar van. Covered with fish decals and the name of the store, the van is the only major possession he managed to save. Its brakes are gone now, and its main function is to direct customers to the store. 
 Ed doesn't know how the recession is going to affect his comeback. The flood began our economic struggle a few months early, and it's hard to see one from the other. But he said: ''I'm in a honeymoon period. Right now, I'm probably feeling the recession less than most people.'' 
 Many neighboring businesses did not return. ''You look around the street and a lot of people weren't able to come back,'' he said. He counts himself as lucky. ''We're just a little goofy fish store and I think we're going to make it.''
 HOME ECONOMICS: On Thursday came disheartening news that 467,000 jobs were lost in June. The Op-Ed editors has asked four writers from around the country to provide quarterly snapshots of their local economies. Here are their second dispatches.

HEADLINE: Who Can Possibly Govern California?

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH. 
Mark Leibovich is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Times. He last wrote for the magazine about President Obama's press secretary.

 BODY:
Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, has an emergency button under his desk that was installed 30 years ago after former City Supervisor Dan White entered City Hall through a window and fatally shot Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. Not knowing what the button was for, Newsom kept pushing it on his first day in office, only to have three sheriffs rush in repeatedly.
 Newsom says he has not had occasion to press the button since, although the mayor admits he is tempted to whenever meetings drag on or when reporters ask him annoying questions or when he becomes bored, something that happens easily.
 I was sitting in Newsom's office in May, and the mayor was fidgeting behind his desk, which is neat except for a few side-by-side stacks of collated papers. These are what Newsom calls his CliffsNotes, part of an elaborate system of self-education he developed over several years. 
 Newsom struggled with severe dyslexia as a child and compensated by rereading, underlining, bracketing and scrawling comments in the margins. ''I just butcher a book,'' he explained to me. ''Everything I underline I assume is important to me.'' Interns type up what Newsom has underlined and produce a set of notes for him. ''Sometimes I will make CliffsNotes of my CliffsNotes,'' Newsom said. He described the practice as ''really pathetic.'' But it works for him and illustrates a larger point about people with learning disabilities: when a person struggles to learn in conventional ways, he said, you adapt ''in ways that can nurture creative solutions.'' Doing so can also promote ''audacious goals that many would dismiss as irrational.''
 That may well be the best description of Newsom's latest ambition: to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger as the governor of California even as the state is in the midst of one of its recurring cataclysms. They come along once or twice a decade, sparked by natural disaster or some fiasco of overcrowding (prisons, schools, roads) or shortage (water, energy, cash) or civic rebellion (taxes, cops, Gray Davis). California always seems to produce more spectacle than anywhere else in the country, and that goes for its meltdowns too. Calamity is just part of the equation here, as if God gave California so much glamour and grandeur and great weather that he had to throw in some apocalyptic menace to provide a little balance. Earthquakes, say. Or Sacramento.
 Californians, would-be governors included, have learned to take crises in stride. ''People have been declaring this place on the brink of extinction for decades,'' said Newsom, who was born in San Francisco and reared in the city and in the adjacent county of Marin. When I visited him in his office, Newsom, who is 41, had just finished rereading his notes on one of his favorite books about the state, ''Coast of Dreams: California on the Edge, 1990-2003,'' by Kevin Starr. Newsom's CliffsNotes for ''Coast of Dreams'' fill 77 pages. He gave me a set, after leafing through them to make sure he had not written anything embarrassing in the margins.
 ''California had become . . . a reality in search of a myth that had once been believed in,'' Starr writes in a passage highlighted by Newsom. ''That dream, in fact, had been the first and only premise of the Schwarzenegger campaign.'' Those days, in the early years of this decade, were the last time real life overwhelmed the state's ability to govern itself -- that's when voters recalled their governor, Gray Davis, and once again looked beyond ''reality,'' to Hollywood, for their next savior, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
 Six years on, California's political culture seems no less dysfunctional. The state's most urgent problem is its lumbering wreck of an economy. Not surprisingly, given California's size, more people have lost jobs and more homes have been foreclosed on and more big banks have failed here in the last year than in any other state in the country. The state faces a $24 billion deficit, and Schwarzenegger recently joked that his finance director has been placed ''on suicide watch.'' ''California's day of reckoning is here,'' Schwarzenegger said in a speech in early June, though in fact many Californians are convinced that the state is past its day of reckoning and that the governor is approaching his ''end of days.'' (Whatever his successes and failures, Schwarzenegger has at least nourished California politics with endless opportunities for movie allusions, double entendres and overall goofiness -- some of it occasionally clever.)
 Schwarzenegger still exudes a celebrity aura that transcends politics, no matter how unmanageable they are. Schoolchildren and tourists crowd hallways to glimpse him before he appears at the Capitol -- scenes that resemble red-carpet openings of ''Kindergarten Cop.'' Shrieks announce his arrivals. ''The Arnold alarm,'' one Statehouse reporter called it. There was no Gray Davis alarm.
 The former Mr. Universe has shrunk greatly in political stature, now that he has become ineligible for re-election (thanks to term limits), unpopular (a 33 percent approval rating) and incapable of asserting his will over an unyielding Legislature and ornery electorate. And there is a general recognition that Schwarzenegger's substantial assets proved no match for the daunting disorder of the state's politics, something even Schwarzenegger admitted to me recently: ''The bottom line is, even me as a celebrity governor -- even with that, I can't penetrate through certain things.''
 And yet, the governorship of California remains an oddly seductive job. It doesn't matter that the office has become a graveyard of political aspiration, that Davis was actually considered a rising national star at one time. State Attorney General Jerry Brown -- yes, that Jerry Brown -- recently called the job of California governor ''a career ender,'' which is notable given that Brown, a two-term former governor, now 71, seems intent on ending his career back in that office. Indeed, Brown is a big reason that the 2010 governor's race in California might be the most compelling political show in the nation next year. You have nationally known Democrats. You have socially moderate Republicans who favor abortion rights and, to varying degrees, gay rights (if not gay marriage itself), in a state whose traditional strains still run deep. And above all, you have a diverse and, to some degree, radically discordant group of candidates striving to win over one of the country's most disruptive places (the California of Silicon Valley and the counterculture) and one of its most conservative (the California of Reagan, Nixon and tax revolts). ''In a sense, the race to succeed Schwarzenegger is so fascinating because the competing souls of the state are all wrapped up in the candidates,'' is how the Los Angeles-based Democratic strategist Bill Carrick put it. ''You have the old and the new, the bizarre and the boring. Crisis does tend to bring it all to the fore.''
 Newsom, who earned a small fortune as a wine entrepreneur, became the eminence of the gay-marriage movement in 2004 when he authorized same-sex unions in San Francisco. He is vivacious and something of a political thrill-seeker -- a trait that extended to his personal life a few years ago when he had a potentially career-killing affair with the wife of a campaign manager and close friend (now former campaign manager and extremely former close friend). Newsom sees the job of governor as a potentially exhilarating high-wire act. ''We're in a moment of crisis that requires order-of-magnitude change, dramatic change,'' he told me. ''Candidly, if things were going very well, I don't think I'd be the best person for the job.''
 The nightmare-as-opportunity theme enables the candidates to show optimism and present themselves as saviors. ''Our democracy works best, unfortunately, in a crisis situation,'' said one of them, the Republican Steve Poizner, the state's insurance commissioner and a serial entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. ''These windows of opportunity for big structural reform don't come around that often.''
 Another Republican candidate, Meg Whitman, the former eBay C.E.O., presents herself as a parental antidote to chaos. That's why eBay's founder, Pierre Omidyar, hired her, she claims. ''Pierre said he was looking for adult supervision at eBay,'' Whitman said not long ago at a campaign appearance in San Jose. She criticizes Schwarzenegger for trying to ''boil the ocean,'' for being too ambitious. Whitman might be the early Republican favorite. A recent cover article in The Weekly Standard mentioned her as a future presidential candidate. Her campaign distributes a Fortune cover story for which she was photographed holding the reins of Brandy, a regal-looking horse, although an editor at Fortune later admitted that Brandy was in fact a rental horse and did not belong to Whitman. And the success and name recognition of eBay, the online-auction colossus, has generated a good deal of attention for Whitman. ''Well, that makes sense,'' Jay Leno said recently. ''I mean, the state's broke. If we're going to start selling stuff, who better to be governor than the head of eBay?''
 An unlikely grown-up in the field, Jerry Brown recently dubbed himself the Apostle of Common Sense. ''Governor is an important role, but a modest role,'' Brown told me this spring. ''You can't wear different kinds of socks.'' He was referring to the film director Francis Ford Coppola, who, according to Brown, wears mismatched socks just to be different. ''Whatever Coppola said might work for movie directors, it doesn't work for politics,'' Brown said. Once famous for dating pop singers and actresses, Brown is now married to his longtime girlfriend, Anne Gust Brown. (The Los Angeles Times recently called them the Ozzie and Harriet of the campaign.)
 The woman who officiated the Browns' wedding in 2005 was Senator Dianne Feinstein. She probably won't run for governor, but she is being coy enough that her presence hovers over the Democratic field. Until a couple of weeks ago, the same was true of Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles and, as one of the nation's best-known Hispanic elected officials, the presumptive wielder of the Hispanic voting bloc's growing power. With or without Villaraigosa or Feinstein, the 2010 race should fulfill one of California's most basic and enduring promises: It will be entertaining. So many people (12 percent of the American population), so many problems, so many stories -- tales of horror, of redemption, of twists and turns.
 IN EARLY JUNE, I drove to Sacramento from San Francisco to see Arnold Schwarzenegger. Going to California to write about politics and not seeing Arnold is like going to Disneyland and not seeing Mickey. Never mind that Schwarzenegger was the lamest of Donald Ducks or now just another familiar piece of political furniture. It was still an astounding thing -- for me, at least; maybe I'm shallow -- to stand in the presence of the real-life governor of Culi-fornia, bemoaning pawtisan bickering in his Austrian accent, looking totally excellent in a fitted gray suit, gold tie and impeccably coiffed (and increasingly orange) hair.
 ''Our wallet is empty,'' Schwarzenegger said in a speech a few days before my visit. ''Our bank is closed. Our credit is dried up.'' He called for cuts that would, among other things, eliminate health insurance for close to a million poor kids, stop welfare checks for more than half a million families and close 80 percent of the state's parks. Then he pivoted into empathy mode. ''I see the faces behind those dollars,'' Schwarzenegger said. ''I see the children whose teachers will be laid off. I see the Alzheimer's patients losing some of their in-home support services.''
 As I waited for Schwarzenegger in the lobby of the governor's office, I studied the official portraits of former governors, including those of Ronald Reagan, Earl Warren and Jerry Brown (boldly colored and cartoonish and considered so bizarre at the time it was painted that the Legislature initially refused to hang it). Suddenly I heard Schwarzenegger's unmistakable voice booming joyously as he led an entourage from his office.
 ''We are going to da beh, we are going to da beh,'' Schwarzenegger kept saying.
 Schwarzenegger's spokesman, Aaron McLear, translated: ''He is going out to the bear.'' That was the 450-pound bronze sculpture of a bear that Schwarzenegger fell in love with at an art gallery in Aspen last year. ''I just immediately had a vision of it in front of my office door, and having kids sitting around it, and people taking pictures,'' he told me.
 So that's where he was going, to meet a group of schoolchildren from Pacific Palisades. Kids surrounded the monumental specimens (Schwarzenegger, the bear). A member of the governor's security detail admonished one juvenile delinquent for making bunny ears over Arnold's head during the photos. ''Hasta la vista, baby,'' a few of the kids called after Schwarzenegger as he turned to leave.
 Schwarzenegger and I then repaired to a tent that he had put up in a courtyard next to his office, which allows him to smoke cigars legally at work (no smoking is allowed inside the Capitol). The tent is about 15 square feet, carpeted with artificial turf and outfitted with stylish furniture, an iPod, a video-conferencing terminal, trays of almonds, a chess table, a refrigerator and a large photo of the governor. Schwarzenegger reclined deeply in his chair, lighted an eight-inch cigar and declared himself ''perfectly fine,'' despite the fiscal debacle and personal heartsickness all around him. ''Someone else might walk out of here every day depressed, but I don't walk out of here depressed,'' Schwarzenegger said. Whatever happens, ''I will sit down in my Jacuzzi tonight,'' he said. ''I'm going to lay back with a stogie.''
 Size is important to Schwarzenegger, as befits a champion bodybuilder. The first thing he asked me was how long this article would be. ''About 9,000 words,'' I said, exaggerating slightly, wanting to impress him.
 ''It's a big story,'' he said, nodding, pleased. Schwarzenegger then relighted his cigar, using a lighter about the size of my hand. It was the biggest lighter I had ever seen, I told him, and he grinned, seeming glad that I had noticed. He flicked up another big orange flame, for special effect.
 Schwarzenegger spoke with relish about governing his gargantuan jurisdiction. ''Why do people go everyday up to Mount Everest?'' he said. ''I mean, think about it. You go there, and you look at this thing and you think, Isn't it just better to go up in the helicopter and land? Some people will say that.'' He loathes that impulse to take the easy way to the summit, only to ''take a picture and then go home.''
 Of course, Schwarzenegger himself now has legions of critics dismissing him as a political tourist who governs from a lavish tent, reduced to posing for photos while the state mocks him with the fiscal and governing equivalent of bunny ears. ''Schwarzenegger has been desperately trying to give people what they want, except that he has proven time and again that he has no idea what they want,'' Bruce Cain, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley, told me. ''The result is that he's a rudderless ship that has lost all credibility with his Republican base and that the Democrats don't trust because he turns on them.''
 Before I'd met Schwarzenegger, a few Californians told me that he was shorter in person than you would expect. But he didn't seem that short to me -- his listed height of 6-foot-1 seemed entirely plausible. It's possible that trying to govern California for six years creates the illusion of shrinkage.
 THE NIGHT BEFORE my trip to Sacramento, I found an unlikely Schwarzenegger defender in Jerry Brown. I went out for sushi in Oakland with Brown and his wife, Anne, not far from the home they share with their black labrador, Dharma. The three-time presidential candidate, former Oakland mayor and student of Zen meditation now has white sideburns and eyebrows and a smooth head (which Anne lovingly trims with clippers every few weeks). A few months ago he posted ''25 random things about me'' on his Facebook page, in which he revealed, among other things, his fondness for arugula, broccoli and Flax Plus multibran cereal. ''In 1958, I took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience,'' he also shared. ''Later, Pope John XXIII dispensed me from these obligations.''
 Brown credited Schwarzenegger with ''making the job of governor bigger.'' Brown linked Schwarzenegger to Ronald Reagan, another former actor, as someone who ''added size.'' I asked Brown if he added size to the governor's office during his two terms in Sacramento from 1975 to 1983.
 ''I don't know,'' he said. ''I added something.'' He paused to sip from a cup of sake. ''I would say that I added some . . . dimension to the job.''
 ''Dementia?'' Anne said, laughing.
 ''No, dimension,'' Jerry clarified.
 Even when the state seems to be caught in one of its death spirals, Californians still tend to view their predicament in airy, romantic terms. ''It's as much a state of mind as it is a state,'' Meg Whitman told me this spring after one of her campaign events. ''If the California dream is not alive, then there's an issue of how we think about ourselves as Americans.''
 It has been falling to Brown, once known as Governor Moonbeam, to bring the discussion back to earth. While other candidates evoke the ''myth'' and the ''dream'' and the ''epic disaster'' that is California, Brown is more likely to speak of ''the mundane quality of the enterprise,'' that enterprise being state government.
 Brown delights in deflating overblown rhetoric. Everything is deemed a ''crisis'' today, he said with a smirk. ''Instead of having 'stars,' at some point we had 'superstars.' Instead of having 'stores,' we had 'superstores.' So there is an escalation in the rhetoric because of the difficulty penetrating to the consumer.''
 To many casual observers, the return of Jerry Brown is the most amazing subplot of the 2010 campaign. Newsom was on Capitol Hill recently, and people kept asking him about Brown -- variations on Is he serious? ''Yes, totally serious'' was Newsom's answer. He clearly sees Brown as his chief Democratic competition, especially with Villaraigosa declining to enter the race.
 Brown is raising money, ostensibly for his re-election campaign for attorney general, but he is hinting strongly that it will be for a governor's bid. When I asked him what he thought of Newsom, he declined to answer, saying he would refrain from commenting on potential opponents. Brown has been reading George Orwell's essay on political language. He is circulating it to some staff members to promote simplicity of language: subject, verb, object. ''See Spot run,'' Brown said. ''See Jerry run?'' I countered. Brown shrugged.
 Brown has been ahead in early polls, largely because of name recognition (though he comes in second behind Feinstein when her name is included). He is so deeply enmeshed in California politics that it is impossible to circulate among even his potential opponents without stumbling onto some connection. His father, the former Gov. Pat Brown, was a close friend of Newsom's grandfather, and Jerry Brown appointed Newsom's father to two judgeships; Brown's wife, Anne, was chief administrative officer at the Gap and came to know Meg Whitman when she served on that company's board. It's worth noting, also, for symmetry's sake, that Brown acquired his Moonbeam nickname in the 1970s after he proposed that California launch a satellite into space for emergency communications -- and two decades later, Steve Poizner, a Republican candidate now, started a company that put G.P.S. devices into cellphones.
 Because he is already well known, Brown can bide his time. His campaign basically consists of Jerry and Anne, some guy (Ned) Anne used to work with at the Gap and Dharma (''our attack dog,'' in Anne's words). ''Richard Nixon once said to me, 'Don't peak too soon,' '' Brown said. ''And I think that was good advice.'' In the same conversation, he added, Nixon told him he would go far ''because you're interesting.''
 Brown hardly sounds nostalgic about the governor's job. ''You're basically a flak-catcher, or a pincushion,'' he told me. No one pays any attention to State of the State speeches. You have this big inauguration party, and all your friends come -- ''and then they leave because no one lives in Sacramento.'' The governor becomes invisible. ''It's like that game -- what do you call it? Where's . . . where's . . . Nemo.''
 ''Where's Nemo?'' Anne said. ''You mean Where's Waldo?''
 ''Yeah, Waldo,'' Jerry said. ''It's like that.''
 ONE OF THE recurring buzzwords in California today is ''ungovernable.'' Nowhere does it apply better than to the mud slogs that are the state's annual budget deliberations.
 In the view of many, the origins of the mud slog began with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, the landmark referendum that capped property taxes. ''Over 50 percent of our revenue is dependent on personal income tax, and that's a very important part of explaining the boom-and-bust cycle,'' according to another Republican candidate for governor, Tom Campbell, an immaculately credentialed policy marvel who graduated from Harvard Law School magna cum laude and who later studied under the conservative economist Milton Friedman before going on to represent Silicon Valley for five terms in the United States Congress.
 This dependence on income tax was the first thing Dianne Feinstein mentioned when I asked her to assess California's problems. ''In most states, it's one-third property tax, one-third sales tax and one-third income tax,'' Feinstein said. ''It's 55 percent income tax in California. And 45 percent of that comes from the top brackets.''
 When the economy is booming, the stock market soaring and jobs abundant, relying on income taxes is not a problem. That was the case in the years after Schwarzenegger first became governor in 2003, and he was hailed as a ''postpartisan'' leader who cut taxes and appealed to Democrats by aggressively tackling issues like global warming. But in today's cratering economy -- in which California faces a decline in personal income for the first time since 1938 and unemployment sits at 11.5 percent -- the state's coffers have shriveled up quickly, along with the governor's popularity.
 Passing a budget or increasing revenues in California is dicey in the best of times. The state constitution requires that two-thirds of the Legislature agree on a budget or higher taxes -- the kind of overwhelming political consensus, in other words, usually reserved for amendments to the federal Constitution. (California is one of just a handful states that require a two-thirds vote to pass a budget.) 
 Complicating matters further, the major parties in California are both effectively controlled by their most partisan elements, a byproduct of gerrymandered voting districts that force lawmakers to appeal to their ideological bases. After many earlier failed efforts, a ballot initiative championed by Schwarzenegger finally passed last year that will redraw the districts. But that won't take effect until after the 2010 census, so for now the two parties are largely controlled by what Bruce Cain at Berkeley calls ''the Taliban.'' The result? Gridlock in Sacramento, a standoff between the parties of ''no more taxes'' (Republicans) and ''no more cuts'' (Democrats).
 Even in the most desperate circumstances, when you might expect the two sides to make common cause, their attempts at working together are comical, or sad. In the middle of June, Schwarzenegger sent a melon-size sculpture of bull testicles to the leader of the Democratic-controlled senate, Darrell Steinberg, to encourage lawmakers to find the requisite fortitude to close the budget deficit. Not amused, Steinberg returned the ''gift'' to the governor.
 ''We should all be on the same team, but we are on different teams,'' Schwarzenegger lamented to me. ''The system is set up to fail.''
 California's leaders also complain about voters' ability to assert their will directly through the state's freewheeling system of ballot initiatives. In effect, anybody with money can circumvent the Legislature by putting something to a statewide plebiscite, something that has happened 71 times in the last decade, according to Mark Baldassare, the head of the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research firm. ''The use of the ballot box to make fiscal policy is used much more often in California than in other large states,'' Baldassare told me.
 So great is the frustration among the state's political class that a movement has been building to call a constitutional convention -- to tear up the existing 130-year-old document and start over. ''This is an effort born of the fact that the state has become ungovernable,'' said Jim Wunderman, the president of the Bay Area Council, who is leading the effort. It is too soon to know how a convention would work, Wunderman told me. Schwarzenegger says he supports the movement. ''It's like an intersection where people keep crashing into each other,'' Schwarzenegger said, referring to the rules of the political road in California. ''We're saying: 'Hey, let's stop. Let's put up some new signs and stop this madness.' ''
 The sentiment seems to be widely shared. The state is ''failing'' (Whitman), ''deteriorating'' (Poizner) and ''a total mess'' (Newsom). ''Why in the world would you want to be governor?'' Whitman asks at her campaign events. Even President Obama, at a dinner in Washington a couple of weeks ago, joked that Schwarzenegger would be starring in a new reality series, ''I'm a Celebrity . . . Get Me Out of Here!''
 Whenever I mentioned Schwarzenegger to the masochists who covet his job, they responded variously with sympathy, qualified praise and backhanded compliments. ''I think he's done the very best that he could in a very difficult situation,'' Tom Campbell told me. In a somewhat patronizing way, Whitman said, ''You know, there's a lot I like about Governor Schwarzenegger.'' (Her tone was reminiscent of that ''Not that there's anything wrong with that'' episode of ''Seinfeld.'')
 There is some consensus among people in both parties that Schwarzenegger has been genuine in his commitment to changing the system, particularly as it relates to fiscal policy. ''He has done a very good job of getting the reform movement started,'' Poizner told me. Likewise, many Democrats say the governor has been more than sincere in his attempts to work with them (even hiring one of their own as his chief of staff). For the most part, though, Schwarzenegger is held up as the emblem of how impossible the job has become. He seemed to come in with every advantage -- no debts to special interests, a nonideological orientation and a big, charismatic personality. ''To see that he's incapable of pulling this thing off suggests that you have a systemic problem, a governance problem,'' Newsom told me.
 AS A CANDIDATE and as a mayor, Newsom is sensitive about being defined by gay marriage. ''It's an introductory piece,'' he told me, referring to how the issue made his name. Much of his rhetoric is geared to amplifying his broader portfolio. He speaks constantly about the environment and technology initiatives, which he presents as cornerstones of his leadership approach. In mid-June, for instance, Newsom's office announced that San Franciscans could now get all kinds of information about recycling on their iPhones. ''Instead of dumping old electronics or furniture on the sidewalk, the EcoFinder iPhone app tells you where these materials should go, based on your location,'' the statement read. Newsom and his aides expend a great deal of energy touting how incredibly deft they are with the latest new-media playthings -- YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and the like.
 While generally considered a liberal by people outside of San Francisco, Newsom has not shied from confronting the left with tough love. Shortly after he was elected in 2003, Newsom implemented his controversial ''Care Not Cash'' program, which essentially ended direct payments to homeless people and put the money into service agencies instead. He talks often about the need for ''order of magnitude'' change in state government and has been the most full-throated of the candidates in his support for a constitutional convention.
 But the issue of gay marriage always finds Newsom, and often at high volumes. Protesters yell passages at him from the book of Leviticus -- namely the two verses that seem to prohibit gay sex. ''So I went out and researched my Leviticus,'' said Newsom, who was brought up Roman Catholic and now calls himself an ''Irish-Catholic rebel.'' With a big and satisfied grin, he read aloud some other directives from his CliffsNotes on Leviticus. ''It says that I may possess many slaves, male and female, as long as they are purchased from nearby nations,'' Newsom said with a laugh. He went on: ''It forbids me from having contact with a woman while she is in a period of menstrual uncleanliness.''
 Newsom's identification with same-sex marriage is a mixed bag, politically speaking. It should help him among Democrats, 68 percent of whom opposed Proposition 8. It engendered good will among liberals and gay rights advocates nationally, a great source of donations. But the issue also made him a ready lightning rod. One of Newsom's low points occurred at a rally celebrating a California Supreme Court ruling in favor of gay marriage in May 2008. ''This door's wide open now,'' a grinning Newsom said, seeming to deride the opposition as the crowd cheered. ''It's gonna happen, whether you like it or not.'' It became an oft-replayed sound bite for supporters of Proposition 8.
 ''I'll never say that again -- I learned my lesson,'' Newsom promised at a town-hall meeting in Fresno in April. Fresno is the kind of mid-California heartland city where Newsom might not be expected to present well. ''They all said, 'Good luck when you go to Fresno,' '' Newsom said at the town meeting. ''The issue of marriage equality . . . you can't win. The state rejects it.''
 A fifth-generation Californian, Newsom says that he has an intuitive sense of the state and has lived ''the California dream.'' ''It's nature-nurture, right?'' he said. ''I've been nurtured by Californians.'' Bill Newsom, Gavin's father, was a well-connected judge who had ties to the Getty family of oil fame as well as to the Brown political dynasty. Bill Newsom was also close to Willie Brown, the longtime speaker of the California Assembly. After Willie Brown became mayor of San Francisco in 1996, he appointed Newsom -- who had expanded his wine store, PlumpJack, into a lucrative chain of businesses in the city -- to the San Francisco Parking and Traffic Commission, and later to the city Board of Supervisors. When Newsom ran for mayor in 2003, he emphasized his business background. His opponent portrayed him as a child of privilege, which became -- and to a point remains -- a caricature. ''Prince Gavin,'' he was christened by Calbuzz, a popular California political Web site.
 But Newsom's relationship to money is more nuanced than that. He grew up with little, in large part because his father had a well-intentioned but self-destructive penchant for giving it away. Bill and Tessa Newsom divorced after only five years of marriage, leaving Tessa to rear Gavin (then 4) and his sister, Hilary. For extra cash, Tessa took in boarders and foster children. ''My mother -- it's not one of those waxing-poetic kind of things -- she literally worked two or three jobs most of her life,'' Newsom said. ''So I personally experienced that, even though I had these great friends and associations who had unlimited amounts of money. That juxtaposition was an interesting one.''
 Tessa Newsom died of breast cancer at 55 in 2002, just as her son's political career was taking off. The day before she died, she urged him not to run for mayor.
 ''THANK GOD FOR West Virginia and Mississippi,'' Meg Whitman declared at the Hyatt in Long Beach, where she was speaking to a group of local Chamber of Commerce types. (All of her campaign events appear to be held in the exact same ballroom, whether they are in a Radisson, a Hyatt or a Doubletree.) She was talking about two states that rank below California in some categories of public education.
 Whitman is probably the early leader in the ''Why This Place Is Such a Mess'' campaign. The state is ''bleeding jobs,'' she says. It is ''effectively bankrupt.'' It is rated ''the 50th in the nation to do business with.'' Test scores in public schools are plummeting. At the end of her presentation, her hosts gave Whitman a sea-lion sculpture that had to weigh 40 pounds or so. She could barely lift it. When I asked Whitman if she planned to sell it on eBay, she said no and vowed to find a place for it in her living room, at least until the governor's office became available.
 Before eBay, Whitman worked in marketing -- for Ivory shampoo at Procter & Gamble and Mr. Potato Head at Hasbro. She gained an appreciation for the power of branding, which she says she can apply seamlessly to politics. She admires, for instance, how Barack Obama's presidential campaign was a model of this. ''We do focus groups today, and if you say 'Barack Obama,' people still say 'Change you can believe in,' '' she told me. Whitman's campaign message is ''A New California.'' (''Thank God for West Virginia and Mississippi'' didn't test well, apparently.)
 Both Whitman and Steve Poizner are Silicon Valley billionaires who promise to bring private-sector discipline to state government. Poizner has been critical of Whitman and dismissive of her stewardship of eBay. ''We don't need to be rebranded, like some people are pitching,'' Poizner told me. ''The state needs to be rebuilt.'' He emphasized his own background as an engineer and entrepreneur and compared it with that of Whitman, who worked at established firms and took over an existing one in the case of eBay.
 Poizner faces many obstacles. For starters, he is the state's insurance commissioner, which is hardly an electoral launching pad. He also looks like a state insurance commissioner (bookish, with a beakish nose) and is little-known, and his name sounds like ''poison.''
 But Poizner says he will spend ''what is necessary'' on the 2010 race, and he offers a compelling story of having lived the Silicon Valley dream of starting businesses and getting really rich after moving to California from his native Texas. After cashing in his software and telecommunications businesses, Poizner spent the 2002 school year teaching government to 12th graders at a high school in East San Jose. That's where he asked me to meet him, obviously to evoke his year of giving back, but the students were on break, and the school was abandoned, so we sat down at a sun-drenched table in an empty courtyard. The insurance commissioner then itemized his anything-but-sunny assessment of California:
 ''Three thousand people are leaving this state every day.''
 ''This has become a no man's land for new tech jobs. . . . Google, Cisco, Intel -- they've all pretty much said, 'California, no way.' ''
 ''Eighty percent of people here think the state's on the wrong track.''
 ''There's a huge consensus that the state is broken.''
 ''On behalf of Californians, I apologize to the rest of the country.''
 Before we parted, Poizner told me to enjoy my stay in paradise.
 WHITMAN AND POIZNER are the latest in a line of dizzyingly rich candidates in California. The recent history of the type does not portend well for them. The Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon lost to Gray Davis in 2002, while the Democrat Al Checchi (a former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines) was clobbered by Davis in the 1998 primary. Michael Huffington, the former Republican congressman and now ex-husband of the Web-site impresario Arianna Huffington, spent $28 million and lost to Dianne Feinstein in the 1994 Senate race.
 While these precedents cheer Tom Campbell, the financial disadvantages faced by the former congressman from Silicon Valley have meant he gets overlooked to a degree. Despite early polling that shows him to be competitive with or ahead of his opponents, the perception lingers that he will be seriously outgunned. Still, the mild-mannered Campbell has won plaudits in the press for his deep resume, expertise in a crucially relevant area (budgets and finance) and willingness to be specific in his budget-cutting plan.
 Campbell said that a large field of candidates will help him, especially if Poizner and Whitman look past him and bludgeon each other. But the wild card for Campbell -- and the Republican primary field -- is the prospect of a social conservative entering the race, which Campbell and others suggest is a great possibility. Republican primaries in California typically include social conservatives. If one does emerge, he or she would presumably siphon off support from Poizner and Whitman, both of whom have worked to court social conservatives, or at least not offend them too much with their pro-choice positions on abortion. Of the three Republicans, Campbell is by far the most socially liberal -- he calls himself libertarian -- and the only one who opposed Proposition 8. His positioning on social and fiscal issues probably aligns him most closely with many of the potential voters and donors from Silicon Valley whom Whitman and Poizner are competing for.
 If the unknown social conservative looms over the Republicans, the Democratic sleeper is Dianne Feinstein, maybe the state's most popular politician. While people close to her say they doubt she will run -- and she herself told me it is unlikely -- Feinstein is a former mayor from San Francisco and has spoken of longing for another executive job, and she has not ruled anything out. Newsom has said that if Feinstein runs, he will not. He told me he recently visited with Feinstein in her Washington office for 45 minutes, and the subject went conspicuously unmentioned.
 Assuming that Feinstein does not run, and that no one else joins the race, Brown and Newsom, past and present colorful Bay Area mayors, could provide a riveting generational and stylistic showdown. Newsom will make this an ''old versus new'' debate, highlighting his techno-hipness, playing up his youth (he is 30 years younger than Brown) and rolling his eyes at ''the old sages'' who speak endlessly of limitations. He is fixated on Robert F. Kennedy and, lately, Obama -- he boasted of having read every published speech the president has delivered.
 He recently CliffsNoted the book ''Say It Like Obama: The Power of Speaking With Purpose and Vision.'' When I looked through Newsom's notes, I came across this in the margin: ''It's not about young versus old. It's about past versus future.''
 Running as the old sage (or Apostle of Common Sense), Brown still enjoys a great deal of support from many traditional Democratic constituencies -- like African-Americans and white liberals -- who backed him as governor. Had he run, Antonio Villaraigosa would have relied on heavy backing from Hispanic voters, something of a holy grail in American politics these days. Their numbers in California are huge -- estimated to be between one-fifth and one-third of the Democratic electorate -- and would have instantly provided Villaraigosa with a formidable base.
 Brown has ties to Hispanic leaders that date back to his work in the 1970s with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers. Villaraigosa's exit from the scene probably benefits Brown the most, but it also opens the race to others, particularly those who are not white liberal males from the north. Recently I called Loretta Sanchez, the outspoken and increasingly visible Democratic congresswoman from Orange County, who had been mentioned as a possible candidate if Villaraigosa did not run. She described a ''hypothetical'' candidate who happened to sound a lot like Loretta Sanchez.
 ''I'm pretty sure you would agree,'' she told me, ''that a person who is from the south, who is viewed as more moderate than Jerry Brown and Gavin Newsom, who is a woman, and who might have an ethnicity, let's say, of Hispanic, probably would, on paper, be a very good candidate.''
 After volunteering that her ''phone has been ringing off the hook'' with calls from donors since Villaraigosa announced his decision, Sanchez told me that there is about a 20 percent chance she will run, and then qualified even that by noting that ''things can change.''
 If nothing else, Villaraigosa's flirtation with the governor's race underscores the power of the position's appeal. Few politicians are as embattled as Villaraigosa is these days: he is confronting a $530 million budget deficit, a cranky electorate, plunging poll numbers and an increasingly hostile press. (''Failure,'' screamed the cover line of the June issue of Los Angeles magazine over a photo of the mayor.) And yet he almost ran anyway.
 I attended Villaraigosa's State of the City address in April, back when it looked as if he would run. It resembled a presidential event, with three flags arrayed on stage and a very visible security team outside: police cars, black S.U.V.'s and lots of large men with earpieces standing in what Hunter S. Thompson called the Deadly Pounce Position. Before the speech, I mistakenly entered Villaraigosa's makeup room, thinking it was the men's room, and found the mayor perched on a swivel chair and covered entirely in a white smock, possibly asleep. Of all the California leaders I spent time with, Villaraigosa, who is 56, seemed to be having the least fun. When I met with him after his speech, he was sipping green tea and keeping strenuously on message -- the message being that he was focused on being mayor. And he then referred to ''my State of the State'' address, not his State of the City address. Freudian slip? ''Well, you were talking about the state,'' Villaraigosa said defensively, and he spent the next several minutes being more careful.
 THE FIRST TIME I met Newsom, it was in April, at the bar of the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Newsom, who publicly swore off alcohol in 2007 after the affair with his campaign manager's wife was revealed, sipped water garnished with cucumber slices. When I asked if he was running for governor, Newsom broke into an exaggerated, Ted Baxter-like blowhard baritone to signal a stock answer. (''First of all, I'm flattered that you'd ask. . . . '') The baritone is his verbal equivalent of a wink. As an aside, I mentioned that the Mayflower had some notorious connections to Washington sex scandals -- Monica Lewinsky stayed here, Eliot Spitzer was busted for what he did here. ''Yes, I hate this place for that reason,'' Newsom said and quickly changed the subject.
 Newsom's dalliance with Ruby Rippey-Tourk, the ex-wife of his ex-friend Alex Tourk, is a lingering burden for him, if not an albatross. He is fully aware that if people beyond San Francisco know anything about him at all, it is most likely his association with gay marriage and his egregious violation of the ''guy code'' (becoming involved with a friend's partner, in this case wife). His full-blown admission at the time of the affair, which occurred while he and his first wife were divorcing, was striking. ''I want to make it clear that everything you've heard and read is true,'' Newsom said at a press conference in 2007 after details of the affair were revealed in The San Francisco Chronicle.
 But when Newsom and I finally discussed the matter in his office this spring, he appeared to want to say more. ''There's a story that's never been told,'' Newsom said. ''Things were much more benign than they actually appeared in print.'' At which point Newsom seemed ready to tell me more, but then he stopped and shook his head. ''It wasn't true that everything you heard was true,'' he said before his communications director, Nathan Ballard, walked in to Newsom's office with impeccable timing. (Both denied that the panic button had been pressed.)
 ''No-Drama Obama?'' Newsom was quoted as saying in Newsweek earlier this year. ''Yeah, that's not me.''
 There is indeed about Newsom something of that quintessential California type, the overgrown and hyperactive child. Immensely gifted but flawed, he is a jumble of self-regard, self-confidence and self-immolation -- potential greatness and a potential train wreck in the same metrosexual package.
 Newsom told me he realizes that the Rippey-Tourk affair could have ended his political career if he were in a place less permissive than San Francisco. He once described his city as ''47 square miles surrounded by reality,'' a formulation he himself tends to reinforce whenever he leaves.
 In the middle of May, I followed him to a water-treatment plant near Tracy, Calif., about 65 miles east of San Francisco, where he presided over a groundbreaking ceremony for the facility. He looked every bit the exotic bird in the midst of browning foothills, construction equipment and about 50 onlookers, many wearing hard hats, as he maneuvered his gangly self onto a backhoe.
 The scene had the makings of a Dukakis-in-a-tank debacle: Newsom in a soft blue suit over an open-collar white dress shirt, exposing a smooth, reddish chest, his loafers vibrating on the machine. As a general rule, well-manicured mayors of San Francisco don't photograph well on John Deere equipment. ''I got my helmet right here,'' Newsom called down from atop the backhoe, patting his heavily gelled hair. Someone offered him a plastic hard hat, which he declined (proving maybe he had learned something from Dukakis's experience). He pressed a few buttons that resulted in a slight jostling of dirt. Photos were snapped, and the hard-hat guys clapped. ''I've got to Twitter this,'' Ballard gushed, standing to the side.
 Newsom then stepped down from the backhoe and received another reality slap -- this in the form of questions about a previously-agreed-upon deal that appeared to have fallen apart the night before between the city of San Francisco and its biggest union, the Service Employees International Union. Newsom said that morning that 1,000 city workers could lose their jobs. He speculated to me that some ''far-lefttypes, who oppose my very existence as a human and as a businessman,'' were just trying to stir up trouble for his gubernatorial campaign. ''It's like that line from the French poet,'' Newsom told me as he strolled away from the backhoe. These were people who like to urinate ''on grasshoppers, just to make them sing.''
 As I pondered this, a reporter from The San Francisco Chronicle ambushed Newsom: how could he drive (or be driven) to Tracy on the sacred morning when San Franciscans had been observing their annual Bike to Work Day? After protesting that he had been righteous on 10 of the last 12 Bike to Work days, Newsom noted that he had in fact been on a bicycle earlier in the morning -- albeit a stationary bicycle. ''It's a technical point,'' Newsom acknowledged in his Ted Baxter voice.
 Laughter broke the stern talk for a few minutes, a sign of the times in a political circus where presentiments of doomsday mingle with the absurd. As Newsom returned to his S.U.V., Ballard made sure to tell me how many Twitterers would already be able to see photos of the mayor on the backhoe. He derided Jerry Brown's campaign Web site and ridiculed Villaraigosa's ''totally pathetic'' Twitter following.
 Newsom then hopped into his black S.U.V. for the drive back to San Francisco, two canisters of hand sanitizer awaiting him in the back seat.
 GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER LIKES mountain metaphors. Running California is like climbing Mount Everest -- or negotiating an Olympic slalom course on the way down. ''It's the tightest slalom course you can find, with bumps and moguls all on top of it,'' Schwarzenegger told me. He was sitting in his tent, tapping his alligator-skin shoes on the artificial turf. He went on: ''You have every obstacle you can think of. You jump in the middle of the air. Then do the turnaround with the gate. That's what it is.'' It's very easy to catch your skis and wipe out, he added. I asked him if he wiped out. ''People wipe out all the time,'' he said, not answering directly.
 He switched to weight lifting. ''You have to psych yourself up, even though you have to lift at a weight you've never lifted before,'' he said. ''Everything's going against you. There's noise out there in the audience. There are people whistling, someone talking Russian behind you, all this stuff.''
 Schwarzenegger has no patience for the people who want his job running around the state asking aloud why they would ever want such a job. ''That, I have to say, is nonsense,'' he said, tightening his massive hands into claws for emphasis. He scrunched his face into an exaggerated smirk (the exasperated ''It's not a tumor'' face). ''I think that you only take a job like this because you are meant to be a leader, and you are meant to be the kind of a person who likes struggle,'' he said, reclining in his cigar tent, tilting his head back to blow smoke straight into the air. We should all struggle like this.
 Schwarzenegger, who a few days earlier had declared June to be Real California Milk Month and hosted a demonstration for a new hybrid Hummer, betrayed slight annoyance at his difficulties with the budget but no discernible stress in his job. He said he would not change places with anyone in the world -- which of course is the only thing a politician can ever say publicly. But perhaps Schwarzenegger's most enduring asset, even if it does not always lead to salvation, is the same thing as California's chief export: optimism. Schwarzenegger describes California's politics as ''twisted'' but the state itself as ''addictive.''
 After our meeting, Schwarzenegger led me out of the tent and walked away to more cheers and screams before disappearing around a corner, no doubt headed to put out wildfires with his bare hands or something. I took a brief tour of his office -- hallways blanketed with his photos and magazine covers, an enormous conference room stocked with bottles of booze, plates of fruit and souvenir cigars and the original sword from ''Conan the Barbarian.''
 It's good to have the sword, even encased in glass as a museum piece. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 19, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 5 about the California governor's race misstated the size of the outdoor tent where Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger smokes cigars when working at the Capitol. The tent is about 15 feet square, not 15 square feet. (In other words, the tent is about 225 square feet.)

HEADLINE: The Dictator and the Disco King

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
OVER the years ''Saturday Night Fever'' has meant a lot of different things to a lot of different people. But the Chilean director Pablo Larrain is probably the first to have been inspired to use that 1970s disco drama as a device to dissect the abusive dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, as he does in his new film, ''Tony Manero.''
 Tony Manero, of course, is the name of the character John Travolta played in ''Saturday Night Fever.'' ''Tony Manero'' the movie, which opened in New York on Friday, is about a week in the life of Raul Peralta, a dancer in a run-down cabaret who embarks on a relentless quest to win a Travolta look-alike contest broadcast by a Chilean television show at the height of the ''Saturday Night Fever'' craze. 
 ''Saturday Night Fever'' was released in Chile in 1978, which happened to coincide with one of the bleakest, most repressive periods of Pinochet's 17-year rule. He had seized power on Sept. 11, 1973, in a bloody, United States-backed coup that overthrew the Socialist president, Salvador Allende, and imposed policies that crushed political dissent while encouraging an every-man-for-himself scramble for economic gain.
 That history encouraged Alfredo Castro, the actor who plays Peralta, to endow his character with an aura of menace and barely contained aggression, meant to register as a metaphor for the amorality and viciousness of the Pinochet regime.
 Raul Peralta is ''a social outsider, perfectly capable of appropriating the opportunity to kill with impunity,'' Mr. Castro said. ''He lacks moral judgment, and his logic is demented, archaic, that of: 'If the state is killing hundreds, why can't I?' ''
 Released in Chile in 2008, ''Tony Manero'' was first shown in the United States at the New York Film Festival last fall. The festival's program director, Richard Pena, said the film appealed to him because of its ability to convey ''the feeling, the texture and tactile sense of life during that time'' and its complicated and nuanced view of American pop culture.
 '' 'Saturday Night Fever' becomes a strange double-edged sword,'' Mr. Pena said. ''On the one hand it is free and easy and democratic and represents freedom and masculine flamboyance. But it also comes from America, which is seen as being at the root of the problem, behind the overthrow of Allende and the installation of Pinochet.''
 In addition Mr. Castro's character looks a lot like Al Pacino, as critics were quick to note after ''Tony Manero'' was shown at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. Mr. Castro and Mr. Larrain said they were amused by the comments that similarity has provoked, which they believe underline and amplify their theme of cultural domination. ''The interesting thing is that here you have a Chilean actor who tries to look like John Travolta and ends up being said to look like Al Pacino,'' Mr. Larrain said. ''He's never Alfredo Castro. He's always somebody else, and what he does in the film is exactly that too.'' 
 Mr. Castro added: ''It's like I've been erased, and there is something symbolic about that.''
 The genesis of ''Tony Manero'' can be traced to a book of photographs Mr. Larrain, 32, stumbled across in a museum gift shop in Spain a couple of years ago. One image especially fascinated him: that of a gaunt, tattooed man sitting in a chair and staring blankly out a window, a cigarette in one hand and a revolver in the other.
 Back home in Santiago, Mr. Larrain showed the picture to Mr. Castro, who quickly agreed to join Mr. Larrain in elaborating a story for the man. ''We saw a dancer who was also a killer and began to create from that premise,'' Mr. Larrain recalled. ''Later in the process we came to see that we had the possibility to insert this human being and his desire into the political context of a particular period in Chile, and that made us rethink the story.''
 Though ''Tony Manero'' also contains elements of a psychological study, a thriller and a musical, its political subtext has drawn the most attention. After the showing in Cannes, a critic for the Le Monde called Raul Peralta ''a small-scale replica of Pinochet'' and argued that ''if the term weren't so pejorative, I'd say that 'Tony Manero' was a great anti-imperialist film.''
 On the surface Mr. Larrain would seem an unlikely candidate for that kind of undertaking. His father, Hernan Larrain, is a former president of the Chilean Senate who is also president of the country's main right-wing party, which enthusiastically supported the Pinochet dictatorship.
 On his mother's side Pablo Larrain is part of the Matte family, perhaps Chile's wealthiest. The Mattes, whose fortune comes largely from their pulp and paper businesses, have been accused by human rights, indigenous and environmental groups of improperly benefiting, during and after the Pinochet era, from the expulsion of Mapuche Indians from traditional forest lands.
 Asked how his father felt about his movie, Mr. Larrain said he wasn't sure his father had seen it.
 ''You'd have to ask him, but I think he'd like it a lot, because, like any father, he wants his children to do well,'' he said. ''Although I don't share his political ideas, we have a terrific relationship.'' Hernan Larrain did not respond to requests for comment.
 Reaction to ''Tony Manero'' in Chile has been mixed and often intense. Some on the right are furious at what they regard as a betrayal by someone they thought was one of their own, but even some anti-Pinochet commentators have complained that the film projects an overly negative image of the country.
 ''I wanted to provoke an explosive reaction,'' said Mr. Larrain, who began his career as a director of television commercials. ''This is not a spot, a commercial for Chile. I make the films I want to make, and this one is about a time that, to the extent that people recall it at all, is like a bad dream, a blurred memory that can't be remembered as fact but only as emotion.''

HEADLINE: Once Around the Island

BYLINE: By GAY TALESE. 
Gay Talese, the author of 11 books, was a writer for The New York Times from 1956 to 1965.

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH I was born and reared on a resort island in southern New Jersey, I have never learned to swim, nor have I ever gone fishing -- nor, since moving to Manhattan in the mid-1950s, had I ever ventured out to observe the city from the Circle Line tours that depart from Pier 83 on the Hudson River at 42nd Street.
 My aversion to the water is partly hereditary. It is traceable to my Italian-born father, who grew up in a hillside village that overlooked malarial marshlands and offered a distant view of the Tyrrhenian Sea, which, since antiquity, had carried boatloads of hostile invaders to shore and was also the mythological site of a Homeric sea monster with a ravenous appetite for human flesh.
 In 1922, at the age of 17, my seasick and terrified father traveled alone for 10 days on an immigrant ship before finally transferring his nautical-centered nightmares to the New World. He eventually passed these nightmares on in the form of bedtime stories intended to enlighten me about the fears and hardships he had endured in his quest for a better life in America, while at the same time suggesting that I had little cause ever to complain about anything. 
 Throughout my boyhood in Ocean City, N.J., a community slenderly built on a barrier island between the Great Egg Harbor Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, I never complained about my father's worrisome relationship to the water. His concerns were justified, it seemed to me, as summertime bathers were often carried to their deaths by the ocean's strong currents; one autumn, the waves crashed over the dunes and caused the flooding of most of our community, including the first floor of my parents' two-story property located on high ground in the business district.
 In some 50 years as a writer, I do not recall ever proposing a story that would likely lead to getting my feet wet. But when an editor-acquaintance heard me say that I had never circumnavigated the city, he suggested it was about time I hop aboard the Circle Line and see what I would see.
 I chose a sunny morning when the Hudson was very calm, and, after purchasing a $29 senior-citizen ticket (adults $34, children $21), I found myself among some 400 passengers on a three-hour voyage aboard a white double-decked vessel that was nearly 160 feet long and named ''Manhattan.'' 
 The captain, Ed Weber, was a short and stocky individual of 65 who resides on Long Island, and possessed a reassuring smile and an accommodating disposition. I introduced myself and sat behind him as we passed the Javits Center and the huge net that had been erected courtesy of the Chelsea Piers's driving range so as to prevent golf balls from strafing the river. Captain Weber kept his hands on the wheel and eyes straight ahead while responding to my questions with a reticence that I attributed to his modesty. 
 As we headed south in the direction of the Statue of Liberty, Captain Weber, a Circle Line skipper for more than 35 years, told me he had never crashed into the foundation of a bridge nor bumped into a barge, tug, ferry, fireboat, garbage scow, freight-car carrier, ocean liner, Coast Guard cutter, yacht or any of the other craft that share the waterway.
 He has, however, swallowed some of the murky bluish waters of New York, which vary in depth from perhaps 15 feet near the Circle Line docks to 50 feet below the Statue of Liberty, 90 feet under Hell Gate, and 180 feet beneath the George Washington Bridge. After one of the women who sell food and beverages on board the boat dropped a bag with her earnings into the water a few years ago, Captain Weber donned his diving gear and went down to retrieve it. How to discreetly paraphrase his description of how the water tasted? Like a diesel daiquiri, with a sewage flavor.
 Our guide for the day was John Keatts, a 70-year-old, 6-foot-tall Midwesterner who has a degree in mechanical engineering. After serving on submarines in the Navy, Mr. Keatts brought his mellifluous voice to New York and found work doing commercials and playing small parts in musicals, revues and television shows. Since he resembled the actor Jerry Orbach, having large dark eyes, a long face and a sloped posture while walking, Mr. Keatts sometimes served as a stand-in on ''Law & Order'' for Mr. Orbach's character, Lennie Briscoe. He started with the Circle Line in the 1980s to supplement his income.
 On deck, as the ship cruised at 20 miles an hour, Mr. Keatts stood among the crowd in dark trousers, soft leather shoes with rubber soles, and a white shirt with black epaulets bearing twin gold bars, holding a cordless microphone. 
 ''The Lincoln Tunnel is 97 feet beneath us,'' he said.
 This got me to thinking about a man I interviewed in the mid-'60s who was in charge of cleaning the tiled walls of the Lincoln Tunnel's three tubes -- each tube having 2.5 million tiles. 
 He and an assistant would drive two trucks in tandem through the tunnel at night -- one truck equipped to squirt 1,500 gallons of liquid soap against the walls, the other affixed with large nylon brushes that swabbed the sudsy surface. After I watched him do the tedious job, the foreman had proudly driven past the gleaming tiles and said, ''A tunnel is a thing of beauty, if you know how to look at it.''
 We passed the West Side docks and the skyscrapers of Lower Manhattan, headed out toward Ellis Island. ''Samuel Ellis is well known in this town,'' Mr. Keatts was saying. ''During the Revolution, he continued as a strong supporter of the king of England, and when the Revolution was over, so was his tenure on the island. His business was shut down. That will teach him.''
 I had last seen Ellis Island in 1990, when it was reopened as a museum and I escorted my then-85-year-old father to a program honoring immigrants. He used the occasion to remind me of how petrified he had been during the ocean voyage that had brought him here, and as he spoke I noticed that he not once faced the water. During the ceremony he took his place on stage and introduced himself to a man standing next to him. 
 ''I'm Joseph Talese,'' my father said, extending a hand. 
 ''I'm Antonin Scalia,'' the other man replied with a handshake. 
 ''There's a Supreme Court justice by that name,'' my father said, to which the other man responded, ''Yes, that's me.'' 
 ''Oh, I'm very impressed,'' my father said. ''So am I,'' said Justice Scalia.
 THE CIRCLE LINE sightseeing vessel pauses in the calm water within a few hundred yards of the Statue of Liberty. The ship seemed to list slightly from the weight of so many passengers leaning against the rail that afforded the closest view. With their hundreds of uplifted cameras -- their single-lens reflexers, point-and-shoots, camcorders, cellphones -- these people from China, Denmark, Ecuador, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines; from Tulsa, Trenton, and Dingmans Ferry, Pa., began taking pictures of the lady that they had mainly known from postcards. 
 ''She's good-looking,'' said 38-year-old Chen Yan of Shanghai.
 ''She's wonderful,'' said 50-year-old Christine Leusmann of Hamburg.
 ''She's bigger than I thought,'' said a retired British teacher named Eileen Woolley, who lives in the county of Derbyshire. ''Actually, she's quite beautiful, if that's any help to you.''
 Ten minutes later, as we passed under the Brooklyn Bridge headed north up the East River, Mr. Keatts informed us that if you stood on the bridge in 1883, ''you were standing at the highest man-made point of North America.'' Directing our attention to the right, he noted that 5,400 ships were built or repaired at the Brooklyn Navy Yard over four years of World War II. To the left: ''Here's the United Nations. We had 51 nations when the U.N. opened here in 1950. Now we've got 192.'' Again to the right, pointing out the Pepsi-Cola sign, ''The company built something astonishing in Queens: Neon!'' 
 ''People used to come and take a picture -- they'd never seen anything like this before,'' Mr. Keatts continued. ''And Times Square caught on. It's cheaper to offer than electric light bulbs -- neon!''
 We passed under the Queensboro Bridge, which, when I first arrived in New York, had its four 350-foot towers topped by eight 70-foot-high flagpoles; the poles were removed in 1960 following reports of faulty maintenance. I was sorry to realize the voyage was more than half done, as I had become surprisingly relaxed on the water and was enjoying in particular such rustic and often downtrodden views of New York that were getting little or no attention from the amplified voice of John Keatts on the speaker system.
 There was the sight of a barge carrying more than 30 bent and battered automobiles that Captain Weber guessed had been stolen and tossed into the Harlem River bereft of whatever might be sold on eBay: wire wheels, stereos, global positioning systems. A New York diver I once interviewed who specialized in retrieving wet cars told me that vehicles dumped into the water were nearly always upside down by the time they had settled on the muddy bottom. This was so, he explained, because the heavy automobile motor drags the vehicle nose first to the bottom and, upon reaching it, the momentum flips the car over on its roof. He also told me that he could estimate how long a car had been stuck underwater by running his hands along the vehicle's body and counting the number of attached barnacles.
 Atop a cliff on the Manhattan bank of the Harlem River stands the 185-foot Highbridge Water Tower, which resembles a medieval minaret and housed a carillon that chimed tunes thrice daily until it was destroyed by arson in 1984. Across the river, within view of Yankee Stadium (or stadiums, both old and new), two young boys hurled stones toward our vessel, failing to reach the mark but prompting Captain Weber to respond to their ill intent with a few forceful honks on his foghorn.
 There were rows of rusty subway cars lining railroad tracks in weedy fields, and storage buildings attended by junkyard dogs and surrounded by barbed wire fencing. On a rickety wooden pier, an elderly man in a straw hat stood with his fishing rod extended over the muddy water.
 ''What fish are around here?'' I asked Captain Weber.
 ''Flounder, striped bass,'' he replied.
 ''Can you eat these fish?'' I asked. 
 ''You could,'' he said.
 ''Would you?'' I asked. 
 ''I wouldn't,'' he answered.
 ''THERE was a Dutch trading town to the right, and they were going to stay there and trade, in spite of the devil,'' John Keatts said on the sound system as we passed through Spuyten Duyvil Creek. ''The devil in their eyes were pools of sulfur, bubbling pools of sulfur that smelled like the devil.''
 Ahead was the George Washington Bridge. Some 45 years before, I had interviewed O. H. Ammann, the Swiss engineer who had overseen the construction of the bridge, which was completed in 1931. Mr. Ammann, who was 85 when we met, had built many of New York's bridges -- the Whitestone, the Throgs Neck, the Triborough, the little green pedestrian bridge across the East River to Wards Island and, largest of all, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge -- all of which he could see through a telescope from his apartment at 76th and Madison.
 But he was most pleased with the George Washington. ''That bridge was his firstborn,'' explained his wife, Klary, ''and it was a difficult birth.''
 When construction of the George Washington began, in 1927, the city was characterized by feelings of affluence and optimism -- it was the era that produced the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and the Waldorf-Astoria hotel; the Holland Tunnel had recently been completed. 
 But by 1931, when the bridge would open -- after 12 workers had died on the job (9 more than would perish building the Verrazano, which was completed in 1964) -- New York was a city of bread lines and apple sellers and half-empty skyscrapers. Although Mr. Ammann had designed his bridge with two decks, the diminished economy would cover the cost of only one (the second deck was not erected until 1962). The diminished budget, however, did him one favor: it was easier to rebuff a proposal he disliked to cover the steel structure with masonry.
 And every time he and his wife would drive past the bridge in later years, they would nod and gently salute. Mrs. Ammann told me this as we talked in their penthouse apartment, 32 flights up at the Carlyle Hotel -- far from the water.

HEADLINE: Bernie Madoff Is No John Dillinger

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THE judge condemned Bernie Madoff's crimes as ''extraordinarily evil.'' The New York Daily News, whose publisher was a Madoff victim, chose ''The Pariah'' as its front-page headline and promised that the dastardly villain would suffer ''everlasting consumption in the jaws of the devil.'' The Times declared that the Madoff case, by attaching a human face to a financial meltdown that produced fear, panic and loss, had ''put an entire era on trial.''
 But for all this rhetorical thunder, Madoff's 150-year sentence still seemed an anticlimax, as if the trial of the century had ended without a verdict. There was no national catharsis. The news landed with something of a thud. On the most-watched network newscast, ''NBC Nightly News,'' it received second billing to Day Four of updates on Michael Jackson's death. 
 Madoff, it turned out, was no Public Enemy No. 1 to rival John Dillinger, the Great Depression thug at the center of Hollywood's timely release this holiday weekend, ''Public Enemies.'' In the context of our own Great Recession, Madoff's old-fashioned Ponzi scheme was merely a one-off next to the esoteric and (often legal) heists by banks and bankers. They gamed the entire system, then took the money and ran before the bubble burst, sticking the rest of us with that fear, panic and loss. 
 The estimated $65 billion involved in Madoff's flimflam is dwarfed by the more than $2.5 trillion paid so far by American taxpayers to bail out those masters of Wall Street's universe. A.I.G. alone has already left us on the hook for $180 billion. It's hard for those who didn't have money with Madoff to get worked up about him when so many of the era's real culprits have slipped away scot-free. Already some of those same players are up to similarly greedy shenanigans again now that the coast seems to be clear.
 Washington had no choice but to ride to their rescue last fall to prevent even greater systemic catastrophe. But that rescue is tainted. As the economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote in this month's Vanity Fair, ''In the developing world, people look at Washington and see a system of government that allowed Wall Street to write self-serving rules which put at risk the entire global economy -- and then, when the day of reckoning came, turned to Wall Street to manage the recovery. They see continued re-distributions of wealth to the top of the pyramid, transparently at the expense of ordinary citizens.''
 Not just in the developing world, but in America. Look at what we saw last week alone.
 To beat out the implementation of new regulations, banks are rapidly jacking up checking-account charges and credit card fees, even for those who have paid their bills on time. As Eric Dash of The Times reported on Thursday, the institutions that received the most bailout loot are often the biggest offenders.
 That would include the too-big-to-fail Citigroup, which has so far received $45 billion in taxpayers' money, along with guarantees on $300 billion in toxic assets, to mitigate its reckless risk-taking during the reign of such obscenely rewarded (and now departed) executives as Charles Princeand Robert Rubin. While taxpayers will soon own some 34 percent of Citi, it is not only increasing our credit card interest rates (to nearly 30 percent in some cases) but raising its own base salaries (by 50 percent) to work around Washington's new restrictions on bonuses. New rules may come and go, but loopholes remain eternal.
 We also have learned, from The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, that Goldman Sachs, another bailout recipient, is on track to pay its employees an average of $700,000 each in 2009, which, incredibly, is a bit higher than its compensation average in the pre-crash year of 2007. In a scathing and controversial new article in Rolling Stone, Matt Taibbi accuses Goldman of having earned such rewards by engineering ''every major market manipulation since the Great Depression.'' 
 What's uncontroversial and indisputable is that Goldman alumni have played key roles in both the Bush and Obama administrations' responses to the current crisis -- even though Goldman has a big stake in the outcome. The dense revolving-door conflicts of interest are appalling. Goldman is howling about Taibbi's article, but the bottom line was articulated last week by the economic blogger Felix Salmon of Reuters. He wrote that he couldn't ''think of a single government regulation over the past couple of decades which has remotely harmed Goldman Sachs'' as opposed to the many that ''have done it a world of good.''
 Goldman also rules at the New York Fed, a supposed monitor of Wall Street. Until May the Fed's chairman was serving simultaneously on the Goldman board; he resigned only after The Wall Street Journal reported that he was also still buying Goldman stock during his Fed tenure. At least that other failed watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has now cleaned house. But Politico reported last week that its new chairwoman, Mary Schapiro, had been the star draw at a lavish June banquet for the S.E.C. Historical Society, an independent organization that sold tables for up to $7,500 to ''law and lobbying firms that do business with the S.E.C.'' Among the buyers: Standard & Poor's, a credit ratings agency that enabled the subprime bubble by giving its approval to wildly speculative derivatives. 
 It's against this grand backdrop of business-as-usual at the top of the pyramid that we learned at week's end that the speed of job losses is accelerating again. The government also reported that Americans who still do have jobs now have an average 33-hour workweek, the lowest since tracking began in 1964. 
 The Obama administration's response to the economic crisis is rapidly facing its own stress tests. We will soon learn the ultimate fate and stringency of the regulatory package sent to Congress, including the consumer-protection agency the banks want to maim or kill. The stimulus's ability to put Americans back to work remains an open question. Should we have a jobless recovery or, worse, a second-wave recession like the one that blindsided F.D.R. in 1937, it will be as catastrophic for the Democrats as it will be for the country.
 Barney Frank seems to understand the political dynamic better than the White House. He told bankers back in February, ''People really hate you, and they're starting to hate us because we're hanging out with you.'' If the administration wants to be reminded of how quickly today's already sour mood can turn rancid, Michael Mann's haunting ''Public Enemies'' could not be a more apt refresher course. The casting alone tells you where the audience's sympathies will lie: Dillinger is played by America's reigning male sweetheart, Johnny Depp, while his G-man pursuer, Melvin Purvis, is in the hands of the thorny Christian Bale. 
 ''Public Enemies'' doesn't make a federal case of parallels between its era and ours. It doesn't have to. But it's instructive to revisit the actual history. In the book that inspired the film, the journalist Bryan Burrough writes that Detective magazine polled movie theater owners during Dillinger's yearlong spree of 1933-34, and found that in terms of drawing audience applause Public Enemy No. 1 beat out F.D.R. and Charles Lindbergh. Roosevelt ran with it. As Steve Fraser writes in his cultural history of Wall Street, ''Every Man a Speculator,'' F.D.R. ''likened his Wall Street villains to 'kidnappers and bank robbers' eluding capture'' in his 1936 re-election campaign. He knew Wall Street manipulators were the real targets of the public's ire. 
 Another look at this much-chronicled past, ''Dillinger's Wild Ride,'' by Elliott J. Gorn, a professor of history at Brown University, is the first to be published during our own hard times. In it you learn that ordinary law-abiding Americans even wrote letters to newspapers and politicians defending Dillinger's assault on banks. ''Dillinger did not rob poor people,'' wrote one correspondent to The Indianapolis Star. ''He robbed those who became rich by robbing the poor.''
 Gorn writes that the current economic crisis helped him understand better why Americans could root for a homicidal bank robber: ''As our own day's story of stupid policies and lax regulations, of greedy moneymen, free-market hucksters, white-collar thieves, and self-serving politicians unfolds, and as banks foreclose on millions of families' homes, workers lose their jobs, and life savings disappear, it becomes clear why Dillinger's wild ride so fascinated America during the 1930s.'' An outlaw could channel a people's ''sense of rage at the system that had failed them.''
 As Gorn reminds us, Americans who felt betrayed didn't just take to cheering Dillinger; some turned to the populism of Huey Long, or to right-wing and anti-Semitic demagogues like Father Coughlin, or to the Communist Party. The passions unleashed by economic inequities are explosive because those inequities violate the fundamental capitalist faith. It's the bedrock American dream that virtues like hard work and playing by the rules are rewarded with prosperity.
 In 2009, too many who worked hard and played by the rules are still suffering, while too many who bent or broke the rules with little or no accountability are back reaping a disproportionate share of what scant prosperity there is. The tepid national satisfaction taken in Bernie Madoff's terminal prison sentence should be a warning to the White House. In the most devastating economic catastrophe since Dillinger's time, many Americans know all too well that justice has yet to be served.

HEADLINE: Hunger Outside Prison

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Two Meals and Not Always Square'' (editorial, June 29): 
 The Times has performed a vital service by highlighting just how wrong it is for prisons to deny inmates three proper meals a day. 
 Fortunately, because federal courts have ruled that denying food constitutes ''cruel and unusual punishment'' barred by the Constitution, prisoners in the United States have a constitutional right to food that can be enforced by courts.
 No such constitutional right to food, however, exists for law-abiding citizens. In 2007, before the worst of the economic downturn, fully 36.2 million Americans lived in households that could not afford enough food. The United States government has even long opposed attempts to create a worldwide right to food under international law.
 Now that President Obama has made the courageous pledge to end child hunger in the United States by 2015 as a down payment on ending all domestic hunger, I hope the administration and Congress can not only agree that food should be a right for all people of the world, but also start making that a reality by enacting the policies and providing the funds necessary to eliminate hunger in America. 
 All of us deserve three square meals a day, and shouldn't have to commit a crime to get them.

HEADLINE: Say Hello to Underachieving

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
ERIN McAULIFFE had a vision for this summer. A 20-year-old junior at Bowdoin College, she had lined up an internship at a New York publishing house and imagined stimulating days leafing through manuscripts, and evenings of sparkling conversation with friends at downtown cafes. 
 She ended up starring in a real-life version of the movie ''Adventureland'' instead. In that recent comedy, a recent college graduate is forced by economic hardship to work at a suburban amusement park.
 Life is imitating art for Ms. McAuliffe. With her parents unable to help bankroll three months of unpaid work in Manhattan, she gave up the internship offer and moved home to Andover, Mass., where she took the one job she could find: working 12-hour days at an amusement park. For $7.80 an hour, she tends bumper cars and the big swing, and endures the many carny jokes of her friends. 
 ''It's rain or shine,'' Ms. McAuliffe said dryly about her job. ''You'd be really surprised how many people go to an amusement park in the pouring rain.'' 
 School's out for summer 2009, and instead of getting a jump on the boundless futures that parents and colleges always promised them, students this year are receiving a reality check. 
 The well-paying summer jobs that in previous years seemed like a birthright have grown scarce, and pre-professional internships are disappearing as companies cut back across the board. Recession-strapped parents don't always have the means or will to bankroll starter apartments or art tours of Tuscany. 
 So many college students and recent graduates are heading to where they least expected: back home, and facing an unfamiliar prospect: downtime, maybe too much of it. To a high-achieving generation whose schedules were once crammed with extracurricular activities meant to propel them into college, it feels like an empty summer -- eerie, and a bit scary.
 ''Things have changed drastically,'' said Ron Alsop, author of ''The Trophy Kids Grow Up: How the Millennial Generation Is Shaking Up the Workplace,'' a book that only last year portrayed young workers as entitled and in a hurry. ''It has to be a huge wake-up call for this generation.''
 Numbers provide the backdrop to the story -- not just the grimly familiar national unemployment rate, 9.5 percent in June, but the even scarier, less publicized unemployment figure for 16- to 19-year-olds, which has hit 24 percent, up from 16.1 percent two years ago. Internships available to college students have fallen 21 percent since last year, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Across the country, there are countless tales like that of Morgan Henderson, a student at the University of San Francisco, who, along with friends, planned a big road trip to Las Vegas this summer. With so few of the friends finding jobs, they downgraded plans to a road trip to Reno, then to no road trip at all. They're spending time watching DVDs at one another's houses.
 Or Kathryn Estrada, a high school senior in Hialeah, Fla., who has no summer job after Circuit City, which employed her during the school year, went out of business. She is finding that even this early in the summer, attempts to while away the hours playing Scrabble and Cranium have grown stale. ''We all just wish school would start so we would have something to do,'' she said. 
 Or Will Ehrenfeld, a political science major at Tufts, who worked at a think tank last year and this summer was aiming higher: a White House internship. When the White House didn't come through, and neither did the State Department or dozens of companies he applied to, Mr. Ehrenfeld, 20, moved back home to Vernon, Conn. Even the local Boston Market had no work. 
 Mr. Ehrenfeld, a top student who has always held leadership positions in clubs and academic groups, loafs through days, rolling out of bed around 11 and reading or playing trumpet or guitar. Nights, he sometimes meets up with friends who also have nowhere that they have to be in the morning, and they share a few cheap beers. ''At worst, misery continues to have company,'' he said.
 While young people in earlier decades might have cherished the chance to goof off and sleep in for a few months, the current generation, experts like Mr. Alsop are apt to point out, ''have always been told they can achieve anything they can put their mind to.'' 
 ''They were always given trophies just for showing up,'' he said. ''Now, they're being told 'no' when they really want a job or an internship.''
 To them, a staycation at Mom and Dad's can feel more like house arrest. 
 If the only problem were tedium, students might find a recessionary summer unpleasant but endurable. But some expressed concern that the economic gloom might be a preview of harsh career realities that await. 
 ''The worst thing about this summer is the lack of hope felt by so many kids,'' Lydia Wiledon, a Barnard undergraduate, wrote in an e-mail message. ''College students ready to thrust themselves into work find nothing, and those most in need are edged out by older, more skilled individuals who are overqualified for such foot-in-the-door opportunities. I worry about how this employment drought will affect my generation in the future.'' 
 There may be reason for concern. Students who enter the job market during a recession can see their wages lag behind comparable students who graduated in better times for as long as 15 years, according to a recent study by Lisa B. Kahn, an economist at the Yale School of Management.
 Even for students who remain optimistic about their long-term career prospects, an unexpected move home -- back under the roof of Mom and Dad, where many had barely alighted in years except for brief Thanksgiving breaks -- can require an attitude adjustment. 
 ''Communication patterns are different when students come back from college,'' said Roni Cohen-Sandler, a clinical psychologist in Weston, Conn., specializing in adolescent issues. ''Kids may not be as interested in sharing who they're hanging out with and why. The level of disclosure is different, and parents have not made the shift in their mind. They're asking a lot of questions, and students are chafing.'' 
 When students try to stave off the boredom by watching television, parents may wonder aloud if there is not a more productive use of their time. Curfews and household chores that seemed natural at 16 can seem oppressive at 20.
 This has been the experience of Kelly Fabian, an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, who hoped to study art history in Rome this summer, but returned home to Orange County, Calif., instead, when her family asked her to work to help pay her tuition. 
 It's an adjustment, she said. Living on her own for two years, including summers, she got used to doing chores like washing dishes and taking out the recycling -- but not when instructed to. 
 ''It's not weird doing them, it's weird having someone tell you to do them,'' she said. 
 Ms. Fabian said she was close to her parents and valued the time spent together, but the new proximity did take getting used to, on all sides. Ms. Fabian, 20, found work at a cable-television company, and with four family members sharing two cars, she commutes for nearly an hour each way with her father, Jim Fabian. 
 The opportunity to bond is, in theory, delightful, she said -- but does it have to be at 7 a.m.? ''My Dad is a morning person and I most certainly am not,'' she said. She needs a second cup of coffee just to make her lips move. When they reach for the radio knobs to pass the time, father and daughter encounter a generation gap: He likes sports talk radio; she would rather listen to the New Pornographers.
 ''I'm a relic of the '70s -- I still listen to the Stones, Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac,'' said Mr. Fabian, a financial consultant. ''Her music, I'll just describe it as different.''
 Some other college students unexpectedly back home described frictions with their families that were less amusing and more fraught. Daniel Bortz, a junior at Syracuse University who was unable to find a summer job for the first time in five years, told of unpleasant friction in his household over money.
 In the short term, the lost summer of 2009 might actually be a blessing, some psychologists said, especially because members of this generation have lived their lives like track stars trying to run a marathon at the pace of a 100-meter dash -- their parents typically waiting at every turn with a stopwatch. 
 ''Parents have really put a lot of pressure on the kids -- everything has been organized, they're all taking A.P. courses, then summer hits and they're going to learning camps,'' said Peter A. Spevak, a psychologist in Rockville, Md. Now, he said, with opportunities for achievement at a minimum this summer, ''there is something to be said about sitting out on a warm evening and looking at the stars -- they need more of this contemplation and self-evaluation.''
 Sara Germano, a senior at Fordham University who was hoping to find a journalism internship in New York, ended up moving home to Albany, where she found part-time work as a research assistant. And she has gotten to know her family again after an educational career that usually led her off on one adventure or another during vacations, so that, she said, ''I come home on Thanksgiving, they don't even know who I am.''
 Now she has time to watch Yankees games with her younger brother and sister, and in the evenings, she sometimes drops in to the bar that her father owns. At 21, she is now able to share a drink with him and to talk sports and politics with the regulars.
 ''I think he enjoys having a child who's matured and can talk about adult things and enjoy adult pastimes,'' she said. ''Since I've been gone so long, it's all new territory.''
 Her father, Phil Germano, agreed. ''She completes the family,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bike Among the Ruins

BYLINE: By TOBY BARLOW. 
Toby Barlow is the author of ''Sharp Teeth.''

DATELINE: Detroit 

 BODY:
 O NE night a little over a year ago, crossing Woodward Avenue, I crashed my bicycle. As I flew head over heels across Detroit's main boulevard, I thought, well, in any other town, I'd be hitting a car right about now. But this being the Motor City, the street was deserted, completely motor-free. 
 While bike enthusiasts in most urban areas continue to have to fight for their place on the streets, Detroit has the potential to become a new bicycle utopia. It's a town just waiting to be taken. With well less than half its peak population, and free of anything resembling a hill, the city and its miles and miles of streets lie open and empty, beckoning. And lately, whether it's because of the economy or the price of gas or just because it's a nice thing to do, there are a lot more bikers out riding. 
 This budding culture brings some commerce with it. Down on the waterfront, and just three hundred yards or so from the headquarters of General Motors, my friends Kelli and Karen are in their second year running the Wheelhouse bike shop. One might think, given the economy, that starting a business in the D makes as much sense as stepping on a nail, but Kelli and Karen's shop is thriving; their profits in May were double what they were a year ago.
 Granted, right now neither Kelli nor Karen take a salary from the business. They've each kept working their other jobs, Kelli as a bartender and Karen at a local community organization. Neither of them intends for the Wheelhouse to be a volunteer effort forever, but like many entrepreneurs, they believe investing in the business's growth right now is the prudent thing to do. 
 Meanwhile, up in the Cass Corridor neighborhood, another bike shop has opened up. Manned by some of the most die-hard, gear-headed gentlemen you'll ever meet, the Hub comes with a storeroom of piled-up old bikes that they'll refurbish for you -- and a greater social mission. Their Back Alley Bikes training program, which predates the shop, teaches youths about mechanical repairs and customer service. The Hub is technically a nonprofit, but their business is also doing pretty well.
 Biking in the D is the transportation equivalent of the Slow Food movement, offering a perspective that's completely lost to those zooming in on the Lodge Freeway and I-75, those great superhighways that, once upon a time in the name of progress, were sliced deep into the heart of the city only to bleed it dry. 
 A bike gives you the chance to soak up what's left, hidden neighborhoods like Indian Village with its dappled lanes and old eclectic mansions. Out near the fabled Eight Mile Road you can cruise past an almost forgotten but now happily restored Frank Lloyd Wright house. Downtown, you can circle the ruins of the old Michigan Central Depot. 
 Our abandoned landscape suggests an opportunity that alternative-transportation proponents should consider: instead of raging against their cities' internal combustion machines, they might consider a tactical retreat to the city that cars have pretty much abandoned. 
 Despite the press, survival here isn't so hard. Businesses like the Wheelhouse and the Hub have already shown how well Detroit can work as a new business hothouse. With the legendarily affordable real estate and without needing to pay for car payments, gas or insurance, bicyclists could rebuild Detroit into a model of a two-wheeled economy. They could pass laws promoting bikes over cars and designate entire avenues motor-free zones, which, given the state of many of them now, wouldn't be so much of a stretch.
 Maybe it sounds far-fetched, but then again maybe it's just destiny. Look at a map and you'll see that Detroit is designed in the shape of a wheel, with streets emanating like spokes from the downtown hub. It looks like a premonition, a city uniquely designed to alter transportation forever. 
 So, who knows, maybe the bike will follow the car. After all, it's happened before. In 1896, when Charles B. King steered Detroit's first automobile across its cobbled streets, following King's progress with a keen and intelligent interest was Henry Ford, riding on a bicycle.
 HOME ECONOMICS: On Thursday came disheartening news that 467,000 jobs were lost in June. The Op-Ed editors has asked four writers from around the country to provide quarterly snapshots of their local economies. Here are their second dispatches.

HEADLINE: Helping Patients Get Back On All Four Feet

BYLINE: By JULIE WEED

 BODY:
MARY ANN BAIK left her job as an office manager five years ago to follow her childhood dream of working with animals. Now she spends her nights tending sick and injured pets at the intensive care unit of an animal clinic in Los Altos, Calif.
 Ms. Baik helps with triage when animals arrive, monitors those in critical condition and assists with surgery. She also checks blood pressure and breathing rates and changes dressings on wounds. Rodents, reptiles and birds have all spent time in the unit, but a majority of the patients are dogs and cats. 
 She also tries to keep the animals calm. This is especially important because one animal's stress level can affect that of the others, especially in the case of cats, she said.
 ''We call it 'bad cat syndrome' when a stressed-out feline comes in and causes all the other cats to get riled up,'' she said, adding that stress is also known to delay healing.
 Despite increases in the overall unemployment rate, animal health care technicians like Ms. Baik continue to be in demand. In 2006, there were about 145,000 such technicians, and the number is growing faster than in most other types of occupations, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. 
 Various factors keep these types of jobs strong. In veterinary offices, medical advancements and increased use of pet health insurance mean an increase in animal procedures, said Henry Kasper, a supervisory economist at the bureau. ''If there's a way to help a pet, owners are going to ask for it,'' he said. 
 Job opportunities will continue to be excellent, Mr. Kasper said, because the 150 or so veterinary technology programs graduated only about 3,000 people last year -- not enough to meet demand. 
 The work of an animal technician can vary enormously, depending on the job. Some administer medication, provide postoperative care or draw blood for lab tests. Tasks can be mundane, such as daily cage cleaning, or leading edge, such as DNA analysis of genes involved in mouse brain development. 
 Most technicians work in veterinary offices, but thousands work in university labs, at biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies or in other settings. Highly regulated product-development procedures at these companies mean that demand for these skills will endure despite economic downturns, according to George Goodno, a spokesman for the Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington. 
 ''Federal requirements for drug and treatment testing don't go away because the economy is bad,'' he said.
 Kevin I. Phelps, a senior lab animal technician at the SUNY Upstate Medical University research facility in Syracuse, focuses on minimizing the stress of the animals in his care. 
 ''If they aren't properly cared for and they get anxious,'' he said, ''their blood pressure goes up, their hormone levels change, and we end up with inaccurate test results.'' 
 In a job that he says is different every day, Mr. Phelps has brought in toys to keep mice occupied and managed postoperative care for animals that had undergone new knee-replacement and kidney-transplant procedures.
 Mr. Phelps also does public outreach to educate people about animal testing. ''Animal research can be controversial,'' he said, ''but it's a component of virtually every drug and medical advancement we have.'' 
 While veterinary technicians learn many things on the job, most have formal training. And most states, though not all, have guidelines for credentials. 
 Ms. Baik completed a two-year veterinary technology program at a technical college. Mr. Phelps's training includes an undergraduate degree in zoology. 
 Professional organizations offer continuing-education opportunities.
 ''It's definitely important to keep learning,'' Ms. Baik said. ''The animals can't communicate a lot with you, so incorporating the best new practices help you deliver the best care.'' 
 She is currently pursuing advanced training in emergency and critical care.
 PAY varies considerably in the field. Veterinary technicians made an average of $36,120 in 2007, with increases accompanying more training or specialized skills, according to the National Association of Veterinary Technicians in America. 
 In lab settings, entry-level laboratory animal technicians earned an average salary of $30,262 in 2007, while more highly trained animal health care technicians made an average of $44,382, according to a study by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science, based in Memphis. The association has certification designations for technicians at different levels.
 Positions at biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies pay more, on average, than those in university settings, with animal health care technicians at the companies making an average of $73,538, the study found. 
 Along with the satisfaction of caring for animals and feeling that he is advancing science, Mr. Phelps enjoys talking to his own primary care doctor about his lab work, because he expects animal research to translate into improved medical practices for humans.
 ''I tell him I know what procedures he'll be using in eight or so years,'' he said, ''because we're figuring them out right now.''

HEADLINE: The New Country Squires

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
LIKE other property-hungry renters in New York City, Janet Hicks recently decided to take advantage of the weak real estate market and buy her first home.
 But instead of getting an apartment in the city, she chose to become a first-time buyer in a second-home market.
 While keeping the one-bedroom rental she shares with her boyfriend in Park Slope, she moved last month into a historic house in Kingston, a quiet city on the west bank of the Hudson River with a growing weekender population.
 ''You just get so much more for your money up here,'' she said. For less than $300,000 -- an amount that would have barely secured a tiny studio in Brooklyn, she bought a three-story 1790 brick house on half an acre of land. 
 Real estate agents throughout the Hudson Valley and in other second-home markets, including the North Fork of Long Island and the Jersey Shore, say that sales have picked up recently, as New York City renters came shopping for homes. Many of these renters are convinced that now is the time to buy, because prices and interest rates are down. But since New York City real estate is still out of reach for them, they are heading north, south and east. 
 People willing to go more than two hours outside of the city might also look in the Poconos, the Berkshires or in eastern and northern Connecticut. 
 Joan Lonergan, the owner of Coldwell Banker Village Green Realty, which has three Hudson Valley offices and which helped Ms. Hicks find her Kingston house, said that there have always been Manhattan renters looking to buy a slice of the country. ''But I think there might be more of it now, because there has been so much trepidation about the New York City market and some people see this as being more secure,'' she said.
 Brokers estimate that prices in the Hudson Valley are down about 10 to 15 percent from last year, while they are estimated to have fallen by about 30 percent in the city. For buyers, ''prices in our area are better than they have been for three to four years,'' said Harris Safier, the owner of Westwood Metes & Bounds Realty, which has five offices in the Hudson Valley.
 Just as in the city, the Hudson Valley has seen a significant drop-off in sales at the high end, houses priced upward of $700,000. Agents said that most second-home buyers are looking in the $250,000 to $450,000 range, which is the middle range of the upstate market and includes three-bedroom homes that come with swimming pools and several acres of land. 
 Chris Pomeroy, a vice president at Halstead Property who has listings in the city and the Hudson Valley, said that this part of the upstate market has been the first to bounce back, and ''first-time home buyers are definitely driving that resurgence.'' 
 Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, a Manhattan research and appraisal company, said that for the most part, second-home markets went into a decline before the city did. ''If the conventional wisdom says that Manhattan might have more problems ahead, it could mean that second-home markets are farther along in the housing cycle, which would give buyers there some comfort,'' he said.
 If anything, people who are second-home shopping suspect that those markets are close to hitting bottom.
 Max and Veronika Surla have been house hunting in Ulster County in the $300,000 range for several months. ''We feel like we really need to buy something before it's over,'' she said. ''Because once it is, then we won't be able to get anything at all.''
 The Surlas, who have two children, ages 2 and 5, live in a three-room apartment in a walk-up on the Upper West Side near Central Park. ''We enjoy raising our children in the city, but we live in a small amount of space and we can't afford to buy anything in the city,'' Ms. Surla said. ''Being able to stretch out on the weekends and in the summer would really help.''
 Nick Gaglio, his wife, Liza, and their 1-year-old daughter live in a $4,000-a-month rental on the Lower East Side. They decided to buy their first home upstate, he said, because ''we looked at the market decline as a potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
 They expect to close soon on a $300,000 three-bedroom house on seven acres in Marbletown in Ulster County. The house was originally listed last fall at $360,000, and the price drop made it particularly appealing. Mr. Gaglio said that their monthly housing costs with both homes are probably still thousands of dollars less than what they would be paying if they had bought an apartment like their two-bedroom rental in a luxury doorman building -- a proposition he estimates would have probably cost them about $2 million.
 ''The economics make sense, but they weren't even as important as the quality-of-life issue,'' said Mr. Gaglio, an antitrust lawyer. ''Our house is on a wooded lot with a pool in the backyard and plenty of space for my little girl to play around when she gets older.''
 Because New York City's rental market is weak, with some landlords offering a month of free rent and paying broker fees for new tenants, most established renters are not worrying about an astronomical rent increase. Thus, some feel emboldened to buy outside the city.
 Ms. Hicks said she and her boyfriend, Edmund Mullins, are very happy in the one-bedroom that they share in Park Slope for less than $2,000 a month. Ms. Hicks, 36, works as an agent for artists. She said that before she started her search upstate last year, she looked at apartments in the city, but all she could afford was a studio. Open houses at apartments as big as her one-bedroom rental ''were strictly fantasy,'' she said, so ''buying something upstate seemed like a good solution.''
 In her Kingston home, Ms. Hicks revels in her three floors, the renovated kitchen and the washer and dryer. And she is charmed by the wide plank floors and rope-pulley windows with wavy period glass. ''The view from the house across the street to the Rondout Creek and train trestle makes you feel like you live in another century,'' she said. 
 Having never bought any property, Ms. Hicks said she was surprised at how smoothly the mortgage and contract process went. ''I leaned on my broker for who to talk to and then I just did everything over the phone,'' she said. ''I didn't even meet the lender or the lawyer until the closing.''
 Patty Curry, an agent in the Stone Ridge office of Westwood Metes & Bounds, said that credit checks and mortgage approval standards are the same as they would be in the city, ''but the process can be a lot easier up here because all the players know each other.'' Local lenders, she added, ''are investing in their own communities and they're often willing to work more closely with clients than a national bank would be.''
 Like Ms. Hicks, Mark Burrell and Jason Dumas started their house hunt in the city. In fact, they were in contract last year to buy a two-bedroom condominium in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
 They were supposed to move into a $585,000 duplex apartment in June 2008, but the developer fell behind schedule. When December came and no move-in date was on the horizon, they decided to walk away from the project and got out of their contract. ''So then we had some extra cash on hand, and we had always wanted to have a house in the country,'' Mr. Dumas said. 
 While visiting friends in the Catskills, they spotted what looked like a deserted house in the woods. They bought the old hunting cabin for about $150,000 and moved in a month ago. 
 ''This is truly the home of our dreams,'' Mr. Burrell said. ''We would not want anything bigger or smaller.'' 
 The 1,300-square-foot house, in Kerhonkson, feels loftlike and sits amid three acres of woods. ''We wanted a getaway,'' Mr. Dumas said. ''And now we have a place where we can go and not be with a million people.''
 With all the space they now have upstate, they are considering leaving their $1,500-a-month three-bedroom in Washington Heights and moving to something smaller and closer to work. Mr. Burrell, 30, is an assistant choreographer at Radio City Music Hall, and Mr. Dumas, 32, works at the Nathan Cummings Foundation in Midtown.
 Real estate agents in second-home areas said that with the recession, some city renters were opting to give up their rentals entirely and make their weekend houses their full-time homes. 
 ''I've worked with several buyers who decided to buy upstate instead of the city and then subsequently, either due to job flux or just to be financially defensive, have given up their rentals,'' said Jeff Serouya, an associate broker at Westwood Metes & Bounds.
 On the Jersey Shore, Lauren Barcellona, an agent with the Arthur Rue Agency, said she is working with several renters who are toying with the idea of buying a primary home in Seaside Park. Many of them have previously rented summer homes there, she said, ''and they're saying they want to put money into real estate, so why not buy here and make the commute.''
 Robert Kaskel and Kristan Keck are living two variations on that theme, Mr. Kaskel in Rockaway Park, Queens, and Ms. Keck in Germantown, on the east bank of the Hudson River.
 Mr. Kaskel started looking for a weekend house upstate last summer, even though his wife, Metta, thought they should buy in the city before buying a country home.
 At the time, they rented the parlor floor of a brownstone on the Upper West Side for $3,700 a month. To be able to keep the apartment and still buy a weekend house, Mr. Kaskel set a price limit of $150,000, but he could not find anything within two hours of the city.
 Then last winter he heard about Belle Shores, a new development in Rockaway Park, Queens. They bought a duplex condo there in March and gave up their rental. ''I didn't even know that New York City had any oceanfront property,'' Mr. Kaskel said. ''This turned out to be a win-win for both of us, because I've been in the ocean every week since we moved in, and we can both still commute to work.'' 
 Ms. Kaskel works as a bartender at a restaurant in Lower Manhattan and Mr. Kaskel runs an information services company in Midtown. When their subway connections work right, it takes them about an hour and 10 minutes to get to their jobs. 
 Ms. Keck, 37, produces commercials and when she is not on location filming, she can work from home, wherever home is. She came close to buying a one-bedroom apartment in Park Slope last year, but decided against it because ''my boyfriend has an apartment that's already too small, so why buy another apartment that's too small?''
 Instead, she decided to look on the North Fork, but wound up in the Hudson Valley, which she found more affordable. She said that her boyfriend, Kirby Farmer, a private chef, urged her to look upstate because he had spent time there studying at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park.
 Early last month, Ms. Keck bought a three-bedroom house for less than $400,000 on five acres in Germantown in Columbia County, just minutes away from a kayak on the Hudson. She had planned to keep her $1,000-a-month rent-stabilized apartment in Park Slope, but decided to make the house her primary home, since Mr. Farmer still has his Manhattan apartment. 
 ''People pay in a lot of ways to live in the city, and I realized that I don't have to,'' she said.

Getting Help 
 In a 'Short Sale'
 Q Are there reputable companies that I can hire to negotiate with my mortgage lender when I am trying to work out a ''short sale,'' in which the lender will accept the purchase price as full payment of the outstanding balance? 
 A Steven Einig, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in mortgage foreclosures, said that as a result of the downturn in the economy, a cottage industry had developed, with so-called workout specialists and short-sale specialists. ''You should look into their track records and check with the Better Business Bureau or similar agencies,'' he said.
 Mr. Einig said that people can also contact banks themselves, but doing a short sale can be arduous and frustrating. ''If you do not want to do this yourself, most real estate lawyers can navigate the process or refer you to someone who can,'' he said. 
 Challenging 
 The Incumbents
 Q I was nominated as a candidate for the board of our building by some shareholders. I asked the management company to put my name on the ballot before distributing the proxies. It didn't; only the names of the current board members are on the proxies. Is this legal?
 A ''The board generally determines the election procedures, including nominations,'' said Kenneth Jacobs, a co-op and condominium lawyer with offices in Manhattan and Yonkers.
 Proxies are usually sent out with the notice of the annual meeting, he said, and ballots are given out at the meeting itself. ''Frequently, proxies will only contain the names of incumbents who are running for re-election and additional nominations can only be made at the annual meeting,'' Mr. Jacobs said.
 ''So both the proxies and the printed ballots will contain the names of the incumbents, but voters must write in the names of additional nominees. This may put challengers at a disadvantage, but it is not illegal.'' JAY ROMANO

HEADLINE: Remixed Messages

BYLINE: By ROB WALKER

 BODY:
 A blunt slogan and a simple image: these basic elements of persuasion, protest, propaganda or making a point have been used in tandem and to great effect for as long as anyone reading this has been alive. Presumably, these messages have always been received in a variety of ways. But these days, it seems, when a slogan and an image reach a significant audience, that's not the end of the process. In fact it's just the beginning. 
 For example, when red posters bearing the sans-serif slogan ''Keep Calm and Carry On'' underneath a simple crown icon started catching on in Britain a few years back, Bex Lewis knew their provenance. Now an associate lecturer in history and media studies at the University of Winchester, Lewis wrote her Ph.D. thesis on British propaganda posters devised for the home front during World War II. The ''Keep Calm'' poster, meant to be distributed in the event of a German invasion, was extremely obscure for many decades. So she was interested, she recalls, to see it turning into ''sort of a consumer item.'' 
 That process began with a fluke: in 2000, Stuart and Mary Manley, owners of a shop called Barter Books in north England, found one of the original posters folded up in the bottom of a box of old books and framed it. Customers liked it, and eventually the Manleys decided to sell reproductions. ''Part of it is that it does have this sort of intrinsic British feel about it,'' Mary Manley says, adding that the poster evokes a ''nostalgia for a certain British character, an outlook.'' 
 On a less romantic note, the design is in the public domain, meaning it can be remade and sold by anybody. A British freelance television-production manager named Mark Coop, for one, decided it ''would be a brilliant idea to put it on a T-shirt.'' In 2006, he bought the domain name keepcalmandcarryon.com, and offers the slogan and design on a variety of goods, including cuff links and duffel bags. Around the same time, Victoria Smith, a San Francisco Bay Area design blogger and photographer, bought one of the Barter Books posters secondhand and ended up producing her own silk-screen ''Keep Calm'' prints in a variety of color variations that she sells on Etsy.com. Barter Books has added mugs and mouse pads to its lineup. (Relations among these sellers are not particularly friendly; each complains of copycats selling low-quality versions.) 
 It turned out that the ''Keep Calm'' merchandise resonated all over the world. ''Germany's really big on it, oddly enough,'' Coop observes. The banking crisis, Smith adds, brought a wave of orders from people working for American financial firms (and, more recently, advertising agencies). In fact, the travails of the global economy seem to have given the slogan fresh relevance to many -- as reassurance for some but as creative fodder for others. For instance, one T-shirt design tips the crown upside down and reads ''Now Panic and Freak Out.'' 
 Possibly the best-known response graphic was created by Matt Jones, a product designer with the British-based firm Schulze & Webb. He was ''in a grumpy mood'' when he happened to read an article in The Guardian about the ''Keep Calm'' trend. ''It was full of this sort of British fatalism,'' he recalls. Being of the mind-set that ''we have to invent our way out of trouble,'' he started sketching. His design -- the slogan ''Get Excited and Make Things'' under a crown that includes wrenches -- became a Web hit, leading to a T-shirt from Howies, a Welsh clothing brand, and a set of prints sold on 20x200.com; Mule Design in San Francisco is bringing out a version of the shirt in the U.S. (Jones has given his chunk of the proceeds to nonprofit groups.)
 By now the iterations online and off are legion: ''Keep Calm and Have a Cupcake'' (substituting the pastry for the crown); ''Don't Panic and Fake a British Accent ''; ''Keep Spending and Carry On Shopping,'' etc. Each increases the distance from the original and simultaneously underscores its importance as a reference point, albeit an abstract one. As Bex Lewis points out, even those attracted to the poster's past may be more revisionist than they realize. ''People talk about it -- Americans in particular I'm afraid -- being the poster that kept the British going through the war,'' she says. 
 In fact, few saw the poster back then. Not many were distributed, and the land invasion never came. Another poster with a similar style did generate ''a huge fuss'' at the time, she adds, but much of it involved criticism of the condescending, authoritarian tone. Government posters that followed abandoned the stark look and the suggestion of the crown talking down to the masses and were ''a lot more colorful and a lot more people-focused,'' Lewis says. Nowadays, of course, nobody waits around for the authorities to adjust the meaning of their slogans and images. We just do it ourselves.

HEADLINE: Employment Report Sours the Market

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
A grim report on unemployment on Thursday let the air out of the stock market, which ended a shortened trading week on Wall Street with sizable losses. 
 In a monthly report, the Labor Department said that 467,000 jobs were lost in June. In surveys, most economists expected 100,000 fewer jobs lost. The unemployment rate edged up to 9.5 percent from 9.4 percent the previous month, to its highest level in 26 years, and virtually all analysts expect joblessness to mount in the coming months.
 Earlier in the week, there were some signs of improvement in the housing market, giving rise to hopes that a market bottom might be in sight. 
 The markets were closed Friday in the United States to kick off the Independence Day weekend.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 157.65 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 8,280.74. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 22.48 points, or 2.4 percent, to close at 896.42. The Nasdaq composite index lost 41.70 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 1,796.52. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.49 percent from 3.54 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: The Architecture Issue

 BODY:
If an issue ''devoted to architecture and infrastructure would be incomplete without architects,'' the vision of future infrastructure offered in the June 14 issue is curiously lacking. The most exciting infrastructure advances today are not being developed by architects. Urban designers and landscape architects are creating public spaces that double as water-treatment facilities; new businesses are using cars to transform energy distribution and storage; artists are rethinking municipal waste facilities; product designers are making it possible to aggregate individuals' choices to create real change; and engineers are inventing transformative technologies right now.
 The infrastructures of the 21st century will undoubtedly take on visible form and create public benefits as suggested by Grimshaw Architects et al. But they will do so because they integrate the expertise of planners, designers and engineers. These interdisciplinary teams are already creating new visions of what urban infrastructure can be -- visions The New York Times should be celebrating, as they are the future systems we need. 
 CHARLIE CANNON Department of Industrial Design Rhode Island School of Design Providence, R.I
 While thrilled by the Infrastructure issue of The New York Times Magazine, I was struck by a gaping absence. Here in New York City, we are undergoing our own infrastructure revolution, and yet I didn't see even a cursory mention of it. In our own backyard, we are in the process of gaining bus rapid transit, protected bike lanes (one on Ninth Avenue reduced collisions between bikes and cars by more than 40 percent) and traffic islands' making street intersections safer for children, the disabled and the elderly. And pedestrianization! Don't get me started! Locals, tourists and the upper crust are mixing, with laughter and sandwiches, in the middle of new plazas in Madison Square, the Meatpacking District and Times Square. The work and the vision of our own local hero Janette Sadik-Khan [commissioner of the city's Department of Transportation] and her staff deserve praise and a lengthy feature article in the next New York Times Magazine.New York
 BARBARA LEITERMAN New York
 In ''Bridging the Gap,'' Henry Petroskifocused on bridges, the most visible infrastructure. But he ignored the invisible infrastructure: aging underground water and wastewater pipes that are rupturing at an increasing rate. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives these aspects of our underground infrastructure a grade of D-minus. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency there are more than a million miles of underground pipes; many are getting old. Our own utility has had more than 4,000 breaks and leaks among our water pipes in the last two years. Please don't forget the underground pipeline. Our lives depend on clean water.
 TERESA D. DANIELL Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission Laurel, Md.
 I applaud Henry Petroski for his timely essay about our need to rethink the way we build infrastructure. With stimulus money providing a fraction of what is needed, the current administration must support a highway reauthorization bill capable of improving our crumbling roads and bridges. In addition to sufficient funding, governments can and should use alternative delivery methods to get ''best value'' proposals for their projects, as the success of the Interstate 35 W bridge demonstrates. One such alternative is public-private partnerships, through which governments can borrow money from the private sector and pay it back over a longer period of time than is traditionally possible with municipal bonds. This means cash-strapped states can build projects immediately without raising taxes or diving deeper into debt.
 With a viable model already working in Canada and elsewhere, the United States should adopt these proven methods to finance and build our much needed public infrastructure.
 TOM RADEMACHER Longmont, Colo.
 Thank you for Jim Lewis's thoughtful piece on humane prison design (''Behind Bars . . . Sort Of''). Our organization has collected the signatures of more than 1,000 architects (and their supporters) who have pledged not to design prisons in the United States -- not because we oppose the type of humanism displayed by Josef Hohensinn's design at Loeben, but because U.S. prisons are failures irrespective of their design. The facts we rely on were thoughtfully and cogently presented in the article, but our conclusion is different from the implication that better architecture cannot reverse the social injustices and policy failures of today's American criminal-justice system but will only make it larger and capable of warehousing more people. Perhaps when American criminal justice is based on the concept of respect for human dignity in all circumstances, as Hohensinn so eloquently carved into his building, we will be ready for a new generation of prisons. For now, more prisons just expand the space for the racism, violence, antidrug hysteria and contempt for the poor that pervade the ''tough on crime'' demagoguery of too many American politicians and their supporters. In other words, before American architects can follow Mr. Hohensinn, we must have ''clients'' who are willing to challenge the current attitudes toward criminal justice. We hope this article will move the conversation in that direction.

HEADLINE: Pooh to the Plaza

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
WHAT do you do when you agree to spend $53.5 million for what you thought was the grandest penthouse at the Plaza and your wife, a Russian actress, turns up her cinematic nose at the space, and your lawyer trashes it as an ''attic-like'' warren with small windows and low ceilings?
 That was the problem faced by Andrei Vavilov, the Russian multimillionaire and energy magnate, when he walked away from the Plaza last September. While some people of wealth have trimmed their real estate sails during the economic hard times, it turns out that Mr. Vavilov is not among them. 
 Last February, Mr. Vavilov reached a settlement with the Plaza, in which he agreed to buy one of the two apartments he planned to make into one large penthouse. He then quickly put it back on the market, selling it for a loss. 
 With the help of two brokers from Brown Harris Stevens, Elizabeth Lee Sample and Brenda Powers, he began a quest for a grander space, with huge windows and high ceilings, that would allow him to move beyond his broken dreams at the Plaza.
 Property records filed last week show that a corporation linked to Mr. Vavilov closed on the purchase of a five-bedroom penthouse on the 78th floor of the south tower at Time Warner Center for $37 million. That is the highest price paid for an apartment in Manhattan since last September, when Scott Bommer, a hedge fund manager, flipped a co-op for $48.7 million at 1060 Fifth Avenue soon after buying it.
 The new apartment lacks the associations of the 100-year-old Plaza, with its Palm Court, Oak Room, tales of Eloise, its evocation of an older New York and its location on Fifth Avenue facing Central Park. 
 But in exchange, the new apartment has privacy: it encompasses an entire trapezoidal floor at Time Warner, and with 8,300 square feet, including the elevator landings, almost as much space on one floor as the Plaza apartment had on three levels. The ceilings are 14 feet high, so no one -- not his wife, not his lawyer -- is likely to complain about attic-like space. 
 There is little danger of claustrophobia, since the entire apartment is sheathed in glass. 
 As for decorating, the prior owner, Gerhard Andlinger, the founder of an international investment firm, and his designer, Robert Couturier, have shown how the sleek glass expanse can be re-imagined as a classical space, with Louis XVI furniture and Chinese screens.
 Mr. Andlinger originally listed the condominium last fall with C. Graham Uffelman of Brown Harris Stevens for $65 million, or more than $7,850 a square foot. The price was cut to $49 million in March, and the condo went into contract on May 1. The final price works out to $4,518 a square foot, a bargain compared with the $5,800 a square feet that Mr. Vavilov originally agreed to pay at the Plaza.
 And let us not forget the views, which extend out in all directions. The children's rooms face west to the Hudson, the master bedroom suite takes in the Empire State Building, the dining room looks out at the George Washington Bridge. And, best of all, the 41-foot-wide living room faces Central Park and towers over that old, forgotten penthouse atop the Plaza. 
 Asked for comment, Lloyd Kaplan, a spokesman for the Plaza, said, ''If he is looking at the Plaza, he has one of the best views in town.''

HEADLINE: Accumulated, if Not Curated

BYLINE: By RICHARD S. CHANG

 BODY:
CAR collections, by nature, are a reflection of their owners' interests. There are sports-car collectors and muscle-car collectors. There are collectors devoted to Italian makes, and there are those who reserve their affections for a single brand.
 Then there is Lenny Shiller of Park Slope, Brooklyn. 
 An inveterate Brooklynite (''If I never leave Brooklyn, I'm happy,'' he says), Mr. Shiller owns 57 classic cars and trucks. His holdings also include 11 vintage motorcycles and scooters, and because he doesn't much care to drive, he has around 100 bicycles. 
 Though his vehicle cache covers a boggling range of sizes, shapes and makes, there is a logic to his acquisitions. 
 ''The one thing you won't find here is what everybody else has,'' Mr. Shiller said on a recent afternoon, the black 1951 Hudson next to him gently confirming his point. 
 ''I don't want '55 Chevys or '59 Cadillacs or old Mustangs,'' he said. ''Anyone can have those. I really want things you don't see.''
 And so in his 12,300-square-foot garage, sniffing distance from the notorious Gowanus Canal, you'll find curiosities like a 1947 International KB-6 soda truck (with period-correct seltzer bottles), a 1961 Messerschmitt KR200 bubble car and a 1954 Packard ambulance.
 The garage would be indistinguishable from the other concrete industrial buildings around it, except that Mr. Shiller often leaves the door open, offering interlopers a peek inside.
 The building was once an oven for the California Pie Company, Mr. Shiller said. When the bakery went out of business a truck repair shop moved in; Mr. Shiller bought the place from the shop's owner in 1996.
 ''What's amazing about this building is that it peaks at 30 feet, and it has no columns,'' he said. ''It's all steel-truss construction and a concrete-slab roof.'' 
 Mr. Shiller said the collection started slowly. Until 1986, he owned but six cars. When asked what they were, he took off across the open floor.
 He is tall and has long legs that enable him to cover quite a bit of ground with each stride. He quickly disappeared into a corner. His voice echoed across the cavernous shop.
 ''The '36 Chevy was given to me,'' he said of the black car he had stopped at. His first car, the Chevy, belonged to his grandmother and was stored in her barn in the Catskills until it was given to Mr. Shiller in 1967, ''not without a lot of prodding.''
 He paid for his next car, a 1954 Mercury Monterey two-door hardtop that belonged to a 99-year-old retired lawyer. It had 19,000 miles and cost $250, he said.
 The cars and trucks are packed tightly inside the dark space. Mr. Shiller seemed adept at maneuvering his lanky body between (and sometimes over) the vehicles, easily covering the few steps from car No. 2 to No. 3.
 ''Another neighbor on the same block where I lived in Flatbush had this Jaguar,'' he said, hovering over a beautiful red sports car. ''It's an XK120. And he saw me -- keep in mind, it's 1968, so it's only a 15-year-old car -- so he saw me working on the other cars, and he said, 'You know, this car has been sitting in my garage, I'm never going to get to it, you can have it.'''
 Mr. Shiller paused for a moment. He said he had stored these cars, too, in his grandmother's barn.
 ''I was very busy at that point in my life,'' he said. Educated as an economist, he disliked office work and gave up that career to renovate houses in Park Slope. He did that from 1970 to 1980, which was when he started buying property. 
 ''My goal was to have enough passive income -- although it's not totally passive -- to be able to do this,'' he explained. ''So now, financially, I can do it.''
 He continued the tour. ''From 1968 to 1986, I kind of fell into three more cars, including this '55 Buick, which cost me $350,'' he said, loping past the car before falling silent. 
 Then he looked across the garage and exclaimed, ''Oh! The '50 Studebaker, which cost me $50.''
 Pushed against a corner was a Champion Starlight Coupe with a wraparound rear window. ''This is the car that Bob Hope made the jokes about, that you couldn't tell if it was going forward or backward,'' he said. ''It's a bullet-nose Starlight Coupe, which is the combination you want. You could only get a car like this in '50 or '51.''
 Mr. Shiller said he found the Starlight Coupe on a vacant lot in Amagansett, on the eastern reaches of Long Island, that used to be the Studebaker dealership DiSunno Motors.
 ''Of course they were no longer in existence,'' he said. ''And the guy who had it said, 'Give me 50 bucks.' So I pulled it out of there for 50 bucks. It wasn't running but I got it running right away. 
 ''It was a big mistake,'' he continued. ''When I first started working on it, I would get ticks. I had to actually fumigate the car.'' 
 That was his fifth car. The sixth car was a 1942 Buick Roadmaster that he later sold. The total cost of those first six cars was around $1,000.
 When Mr. Shiller began collecting, his plan was to acquire cars of each year from 1936 to 1958. ''I don't like fins,'' he said, explaining his choice of an end date before the peak of the tailfin craze. 
 But then a friend told him about a pale yellow 1954 Chrysler New Yorker Deluxe convertible that had become available (very few were made). Already owning the Mercury from '54, his plan of one example per model year went out the window. 
 Some of his vehicles have become minor celebrities, he said. The '54 Chrysler was in the music video for ''Smooth'' by Carlos Santana, and his 1965 Chrysler 300 convertible was ''as big as a whale'' in B-52's video for ''Love Shack.'' 
 ''If you own a lot of vehicles, somehow people find out and you get involved in photo shoots and music videos and commercials,'' he said.
 About 20 years ago, Mr. Shiller got involved helping the director Paul Mazursky find an old soda truck for the movie ''Enemies, a Love Story.'' A friend who collected trucks told him to ''get in touch with Richie Scholz.'' 
 Scholz Brothers was a beverage company in Brooklyn that had gone out of business. Mr. Scholz told him that the company's delivery truck, a deep green 1947 International KB-6, was still in a warehouse.
 ''One call and I located this truck,'' Mr. Shiller said proudly. Mr. Shiller went to pick it up with two friends.
 ''We worked on the truck, we got it running, we actually drove it back here with -- with no brakes,'' he said. ''We drove it in low gear. And about halfway back, I was driving and my hands were shaking, so I let somebody else drive it.
 ''It's fully equipped with all of the soda bottles. Soda bottles from the original company and the seltzer bottles. It's a magnificent vehicle.''

HEADLINE: Sculpture to Invigorate a Shrinking City

BYLINE: By MALCOLM GAY

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS 

 BODY:
 ONE telling measure of this city's past glories and present challenges is this: The United States Census of 1950 reported roughly 850,000 people living in St. Louis; today the number is around 350,000. Or there's this: In 1988, when Jonathan Franzen published ''The Twenty-Seventh City,'' a novel about real and fictional tribulations afflicting St. Louis, his title referred to the city's plunge in rank to 27th largest in America from 4th in less than a century. If he wrote the book now, just two decades later, he would have to call it ''The Fifty-Second City.'' 
 Signs of the depleted population are everywhere, from the boarded-up houses that dot the city's north side to the stubbornly vacant office buildings downtown. 
 Over the last 10 years, however, civic groups, private developers and city leaders have been trying to nurse downtown St. Louis back to life. Taking cues from revitalization drives in other midsize cities, they have created thousands of residential loft units. There is now a bookstore in the area, and next month a local grocery chain plans to open its first downtown branch.
 But perhaps the most original -- and conspicuous -- step in the campaign is Citygarden, a 2.9-acre sculpture park that opened Wednesday on two blocks of the city's central corridor, known as the Gateway Mall.
 Financed by the Gateway Foundation, a nonprofit organization that installs public art in the St. Louis area, the park cost between $25 million and $30 million -- which does not include the collection of 24 works by artists including Fernand Leger, Tony Smith, Jim Dine and Bernar Venet. (The foundation, which has a longstanding policy of not commenting to the news media, declined to disclose the collection's value.) 
 Within walking distance of the Gateway Arch, the park is intended to bring tourists and art fans to the mall and to draw office workers and loft dwellers outside with an array of amenities. ''It's really a hybrid landscape,'' said Warren Byrd, a principal of Nelson Byrd Woltz, the landscape architecture firm in Charlottesville, Va., that designed Citygarden. ''It's some combination of a city park and a sculpture garden.'' 
 The sculpture collection, which includes both modern and contemporary works, is cosmopolitan in flavor, ranging from Mr. Dine's whimsical treatment of Pinocchio in ''Big White Gloves, Big Four Wheels'' to the mysterious, egglike form of the Japanese sculptor Kan Yasudas's ''Door of Return.'' Visitors can call up an Acoustiguide-style audio tour, read by prominent St. Louisians, by dialing a dedicated number on their cell phones.
 The park's other features include a cafe, a massive ''spray plaza'' and a split-level pool whose two parts are joined by a waterfall. A granite-capped ''meander wall'' snakes through the park's southern portion, offering seating and spatial definition, while a complementary wall of Missouri limestone arcs diagonally through the northern section. The walls, Mr. Byrd said, were ''our way of marking several territories in the site'' -- which was previously two empty squares of grass -- and of linking the two blocks.
 The park, shown below in a rendering by Nelson Byrd Woltz, has no formal entrances or barriers to segregate its manicured paths and quiet spaces from the streets around it. 
 ''It has no limits,'' said Mr. Byrd, whose firm also designed the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pa. ''We wanted to make this site accessible to everybody.''
 He added that the landscape included several ''design gestures'' -- rows of Ginkgo trees, native plants, wide sidewalks -- that could be extended to other portions of the Gateway Mall. 
 City planners say they share that vision, but for now they are looking to these two blocks to spur economic development on their own. 
 ''There are several development opportunities right in the vicinity, and as the economy recovers, I think Citygarden will make those sites a lot more attractive,'' said Barbara Geisman, the city's executive director of development. ''This is probably one of the best things that's happened downtown in the last couple of decades.'' 

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: 1. LIMESTONE WALL Constructed from stone quarried about 80 miles down the Mississippi River from St. Louis, the arcing limestone wall is one of the park's dominant features. Its diagonal curve provided ''the opportunity to make a higher ground and a lower ground,'' Mr. Byrd said. The wall's eastern portion is bisected by the park's 180-foot split-level pool (shown here with Bernar Venet's ''2 Arcs x 4
230.5 Degree Arc x 5'' from 1999 on the grass beyond it). Its western section incorporates a large LED video wall, which during the first season will feature video art and films selected by local museum directors and curators. 2. 'FEMMES AU PERROQUET' One of several works by Fernand Leger depicting women with parrots, this bronze bas relief from 1952 is installed on the exterior wall of the park's cafe, within view of its patio. 3. 'EROS BENDATO' At the park's southeast corner the Polish sculptor Igor Mitoraj's arresting 1999 bronze head, more than 12 feet long, rests on one of the park's water features: a tilted granite disk that is partially covered by a scrim of flowing water. 4. 'TAI-CHI SINGLE WHIP' In this 1998 bronze work by Ju Ming, a Taiwanese sculptor, a blocky figure strikes one of the martial art's basic poses. 5. SPRAY PLAZA With 102 computer- controlled spray nozzles, the park's ''spray plaza'' occupies more than 4,300 square feet, making it one of the largest of its kind in the United States. Each nozzle is outfitted with LEDs, allowing programmers to create nearly infinite combinations of water and light. 6. MEANDER WALL Evoking the twists and oxbows of the nearby Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, the 1,100-foot wall gives a loose structure to the park's southern sector, defining both open and more intimate spaces within it. Topped with Lake Superior granite -- designers tried to use materials ''sourced from within the rivers' basins'' whenever possible, Mr. Byrd said -- the wall also acts as a bench for viewing sculptures, several of which it wraps around. Here it is shown with one of the two figures that form Tom Claassen's 2004 work ''Untitled (Two Rabbits).'' 7. 'ZENIT' At the garden's highest spot, this towering and mysterious 1999 work by the Italian sculptor Mimmo Paladino is cast in bronze and aluminum. 8. UNTITLEDMartin Puryear's 2008 stainless steel abstract explores the relationship between traditional craft -- in particular, basketry -- and industrial design. Doubling as a bench, it allows visitor's to sit while viewing Mark di Suvero's ''Aesop's Fables,'' shown here in the background. 9. 'AESOP'S FABLES' A classic example of Mr. di Suvero's work with industrial materials, this sculpture form 1990 is a lowslung balancing act. The collection of I-beams welded into a tidy pattern of interlocking V's at one end is counterbalanced by the curvilinear tangle of steel at the other. 10. 'LA RIVIERE' Aristide Maillol's nude, perhaps the park's most famous sculpture, is also the earliest in the collection, made between 1938 and 1943. Meant to personify a river's churning current, the bronze figure is sited here on the upper portion of the park's split-level pool, where the sound of water falling into the lower pool gives an auditory assist to the sculpture's dynamic lines.

HEADLINE: School's Out, But Many Will Get Free Meals

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
REGULAR classes at the Greater Brunswick Charter School in New Brunswick, N.J., ended June 25, but many students and their families will continue to stop by each week this summer to collect two bags of free groceries -- pasta, rice, tomato sauce, canned tuna, fruit and vegetables -- from the newly opened food pantry in a school storage area. 
 In New Haven, 100 teenagers are being invited to Summer Suppers four days a week at the Elks Lodge through a new Connecticut Food Bank program financed with $27,500 in federal grants and donations. Local chefs will prepare the meals, and community leaders plan to dine alongside the students. 
 And on Long Island, Bay Shore High School last week restored a free summer breakfast and lunch program that it discontinued more than six years ago as the community prospered, while Island Harvest, a local food bank, is starting a new program on Monday that is expected to serve 500 free lunches a day to children in Glen Cove, Manhasset, Port Washington, Bay Shore, West Babylon, Medford and Port Jefferson Station. 
 ''People are struggling to make ends meet, and having access to good, nutritious meals is really key for any child to develop good learning and social habits,'' said Randi Shubin Dresner, president and chief executive of Island Harvest.
 Despite budget cuts, many schools and community groups are expanding their efforts to feed children from poor and struggling families this summer as the lingering recession deepens longstanding concerns that those who qualify for free meals go hungry once classes end. 
 The number of students qualifying for free and reduced-price lunches was up about 5 percent nationwide this spring, to nearly 19.4 million from 18.4 million the previous year, according to federal officials. These new programs extend beyond school hours to feed children on weekends and in the summer, and they have spread from impoverished urban areas to suburban communities once believed to be insulated from financial ups and downs.
 In Bay Shore, for example, 42 percent of the district's 5,800 students were eligible for free and reduced-price meals this year, up from 33 percent in 2008. Similarly, the school district in Bloomfield, Conn., started serving free summer breakfasts and lunches on June 22 after 46 percent of its 2,160 students qualified for the subsidized meals, up from 42 percent in 2007. 
 Even urban districts with long-established summer lunch programs are expanding to more neighborhoods this year as the free and reduced-price lunch rolls have swelled. In Syracuse, a record 80 percent of the district's 21,000 students qualified this year, up from 78 percent in 2008, district officials said.
 The federally subsidized school lunch program was signed into law in 1946 by President Harry S. Truman; this school year, a family of four earning up to $27,560 qualified for free meals, while students in families earning up to $39,220 paid no more than 40 cents for lunch.
 Unlike the school-year program, schools do not charge for meals in the summer, and in many cases they serve anyone under 19 regardless of family income. The federal government reimburses schools -- up to $1.8150 for each breakfast and $3.1825 for each lunch or dinner. A few states, including New York, provide additional money. 
 Even so, federal and state officials said that summertime free-meal programs have historically reached only a fraction of poor students because of a shortage of sponsors and a lack of transportation and public awareness. 
 New York State has used $576,575 in federal funds to promote New York City's summer meals program at more than 1,000 sites this year, including $90,000 for posters at subway stations at 125th Street in Harlem and Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. 
 At the same time, the United States Department of Agriculture, which runs the school lunch program, has spent $16,000 on 15-second public service announcements broadcast since March on the JumboTron in Times Square.
 To bring more students into the summer program, New York City is offering grab-and-go breakfasts of apple juice, muffins, bagels and cereal -- in addition to hot food -- in cafeterias at about 300 schools holding summer classes. Since 2007, the portable breakfasts have been available during the school year on a growing number of menus.
 The Yonkers school district, in Westchester County, is serving all its free meals in air-conditioned buildings as an added incentive. 
 In Connecticut, a community group in Thompson is hosting theme lunches, like Christmas in July and Caribbean days, and the Town of Stonington is holding drawings for gift certificates for students who come for the meals. Dawn Crayco, a child-nutrition advocate with End Hunger Connecticut!, said that the group has awarded a total of $6,750 in grants for such promotional activities to nine schools, agencies and community groups.
 But even as some schools and groups have responded to what they see as a greater need for food programs, others have been forced to cut back. For instance, a summer meals program in Nassau County lost some of its largest sites this spring after community groups canceled their day camps and enrichment programs. But churches and synagogues have stepped in to fill the gap.
 ''If you can't keep your lights on, you can't serve lunch,'' said Carl DeHaney, who oversees the Nassau County program. ''The economy is affecting everybody, even those who are trying to help.''
 Similarly, a ''KidzPack'' program that provides weekend meals and snacks to 750 children in Camden, N.J., and surrounding towns may be halted for the summer if its sponsor, Food Bank of South Jersey, fails to raise $10,000. ''Many of these children are going home to empty refrigerators,'' said Valerie Traore, the food bank's chief executive officer.
 Still, the Syracuse City School District has expanded its summer meals program to 49 sites this year, from 40 in 2008, and it plans to serve 1,000 more breakfasts (a 50 percent increase) and 600 more lunches (an 18 percent increase) per day. ''Everybody has felt the crunch in this economy, and we can help with that a little bit,'' said Ken Warner, the district's assistant director of food and nutritional services.
 In Connecticut, the Hartford schools have agreed to provide meals to 350 children from nearby day camps who will come to school cafeterias for lunch -- at no cost to the campers or the community groups that run the camps.
 Lonnie Burt, the school district's food services director, said she welcomed the additional mouths to feed, and predicted a 15 percent increase from the 3,230 lunches served daily last summer; the program is operating an additional eight days this year. 
 ''We're serving all summer along,'' Ms. Burt said. ''My staff will be tired, but happy to help people stretch their household budgets.''

HEADLINE: Ruins of the Second Gilded Age

BYLINE: By CHARLES WILSON

 BODY:
Last fall, The New York Times Magazine commissioned Edgar Martins, a 32-year-old Portuguese photographer based in London, to capture on film the physical evidence of the real estate bust in the United States. Martins, who creates his images with long exposures but without digital manipulation, traveled from rural Georgia to suburban California, visiting large construction projects that began during the speculative boom years and then came to a sudden halt, often half-finished, when the housing and securities markets collapsed. The abandoned or stalled developments -- and Martins's photos of them -- can be seen as signs of the hubris (and occasional criminality) that typified the boom and the economic and human damage that remained in its wake. ''The sudden shift in the economy unmasked such excess,'' Martins says, reflecting on the sites he visited. ''People are present in these images, but not physically. You trace their action, the destruction they left behind.''
 Photographs by Edgar Martins 
CHATEAUX ON CENTRAL This project in downtown Phoenix was supposed to include nearly two dozen luxury homes, priced from $2.8 million to $4.5 million. But by early 2007, the city's high-end condominium market -- which was among the country's hottest -- had become oversaturated. Prices started to fall, and Chateaux on Central's developer, Central PHX Partners, declared bankruptcy. A local commercial lender, Mortgages Ltd., stepped in that year with an offer to provide nearly $50 million in loans to help Central PHX complete construction. But the deal turned sour, and in March 2008, the developer sued Mortgages Ltd., claiming the lender had not made promised payments. On June 2, 2008, the C.E.O. of Mortgages Ltd., Scott Coles, committed suicide. At the time, one-third of his company's loans were in default. More than a year later, Chateaux on Central remains unoccupied and unfinished. [page 34]
 14 BALDWIN FARMS SOUTH In Greenwich, Conn., luxury developers built scores of mansions during the boom, assuming they would fi nd buyers. After the market turned, though, many remained unsold; as of last month, 107 ''spec'' houses were listed for sale in the town, with prices ranging from $800,000 to $18.6 million. According to Christopher Fountain, a lawyer and expert on Greenwich real estate, these sellers are growing increasingly desperate. ''Agents and builders have dropped their prices in half, many have long since stopped paying on their loans and none of the homes have a chance of selling even at their current asking prices,'' he said. This seven-bed, 10-bath 1920s-style estate -- recently repossessed by Patriot National Bank -- was initially offered at just under $10 million. For parts of last winter, its doors were left unlocked and often open, and leaves blew in. [page 37] 
 ECHELON This sprawling $4.8 billion complex on the Las Vegas strip was to contain 5,000 hotel rooms, nearly six acres of shopping, a 750,000-squarefoot convention center and a casino fl oor the size of nearly two and a half football fi elds. The developer, Boyd Gaming, citing the economic turndown, suspended all work on Aug. 1, 2008. The shutdown sent 800 construction workers looking for employment at a moment when other projects in Las Vegas were faltering. Now, according to Steve Redlinger, spokesman for the Southern Nevada Building and Construction Trades Council, ''private development in Las Vegas is nonexistent.'' The state has lost 25,300 construction jobs since May 2008, and the unemployment rate has risen to 11.3 percent, among the highest rates in the nation. [page 38]
 ECHELON Bob Boughner, the C.E.O. of Echelon Resorts, had big plans for the casino: he told a local television reporter that his facility would ''compete effectively with the likes of Wynn, Bellagio and the Venetian.'' The developer made room on the Las Vegas strip by demolishing the Stardust, a casino and hotel that was advertised as the world's largest when it opened in 1958 but that struggled in recent years. The Stardust's implosion was the fi nale of an elaborate fi reworks show in March 2007. [page 40] 
 CITY IN THE HILLS ''What color are your dreams?'' asked the promotional material for this 700-acre planned community in Bakersfi eld, Calif., that promised a manmade lake and ''lush parks.'' Last summer, however, the master developer defaulted on four large loans, and construction ground to a near halt. ''We get a lot of tumbleweeds rolling through,'' says Michael Olivares, a 30-year-old accountant who bought his home there for $410,000 in 2006. (It is now appraised at $205,000.) Nine homeowners on his street have been foreclosed on this year. [page 41] 
 GREENLEAF SUBDIVISION Mortgage fraud rose to new heights nationally during the real estate boom, aided by lenient lending rules and lax oversight. For this subdivision in Dawsonville, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, an appraiser and a developer together created false documents that led a California bank to offer nearly $5 million in mortgages for 15 homes -- houses that were neither fi nished nor ready for occupancy. Out-of-state investors, relying on the false appraisals, purchased the properties, usually sight-unseen. The developer, Jeffery Alan Teague, was arrested after an F.B.I. investigation and is now serving more than 15 years in prison. The home buyers -- many of whom most likely intended to fl ip the properties without ever seeing them -- are now stuck with a nearly worthless asset. The neighborhood has become a dumping ground and is increasingly overgrown. [page 43]

 CORRECTION:
A picture essay in The Times Magazine on Sunday and an expanded slide show on NYTimes.com titled ''Ruins of the Second Gilded Age'' showed large housing construction projects across the United States that came to a halt, often half-finished, when the housing market collapsed. The introduction said that the photographer, a freelancer based in Bedford, England, ''creates his images with long exposures but without digital manipulation.''
 A reader, however, discovered on close examination that one of the pictures was digitally altered, apparently for aesthetic reasons. Editors later confronted the photographer and determined that most of the images did not wholly reflect the reality they purported to show. Had the editors known that the photographs had been digitally manipulated, they would not have published the picture essay, which has been removed from NYTimes.com.

HEADLINE: Can I Clean Your Clock?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Over the past decade, whenever I went to China and engaged Chinese on their pollution and energy problems, inevitably some young Chinese would say: ''Hey, you Americans got to grow dirty for 150 years, using cheap coal and oil. Now it is our turn.'' 
 It's a hard argument to refute. Eventually, I decided that the only way to respond was with some variation of the following: ''You're right. It's your turn. Grow as dirty as you want. Take your time. Because I think America just needs five years to invent all the clean-power technologies you Chinese are going to need as you choke to death on pollution. Then we're going to come over here and sell them all to you, and we are going to clean your clock -- how do you say 'clean your clock' in Chinese? -- in the next great global industry: clean power technologies. So if you all want to give us a five-year lead, that would be great. I'd prefer 10. So take your time. Grow as dirty as you want.'' 
 Whenever you frame it that way, Chinese are quizzical at first, and then they totally get it: Wow, this energy thing isn't just about global warming! In a world that is adding one billion people every 15 years or so -- more and more of whom will be able to live high-energy-consuming lifestyles -- the demands for energy and natural resources are going to go through the roof. Therefore, E.T. -- energy technologies that produce clean power and energy efficiency -- is going to be the next great global industry, and China needs to be on board. 
 Well, China has gotten on board -- big-time. Now I am worried that China will, dare I say, ''clean our clock'' in E.T. 
 Yes, you might think that China is only interested in polluting its way to prosperity. That was once true, but it isn't anymore. China is increasingly finding that it has to go green out of necessity because in too many places, its people can't breathe, fish, swim, drive or even see because of pollution and climate change. Well, there is one thing we know about necessity: it is the mother of invention. 
 And that is what China is doing, innovating more and more energy efficiency and clean power systems. And when China starts to do that in a big way -- when it starts to develop solar, wind, batteries, nuclear and energy efficiency technologies on its low-cost platform -- watch out. You won't just be buying your toys from China. You'll be buying your energy future from China.
 ''China is moving,'' says Hal Harvey, the chief executive of ClimateWorks, which shares clean energy ideas around the world. ''They want to be leaders in green technology. China has already adopted the most aggressive energy efficiency program in the world. It is committed to reducing the energy intensity of its economy -- energy used per dollar of goods produced -- by 20 percent in five years. They are doing this by implementing fuel efficiency standards for cars that far exceed our own and by going after their top thousand industries with very aggressive efficiency targets. And they have the most aggressive renewable energy deployment in the world, for wind, solar and nuclear, and are already beating their targets.''
 Here's the key point on energy from the draft report of the president's Economic Recovery Advisory Board: ''If the U.S. fails to adopt an economywide carbon abatement program, we will continue to cede leadership in new energy technology. The U.S. is now home to only two of the ten largest solar photovoltaic producers in the world, two of the top ten wind turbine producers and one of the top ten advanced battery manufacturers. That is, only one-sixth of the world's top renewable energy manufacturers are based in the United States. ... Sustainable technologies in solar, wind, electric vehicles, nuclear and other innovations will drive the future global economy. We can either invest in policies to build U.S. leadership in these new industries and jobs today, or we can continue with business as usual and buy windmills from Europe, batteries from Japan and solar panels from Asia.''
 Indeed, if you look at those top 10 lists, compiled by Lazard, the investment bank, Japanese companies have the most, then Europe, then China -- then us.
 This is a major reason I favor the climate/energy bill passed by the House. If we do not impose on ourselves the necessity to drive innovation in clean-technology -- by imposing the right prices on carbon emissions and the right regulations to promote energy efficiency -- we will be laggards in the next great global industry. 
 And this is why I disagree with President Obama when he signals that he has to focus on extending health care and put the energy/climate bill -- now in the Senate -- on the backburner. 
 Health care and the energy/climate bill go together. We need both now. Imagine how poor we would be today if U.S. firms did not dominate the top 10 Internet companies. Well, if we don't dominate the top 10 E.T. rankings, there is no way we are going to be able to afford decent health care for every American. No way.

THE MEDIA RELATIONS DEPARTMENT OF HIZBOLLAH WISHES YOU A HAPPY BIRTHDAY
 Unexpected Encounters in the Changing Middle East
 By Neil MacFarquhar
 387 pp. PublicAffairs. $26.95
 In this engaging and fact-filled reporter's memoir, Neil MacFarquhar successfully walks a fine line. He offers something fresh and unexpected for readers steeped in a decade of news reports about suicide bombers, absolutist imams and tyrannical despots. Yet he never forgets that most of those readers care about the subject only because they have already decided, perhaps simplistically, that they are under threat from the Arab or Muslim world. He nods to the prejudices about Middle Eastern fanatics and then sets off merrily to dispel them.
 Like many of us, MacFarquhar desperately wants to make sense of some burning questions: How come the flood of petrodollars in the Persian Gulf has produced so little intellectual innovation and sustainable development? How can political reform and economic liberalization coexist with resurgent Islamism? Can the United States act as a force for change in Iran and the Arab countries, or has it lost its leverage? ''The Media Relations Department of Hizbollah Wishes You a Happy Birthday'' is MacFarquhar's effort to write a funny (yet penetrating) account about real Arabs -- and a few Persians -- struggling against long odds to bring their societies into the modern age. 
 MacFarquhar is well positioned for the attempt. He grew up in the 1960s in Marsa Brega, a fenced-off expatriate oil outpost on the Libyan coast where local food was never served. After studying international relations at Stanford, he returned to the Middle East, spurred by a powerful curiosity. He covered the region in the 1980s for The Associated Press and was the Cairo bureau chief for The New York Times from 2001 to 2005.
 He's a diligent reporter with eclectic interests. He drinks beer with a German brewer in Yemen. He is detained by regular police in Saudi Arabia and sips tea with the secret police in Egypt. He researches religious edicts against dogs at a reference library in Iran and questions an Egyptian cleric whose dial-a-fatwa service berates women reluctant to take the veil.
 How, MacFarquhar wants to know, have Arab tyrants and dictatorial Iranian ayatollahs succeeded at smothering almost every effort at reform? And why has the United States failed so dramatically to promote greater freedom? He argues, convincingly, that despots have won Washington's backing on a platform of ''apres moi, le deluge'' -- if popular uprisings sweep out friendly dictators in Cairo, Riyadh and Amman, far worse authoritarian Islamist movements will take their place. Meanwhile, hard-line clerics intoxicated by power have extended their authority over every aspect of daily life, with rulings, based on the Koran, on whether Muslims can ski or get vasectomies. Taken together, the twin oppression of princes and imams has eliminated the space for even a modest reform movement. This book reminds us thatmultitudes of the ruled share many of their leaders' values and assumptions even if they resent their heavy-handed and corrupt ways. Any change in the Middle East's powerhouses is very likely to come with an Islamic pedigree and to advocate incremental reform. 
 In the end, MacFarquhar embraces a tempered optimism. The characters he introduces fight at great personal risk for civil liberties, political transparency, freedom of worship, even for genuine political pluralism. They give the lie to the misleading claim that democracy is somehow incompatible with Arab culture. For those who care about the Middle East and want to start listening to weak but growing voices calling for reform and modernization on local rather than Western terms, MacFarquhar's account is a fine place to begin.h

HEADLINE: Turning a Corner?

BYLINE: By AMANDA COX

 BODY:
HE economy lost 467,000 jobs in June, a deeply discouraging number at a time when other indicators have suggested the recession may be ending. But economic turning points are notoriously hard to identify, especially when a parade of data can seem to contradict itself. After the 2001 recession, 20 months passed before the National Bureau of Economic Research officially determined its endpoint. To get a feeling for how cycles are evolving, economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have been watching a chart of industrial production, based on data from manufacturers, miners and utility companies. (In the United States, industry's share of the economy has fallen to about 20 percent, but it still moves roughly in step with the economy as a whole.) The chart, explained below, currently suggests that the economy is poised to turn around, but that the climb out will be a long one. 

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: DEFINING A BUSINESS CYCLE: Business cycles have four parts: an expansion, a slowdown, a downturn and a recovery. (Another version has only two parts: an expansion and a recession.) An entire cycle generally lasts 2 to 10 years.
Taming the swings: In the 1970s, cycles were volatile, marked by wild swings. But by the mid-1980s, a period known as the ''Great Moderation'' had taken hold. With computers helping businesses manage their inventories, policy makers paying more attention to inflation and perhaps just some good luck, cycles were mild and recessions were shallow.
READING THE CIRCULAR CHART: The chart at right shows industrial production in two ways: the amount produced -- compared with a long-term trend -- and whether it is rising or falling. Together, these two variables define a cycle.
A period of blips -- and one giant fall: Growth was weak earlier in this decade, but the economy appeared to be much more resilient. There were soft patches when the economy looked as if it were headed into a downturn, but it would then recover. In the last year, however, industrial production has fallen 13 percent, its deepest downturn since the end of World War
Signals that a recession is ending: This chart shows industrial production during the last seven recessions, and in the following six months. In each case, the recession ended around the time industrial production turned toward recovery. Because the pace of the current slowdown has leveled off, the economy appears to be close to that turning point.
What leading indicators say: While industrial production is thought to move with the economy, other indicators -- like consumer confidence, the length of the manufacturing workweek and interest rate spreads -- generally turn before the economy does. These indicators provide a preview of where the economy might be in a few months.(Source: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development

The Public Option
 In Health Care Reform
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Pitfalls of the Public Option'' (Economic View, June 28), in which N. Gregory Mankiw favored a ''lightly regulated'' private insurance system over one where a public option is included: 
 Would the system he advocates include a requirement that private insurers accept all applicants? As long as private insurers are allowed to pick whom they insure, there can be no universal health care system.
 Only by spreading the health care burden can such a system exist. The basic question is whether we, as a society, want universal care. Tom Miller
 Oakland, Calif., June 29
 To the Editor:
 In its argument against the public option in health care reform, the column said that ''we don't need government-run grocery stores or government-run gas stations to ensure that Americans can buy food and fuel at reasonable prices.'' 
 But how many grocers would turn away customers because they had a pre-existing condition? Does your employer choose what grocers you're allowed to use? We already have government-run gas stations if you consider all the subsidies and tax breaks and government services the oil companies get.
 As for competition in the current system, how much is there in a town with only one hospital? What procedures and drugs aren't covered in your plan? Do you really have a choice of doctors when you're being wheeled into an operating room? Are they all on your preferred-provider list? 
 Finally, if the free market is so good at providing health care, why is it more expensive in the United States than in other countries. And why isn't everyone covered? John Eastlund
 Bryan, Tex., June 29

BUSTED
 Life Inside the Great Mortgage Meltdown
 By Edmund L. Andrews
 220 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $25.95
 OUR LOT
 How Real Estate Came to Own Us
 By Alyssa Katz
 278 pp. Bloomsbury. $26
 ''The one Gnostic truth of real estate,'' Frank Bascombe, Richard Ford's gimlet-eyed Realtor-as-Jersey-philosopher, observes in ''Independence Day,'' is ''that people never find or buy the house they say they want.'' Instead, he counsels, ''you're presented with what you might have thought you didn't want, but what's available, whereupon you give in and start finding ways to feel good about it and yourself.''
 In the last decade in America, however, a counter-truth took shape: People were presented with what they thought they couldn't afford, whereupon they, fully aided and abetted by novel ''mortgage bankers'' -- and, it turns out, just about the entire supply chain of modern capitalism -- gave in and started finding ways to finance it. 
 According to the usual rules of Frank Bascombe's game, Edmund L. Andrews, an economics correspondent for The New York Times, wouldn't have been able to get the house he wanted, a ''three-bedroom cottage at the end of a tree-lined lane'' in suburban Maryland. He would have been gently steered to a cluster of more modest ''comps,'' perhaps dissuaded from buying at all. But the rules had changed, and there were people like Bob, a broker specializing in ''unusual situations'' -- e.g., how to procure a half-million-dollar mortgage for someone who, according to the transaction's final terms, had no ''stated income.'' 
 As in the 1950 film ''D.O.A.,'' which opens with its Everyman protagonist entering a police station to declare his own murder, then racing against time to learn who has poisoned him and why, Andrews's financial noir tale opens with the author already on the verge of default, confessing to no less a financial authority than Alan Greenspan. (''Why did you do it?'' the former Federal Reserve chairman, like a detective querying a perp, asks across the table; ''I took a gamble,'' Andrews responds.) The narrative then spools back to the sequence of events leading to the tragically ironic denouement: a man who spends his days covering economics for one of the world's leading newspapers -- who himself wrote ''several early-warning stories . . . about the spike in go-go mortgages'' -- becomes a supporting player in the story of the young century, the national meltdown triggered by the subprime mortgage crisis.
 Andrews admits he should have known better, but one of the tenets of ''Busted'' is that ''many of the people who should have known better did know better.'' Cassandras like the Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg, who spoke darkly of home prices outpacing Americans' ability to pay for them, were drowned out by the ringing of the till. ''As an economic voice, you might say, Merrill Lynch was courageously and almost constantly warning the public that the United States was dangerously overextended,'' Andrews writes. ''But in the real world, where Merrill Lynch was making billions of dollars in profits on exotic mortgage-backed securities, it was trying to torque up those winnings by using vast amounts of borrowed money.''
 There was, it turns out, a collective gamble going on -- an all-in bet that increasing home ownership was a good thing (''worth the risk,'' as Greenspan wrote), and that the rising tide of real estate prices, even when they began to surge beyond historical precedent, would cover the riskiest outlays. Andrews's autopsy on his mortgage and the conditions that helped produce it is sharp and at times mordantly funny, but I couldn't help being drawn more toward the messier personal narrative, looking for hints of the trouble to come. 
 The behavioral economics revolution has taught us that no man, including an economics correspondent, is pure homo economicus, a cool and rational calculator. Experiments have shown that even nutrition experts unwittingly eat more ice cream when given larger spoons. As other studies have shown that people say they will drive across town to save $5 on a $15 item but not $5 on a $125 item, we should perhaps not be surprised that people would fall victim to complex financing instruments that were ultimately not in their own self-interest. 
 And then there is love: in a house, romance and finance uniquely commingle. Neither marriages (''until death do us part'') nor mortgages (the root ''mort'' implying a pledge that ''dies'' when paid in full or defaulted upon) are without risk, as the recently divorced well know. As Andrews admits, the ''fever for romance and the speculative fever to get rich have a lot in common.'' Reading ''Busted,'' one suspects that Andrews plunged into both with reckless abandon. He proposes to his new wife, Patty, over the phone, before they have even kissed. He offers nearly half a million dollars for a house he has not seen.
 There is a whiff of ex post facto mythologizing at work here, as if he were trying, a bit too hard, to convince himself of his own story. Both he and his wife had left their long-term spouses and ''proudly risked everything to be together,'' in a ''glorious gamble.'' She was ''brainy, regal, sexy, fiery and eclectic,'' Andrews writes in a bit of heated salesmanship better reserved for a New York Review of Books personal. In buying that house on the leafy lane, Andrews asks himself, ''why had I tried to keep up the image of a conventional suburban family man, when nothing about my situation was conventional?'' -- an interesting question he never really answers. In the end, I wasn't sure whether ''Busted'' was brave or just therapeutic. It has since been noted by Megan McArdle of The Atlantic that Andrews's wife has twice filed for bankruptcy (the second time while they were married), a fact that Andrews omitted from the book and now insists has nothing ''to do with our subsequent financial problems.'' But given the book's accounting of $300 payments to Verizon, not to mention the pages it devotes to marital fights over money as he struggles to imagine things from his wife's point of view, this seems disingenuous. 
 Alyssa Katz, a New York journalist and the author of ''Our Lot,'' could no doubt have landed an exotic mortgage when her rent-regulated loft building went upscale condo. But she concluded the deal wasn't worth it, and moved ''off the map'' into deepest Brooklyn (and probably found ways to feel good about it, even as she admits to checking the sales history of friends' homes on PropertyShark.com). 
 But ''Our Lot'' is less a personal tale than a trenchant chronicle of how ''all that had been sacred about home lending'' was upended, through a series of government policies that were enacted with seemingly noble intentions -- broadening home ownership and priming the economic pump -- but ended up turning homes into profit centers rather than places to live. At ''the nadir of the insanity in 2006,'' she notes, an estimated ''two out of every five homes in Sacramento and vicinity had been bought by someone seeking to resell within two years.'' 
 In one of the book's most absorbing chapters, she visits South Florida, where the bromides of wealth gurus like Tony Robbins at a packed ''Real Estate and Wealth Expo'' are contrasted with the despairing tales of investors under water on dusty lots in speculative-build communities that come off like Potemkin villages in Margaritaville. Real estate values were rising in a place like Cape Coral because it had the nation's fastest growing job market -- but ''most of the jobs, it would turn out, involved building, financing, or selling houses to speculators.''
 Of course, South Florida had seen its land crazes before, with eager Northerners snapping up swampy lots sight unseen. Only this time, with mortgage money flowing faster than orange juice, houses were actually getting built, often in places where the demand or appeal was unclear. Sure, people were gullible, living beyond their means as Andrews admits to doing. But as Katz reminds us, the real estate bubble was also a crime scene. The only trouble is delineating where crime ended and social policy began. Mortgage fraud is an elusive term, Katz writes, but ''can be boiled down to any transaction where a buyer or seller lies to reap more money on a deal, or to qualify for a purchase they otherwise couldn't get.'' That, of course, ''would apply to much of the everyday business of the home trade in the mid-2000s.''

HEADLINE: Cutting Through the Clutter

BYLINE: By ANGELA BRALY. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I GREW up in Texas, the fourth of five children. We all had jobs growing up. When I worked at a drive-through photo booth, I had to answer the phone by saying, ''It's a great day at Fox Photo.''
 I was also a waitress. Waitressing taught me about hard work and serving people. I worked with a woman who told her young children that Christmas was actually after the holiday so she could buy their presents on sale. It was the only way she could afford them. 
I remember thinking that life isn't easy for everyone. It inspired me to work hard and have opportunities that wouldn't otherwise come along.
 I was a business major at Texas Tech University and decided to become a lawyer when I kept running into the same answer. Whenever I would ask the reason behind a certain business decision, the professor would attribute it to a legal requirement. I didn't want that to be the end of the story; I wanted to understand why. 
 I graduated in three years, in 1982, with a degree in finance, and then enrolled in the School of Law of Southern Methodist University in Dallas. I've found that a legal background allows you to cut through the clutter and identify the important issues.
 I moved to St. Louis to join a law firm and focused on public finance, mergers and acquisitions and securities. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri was one of our clients. It had just had a management change and was faced with legal challenges because it had moved from a nonprofit plan to a for-profit organization. When this happens, there are often questions about who owned the organization previously, whether it was a public charity or a mutual insurance company. Every state is different.
 In Missouri's case, these questions were the subject of several lawsuits. I agreed to become interim general counsel to help it through the legal process, but said that when I had finished it would have to recruit a full-time general counsel.
 I left the law firm and joined Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri in December 1997. In resolving the lawsuits, we created the Missouri Foundation for Health. The foundation's funding exceeded $1 billion and is designed to serve the uninsured and underinsured in Missouri. When a friend said the project might be the most intellectually stimulating work I would ever do in my career, I became determined to prove him wrong.
 Another of my colleagues had advised me to leave after a year and return to the law firm, but I fell in love with the job and the people and decided to stay. About a year after I joined the organization I became president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri, which would be acquired by WellPoint in 2002. Then WellPoint and Anthem merged, and I became general counsel of WellPoint. Two years ago, I became C.E.O. We operate for-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states and Unicare in the other states.
 All the C.E.O.'s I've talked to recently have said that the last year has been difficult because of the economy, but they've learned about themselves as leaders. No industry has been unscathed. When you reach this position, you might think you've arrived, but what you really do is realize that you constantly need to learn new things. 
 I'm very fortunate. I've been able to have this career and raise three children because my husband has helped carry the weight. As I got busier, he took on more responsibility. When we moved to Indiana, so I could become general counsel, he left his family's auto transport business so he could have a more flexible schedule. He's now in real estate and he teaches a college course. Our children rely on him for their day-to-day needs.
 My mother used to say I'd be bored if it weren't for my children. They keep me grounded.

HEADLINE: A U-Turn On Market Risk

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHILE it's not clear that the stock market lows of March 9 were the end of the bear market, one thing is certain: Investors have a whole new take on risk.
 After spending most of 2008 and the first quarter of this year fleeing from volatile areas of the market, investors are now racing toward them. A newly released survey by Russell Investments, taken at the end of May, shows that money managers are most bullish on emerging-market stocks. 
 Just three months earlier -- and before the start of the rally that sent emerging-market shares soaring more than 60 percent -- a version of the survey found that investors favored staid fixed-income investments, specifically high-quality corporate bonds. 
 ''The risk switch seems to have gone from full off to full on, with no in-between,'' said Mark Eibel, director of Russell's client investment strategies group.
 As concerns about the economy's health have ebbed, the common perception of risk has changed drastically, worrying some financial planners.
 Last year, after taking big losses, investors often fretted about the real possibility of losing capital invested in stocks.
 Today, investors are rushing back into them -- nearly $40 billion of new money has poured into stock funds since the end of March -- and are acting as if their biggest risk is being left behind by a rebounding market.
 ''It's the opposite of panic selling -- it's panic buying,'' said Greg Schultz, a principal at Asset Allocation Advisors, a financial planning firm in Walnut Creek, Calif.
 The fear is that they'll miss out on an opportunity to quickly make back last year's losses, especially if it turns out that the economy is really improving and an enduring bull market has begun.
 But what if the underlying assumption that has driven this rally -- that the economy is on the mend and that a recovery will occur by year-end -- is wrong? What if the economy takes longer to heal?
 For now, though, many investors are counting on a robust recovery. 
 ''That's the bet,'' Mr. Eibel said. 
 He noted that the Russell survey found that professional investors were favoring economically sensitive market sectors, while shifting out of defensive areas like consumer staples.
 ''Managers are now positioning their portfolios to take advantage of an economy that's set to grow,'' he said.
 But if investors don't see confirmation in the coming data -- for instance, if economic reports point to further troubles in the housing market -- ''it's not going to take much for them to start selling off,'' he said.
 In fact, there is a growing sense among economists and market watchers that investors have moved stock prices far ahead of the economic fundamentals.
 In a recent report, Stephen Biggar, director of global equity research at Standard & Poor's, noted that in a recovery, stocks typically anticipate how the economy is likely to be faring six months down the road. Today, he wrote, ''the market is already discounting the level of improvement we likely won't see until mid- to late 2010.''
 Yet Mr. Biggar warned that there is a strong possibility that the economic rebound would be hindered by slow job creation, continued weakness in housing, higher interest rates and rising oil prices.
 If the economy fails to meet expectations, there is another cause for concern: the possibility that investors who've been diving back into the market will be punished a second time -- compounding their losses in the recent downturn by buying stocks just before another drop. Then some shellshocked investors will sell at a loss.
 Buying and selling at the wrong time is a common hazard in markets that shift gears so quickly, as this one did back in March.
 Lately, there has been much buying of the flavor of the month -- the previous month, that is.
 ''In March, it was high-quality bonds; now its emerging-markets stocks,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''You can buy what did well just recently, but you have to remember that that doesn't get you any of the profits those investments have already rung up.''
 Mike Scarborough, the president of Scarborough Capital Management, an investment advisory service in Annapolis, Md., warns that even if this rally is real, history shows that recoveries don't send stock prices straight up.
 Typically after a bear market, some investors begin to question the sustainability of the initial surge and sell into the rally. This can push prices back down, and make the market ''retest'' its lows.
 This happened after the bear market in October 2002. After an initial post-bear run-up that lifted stock prices more than 21 percent, the S.& P. 500-stock index fell 15 percent from Nov. 27, 2002, to March 11, 2003.
 MR. SCARBOROUGH says he is concerned that investors now rushing into the market are likely to exit once the market retests its lows.
 ''The risk you run, going from abject fear over to greed so quickly, is that you'll run into a huge whipsaw,'' he said. ''That's the very reason why you're supposed to have a disciplined asset-allocation plan in place,'' where you commit a certain percentage of your portfolio to stocks and a certain percentage to bonds at all times -- regardless of market conditions.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Scarborough said, ''just as the sun rises and sets, people are going to chase returns.''

HEADLINE: O.A.S. Votes To Suspend Honduras Over Coup

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON and MARC LACEY; Ginger Thompson reported from Washington, and Marc Lacey from Tegucigalpa, Honduras.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Organization of American States voted Saturday night to suspend Honduras, but after deliberations that lasted until nearly midnight, it stopped short of calling on member countries to impose sanctions on the interim government responsible for ousting President Manuel Zelaya. 
 With a show of hands, all 33 members of the organization voted in favor of a resolution that expressed ''deep concern about the worsening of the current political crisis'' in Honduras, and called for the country's immediate suspension. It appeared that Honduras did not vote. 
 Afterward, Mr. Zelaya confirmed that he planned to return to Honduras on Sunday. ''I am going back to defend my people,'' he said. ''I am going back to defend my country.''
 Honduras is only the second country suspended by the O.A.S., the Western Hemisphere's top diplomatic body; Cuba was barred in 1962 as Fidel Castro took the island toward communism in the years after his 1959 revolution. The group said that Honduras would be held accountable for violations of human rights, and it called on Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza to continue diplomatic efforts aimed at peacefully returning President Zelaya to power. 
 But rather than calling on member countries to impose sanctions against Honduras, a move advocated by several countries, led by Venezuela, the resolution encouraged countries to ''review their relations'' with Honduras while diplomatic efforts continued, a more moderate stance that had been pressed by Canada and the United States. 
 It appeared that the United States and Canada were less persuasive in convincing Mr. Zelaya not to return to Honduras on Sunday. Some diplomats said his return would be like throwing a match in a tinderbox. 
 But during his speech to the O.A.S. Saturday night, Mr. Zelaya stood firm.
 ''This coup is a test to the rule of law of every country in the world,'' he said with passion after the vote. ''And I believe this test has been energetically answered.''
 Mr. Zelaya added: ''There are moments when keeping silent is a crime. This is one of those moments.''
 As the regional group gathered here to discuss suspending Honduras and escorting its ousted president back to his country, a torrent of defiant statements from leaders of the post-coup government seemed to further narrow the prospects of a diplomatic resolution. 
 The regional group got a bleak report from Mr. Insulza, whose whirlwind visit to Honduras on Friday not only failed to persuade Honduras's de facto government to surrender power, but also seemed to solidify the coup leaders' resolve. Mr. Insulza described his discussions with leaders of the Honduran Supreme Court as ''tense.'' He said that in light of the ''inflexible attitude of the de facto regime,'' there seemed to be no alternative to suspending Honduras. 
 ''This should not be interpreted as an action against the Honduran people,'' he said, ''but as a way of pressuring the de facto government.''
 In Tegucigalpa, the capital, it seemed clear the post-coup government was squaring for a fight. Attempting to outflank the O.A.S.'s plans to suspend Honduras, the interim government -- which took power last Sunday after troops stormed President Zelaya's home, detained him and put him on a plane to Costa Rica -- announced Friday night that it was quitting the group.
 On Saturday afternoon, it was clear that some in the O.A.S. were also prepared to push back. A handful of the region's presidents, including the leaders of Argentina, Ecuador and Paraguay, were scheduled to arrive here to accompany Mr. Zelaya to Honduras on Sunday. 
 Meanwhile, others in the organization were expected to argue strongly against the plan, saying Mr. Zelaya's return to Honduras would be like throwing a match into a tinderbox.
 Peter Kent, a minister of state in Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs, told the meeting that suspending Honduras would not be enough to restore democratic order. 
 And he said the organization had to ''maintain diplomatic initiatives,'' aimed at directly engaging the interim government, to help end the crisis. 
 As for President Zelaya's plans to return, Mr. Kent was emphatically opposed to the idea, saying, ''It is far from clear that the current conditions could guarantee his safety upon return.''
 On the streets of Tegucigalpa on Saturday, anti-Zelaya protesters lined up to defend the new government, while more than 10,000 people answered his videotaped call to turn out at the airport, vowing to guard him upon his return. A man with a megaphone shouted at the soldiers: ''Are you the armed forces of the people or the armed forces of the bourgeois?''
 In a statement on the radio, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Tegucigalpa, Cardinal Oscar Andres Rodriguez, said there could be a ''bloodbath'' if Mr. Zelaya returned.
 With the O.A.S. suspension all but certain, the most pressing matters facing the group on Saturday were decisions over how to proceed. 
 A senior Obama administration official said the United States would probably move to suspend economic development and military assistance. 
 The Pentagon had already suspended joint operations with the Honduran military. But administration officials have said there was concern about shutting down all military operations in Honduras, because the air base there serves as a major staging area for regional security programs, including counternarcotics efforts.
 Some diplomats said that with channels of communication failing between Honduras and the O.A.S., there was talk of inviting a respected regional political figure to serve as a mediator. Among those on the list, one official said, was Oscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. 
 The one thing that seemed clear was the increasing isolation of one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere. 
 Roberto Micheletti, who was sworn in by the Congress to replace Mr. Zelaya, said Honduras would no longer recognize the O.A.S. charter because of the unilateral and indignant resolutions coming from the body. 
 In a letter to Mr. Insulza -- who had visited Honduras on Friday -- he called the O.A.S. ''a political organization, not a court,'' and said, ''It can't judge us.''
 But in the hours before the O.A.S. meeting in Washington, Assistant Secretary General Albert R. Ramdin said the current Honduran leadership did not even have the power to withdraw. Only a legitimate government can withdraw from the organization, he said in a statement. 
 Honduran officials said that they had no intention of allowing Mr. Zelaya's return and that they would go ahead with elections, which had been scheduled for November but could be moved up.
 Mr. Zelaya's ouster was driven at least in part by fears that a referendum he was planning to amend the Constitution was really a backhanded attempt to extend his stay in power.
 Setting up a showdown, Mr. Zelaya had said he would return to Honduras this weekend, despite his opponents' threats to jail him if he did.
 To put the squeeze on Mr. Zelaya's finances, the current government said it had canceled a government credit card that he had been using since his ouster, as well as various bank accounts that he and his allies had access to, local news media reported. It also ended rental contracts for 50 cars and canceled 61 cellphone contracts.

HEADLINE: Mini Debate: Flawed or Quirky

BYLINE: By RICHARD S. CHANG

 BODY:
WHEN General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, readers contributed fond memories of their G.M. cars. Others wrote in with horror stories.
 ''We never intended to abandon U.S.-built cars and always looked at them when we need a car, but the quality, price and resale value never matched the Japanese cars,'' wrote Michael Xantos. ''Sad, but G.M. is dead.'' 
 Invariably, readers said that G.M. deserved to be in bankruptcy because of its failure to build high-quality cars. 
 But is a brand's success necessarily related to its quality? Mini presents an interesting example. 
 In the latest J.D. Power & Associates Initial Quality Survey, Mini ranked 37th in initial quality -- out of 37 brands -- with 165 problems per 100 vehicles. In other words, Mini was dead last.
 At the same time, Mini has been a much-beloved brand with strong sales. Mini had recently announced it would be adding 17 more dealerships in the United States over the next 18 months in anticipation of double-digit sales growth by 2011.
 So what gives? 
 As it turns out, some of things that Mini owners absolutely adore about their cars are also the problems that owners marked down in the J.D. Power survey.
 ''Mini has some idiosyncrasies that we engineer into our cars,'' Jim McDowell, vice president of Mini USA, told The Associated Press. As examples, Mr. McDowell cited the Mini's unusual ambient interior lighting and windshield-wiper control, which is a button instead of a knob.
 David Sargent, vice president of automotive research at J.D. Power, confirmed Mr. McDowell's claims. ''A number of Mini's problems are related to the intuitiveness of the car's interior dash controls,'' he said. The Initial Quality Survey covers the first 90 days of ownership. And during that time, owners are still getting used to their cars.

HEADLINE: Medicare's Mixed Legacy

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Should the government get in the health insurance business?
 The question will be debated fiercely in coming months as President Obama and some Democratic lawmakers push for the creation of a government-run plan to compete with private insurance companies for the business of nearly 50 million people who are without insurance.
 Insurers say they fear they will be driven out of the business, unable to compete with the government's market power to demand lower prices. Other critics warn of another unwieldy federal bureaucracy subject to the whims of Congress. But supporters say private insurers have failed to offer affordable coverage to all Americans and that the government needs to step up. 
 It won't be the first time. The federal government is already in the health insurance business in a big way, providing coverage to more than 45 million elderly and disabled people through Medicare. (Another government plan, Medicaid, is run and financed in combination with the states to provide health care to about 60 million poor people.) 
 How closely a new public plan would resemble Medicare is unclear. Still, Medicare's record offers insights into the benefits and pitfalls of public health care. While it has driven down costs though its sheer market dominance, Medicare has also been extremely slow in using its power to encourage or compel more effective health care. And, of course, providing health care for older Americans has been expensive. Medicare is expected to represent an estimated 13 percent of next year's federal budget.
 Medicare has evolved into the bedrock of health insurance for America's elderly population since it was created in 1965. Anyone over 65 qualifies for coverage, regardless of income or health status. The program focuses on paying medical claims rather than denying them, as private insurers often do, and those covered have found it relatively easy to understand what benefits are provided and to find a doctor who will treat them. The elderly also have the option under Medicare of enrolling in health plans offered by private insurers. 
 ''Medicare's great success is its popularity,'' said Joseph Baker, the president of the Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. ''It's simple and you can go anywhere with it.'' 
 When Medicare was established, many older Americans had no private insurance at all -- and many were going bankrupt when they became seriously ill. Medicare has been ''an invaluable safety net,'' said Karen Ignagni, the chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, which represents the nation's private insurers. 
 Even those who favor private-sector competition over government intervention say Congress needed to step in. ''Medicare was designed to address a real problem,'' said Robert E. Moffit, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Center for Health Policy Studies. ''There was a market failure.'' But the result, he said, was ''a government monopoly.''
 Medicare's market leverage enables it to purchase medical care much more cheaply than private insurers do, and the government uses this clout to drive down prices as a way of controlling costs. Because Medicare represents such a large share of the overall insurance market, hospitals and doctors typically treat Medicare patients even when they might refuse to accept a patient from a private insurer paying the same rate. 
 Medicare's monopoly over the insurance market for the elderly also allows it to compel important changes in the way medical care is paid for. In the early 1980s, for example, the government pioneered a way of paying hospitals a fixed sum, based on a patient's illness, rather than simply for the cost of care. Hospitals stays dropped significantly, as did overall costs.
 But it is that very market power that critics worry about as the debate over a new public plan for the uninsured begins. If lawmakers model such a program on Medicare, ''its lower costs will tend to drive people into the plan,'' said Dr. Mark B. McClellan, a physician and economist who ran Medicare under President George W. Bush.
 And that, critics say, could mean private insurers will be squeezed out of that market and consumers will lose the opportunity to choose among different insurance plans. 
 On the other hand, if Congress creates a smaller program that lacks Medicare's market power, it would raise another question: why do it at all? The government could simply set the rules for competition among private plans and, if necessary, offer subsidies to consumers to help them purchase coverage.
 But a public plan could still have a cost advantage. Medicare is less expensive to administer than private plans, according to Karen Davis, the president of the Commonwealth Fund, a New York nonprofit group that favors the creation of a public plan. While Medicare spends only 2 percent to 3 percent on administrative expenses, large private insurers may spend 17 percent, she said. The private companies spend more on expenses like marketing, determining what to charge customers and, if they are publicly held, paying profits to their shareholders. 
 Many policy experts say Medicare is probably spending too little money on administering the program, whether, for example, in ferreting out fraud or in managing patient care. Still, many in the private sector acknowledged that, overall, the government has proven to be very efficient. ''What has become very clear is that we have much more to do in simplifying the administrative process,'' said Ms. Ignagni of the insurance companies she represents.
 But Medicare has also demonstrated how difficult it is for a government program to innovate and improve the care provided to those it covers. ''It's not good at change -- that's the flip side,'' Ms. Davis said. 
 For instance, Congress didn't add coverage for prescription drugs until 2003, years after such coverage was being provided by private insurers.
 ''When it comes to benefit structure, that has been frozen pretty much since 1965,'' said Paul B. Ginsburg, a health economist who is president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C.
 Many experts say Medicare's way of paying doctors encourages them to provide a high volume of care rather than the most cost-effective treatments. They say the program has been particularly slow in experimenting with new payment methods.
 For example, Congress directed Medicare in 2002 to explore a new way of paying doctors to oversee and coordinate overall patient care, rather than simply paying doctors to treat particular ailments or conditions. But the government will not have the final results of that experiment until 2012, Ms. Davis said. ''No private insurer would take 10 years to develop a new product,'' she said. 
 Another problem, critics say, has been Congress. 
 Lawmakers are aggressively lobbied whenever Medicare contemplates changes, and Congress increasingly has micromanaged the agency, said Bruce C. Vladeck, who ran Medicare under the Clinton administration and is now a consultant. ''The Congress has assumed a very central role in these things,'' making it much harder for Medicare to innovate, he said.
 Still, a new public plan could use its potential influence to help change the direction of American health care, Ms. Davis argued. More powerful than a private insurer, the government can help move the country toward a new payment system that rewards hospitals and doctors for better care and keeps a tighter lid over what they charge for treatments.
 ''You are controlling the price,'' she said, ''and you could control the method.''

HEADLINE: What the Russians Say About Us

 BODY:
What do Americans not understand about Russia? On the eve of President Obama's arrival in Moscow, The New York Times asked readers of its Russian-language blog at community.livejournal.com/nytimesinmoscow. Here are excerpts from their responses, as translated by The Times's Moscow bureau, each introduced by the user's Web nickname. Some readers gave details about themselves, which were not independently confirmed.
 SKABLYAN: The Russian character is founded on contradictions. Inwardly, we understand that in the contemporary world we have not much to be proud of. Therefore, we seek moments of greatness in our history and protect them reverently. The very same can be said of the Soviet Union. The facts show that during the U.S.S.R., the standard of living of the average citizen was, to put it lightly, low. However, paradoxically, the same U.S.S.R. was one of the poles of international politics, and therefore we can't throw out that heritage and call that era a black spot in our nation's history. Denis, 27, Moscow. 
 TIKI2TAVI: In Russia, familial and friendly connections are stronger, mistrust of authority is stronger and we value work less. In practice, this means that we take loans from our friends and relatives more often than from the bank, we go to them instead of the psychoanalyst, we deal with a drunk neighbor without calling the police, and many go on livejournal.com while at work.
 DEPECHE: It seems to me that Americans don't know where to put Russia now. Under Brezhnev, we were the evil empire; under Gorbachev, we became friends, and then a failed state, a Burkina Faso with nuclear weapons. Under Yeltsin, at first we were a young democracy to pat on the shoulder; under Putin, we again became the empire of evil, although a toothless one. Where is Russia now? What is she planning to do? Are we a run-of-the-mill corrupt oil-state like Nigeria, or does the presence of nuclear weaponry complicate things? If I were an American, I wouldn't bother to think about the curious Russian soul but would look at the naked facts. Russia isn't planning to invade anyone, and the conflict with Georgia was just to preserve the status quo. Therefore, from the military point of view, Russia is harmless. As far as economics is concerned, Russia doesn't present any interest to the U.S.A., with the exception of a couple of rare earth metals. Although Russia is one of the primary exporters of oil, its behavior in this regard is at least predictable.
 In conclusion: there's no need to classify Russia and place it in some group of countries. We, like China, are a separate planet. When it comes to predicting the future, not even Russians can do that. For now, the situation is better than 30 years ago, and the appearance of private capital in the country allows one to hope that Russia will be part of the global community. Peter, IT specialist, 30.
 PETRODVORETS: Well, Americans will never be able to understand us, because you are stuck in the cocoon of your mass media, which always depicts Russians as the enemies of America.
 I--KASSIA: It's very simple: an American needs success and a Russian needs truth. And the Russian word ''truth'' (righteousness, honesty, justice and everything that is higher than justice -- love, open-heartedness, care for the weak ones) cannot be fully translated into English. Therefore, an American cannot understand what do Russians want. What does this mean ''to live by truth''? In practice, we, almost without exception, are not capable of ''living by truth'' ourselves. But we don't accept anything below this as a norm. Such is the Russian paradox. And we want Americans to understand this? Funny. Or, do we believe that Americans sincerely want to understand this? Even funnier.
 STRELOC84: The Great Patriotic War [World War II] is important for us because we lost more than 26 million people in it, more than any other country. Even now practically every Russian family can recall their ancestors who perished in that war. This war was a threat to the very existence of the foundation of the state (not only of the Soviet Union) and it was the entire state, the society and the people who won this war.
 The memory of this war is one of the system-forming factors for the existence of our country.
 The dual attitude toward the Soviet Union: First of all, not everyone has a dual attitude. There are many who sincerely believe that the Soviet Union had no shortcomings. Are we proud of the achievements of the Soviet Union? Why should we not be proud of them? I think the dual attitude comes from the disappointment caused by the destruction of the probably inefficient but powerful and stately structure the Soviet Union was.
 Also, after the breakdown of the Soviet Union, we did not see many good things, which explains a kind of nostalgia. And apart from everything else, the advantages of an authoritarian state still remain advantages: very low crime rate, absence of massive drug abuse, social stability.
 A couple words about anti-Americanism in our society. To an extent, it is due to objective reasons, like eastward NATO expansion or deploying ABM radars at our borders. Another reason is a historic feeling of injury for the defeat suffered in the cold war. Of course, the media is pouring oil on fire by salting the wounds of old complexes and going off about the U.S. military threat. My name is Andrey Bespalov, 24, merchandiser from Samara.
 DEER00HUNTER: ''What kind of a country do we have? We have everything but cannot live.'' Viktor Chernomyrdin, former prime minister.
 The situation is very simple. In order to understand a person one needs to know what he wants. In order to understand what he wants, it is necessary that his actions be logical and the logic of his actions not change in the course of time.
 Our country and our people don't know what they want themselves. 
 In the very beginning of the 18th century, Peter the Great issued a command to ''cut a window to Europe'' and everybody began to cut, strived for the European values, achieved European levels in science, culture, education. The trend continued in the 19th century and reached its culmination in the beginning of the 20th century, when capitalism, though later than in other countries, began to emerge in Russia.
 And suddenly, an abrupt turn back. 1917. October. The revolution brings the country about 100-120 years back, leads to a national catastrophe -- the civil war begins. For more than 70 years after it, the country is developing on its own, absolutely unique ''special path'' (as they say now). There are two camps. Finally, the U.S.S.R. gets the name of an ''evil empire.'' 
 Then another abrupt turn. 1985. Gorbachev. Perestroika and glasnost. People understand that ''one shouldn't live like this.'' The system is destroyed instantly. Everything that had been created by several generations collapsed.
 1991. the U.S.S.R. ceases to exist. Russia turns to the West again. The country gets a Constitution, normal relations with its neighbors and with the majority of the world's countries. Some democracy emerges.
 200X. At best, we are ignored by the West. Practically no relations with the neighbors. Quite a strange situation in the country. And I won't say a word about democracy.
 So, where are we going? What do we want? It's absolutely not clear. West-East. Left-right. There is a great phrase in Orwell's ''1984'': ''The one who owns the past, owns the future.'' This is where the roots of most of our problems are, we don't own our past. We don't understand our past.
 KIRGUDUEV: Americans cannot understand why Russia, which they see as an aggressive country, is seen by Russians as peaceful, though peace-loving and democratic United States is seen by Russians as an aggressor and a threat to peace. However, if we look at the history of the new Russia (after 1991), it fought in a foreign territory only once, and after its citizens were attacked (Georgia, 2008). The United States within the same period of time used its armed forces in foreign territories many times, and all of its pretexts sounded like blatant lies. 
 DETIARBATA: Americans seem not to understand a lot. In short: Americans likely do not understand that it's difficult for Russian society to get rid of multi-layer traditions of lies, very often lies with good intentions, and it's difficult for the Russians to get rid of the most impossible symbols of lies, like Lenin's mausoleum. Also, Americans likely don't understand that it's difficult for Russians to somehow separate their private life from the state (the state did not always allow such a luxury!), including to somehow separate the real life from the abstract system of rules and values in the state. As a whole, Americans likely don't fully understand how archaic (traditional) may be the Russian concept of the state.
 Also, Americans likely don't understand how much the role of the allies in the victory over Nazi Germany and its allies is played down in the conscience of Russians. And Americans likely don't properly understand the concept of ''The Great Patriotic War'' in which there is practically no space for Americans themselves. Also, Americans likely don't understand the gap between the elite and the rest of Russian society, the degree of completeness and incompleteness of the process of Europeanization of Russia.
 And the most important -- Americans likely don't understand why Russia is afraid of NATO so much, but the Russians likely don't understand it. Well, they were told they have to be afraid and that's it.

 VERYEAGER: About the ambivalent attitude. Don't Americans have such ambivalent attitude towards their own country? Americans are very proud of their achievements but they also pay attention to their own shortcomings. They remember about Watergate, about the defeat in the war in Vietnam, about the Great Depression, about the destruction of Indians. Michael Moore's critical movies, the ''South Park'' cartoons are popular, conspiracy theories accusing the U.S. government in the events on Sept. 11, 2001, are popular.
 The other thing is that the image of the Soviet Union was probably so demonized in the States that it's difficult for Americans to understand how people can see something that it is possible to be proud of. In fact, if one sees the U.S.S.R. as an evil empire where commissars constantly tortured and executed people, having killed 60 or 100 million people, it is difficult to understand how something good can be found in it. However, the reality is that the majority of people living in Russia today know the U.S.S.R. not only from propaganda, comic books and Hollywood movies, but from their personal experience. And they remember that it was quite a normal country with lots of problems and oddities, but nevertheless quite suitable for living and which had quite a few advantages and achievements. Most of those advantages and achievements were lost in the course of the forced transfer to the contemporary Russian capitalism which explains the nostalgia of many people for the U.S.S.R.
 For an American to understand Russians' feelings about the U.S.S.R., it is necessary first of all to understand that the contemporary image of this country for the U.S. residents was purposefully formed in the course of the ''cold war,'' including resorting to direct lies and manipulations. That was a conscious demonization, conscious creation of the ''image of an enemy'' which had to justify huge military expenditures for the taxpayers and, say, a necessity to send their sons to shed blood in Vietnam. And an image that had been forming for decades cannot disappear overnight, it is maintained because it turned into a common practice. Look at the caricature images of Russians in Hollywood movies -- always drunk, unshaven and in fur hats with ear flaps, even if it's a cosmonaut on an orbital station (like in the ''Armageddon'' movie).

 BODY:
AMERICAN LION: Andrew Jackson in the White House, by Jon Meacham. (Random House, $18.) This entertaining and well-written book won this year's Pulitzer Prize for biography. Jackson saw himself as an outsider sent to Washington on a populist tide, and he greatly increased the power of his office. ''Of the great early presidents'' Jackson is ''in many ways the most like us,'' Meacham writes. His life and work illuminate ''America's perennially competing impulses . . . the struggle between grace and rage, generosity and violence, justice and cruelty.'' 
 AMERICA AMERICA, by Ethan Canin. (Random House, $15.) The protagonist of Canin's novel is a working-class boy in upstate New York who does odd jobs for a wealthy local man who is also a political kingmaker. In middle age, the narrator -- educated by his boss and married to one of his daughters -- looks back on events in 1971 and 1972 surrounding the campaign of a senator and presidential candidate backed by his patron. ''I was involved with something . . . unforgivably wrong,'' he thinks. 
 THE REAGAN DIARIES, edited by Douglas Brinkley. (Harper Perennial, $19.99.) Ronald Reagan kept his diaries -- boiled down here by about two-thirds -- chiefly as memory books, but they yield many political and historical insights. They show him as an active and alert chief executive, particularly in his first term. He had harsh words for Republican moderates, but he disliked the zealots even more. And his love for his wife, Nancy, shines through, as does his affection for friends from his Hollywood days. 
 INVENTING NIAGARA: Beauty, Power, and Lies, by Ginger Strand. (Simon & Schuster, $16.) ''This book documents an obsession,'' Strand writes. ''An obsession with the things Niagara has been made to mean: . . . nature, America, power, beauty, death.'' Simultaneously thoughtful and amusing, she explores its history and its place in popular culture. She also visits the offices of the New York Power Authority as it turns up the flow of water for the spring tourist season and interviews a worker who contracted cancer through his job at a local Goodyear plant. 
 THE COMANCHE EMPIRE, by Pekka Hamalainen. (Yale University, $22.) In the 18th and much of the 19th century, an aggressive empire dominated large expanses of the American Southwest. But these imperialists weren't European -- they were Comanche. The book presents ''a reversal of usual historical roles,'' Hamalainen writes. ''It is a story in which Indians expand, dictate and prosper, and European colonists resist, retreat and struggle to survive.'' ''The Comanche Empire'' won the 2009 Bancroft Prize. 
 THE GARDEN OF LAST DAYS, by Andre Dubus III. (Norton, $14.95.) One September night in 2001, a Saudi visits a Florida club and pays a stripper to dance for him. She is a single mother who has brought her 3-year-old to work; while she dances, the child is briefly kidnapped by an unhappy patron. Dubus, who wrote ''House of Sand and Fog,'' based this novel partly on what is known about the Florida-based terrorist cell that hijacked a plane on 9/11. 
 A NATION OF COUNTERFEITERS: Capitalists, Con Men, and the Making of the United States, by Stephen Mihm. (Harvard University, $18.95.) Only with the Civil War did the United States have a federally backed currency; before that, hundreds of unregulated private banks issued money, much of it of dubious value. ''This is a fun book,'' Stephen Kotkin wrote in The Times. ''Mihm's creative account of the early American economy shines.'' 
 ELLINGTON BOULEVARD: A Novel in A-Flat, by Adam Langer. (Spiegel & Grau, $15.) The love lives and housing destinies of 10 New Yorkers center around an apartment on a gentrifying stretch of West 106th Street. The novel has ''a streetwise sentimentality that feels authentic,'' our reviewer, Troy Patterson, said. 
 FRANKLIN AND LUCY: Mrs. Rutherfurd and the Other Remarkable Women in Roosevelt's Life, by Joseph E. Persico. (Random House, $18.) This book's focus is Roosevelt's affair with Lucy Mercer (later Rutherfurd), a relationship that began in the 1910s, ended when Eleanor Roosevelt discovered it in 1918, and then resumed. Persico also discusses Roosevelt's relationships with other women, reminding us of a time when politicians' private lives stayed private. 
 THE DAY THE EARTH CAVED IN: An American Mining Tragedy, by Joan Quigley. (Random House, $16.) An underground coal seam fire has burned below Centralia, Pa., for four decades, destroying the town as the state and federal governments have failed to provide the money to stop it. The book ''inspires outrage in the muckraking tradition,'' Harry Hurt III wrote in The Times. 
 THE DUMBEST GENERATION: How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future (Or, Don't Trust Anyone Under 30), by Mark Bauerlein. (Jeremy P. Tarcher/Penguin, $15.95.) American high school students know and do less than ever, while the digital world has eroded their attention spans and analytical skills, Bauerlein argues.

HEADLINE: Not Much Relief

 BODY:
Four months into the Obama administration's antiforeclosure effort, the White House's best guesstimate is that ''over 50,000'' at-risk loans have been modified so that homeowners can afford their payments and keep their homes. A Treasury official told The Times's Peter Goodman there is no precise data because a tracking system has yet to be completed. Still, the official predicted that by the end of August, the program would modify 20,000 bad loans a week. 
 That would be an enormous jump. But even 20,000 weekly modifications, starting two months from now, would most likely be too few. 
 Unless substantially more relief is forthcoming, Moody's Economy.com projects that some seven million homes will fall into foreclosure this year and next. Of those, nearly 4.5 million will result in distress sales, prolonging the recession by adding to the downward pull on house prices, home equity and household wealth. And those dire projections may prove too optimistic. 
 Banks say they are overwhelmed by the clamor for relief and are working hard to meet demand. We have heard that before. In May 2007, a group of banks and loan servicers went to Washington to promise a solution for troubled borrowers. The problem has only gotten worse. 
 A more plausible explanation is that banks feel no great urgency to act. They are being buoyed by immense government support. And the Obama plan -- which provides up to $75 billion in subsidies and incentive payments to help lenders and borrowers come to new loan terms -- imposes no real penalty on lenders if the modifications don't happen. 
 So instead of moving forcefully on foreclosure relief, the players in the mortgage chain -- lenders, servicers and investors -- have spent months parsing whether the incentives are adequate. Administration officials have spent countless hours clarifying the rules, trying to iron out the differences and pressing the industry to do more. 
 The longer it takes, the worse the problem gets. Foreclosures cause price declines and contribute to economic weakness. That causes more foreclosures and other financial problems, making it harder for troubled borrowers to afford even reduced payments. 
 Last week, President Obama loosened the rules on his mortgage-refinancing program so that borrowers who are current in their payments, but lack home equity, may be able to switch to a loan with a lower interest rate.
 The borrowers most in need of help, however, are those who are in imminent danger of foreclosure and who cannot refinance, generally because they owe far more on their loans than their homes are worth. A big drawback of the Obama plan is that it emphasizes lowering monthly payments rather than reducing the loan's principal.
 Reducing principal is a better idea because it restores equity to borrowers, which gives them more of an incentive to keep paying their loans and makes redefault less likely. Banks generally loathe principal reductions, in part because they result in upfront losses, and the administration has not championed the idea.
 The president and his aides must be prepared to rethink their position. 
 Done correctly, a loan modification should benefit everyone. For a troubled borrower, it is a chance to stay in the home. For lenders, it means that they will make more money than they would make from a foreclosure. For taxpayers, the cost of subsidizing the right sort of modifications will be far less than the damage to the economy from millions of more foreclosures.

HEADLINE: Myanmar Junta Rebuffs Effort by U.N. Leader to Meet With Jailed Dissident

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: YANGON, Myanmar 

 BODY:
Myanmar's ruling military junta gave no sign to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, that it was prepared to accept any outside pressure about the future of democracy here, rejecting his request on Saturday to visit the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and offering only vague assurances about fair elections. 
 Mr. Ban tried to cast the two-day visit in a positive light, noting that one trip was insufficient to solve problems of several decades and that engaging the country's military ruler, Senior Gen. Than Shwe, was the lone route to try to effect change in time for the 2010 vote for Parliament -- the first elections scheduled in two decades. 
 ''My meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi or not meeting with her should not be the benchmark of success or failure of my visit,'' Mr. Ban told reporters as he left the country. ''The senior general repeated several times that they are committed to make the election a credible one.''
 The election issues that Mr. Ban said he broached with the generals included releasing more than 2,000 political prisoners, publishing an election law, establishing an electoral commission and allowing opposition groups to open offices nationwide. 
 But the fact that the junta barred a meeting with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi raised questions about just how inclusive future elections could be. 
 ''I think they have missed a very important opportunity of demonstrating their willingness to commit to achieving reconciliation of all political leaders,'' the secretary general said. 
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been on trial, facing a prison term for breaking the conditions of her lengthy house arrest by sheltering an American who swam across a lake to her house because he had a vision about her. Mr. Ban said he was told that he could not visit her because ''they did not want to be seen as being interfered with or pressured from the outside.'' 
 The basic reaction from the State Peace and Development Council, as the five-member junta calls itself, seemed to be that while it was happy to welcome Mr. Ban, it was not particularly interested in his message. The front page of the English-language daily New Light of Myanmar featured a picture of Mr. Ban meeting with General Than Shwe, but the article merely listed the members of the delegation, referring to it as a social call. 
 After his overtures met a cool reception, Mr. Ban spent his last hour in the country delivering a public speech -- rare for an outsider in Myanmar. Addressing an audience of humanitarian organizations and the diplomatic corps, he warned the leadership that the country's future prosperity hinged on opening up. 
 Saying Myanmar sits stagnant amid Asia's economic miracle, the secretary general noted the country's human rights record is a matter ''of grave concern.''
 ''The question today is this: how much longer can Myanmar afford to wait for national reconciliation, democratic transition and respect for human rights?'' he said. 
 Mr. Ban was criticized for embarking on the trip by some Western governments, notably the United States and France, which viewed it as window dressing for the junta without any guarantee of progress. But even as Mr. Ban left empty-handed, a senior United Nations official defended the visit. 
 ''This says that the secretary general can't go out and talk to questionable regimes anywhere in the world without putting a label on them,'' said the senior official, speaking anonymously according to United Nations guidelines. He said any outcome from the visit would hinge on how the junta treated the elections. ''The real question is will they take on board the statements that are there and will it affect the process,'' the official said. 
 Other Security Council members, like Britain, supported the visit as a means to get a dialogue going with the junta toward diminishing its isolation and improving its record on human and civil rights. 
 But it was unclear that the ruling generals see it that way. The senior official quoted General Than Shwe as saying that the next time the secretary general visited, the leader would be an average citizen. That implies that the next visit would come after the elections expected in early 2010. The military plans on a civilian government that, among other measures in the new Constitution, reserves one quarter of the seats in the new Parliament for the officer corps. 
 Analysts suggested that it was time for a different approach. 
 ''Trying to broker a deal between the generals and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been a graveyard for foreign mediators for nearly two decades,'' said Thant Myint-U, the author of a history of Myanmar, previously called Burma, entitled ''The River of Lost Footsteps'' and a former United Nations official. ''I think it may be time for a slightly more creative approach to addressing Burma's challenges.''
 Mr. Ban visited Myanmar a year ago in the wake of Cyclone Nargis, which killed some 138,000 people. He won praise then for persuading the country's recalcitrant generals to reverse themselves and allow foreign aid. 
 On Saturday, Myanmar officials showed off a village of some 60 wooden houses with tin roofs that housed several hundred people who lost their homes. 
 ''Comparing the situation which I saw last year, this is quite a different improvement,'' Mr. Ban said of Kyan Da village in the Irrawaddy Delta. ''I am glad the government has taken necessary measures.''
 Foreign relief workers called Kyan Da a Potemkin showcase, where each house cost about $2,000 and ran about 300 square feet, far beyond their United Nations-approved budget of about $200 for a 160-square-foot shelter. At the same time, the government was insisting that some lower-cost shelters be torn down as unsightly at a time when about 130,000 people are still without shelters, they said, out of the original 500,000 homeless.

HEADLINE: Heading to Russia, Obama Is Mindful Of Its Power Equation: One Plus One

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
The summit meeting here this week revolves around two men with some notable affinities. Presidents Obama and Dmitri A. Medvedev are relatively young leaders who represent a new generation of post-cold-war leadership, who once taught law and embrace the Internet. (Mr. Medvedev even has a video blog.)
 One difference stands out, though: Mr. Obama is the undisputed head of his nation. Mr. Medvedev? Well, that is a bit more complicated, and is a significant problem for the Obama administration as it prepares for discussions on Monday.
 Mr. Medvedev holds the highest office in Russia, so protocol dictates that Mr. Obama meet and negotiate nuclear arms control and other matters with him. Yet questions about Mr. Medvedev's authority hang over the summit meeting like an awkward familial arrangement that everyone acknowledges but no one knows how to handle. 
 Mr. Obama himself waded into the issue on Thursday when he made a pointed remark about Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, who is Mr. Medvedev's mentor and is widely assumed to be Russia's real ruler.
 Mr. Obama said that Mr. Putin, the former president, had ''one foot in the old ways of doing business and one foot in the new.'' Mr. Obama said that it was time to move forward and that Mr. Medvedev ''understands that.''
 The comment suggested that Mr. Obama was trying to build up Mr. Medvedev, who the Americans say they believe may be easier to deal with than Mr. Putin.
 American officials said that Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev met at the Group of 8 summit meeting in London in April and that they seemed to hit it off. But the officials said they feared that Mr. Putin stood in the way. 
 Mr. Obama also may have been trying to protect his own domestic political flank, anticipating criticism that he is too easy on the Kremlin.
 Mr. Putin, who is often quick with a retort when criticized, seemed to go out of his way on Friday not to take offense at Mr. Obama's comment.
 ''We stand firmly on our feet and always look to the future,'' Mr. Putin said. He said he was awaiting Mr. Obama's visit with ''very warm feelings.''
 Still, the strategy of empowering Mr. Medvedev might be difficult to carry out, and it might even backfire. Mr. Medvedev might respond by emphatically moving closer to Mr. Putin to avoid the appearance of being influenced by Mr. Obama.
 Well aware of those dynamics, the White House seems to be hedging its bets. So while Mr. Obama is spending several hours with Mr. Medvedev on Monday, he is scheduled to have breakfast with Mr. Putin the next day.
 Speculation about where the power lies in the Putin-Medvedev tandem began as soon as Mr. Medvedev took office last year after being endorsed by Mr. Putin, who was barred by term limits from running again. But the uncertainty has taken on added urgency now that Mr. Obama has pledged to ''reset'' relations.
 David J. Kramer, a Russian specialist who was a senior diplomat in the administration of President George W. Bush, said Mr. Obama's remark on Thursday appeared to indicate a degree of exasperation over Mr. Putin's continued prominence.
 ''You have to do business with Medvedev, and then you have to do the same business with Putin, and you may get a different answer,'' Mr. Kramer said. ''You can't do one without the other. It may be a frustration, wishing that Medvedev were more powerful. But certainly the flip side of this is that Putin is not just lurking in the background, but is very much at the forefront of the summit.''
 Some analysts said that searching for a schism between Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Putin was a fool's errand, asserting that the men governed as staunch partners and that there had been no evidence that Mr. Medvedev wanted to go his own way. (Nor is it even clear that he could.)
 Most agreed that, in the end, it did not matter whether Mr. Medvedev or Mr. Putin was in the room with Mr. Obama because both would hew to the same policies, whether on arms control, terrorism, Afghanistan, Iran or other topics.
 ''It is a bureaucratic consensus,'' said Sergey M. Rogov, director of the Institute for the U.S. and Canadian Studies in Moscow. ''There is an agreement on the Russian position on all key issues, and summits are not normally the stage for improvisation.''
 Under Russia's Constitution, the president controls foreign policy. But the reality can be different, as was illustrated by the recent collapse of Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization. 
 Mr. Medvedev, who has sought to portray himself as an economic reformer, pushed hard for Russia's entry in the group. The United States and the European Union relied on the assurances of Mr. Medvedev's aides that the bid was genuine, and the Obama administration got behind it.
 But last month, Mr. Putin abruptly announced that Russia was abandoning the effort and that it would try instead to join the trade organization in conjunction with two other former Soviet republics, Belarus and Kazakhstan. American and European officials were caught off guard, and even some of Mr. Medvedev's own aides were said to have been blindsided by Mr. Putin.
 Mr. Putin's move was interpreted as a signal that he was ultimately in charge of the most important decisions.
 ''Some Russians see it as a message from Putin to the American government, saying, 'I'm the decider and I can, at any time, make a decision to overrule anything else that's been going on in our negotiations if I'm not satisfied,' '' said Stephen Sestanovich, a longtime Russia expert and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
 ''This is something that is going to be a game that the American side will be trying to figure out, but it will not be easy to completely understand,'' Mr. Sestanovich said. ''Putin knows that given Medvedev's position, he's the guy who deals with foreign leaders. But Putin wants to find ways of reminding everybody of who's really in charge.''
 Germany has often been a bridge between Russia and the United States in recent years, and Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has determined that it has no choice but to work with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev, said Hans-Henning Schroder, a Russia expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.
 Mr. Schroder said that after eight years as president, Mr. Putin probably did not miss having to carry out all the job's formal duties. (Mr. Medvedev, in fact, just returned from a trip to Namibia and elsewhere in Africa.)
 ''Putin would mind if he were insecure, and if he did not think that he is the one really in power,'' Mr. Schroder said. ''You could say that now, one of them is making the decisions, and one of them is doing the ceremonies.''

HEADLINE: Decoding Russia: A Six-Step Plan

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
-- Barack Obama's last visit to Russia, as a senator in 2005, did not end so well. He was detained by the security services at an airport near Siberia for three hours, locked in a lounge, his passport confiscated, like a scene from a John le Carre novel.
 The Russians later called it a ''misunderstanding.''
 Those tend to happen a lot around here. 
 Now Mr. Obama is coming back, due in Moscow on Monday for his first Russian-American summit, taking his place in a long line of Americans who have tried to figure Russia out.
 The United States and Russia (or its Soviet predecessor) have circled each other warily for decades. And often enough at these meetings, the Americans have been frustrated, mumbling ''I don't get these people'' all the way home.
 The issues that Mr. Obama is tackling with the Kremlin's tandem -- Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin and President Dmitri A. Medvedev -- range from arms control to Iran's nuclear ambitions to Russian assistance for NATO troops in Afghanistan. Mr. Obama's success will depend in part on his grasp of the mentality of today's Russia. Here are how things look on this side: 
 NOT LOVE, RESPECT
 The airport incident was a classic bureaucratic brouhaha -- the Russians tried to search his official plane, the Americans protested, the Russians relented -- but it hinted at a larger theme. The Russians want respect, and resent when they are perceived as has-beens who can be pushed around, especially by Americans.
 Whether or not they puff out their chests too often, it is hard not to comprehend the roots of this impulse. The Soviet Union once dominated the world. Russians were imbued with a sense that their nation was rivaled only by the United States.
 Most Russians do not miss Communism. They love cars and cellphones and all the rest as much as anyone else, not to mention today's personal freedoms.
 But the loss of empire still aches. That is why Russia's enormous nuclear arsenal is a pillar of its identity -- not to be belittled -- and why cutting the arsenal is a sensitive topic.
 ''A country that dictated its will to the world finds itself playing secondary roles, and it's very painful to national pride,'' said Vladimir R. Medinsky, whose best-selling books seek to debunk negative stereotypes about Russia.
 ''Materially and economically, citizens of the Soviet Union and the Russian empire before that were deprived of many things,'' he said. ''But they had compensations. They felt they were residents of a great country.''
 ONLY WE CAN SAY THAT
 One consequence of this history is that Russians are highly sensitive to slights from abroad. One of the most popular news Web sites in Russia is inosmi.ru, which translates into Russian articles in the Western press about Russia.
 The site's success underscores how Russia cares more about what the United States thinks of Russia than the reverse. Even so, the Kremlin often reacts to perceived snubs by lashing back and withdrawing.
 Yelizaveta Likhacheva, a museum curator in Moscow, described views toward outsiders by citing an old Russian saying: ''Russia for me is like a wife. I can scold her as much as I find necessary, but if somebody else does it, I will smash his face.''
 Ms. Likhacheva wrote her comment on a Russian-language blog run by The New York Times, responding to a request for thoughts on what Americans do not understand about Russia. The blog was swamped with comments.
 A NORMAL LIFE
 Ask Timothy Post to describe the Russian mentality these days, and he reaches for an unexpected analogy. Think America, circa the 1950s.
 Mr. Post, an American entrepreneur and public relations executive, lives in southern Russia with his Russian wife and child. He said that he had noticed a turning inward among Russians after the traumas of recent decades.
 ''The values of Russian society and what people want for themselves are much more focused on immediate family and friends,'' he said. ''Their concerns are like in the 1950s in the United States -- improving their lives, going to work, getting a good job.''
 This inclination helps explain why most Russians are comfortable with how the Kremlin wields power. They crave stability.
 ''The hopes and aspirations of the average Russian are very different from the hopes and aspirations that the average Russia-watcher has for the average Russian,'' Mr. Post said.
 TIME OF TROUBLES
 Americans typically consider the 1990s to be a glorious time when Russians tasted freedom after freeing themselves from Communism.
 Russians cringe at that. For them, it was a decade of despair, of economic collapse and political bedlam.
 Some Russians blame the United States for not providing enough assistance to Russia when it was enfeebled. They maintain that Russia was deceived into believing American assurances that NATO would not expand into the former Soviet bloc.
 This is more than a footnote. Senior Russian officials connect this supposed betrayal to President Bill Clinton. They see Mr. Obama as surrounding himself with former Clinton associates, beginning with Hillary Rodham Clinton herself, the secretary of state.
 So while Mr. Obama has called for a ''reset'' in relations, and might be described as getting along better with the Kremlin than President George W. Bush, that bitterness lingers.
 POST-SOVIET NIMBY 
 The Soviet Union's end was more than a geopolitical breakup. It was also to some extent a familial one. Moscow was the dominant member of the household, and its dependents -- the other 14 republics -- went off on their own.
 It is perhaps not surprising, then, that Russia reacts viscerally to what it sees as incursions by the West in the region. That sentiment was at the root of Russia's war last year with Georgia, and will be the subject of heated discussion at the summit.
 Russia may be the world's largest country, but it believes that it is under siege, from the West on one side and China on the other.
 ''It is not just about imperial nostalgia, it is much, much deeper,'' said Fyodor Lukyanov, editor in chief of the journal Russia in Global Affairs. ''Russia's perception of security is closely linked to what is going on in neighboring territories.''
 A LEADER TO ADMIRE
 The world does not have a high regard for Mr. Putin, at least according to a recent survey by worldpublicopinion.org. Inside Russia is another story.
 Russian liberals argue that Mr. Putin is very popular because he has whitewashed the television news of criticism of his rule, and there seems to be some truth to that.
 Still, Russians credit him for the stability of recent years. And there is a less-appreciated aspect to his popularity: the public is relieved that he is not an embarrassment. Boris N. Yeltsin was often thought of as a buffoonish alcoholic. Many of the final Communist leaders were decrepit.
 Mr. Putin is seen as sober (a rebuttal to cliches about Russia), physically fit (a black belt in judo) and verbally adept (with a penchant for tart asides).
 A DESTINY OF ITS OWN
 Americans, from intrepid travelers in the 1800s to recent missionaries, have often come to Russia and reached a singular conclusion: Russians want to be just like us.
 In fact, most Russians don't. They envy the material comforts of the United States, and the level of anti-Americanism here is actually lower than in Western Europe. But they do not see the United States as a model.
 Prof. David S. Foglesong of Rutgers University, who wrote, ''The American Mission and the 'Evil Empire,' '' said Americans were often disappointed with Russia because they ignore the vast differences between the countries.
 ''American have had this expectation that because Russia is white and Christian and had the same kind of frontier experience that America had, it would evolve more and more into the United States,'' Mr. Foglesong said. ''The truth is that Russia is a separate country -- it is neither America's imaginary twin, nor its evil opposite.''

HEADLINE: The Alaska news? Another reflection of G.O.P. division.

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS

 BODY:
Grant the Republicans this much at least: they're no longer boring. Just when the novelty of the Argentine dalliance of Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina had begun to fade, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska enlivened a ho-hum Fourth of July with her announcement that she would abruptly terminate her first term and instead seek to ''effect positive change outside government.''
 Exactly what this might mean was not immediately clear. Some said her political career was done. Others speculated that Ms. Palin, eying the White House in 2012, plans to complete and then hawk her memoir (for which she reportedly had been seeking a seven-figure advance) and also increase her visibility along with her war chest by accepting lucrative speaking engagements -- activities not so easily managed by a chief executive marooned in Anchorage. 
 ''Some are going to question the timing of this,'' Ms. Palin acknowledged when she made her announcement on Friday, though she said ''this decision has been in the works for quite a while.'' 
 Perhaps, but to judge by the surprised reactions of top Republicans across the country, very few seemed to have been consulted or even tipped off that it was coming. 
 The announcement by the freelancing politician may be the best example yet of the striking transformation in the current Republican Party. Only a few years ago, the party was considered a model of lockstep discipline with around-the-clock message control and seamless coordination of policy and politics. But from all appearances, it has entered a period of inner confusion, verging on the dysfunctional. Some of that dysfunction was on display earlier last week, when word surfaced of a Vanity Fair profile of Ms. Palin that showed her often to be at odds, and sometimes at swords' point, with Alaska Republicans and also with party strategists when she ran on the Republican ticket with John McCain in 2008.
 How did so organized a party come apart so swiftly? One explanation is that it hasn't been swift at all. The Republicans have been in decline for some time -- and in recent years, even in disarray. Since the peak years of Republican success in the 1980s, the party's candidates have only sometimes been vote-snagging virtuosos. Dating back to 1992, Republicans have won a plurality in only one presidential election -- and that lone victory, in 2004, was not nearly the triumph it appeared to be at the time. Its architect, Karl Rove, spoke of establishing a ''permanent majority'' for the Republicans, but in reality Mr. Bush won by less than 3 percentage points -- one of the narrowest re-elections in presidential history. And although he claimed a mandate, his two big second-term initiatives -- privatizing Social Security and immigration reform -- were easily thwarted. Some of the strongest opposition came from within Mr. Bush's own party -- further evidence that the Republicans were even then losing their cohesiveness.
 Ms. Palin's emergence as a national candidate was itself the outcome of tension within the party. Mr. McCain's top choices were said to include Tom Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania and Mr. Bush's first director of homeland security, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. 
 Each was an experienced and prominent official. Each had established his strong loyalty to Mr. Bush, the party's unrivaled leader. But both were also deemed insufficiently conservative by the party's rank and file, and so were passed over. Mr. McCain's inability to assert his will in this crucial matter was a clear sign of party fractiousness. And the sudden, dramatic emergence of Governor Palin -- and the controversy that instantly greeted her candidacy -- created the impression that Republican strategists had acted without the careful planning that had characterized their previous campaigns.
 Still, Ms. Palin was a galvanizing force and continues to outdo all other Republicans in exciting the party's base. On Friday, it was even possible to see how her decision to exit the governorship could actually strengthen her populist, anti-government theme -- and place her in the tradition of previous conservative leaders who have presented themselves not merely as professional politicians but as leaders of a movement.
 It is true enough that during its period of ascendancy, the Republican Party has often depicted government as the enemy of conservative values. These were arguments advanced by presidents like Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, who helped bring the modern party into being. But both were also masters of accommodation, who built broad constituencies within the party and beyond. It was Mr. Reagan who most forcefully imposed ''the Eleventh Commandment,'' which forbade Republicans from openly criticizing others in their party.
 Even this pretense of concord now seems gone. Ms. Palin has made no secret of her displeasure with Republicans who differ with her. And in what could be interpreted as supportive remarks Friday, one of her champions last year, William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, seemed to be extending his open conflict with Republicans who were quoted in the Vanity Fair article expressing reservations about her fitness to govern. 
 At a time of prolonged anxiety and uncertainty -- which increased last week when dispiriting unemployment figures were released for June -- the G.O.P. has added unexpected spice to American politics. But they seem to have done it by forgetting the lessons they once knew so well.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 In Canarsie, Cuts
 Slice Into Basics
 At some point during the downturn, using a car service in hard-to-reach Canarsie, Brooklyn, went from necessity to luxury. 
 These days, during the evening rush at the Canarsie-Rockaway Parkway subway station, drivers at Transit Car Service wait half an hour for a fare (and often longer while newly frugal passengers haggle over the price). ''Normally, they'd be constantly moving,'' said Bob Shelly, a dispatcher.
 Farther along the neighborhood's main commercial drag, at the Canarsie Meat Market, Stefano Adragna and his co-workers are learning that meat has become a luxury too. Laid-off customers have stopped buying the oxtail, goat and pork that are neighborhood staples, and the butchers have had their hours cut. ''We've been seeing more of the credit cards from the Department of Labor,'' said Mr. Adragna, referring to the cards issued for unemployment benefits.
 Times were already tough in Canarsie and neighboring Flatlands before the worst of the recession set in: The area has seen increases in mortgage loan defaults over the last three years. Now a combination of factors -- the recession, but also a proliferation of nearby big-box stores -- are ravaging the small businesses along Canarsie's commercial corridors, according to local officials.
 Mercedes Narcisse, the president of the Avenue L Merchants Association, who has owned a medical and surgical supply company on the avenue for about 10 years, spoke recently about the neighborhood's straits. 
 Q. How is the downturn affecting your business?
 A. Families used to be able to buy things not covered by insurance -- a walker or a wheelchair -- with a credit card. Now people cannot afford them, even if you give them discounts. Reimbursements from Medicaid and H.M.O.s have decreased. Let's say they used to give you $80. Now, if you're lucky, you get $65. And because of budget cuts, some things -- say, a handheld shower -- aren't covered.
 Q. What about the other stores on the avenue?
 A. I'm talking to them all the time. The cleaning store next to me closed. Another store, a 99 cent store, opened in its place, and that's closed. A jewelry store that was here for years relocated. The barbershop on 94th Street hardly sees people come in. People in the community don't have money to buy things.
 Q. How do the struggles of the business owners affect the neighborhood?
 A. As a resident for over 20-something years, it's depressing when stores close. There's the rhetoric: We're always saying that small businesses are the backbone of the community, but we don't have investment here. When you don't have businesses hiring local people, it's a burden on the city. We need people to care. KAREEM FAHIM

HEADLINE: Former Artistic Director Is Now a Freelancer

BYLINE: Compiled by RACHEL LEE HARRIS

 BODY:
First, the artistic director of Skylight Opera Theater in Milwaukee was laid off; now he is going to return to the theater as a freelance director, Playbill.com reported. In June the theater, whose productions include Broadway-style shows and operas, eliminated the artistic director, Bill Theisen, and assigned most of his duties to the managing director, Eric Dillner, who with the Skylight board had made the decision to eliminate Mr. Theisen's position. The decision, which was attributed to financial difficulties stemming from the economic downturn, drew protests from Skylight colleagues and others. But last week Mr. Theisen said he would return to work on four productions during the 2009-10 season, including ''The Barber of Seville'' and ''The Marriage of Figaro.'' Mr. Theisen told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he did not feel ''celebratory'' about the company but that ''I will try to stay neutral and do the job at hand.''

HEADLINE: Volatile Swings For Price of Oil Hobble Industry

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
 The extreme volatility that has gripped oil markets for the last 18 months has shown no signs of slowing down, with oil prices more than doubling since the beginning of the year despite an exceptionally weak economy.
The instability of oil and gas prices is puzzling government officials and policy analysts, who fear it could jeopardize a global recovery. It is also hobbling businesses and consumers, who are already facing the effects of a stinging recession, as they try in vain to guess where prices will be a year from now -- or even next month.
 A wild run on the oil markets has occurred in the last 12 months. Last summer, prices surged to a record high above $145 a barrel, driving up gasoline prices to well over $4 a gallon. As the global economy faltered, oil tumbled to $33 a barrel in December. But oil has risen 55 percent since the beginning of the year, to $70 a barrel, pushing gas prices up again to $2.60 a gallon, according to AAA, the automobile club. 
 ''To call this extreme volatility might be an understatement,'' said Laura Wright, the chief financial officer at Southwest Airlines, a company that has sought to insure itself against volatile prices by buying long-term oil contracts. ''Over the past 15 to 18 months, this has been unprecedented. I don't think it can be easily rationalized.''
 Volatility in the oil markets in the last year has reached levels not recorded since the energy shocks of the late 1970s and early 1980s, according to Costanza Jacazio, an energy analyst at Barclays Capital in New York. 
 At the close of last week's trading, oil futures fell $2.58, to $66.73 a barrel, after rising above $72 a barrel last month.
 These gyrations have rippled across the economy. The automakers General Motors and Chrysler have been forced into bankruptcy as customers shun their gas guzzlers. Airlines are on pace for another year of deep losses because of rising jet fuel costs. 
 And households, already crimped by falling home prices, mounting job losses and credit pressures, are once more forced to monitor their discretionary spending as energy prices rise. 
 While the movements in the oil markets have been similar to swings in most asset classes, including stocks and other commodities, the recent rise in oil prices is reprising the debate from last year over the role of investors -- or speculators -- in the commodity markets. 
 Government officials around the world have become concerned about a possible replay of last year's surge. Energy officials from the European Union and OPEC, meeting in Vienna last month, said that ''the speculation issue had not been resolved yet and that the 2008 bubble could be repeated'' without more oversight. 
 Many factors that pushed oil prices up last year have returned. Supply fears are creeping back into the market, with a new round of violence in Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta crimping production. And there are increasing fears that the political instability in Iran could spill over onto the oil market, potentially hampering the country's exports.
 The OPEC cartel has also been remarkably successful in reining in production in recent months to keep prices from falling. Even as prices recovered, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been unwilling to open their taps. 
 Top officials said that OPEC's goal was to achieve $75 a barrel oil by the end of the year, a target that has been endorsed by Saudi Arabia, the group's kingpin.
 ''Neither the organization, nor its key members, has any real interest in halting the rise in oil prices,'' said a report by the Center for Global Energy Studies, a consulting group in London founded by Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, a former Saudi oil minister. 
 But unlike most of 2007, when the economy was still not in recession and demand for commodities was strong, the world today is mired in its worst slump in over half a century. The World Bank warned the recession would be deeper than previously thought and said any recovery next year would be subdued. 
 The International Energy Agency held out the prospect that energy demand was unlikely to recover before 2014. Yet the indicators that would traditionally signal lower prices -- like high oil inventories or OPEC's large spare production capacity -- do not seem to hold much weight today, analysts said. 
 ''Crude oil prices appear to have been divorced from the underlying fundamentals of weak demand, ample supply and high inventories,'' Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent report. 
 Investors are betting that the worst of the economic slump may be coming to an end, and are bidding up what they perceive will become scare resources once demand kicks back again, analysts said. This uncertainty is making it difficult for companies to plan ahead, they said. 
 ''People do not like that kind of volatility, they want to know what their costs are going to be,'' said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group.
 For the global airline industry, the latest price surge is certain to translate into more losses this year, according to the industry's trade group, I.A.T.A. Airlines are expected to post losses of $9 billion this year, following last year's losses of $10.4 billion. ''Airlines have not yet felt the full impact of this oil price rise,'' according to I.A.T.A.'s latest report.
 At Southwest Airlines, for example, fuel accounts for about a third of the company's costs, according to Ms. Wright, the chief financial officer. The experience of the past year, she said, ''has convinced us we cannot afford to not be hedged.'' 
 The company has currently hedged part of its fuel use for the second half of the year at $71 a barrel, and for 2010 at $77 a barrel. Hedging acts as an insurance policy if prices rise above these levels. 
 But last year, Southwest reported two consecutive quarters of losses, as prices spiked and collapsed -- all within a few months. ''Prices were falling faster than we could de-hedge,'' Ms. Wright said.
 To survive the slump, many airlines have cut routes and raised both fares and fees, like charging for luggage, while some of the industry's top players have merged. For example, Delta Air Lines bought Northwest Airlines last year, and in Europe, Lufthansa of Germany bought Austrian Airlines and Air France-KLM acquired Alitalia of Italy. 
 Likewise, automobile showrooms emptied out as gasoline prices rose, forcing General Motors and Chrysler to cut production sharply as they wade through bankruptcy. Meanwhile, they are under pressure from Washington to improve their fuel ratings.
 ''Do not believe for an instant that sport utilities are making a comeback,'' George Pipas, Ford's chief sales analyst, told reporters last week.
 But to Jeroen van der Veer, who retired as chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell last week, prices are increasingly dictated by long-term assessments of supply and demand, rather than current market fundamentals. He advised taking a long-term view of the market. 
 ''Oil has never been very stable,'' Mr. van der Veer said. ''If you look at history, you have to expect more volatility.''

HEADLINE: Homeless, and on a College Path to Independence

BYLINE: By AMANDA M. FAIRBANKS

 BODY:
For many college students, survival means keeping up on assigned reading, maintaining an acceptable grade-point average and squeezing in extracurricular activities. 
 But for those at Advantage Academy, a program offered by the city's Department of Homeless Services and St. John's University to provide homeless and formerly homeless people with the chance to earn an associate's degree, survival looks like something altogether different. 
 Besides sustaining the level of commitment that college requires, these students have the additional worries of a homeless single parent -- trying to make ends meet. 
 For Fallon Coffer, 22, who is homeless, reality is going to class during the day, working as a taxi dispatcher at night, caring for her child and worrying about the roof over their heads.
 ''After class, I go home to my shelter, change my clothes, do some homework, drop off my son at my mom's house and go back to work,'' said Ms. Coffer, who had bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep and sat in the front row during the second week of class, occasionally nodding off and eyeing a classmate's can of Red Bull. 
 Starting last month, Advantage Academy, which uses available classrooms at St. John's, enrolled 42 students in its two-year inaugural class. Nearly all are single mothers and the average age is 27.
 Nationwide, it is the first time that a city agency and a university have joined forces with the aim of granting degrees. 
 A similar program, operated by Bard College, provides college-level courses for up to six credits to the economically disadvantaged in about 20 programs around the country. That program, however, is neither a degree-granting program nor is it specifically for homeless people.
 The Advantage Academy program, which aims to break the cycle of poverty and homelessness through higher education, is not without its challenges. The most pressing is transitioning each member of the inaugural class out of the shelter system and into permanent housing.
 But Timothy Marx, executive director of Common Ground, a New York-based nonprofit group that works to prevent homelessness, sees it as the next phase in solving homelessness.
 ''When people are living in a shelter and they don't have permanent housing, they begin to lose confidence in themselves,'' Mr. Marx said. ''Knowing they can go to college and compete in this economy really provides hope.''
 For the students selected to attend Advantage Academy at St. John's Manhattan campus, which was used by the Red Cross as a respite center during 9/11 recovery efforts, two degrees -- one in information technology, the other in business -- are being offered as a path toward self-sufficiency. According to the United States Census Bureau, in New York City, the average income of a household with some college coursework or an associate's degree is about $35,000 -- nearly $10,000 more than households without such a degree.
 For Patrick Markee, a senior policy analyst at the Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit advocacy group, at issue is the increased access to higher education for far too few. 
 ''It's good news to hear those 42 folks will get the chance to go to college, but it needs to be understood in the broader context, that there are more than 36,000 homeless New Yorkers and that last year 110,000 homeless children and adults spent time in the city's shelter system,'' Mr. Markee said.
 Despite the program's limited scope, Dennis P. Culhane, a professor of social policy at the University of Pennsylvania, viewed such a partnership as invaluable.
 ''For a whole number of reasons, college has not always been accessible to people who are homeless,'' Professor Culhane said, adding that access to a university's alumni network can be a gateway into the work force. ''Even if it's only for a relatively small group of people,'' he said, ''it's a group of people who wouldn't otherwise be getting in there.''
 Entrance to the program required either a high school diploma or a G.E.D. Anna Chuhrach, 19, was among the few women in her shelter to qualify. While half of the inaugural class still lives in the shelter system, the aim is that all students will have secured apartments by later this summer. 
 In addition to housing, Advantage Academy students will receive transportation and child care, courtesy of the Department of Homeless Services. St. John's will take care of educational expenses not covered by New York's Tuition Assistance Program or federal Pell Grants. 
 The relationship between St. John's and the Department of Homeless Services began nearly a decade ago, when the university began sponsoring attendance at academic and athletic summer camp at its Queens campus for children living in shelters. Late last year, Robert V. Hess, the commissioner of homeless services, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg envisioned an academy for helping families, who tend to stay homeless for nearly twice as long as single adults. 
 James P. Pellow, executive vice president and chief operating officer of St. John's, accepted the challenge in relatively short order. The university will provide grants of more than $40,000 per student. 
 ''In two years, these single parents will go from living in shelters to becoming educated, employed, housed families,'' said Mr. Pellow, who is seeking the partnership of other organizations and universities, depending on the success of Advantage Academy's first class.
 In the meantime, sporadic attendance is already an issue as basic needs are still being met. In June, when Ms. Chuhrach was confronted with a day care conflict, she had to either bring her son, Richard, 4, to class or skip it. He passed the time in class by making paper airplanes while his infant sister stayed with a friend.
 Jana Rhoden, 31, a student who has moved between three shelters in as many years, said the perception of the homeless is often a negative stereotype. ''When you live in the shelter system, there's dirt on you that won't wash off; you're a statistic; you don't have any ambition or drive,'' said Ms. Rhoden, who lives in a shelter in Brooklyn with her two children.
 For students like her, the associate's degree is just an entry point.
 ''I want my bachelor's and my master's,'' she said, ''and after that, I want to reach out to other women who couldn't make it and give them hope.''

HEADLINE: Despite Turmoil in the Chip Industry, Signs of Hope for Micron Technology

BYLINE: By BROOKE CROTHERS

 BODY:
The memory chip business has destroyed many companies with its vicious price wars. But Micron Technology, a veteran of previous battles, is hunkered down, betting that major cost-cutting and a new high-speed chip will help it survive this bloodbath. 
 A couple of weeks ago, Micron recorded its 10th consecutive quarterly loss. In the last two and a half years, the company's net losses have totaled about $3.8 billion. It has announced plans to lay off 20 percent of its work force and has closed a plant in Boise, Idaho, where it is based. 
 Yet Micron executives are surprisingly optimistic. Cash flow is improving. Rivals are shutting factories. Microsoft, whose Windows software runs most of the world's personal computers, is about to release a major upgrade, which should prompt many PC users to buy new machines that will be equipped with better memory chips made by Micron and others. 
 Perhaps most important, Micron has been cutting its production costs, betting that increased financial efficiency will help it survive any further shakeout along with the market leader, Samsung Electronics. 
 ''It's them and Samsung that have the lowest cost to produce, and they're actually the only two companies generating cash right now on an operating basis,'' said John Pitzer, a securities analyst with Credit Suisse.
 Micron executives declined an interview request. But on a June 25 conference call discussing third-quarter results with investors, Mark W. Adams, vice president for worldwide sales, said, ''We remain hopeful that almost two years of capital expenditure cutbacks and reduction of supply in the industry will improve the profit potential for Micron. We feel Q3 was a good step in that direction.''
 The seeds of the industry's current financial straits were sown in 2006 and 2007, when memory makers went on a capital spending binge to expand capacity, said Jim Handy, director of Objective Analysis, a chip industry research firm. ''It takes two years from the spending before capacity reaches full volume production, so the onset of the current overcapacity was in early 2008, two years after the 2006 spending spree commenced.''
 Now, falling prices are causing major upheaval. Hynix Semiconductor, the second-largest memory chip maker, is posting even bigger losses than Micron, which is No. 3. Some Taiwanese chip makers are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. And Qimonda, a German chip maker, recently filed for bankruptcy protection.
 ''Qimonda is factually liquidated. Therefore, there is no return of that,'' said Micron's chief executive, Steven R. Appleton, on the June conference call. (Last year, Micron bought one of Qimonda's prize assets, a 35.6 percent stake in Inotera Memories of Taiwan, for $400 million.)
 As a result of the upheaval, the industry's capacity has shrunk about one-third, although some of that will eventually return, Mr. Appleton predicted.
 Demand for memory chips, however, should improve as the recession eases and corporations upgrade their PCs to the coming Windows 7 software from Microsoft, Mr. Pitzer said. ''Over the last nine months, since the economy went into a recession, I.T. spending on new equipment has gone to virtually zero,'' he said. ''The installed base of PCs needs to be upgraded.'' 
 Samsung is the primary supplier of DDR3 DRAM, used in the fastest PCs, but Micron is trying to expand its share of that market.
 Micron's flash memory operations, which make up about one-third of the company's business, face bigger challenges. As part of a revamping announced in October, Micron said it would discontinue at one plant, its Boise facility, the production of NAND flash memory, used to store data in digital cameras, portable media players and expensive cellphones, which was part of a joint venture between Micron and Intel. The companies had hoped fast, compact flash drives would become popular in netbooks and other laptops, but cheaper and bigger hard drives prevailed.
 Flash memory has failed to gain much ground in netbooks or PCs. Smartphones, like the iPhone from Apple, are a potentially larger market for flash, but Samsung has a lock on the iPhone contract at the moment.
 Micron also has its sights set on the market for LCD screens. The company recently introduced a new microdisplay panel, using technology it acquired from Displaytech. 
 But Micron does not think displays, or any other side business, will drive future growth. Its future still rests squarely in the memory chip market. 
 And Samsung is a formidable competitor. ''They're the best-financed company,'' Avi Cohen, managing partner at Avian Securities, said. ''They have the lowest cost basis of anyone currently. And everyone's finding it really difficult to compete with them.''
 Another worry for Micron is that governments will prolong the bust part of the natural boom-bust cycle by propping up failed companies, Mr. Cohen said. 
 The Japanese government said on Tuesday that it would offer a $1.7 billion bailout package to Elpida Memory, a chip maker. And Taiwan's government has made aid overtures to its top three memory chip makers: Powerchip, Nanya Technology and ProMOS. 
 ''This is a horrible, terrible business that no one should be in, the way it's organized currently,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''You get some incremental profits for a little while, then everybody moves in and there's oversupply again.''

HEADLINE: Under Gavel, Where Loss Transforms Into Gain

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
Bid, Bid, BID, the auctioneer implores, serenading the curious and meek with the trills and yammers of his trade. Nearly 20 foreclosed properties are up for auction here in the great state of Utah, ladies and gentlemen, and now is your chance to turn an empty house back into a home.
 Dozens of potential bidders sit before him in various states of intimidation, clutching bidding cards as thin as paper and heavy as brick. A few of them scribble out notes like racetrack rookies posturing as touts, calculating the odds of some dark-horse deal.
 Whenever a bidder manages to lift a card, or nod, or wave, an auction assistant prowling the aisles gives praise -- ''Yes!'' He wears a tuxedo, as if to bestow class upon an indelicate process in which one's gain comes from another's loss. 
 ''Yes!'' the assistant yelps again and again, making the Grand Ballroom of a Hilton hotel somehow less so. He challenges bidders in the throes of uncertainty with the cock of an eyebrow and the jut of a finger, as if to ask, Is there something wrong? Are you crazy? Don't you want to own your dream home?
 ''Yes! Yes! Yes!''
 If it's Tuesday, then this must be Salt Lake City for a California company called the Real Estate Disposition Corporation; R.E.D.C., for short. Its employees barnstorm the country like a carnival troupe, staging auctions for banks and other lenders eager to reduce their groaning inventories of failure.
 Since May 2007, the company has held more than 400 events, putting up for auction more than 50,000 houses and condominiums that fell into foreclosure during these singular times. But beware, you buyers with checkbooks in trembling hand. Each property has a minimum sales price unknown to bidders; if the auction doesn't hit that number, the lender can reject the sale.
 Yesterday was Colorado, tomorrow will be Michigan, but tonight is Utah, where an R.E.D.C. representative begins the auction by commending those in the audience for being ''part of the solution to the current economic crisis.''
 And now the auctioneer is singing his way down the brick-and-mortar list, sharing little more than the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in each structure. 
 So a modest $215,000 condo in Heber City (once owned by an electrician, said to have been a good father, dead of lung cancer at 38) is sold at $110,000. And a tired $139,100 condo in Orem (where a man sexually assaulted a woman one night, then lost his government job after being convicted) is sold at $95,000. And a hilltop mansion in Draper (where a man who calls himself a ''preservation mechanic'' mows the lawn and makes the creepy, cavernous place look both neat and lived in) is overvalued at $3 million and sold at $605,000. 
 Halfway through the night, the auctioneer comes to Item No. 1104: an eight-bedroom house in South Jordan. The bidding quickly hits 250, as in $250,000, then rises to 255, 260, 265, 270, while the auctioneer pleads and the assistant kneels before a potential bidder, as if proposing.
 ''I'm at 270!'' the auctioneer calls. ''Don't lose it! Don't lose it!''
 But before another hand rises to bid, and before the auctioneer's gavel slams down in confirmation of deal closed, next deal, it might be instructive to visit this vacated house in South Jordan, on West Rambouillet Drive. A man named Paul Furse, who knows this house's every inch, stands at its locked door and begins to tell its story.
 Years ago a developer bought an old sheep ranch and carved it into lots for sale. In the spring of 2002, Mr. Furse bought a third-acre parcel on a corner for $68,000. Then he set out to build a house by hand, although not alone; he had the assistance of his wife, Teri, and their four children, the oldest just 15. 
 Mr. Furse was 40, blond, sturdy, and nothing if not determined. He had never built a house before, but he had been in and around construction most of his life, remodeling rooms, jobs like that. ''I got a bee in my bonnet and just wanted to build a house,'' he says.
 The family, living then in a small house in a nearby town, assisted the architect by sketching out what they wanted: the bedrooms, the second-story catwalk, the office, the crafts room, the sprawling family area with a wood stove. A construction loan was secured, the foundation was laid -- and just like that, the Furse Family Construction Company began to build. 
 The whole endeavor sounds improbable, but the family filmed the seven-month construction. Here is Kelsi, 15, using a pneumatic nail gun to assemble a wall; Kira, 13, holding steady a beam that will help to support the second story; Haylie, 10, nails in her mouth, applying shingles to the roof; Dean, 7, handing his father some wood, playing with a toy truck.
 They listened to FM radio, broke for sandwiches at lunch, scraped knees, played on a makeshift swing, drenched themselves in water to keep cool, tried to keep up with schoolwork. Kelsi and Kira sometimes used carpenter's pencils to do their math-assignment calculations on the unfinished walls and floors.
 Most of all, everyone just worked, sun-up, sun-down, six days a week. And when they were done, the Furses had built a home in time for Thanksgiving.
 Peering now into the locked house, his head beside a ''Warning -- No Trespassing'' sign, Mr. Furse recalls it all. The wedding portrait on display in the master bedroom. The color schemes chosen by each child for their bedrooms: Dean, a bright green; Haylie, a sky blue; Kelsi, a tan with a rag-rolled look; and Kira, a crazy, Pollock-like spattering of blue, green and purple. The window view of a Mormon church's gleaming white steeple, set against the backdrop of the Wasatch Mountains.
 It is difficult to say when the house that had become a home became just a house again. Mr. Furse used the property as security to finance a couple of business deals that foundered -- mostly, he says, because of betrayals by partners. The money wasn't coming in, the tension built, and everyone sensed this wondrous family accomplishment turning into a burden. 
 ''I could feel it slipping,'' Kelsi recalls.
 Foreclosure proceedings came in 2006, followed by a bankruptcy filing to buy some time, and then, finally, a strangely welcoming release. Mr. Furse likens the experience to the last lingering days of a sick, older relative. ''You hate to see them go,'' he says. ''But what a relief.''
 Today the family is renting a much more modest house a few miles away -- it has no view to speak of -- while Kelsi, now a married mother of a toddler, lives nearby. Not long ago she drove past the house she helped to build, only to find it, she says, ''remarkably alien.'' A home, she has decided, is where your family is.
 Mr. Furse agrees. He says that even though he lost the house, the building of it bonded his family in ways beyond words. Still, he admits, ''I'd have been happy if they'd have buried me in the backyard.''
 Bam! The auctioneer's gavel pounds home the deal for the winning bidders, who say they're looking to invest in real estate. Sold, subject to seller's approval, for $275,000: a house in which the calculations of children are in the woodwork.

HEADLINE: Health Care's Infectious Losses

BYLINE: By PAUL O'NEILL. 
Paul O'Neill was the secretary of the Treasury from 2001 to 2002.

DATELINE: Pittsburgh 

 BODY:
 HEALTH care reform seems to be on the way, whether we want it or not. So I have been asking questions about the various proposals. Here is a sampling. 
 Which of the reform proposals will eliminate the millions of infections acquired at hospitals every year? 
 Which of the proposals will eliminate the annual toll of 300 million medication errors? 
 Which of the proposals will eliminate pneumonia caused by ventilators? 
 Which of the proposals will eliminate falls that injure hospital patients? 
 Which of the proposals will capture even a fraction of the roughly $1 trillion of annual ''waste'' that is associated with the kinds of process failures that these questions imply? 
 So far, the answer to each question is ''none.''
 Let's consider that $1 trillion of waste. If we could capture all of it, the savings over 10 years would be five times what President Obama has said he will extract from insurance companies over the same period. The president's vision of bringing down health care inflation by 1.5 percent a year over the next decade would not be a victory, but a capitulation to the enormous waste in the delivery of medical care. 
 The president says he likes audacious goals. Here is one: ask medical providers to eliminate all hospital-acquired infections within two years. This is hardly pie in the sky: doctors and administrators already know how to do it. It requires scrupulous adherence to simple but profoundly important practices like hand-washing, proper preparation of surgical sites and assiduous care and maintenance of central lines and urinary catheters. With these small steps, we would no longer have the suffering and death associated with infections acquired in hospitals and we would save tens of billions of dollars every year -- money we should have in hand before new health-care entitlements are enacted. 
 What policymakers tend to forget is that only the people who do the work can make this happen. Legislation can't do it, regulation can't do it, infection-control committees can't do it, financial incentives and disincentives can't do it. But excellence is possible, and it has been demonstrated. 
 Where it works, the common denominators are strong leadership and a committed work force. Among those doctors showing the way are Brent James at Intermountain Health in Utah, Gary Kaplan at Virginia Mason Clinic in Seattle and Richard Shannon at the University of Pennsylvania, who have helped bring infection rates down drastically at their own hospitals and at others. 
 Hospitals and medical schools have great impetus to increase the ranks of such doctors: these improvements in patient care don't cost money, they save money. And they represent only the tip of the iceberg in opportunities for improving outcomes and reducing costs at the same time. 
 A next step would be for the government to finance a prompt, detailed and hard-headed study of every example of error, infection and other waste in five major medical centers. Such data would give policymakers and caregivers a clearer picture of the possibilities for cost-saving improvements.
 It would also help if reporters and pundits became more informed about the opportunities for improvement, so they could help educate the public and improve the level of the reform debates. As for members of Congress, perhaps it would help them to understand the problem if we assembled the data, by House district, on hospital-acquired infections, medication errors and other waste indicators. They are more likely to push for the right sort of change when they realize that people they know and represent are being hurt or killed by practices we know how to stop.
 In the end, any health care reform that does not address the pervasive waste and the associated burden of needless suffering for patients and staff alike will give us little to celebrate.

PERSON: Hilda L. Solis 

HEADLINE: As Labor Secretary, Finding Influence in Her Past

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Hilda L. Solis often recalls some advice her high school guidance counselor gave her mother: ''Your daughter is not college material. Maybe she should follow the career of her older sister and become a secretary.''
 Telling that story recently at the Hunter College commencement in Manhattan, Ms. Solis roared into the microphone that she, the daughter of immigrants, did become a secretary -- the nation's labor secretary. The crowd thundered with applause.
After surmounting many obstacles, Ms. Solis, a former four-term congresswoman, has become the first Hispanic woman to serve as a cabinet member. The third of seven children, she grew up in a modest home near a giant landfill just east of Los Angeles. Her mother worked in a toy factory, her father in a battery recycling plant, where he contracted lead poisoning.
 Like President Obama and Judge Sonia Sotomayor, whose confirmation to the Supreme Court would make her the first Hispanic justice, Ms. Solis, 51, pulled herself up through her own drive and intelligence. Now, she is hoping to use those qualities to reinvigorate the Labor Department, which she said became a neglected, atrophied, often pro-business backwater under President George W. Bush. 
 She has promised a vigorous campaign to combat workplace violations, after government auditors found that the Bush Labor Department sometimes did not follow up on complaints of minimum wage, overtime and child labor violations. She said she planned to hire 250 more investigators and conduct a nationwide outreach program so that workers knew their rights and employers knew their obligations. 
 ''There are so many people I knew when I was growing up who were not even paid the minimum wage,'' Ms. Solis said. ''People wouldn't know where to go to lodge a complaint. And if you didn't speak good English, forget it.''
 Her goal of restoring morale and efficiency to the 17,000-employee department would not be easy, she said, partly because so many dedicated people had quit in recent years. When she spoke at a church in Miami in March, she pledged to increase workplace enforcement and used a much-applauded line: ''There's a new sheriff in town.'' The next day, John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., gave her a plastic badge that read ''sheriff.''
 But such enthusiastic support is far from universal, particularly among Republicans.
 ''She is anti-business and extremely pro-labor,'' said Ray Haynes, a Republican former state senator in California who often clashed with Ms. Solis when she was a lawmaker in Sacramento. ''From my experience with Hilda, she has always been doctrinaire. Hilda does not hear the other side of the story.''
 Ms. Solis said she planned to make the Labor Department a major player in fixing the pension system and creating green jobs. And with unemployment climbing above 14.5 million, she has vowed to strengthen job-training programs. 
 When Mr. Obama offered her a cabinet post, she recalled, ''he said if I wanted to work for him, you're going to be the voice for working families and organized labor.'' 
 For her that seems to run in the family. At the dinner table, she said, her father, an immigrant from Mexico, used to hold forth about factory conditions and how he, a Teamster shop steward, pushed to improve them. 
 ''My father spoke to management and fought for the workers' health and safety,'' she said. ''That is something I bring to the Department of Labor. Those values my father shared with me.'' 
 Her mother, an immigrant from Nicaragua who often stood 10 hours a day at the toy factory, was so outspoken about working conditions that she would have been fired if the union had not protected her, Ms. Solis said. 
 Following her parents' example, Ms. Solis has become a fighter -- for immigrants, workers, minorities and women. ''I've always been about seeking social justice and combating discrimination and racism,'' she said. ''I always wanted to stand up and fight for the underdog.'' 
 Labor leaders said they hoped Ms. Solis would push to enact their No. 1 objective, legislation that would make it easier to unionize. At the time she was nominated to be labor secretary, Ms. Solis was the only member of Congress serving on the board of a pro-union group, American Rights at Work, a move that some supporters said caused Republicans to delay her confirmation.
 With the Obama administration focused on fighting the recession and overhauling the health care system, she, like the president, has at least for now left it to Democratic senators to try to muster the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster on the unionization bill. 
 Ms. Solis majored in political science at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, and then obtained a master's degree in public administration at the University of Southern California. While in graduate school, she interned at the White House under Jimmy Carter and soon landed a job with the Office of Management and Budget.
 Returning to California, she was hired to run a state program that helped poor students in the San Gabriel Valley go to college. Friends urged her to run for office, and at age 28, she was elected to the board of Rio Hondo Community College. 
 In 1992, she won a seat in the California State Assembly and two years later she was elected to the State Senate, becoming California's first Latina state senator.
 Remembering her malodorous hometown, La Puente, where there is a federal Superfund site and eight landfills, she sponsored a landmark environmental bill, which required the State Environmental Protection Agency to adopt regulations ensuring fair treatment of people of all races and incomes with respect to environmental laws. 
 Impressed by the legislation, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded her the Profile in Courage Award in 2000; she was the first woman to win it.
 ''This legislation was groundbreaking,'' Caroline Kennedy said in a telephone interview. ''The bill didn't succeed the first time, but she came back and worked with the business community, compromised, and ultimately succeeded.''
 That same year, Ms. Solis challenged a nine-term congressman, Matthew Martinez, in the Democratic primary, angering many Hispanic leaders. Even though Mr. Martinez had a generally liberal voting record, she accused him of being out of touch with his constituency. 
 Unhappy about Mr. Martinez's free-trade voting record, the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor endorsed her, with its president calling her a ''warrior for working families.'' She won the primary 62 percent to 29 percent and ran unopposed that November.
 One of her mentors, Dolores Huerta, a founder of the United Farm Workers, said she was mystified by one thing about Ms. Solis. ''I often went to Washington, and I always wondered why Hilda never said, 'Stay at my place,' '' Ms. Huerta said. ''One night we had dinner, and she had to stop at her apartment to pick up something. Her apartment was tiny. There was barely enough room for a bed. I thought, 'This is how a nun lives.' ''
 Ms. Solis is married; her husband, Sam Sayyad, runs an auto repair business outside Los Angeles.
 At the Hunter commencement, Ms. Solis concluded by returning to her own story.
 ''People always say that women, people of color, Latinas, they're not ready to go to college, they're not ready to be in those big positions,'' she said. ''There are probably a dozen of you in this hall who are future Sonia Sotomayors, and there are probably two dozen future Hilda Solises. You have to have the ganas -- the desire -- to do it.''

HEADLINE: Clean Coal, and the Alternatives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Gregg Easterbrook extols cleaner coal through the ''integrated gasification combined cycle'' process (''The Dirty War Against Clean Coal,'' Op-Ed, June 29). The process, he claims, would reduce greenhouse emissions by two-thirds if used along with carbon sequestration. That's still a lot of CO2.
 More important, the discussion overlooks the damage that coal mining wreaks. Landscapes and habitats disappear, streams are destroyed, miners die and the industry continues unfettered. Make no mistake: from devastating extraction through wasteful combustion, even ''clean'' coal is dirty business. 
 Fred Kepler Portland, Ore., June 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Gregg Easterbrook clearly points out that ''the best'' often becomes the enemy of ''the good.'' The quest for the best in so-called progressive energy policy has also sidelined other potential solutions to energy problems in the United States.
 Wind and solar ''solutions'' have been pie in the sky since the 1960s. Both are boutique solutions, as they require several hundred acres of footprint on the American landscape to provide even a fraction of the energy that even the smallest nuclear power plant (the Toshiba 4S) has been poised to deliver since 2007.
 Unfortunately, since the Carter administration, nuclear power has been the third rail of energy policy in the United States, leaving it to nearly every other developed and developing country to expand cheap and efficient power generation for its people. Any United States energy policy for the next 50 to 100 years needs to include a strong dose of nuclear energy. Anything else is simply window dressing.
 Loel Larzelere Phoenix, June 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The FutureGen Alliance, a nonprofit partnership that leverages the best assets of government and industry, takes issue with several statements in Gregg Easterbrook's article. 
 The Department of Energy did not decide the FutureGen project should be put in Illinois, as stated. Rather, the FutureGen Alliance selected Illinois after a peer-reviewed, competitive and apolitical process based on scientific and economic factors. 
 Mr. Easterbrook suggests that carbon capture and sequestration would not work with conventional pulverized coal power plants, implying that this is FutureGen's intent. FutureGen is unique because it will use integrated gasification combined cycle technology with carbon capture and sequestration. 
 Mr. Easterbook's concluding options -- do nothing and wait for FutureGen or start building improved coal power plants -- obfuscate the best choice: Move forward with FutureGen, which is five years ahead of any other such project.
 Michael J. Mudd Chief Executive, FutureGen Alliance Washington, July 1, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Gregg Easterbrook provides a useful and interesting perspective on coal gasification technology and how it can be used to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions from a coal-fired power plant.
 Coal gasification is more than just an interesting idea that needs further study and more pilot plants. The Dakota Gasification Company plant has been in operation for a quarter-century and is clean and profitable, providing evidence that this technology works. What are we waiting for?
 Roger F. Hoyt San Jose, Calif., June 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Gregg Easterbrook knocks down the straw man of zero-emissions coal-fired power plants to prop up arguments for more federal endorsement of old, dirty, dangerous technology. 
 He is mistaken when he says that new energy needs cannot be met with clean energy sources alone. We must stand with our forward-thinking president on this, and meet our new energy needs by commanding the technologies of the future. 
 Instead of perpetuating coal, let us instead become again that country that, when put to the test, put a man on the moon.
 Wind and solar power can meet our new energy needs through technology available today. All we need is the political will to harness it. Naysayers like Mr. Easterbrook only tie us to the failures of the past.
 Isaac Bloom Minneapolis, June 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Gregg Easterbrook's plea for improving the way we burn coal may be falling on deaf ears. Perhaps the public, misled by the coal industry itself, may have swallowed the confusing message from the industry's huge P.R. campaign that ''clean coal'' is already here.
 The ''dirty war'' is not about whether emissions from existing coal combustion can be reduced (they should), it is about how public money should be spent. In the marketplace, the cheapest and cleanest forms of new energy production are decidedly not ''clean coal.''
 While ''coal use is a future certainty,'' as Mr. Easterbrook argues, its use will be constricted as renewable alternatives to fossil fuels displace it.

HEADLINE: Job Retraining May Fall Short Of High Hopes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: CLINTON TOWNSHIP, Mich. 

 BODY:
For the second time in three years, Mike Hutchins, a laid-off automotive engineer, is preparing to enroll in job retraining at a local community college, this time to become a civil engineering technician. But he has no idea if he has chosen the right path. 
 ''I'm fumbling around in the dark,'' said Mr. Hutchins, 58. 
 The industry where Mr. Hutchins worked for 25 years has shriveled. The courses in computer-aided design that he finished last year in his initial effort at retraining failed to lead to employment. ''I'm looking for a job that will give me some type of a future,'' he said.
 Tens of thousands of laid-off workers like Mr. Hutchins have turned to retraining as a lifeline. Yet for all the popularity of these government-financed programs, there are questions about whether they actually work, even as President Obama's stimulus plan directs $1.4 billion more to retraining and other services for people who have lost their jobs.
 In Michigan, where the unemployment rate in May was 14.1 percent, the nation's highest, 78,000 people are enrolled in the state's No Worker Left Behind program and 7,800 are on the waiting list. At the Michigan Works job center here, where Mr. Hutchins applied for retraining money, the wait to attend an orientation session is up to two months. 
 Nonetheless, a little-noticed study the Labor Department released several months ago found that the benefits of the biggest federal job training program were ''small or nonexistent'' for laid-off workers. It showed little difference in earnings and the chances of being rehired between laid-off people who had been retrained and those who had not. 
 In interviews, the authors of the study and other economists cited several reasons that retraining might not be effective. Many workers who have lost their jobs are older and had spent their lives working in one industry. In need of a job right away, many pick relatively short training programs, which often have marginal benefits. Job retraining is also ineffective without job creation, a point made by several economists who have long cautioned against placing too much stock in it. Finally, workers trying to pick a new field cannot predict the future of the labor market, especially in a time of economic upheaval. 
 ''I can't tell you with any degree of certainty, and I've been doing it for 20 years, what the hot jobs are going to be,'' said one of the authors, Kenneth R. Troske, an economics professor at the University of Kentucky.
 An examination by The New York Times of one group of laid-off workers -- 36 people who finished their retraining at Macomb Community College just outside Detroit at about the same time as Mr. Hutchins, from May to August 2008 -- found that at least 60 percent appeared either not to be working or to be in jobs unrelated to their training.
 Several had jobs but then lost them later, according to state wage records and interviews. And a review of wages for several employed workers before and after training showed that almost all had lost ground.
 Kelly White, 55, spent 30 years in the printing industry before her job disappeared because of automation. So in January 2007, about a year after Ms. White was laid off from a small company, where she earned $16 an hour, she began studying for an associate's degree at Macomb Community College to become a repairer of electronic equipment.
 Before enrolling in classes, Ms. White checked state labor market data and found that hers was a field where jobs were expected to grow robustly -- a requirement for Michigan Works to pay for up to $10,000 in classes over two years. 
 But after finishing her degree in May 2008 with a 3.45 grade-point average, she found the market for electronics service technicians to be smaller than she had expected. She believes that it has also become saturated with unemployed people who have more experience than her.
 ''Unfortunately, by the time I graduated, the whole economy, especially here in southeast Michigan, went south,'' Ms. White said. In the Detroit area, the 10-year projection for her field by state analysts now shows a 1.2 percent decline.
 After several months of unsuccessfully seeking work related to her degree, Ms. White landed a part-time job driving a school bus. It pays $13 an hour.
 Andy Levin, deputy director of the Michigan Labor and Economic Growth Department, pointed out that the state's economic woes made it hard to judge its retraining efforts. But Mr. Levin said he believed the state's focus on longer-term training for occupations showing growth would bear fruit.
 ''My position is this: Unless you have a highly educated work force, you really don't have much of a chance,'' he said.
 Mr. Hutchins lost his $86,000-a-year job at an automotive supply company in late 2005 and, after being unable to find work for two years, took classes in a computer system used by designers in the auto industry and elsewhere. Even though the auto industry has imploded, industrial design is still listed as a ''demand occupation'' and is eligible for training money. (Case managers at the job center here said they often scratched their heads over what occupations state labor market analysts identified as ''high growth.'') 
 After he finished training in May 2008, Mr. Hutchins actually landed a job as an automotive engineer, unrelated to the classes he took. But he was again laid off in October.
 He has since sent out as many as 15 resumes a day but has had no interviews. The design jobs he has found seem to require at least two years' experience.
 The No Worker Left Behind program normally gives participants one chance at retraining. Desperate, Mr. Hutchins's wife, Jill, wrote a letter to Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, attaching his resume and asking for advice.
 In part because of help from Ms. Granholm's office, Mr. Hutchins won approval for additional training. But what should he study this time? 
 Hearing about efforts to attract the film industry to Michigan, the couple wondered if he might become a grip, adjusting sets and lighting. They concluded that there were probably not enough jobs to be had. 
 They seized upon the stimulus program's investment in public works as a place for job growth. But Mr. Hutchins confessed he was uncertain whether those jobs would still be around in a year and a half when he finished his civil engineering classes. 
 ''It's a crap shoot,'' he said. ''You're gambling with your life.''

HEADLINE: HELP Is on The Way

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office has looked at the future of American health insurance, and it works.
 A few weeks ago there was a furor when the budget office ''scored'' two incomplete Senate health reform proposals -- that is, estimated their costs and likely impacts over the next 10 years. One proposal came in more expensive than expected; the other didn't cover enough people. Health reform, it seemed, was in trouble.
 But last week the budget office scored the full proposed legislation from the Senate committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP). And the news -- which got far less play in the media than the downbeat earlier analysis -- was very, very good. Yes, we can reform health care. 
 Let me start by pointing out something serious health economists have known all along: on general principles, universal health insurance should be eminently affordable.
 After all, every other advanced country offers universal coverage, while spending much less on health care than we do. For example, the French health care system covers everyone, offers excellent care and costs barely more than half as much per person as our system.
 And even if we didn't have this international evidence to reassure us, a look at the U.S. numbers makes it clear that insuring the uninsured shouldn't cost all that much, for two reasons.
 First, the uninsured are disproportionately young adults, whose medical costs tend to be relatively low. The big spending is mainly on the elderly, who are already covered by Medicare.
 Second, even now the uninsured receive a considerable (though inadequate) amount of ''uncompensated'' care, whose costs are passed on to the rest of the population. So the net cost of giving the uninsured explicit coverage is substantially less than it might seem.
 Putting these observations together, what sounds at first like a daunting prospect -- extending coverage to most or all of the 45 million people in America without health insurance -- should, in the end, add only a few percent to our overall national health bill. And that's exactly what the budget office found when scoring the HELP proposal.
 Now, about those specifics: The HELP plan achieves near-universal coverage through a combination of regulation and subsidies. Insurance companies would be required to offer the same coverage to everyone, regardless of medical history; on the other side, everyone except the poor and near-poor would be obliged to buy insurance, with the aid of subsidies that would limit premiums as a share of income. 
 Employers would also have to chip in, with all firms employing more than 25 people required to offer their workers insurance or pay a penalty. By the way, the absence of such an ''employer mandate'' was the big problem with the earlier, incomplete version of the plan.
 And those who prefer not to buy insurance from the private sector would be able to choose a public plan instead. This would, among other things, bring some real competition to the health insurance market, which is currently a collection of local monopolies and cartels. 
 The budget office says that all this would cost $597 billion over the next decade. But that doesn't include the cost of insuring the poor and near-poor, whom HELP suggests covering via an expansion of Medicaid (which is outside the committee's jurisdiction). Add in the cost of this expansion, and we're probably looking at between $1 trillion and $1.3 trillion.
 There are a number of ways to look at this number, but maybe the best is to point out that it's less than 4 percent of the $33 trillion the U.S. government predicts we'll spend on health care over the next decade. And that in turn means that much of the expense can be offset with straightforward cost-saving measures, like ending Medicare overpayments to private health insurers and reining in spending on medical procedures with no demonstrated health benefits.
 So fundamental health reform -- reform that would eliminate the insecurity about health coverage that looms so large for many Americans -- is now within reach. The ''centrist'' senators, most of them Democrats, who have been holding up reform can no longer claim either that universal coverage is unaffordable or that it won't work.
 The only question now is whether a combination of persuasion from President Obama, pressure from health reform activists and, one hopes, senators' own consciences will get the centrists on board -- or at least get them to vote for cloture, so that diehard opponents of reform can't block it with a filibuster. 
 This is a historic opportunity -- arguably the best opportunity since 1947, when the A.M.A. killed Harry Truman's health-care dreams. We're right on the cusp. All it takes is a few more senators, and HELP will be on the way.

HEADLINE: Lessons for Failing Schools

 BODY:
The $100 billion education stimulus package gives Education Secretary Arne Duncan unprecedented leverage to energize the languishing school reform effort.
 Mr. Duncan has said from the start that he wants the states to transform about 5,000 of the lowest-performing schools, not in a piecemeal fashion but with bold policies that have an impact right away. The argument in favor of a tightly focused effort aimed at these schools is compelling. We now know, for example, that about 12 percent of the nation's high schools account for half the country's dropouts generally -- and almost three-quarters of minority dropouts. A plan that fixed these schools, raising high school graduation and college-going rates, would pay enormous dividends for the country as a whole. 
 Mr. Duncan can use his burgeoning discretionary budget to reward states that take the initiative in this area. But Congress could push the reform effort further and faster by granting the education department's request for two changes in federal education law. The first would be to come up with new federal school improvement money and require the states to focus 40 percent of it on the lowest-performing middle and high schools. The second change would allow the secretary to directly finance charter-school operators that have already produced high-quality schools. 
 Charter schools get public money but often are exempt from curricular requirements and other rules that govern traditional public schools. Currently, high-quality charter-school programs often go begging while states finance charters that are worse than the traditional public schools they were meant to replace. The problem is underscored in an eye-opening study by Stanford University's Center for Research on Education Outcomes. 
 The study, which looked at schools in 15 states and the District of Columbia, showed that 17 percent of charter schools provided a better education than traditional public schools in the same states. But charter backers and state officials were startled to learn that 37 percent of charters offered a worse education than children would have received had they remained in traditional schools.
 Mr. Duncan confronted this issue directly at a charter school alliance meeting held in Washington last month, pointing out that the states needed to do a much better oversight job and that failing charters needed to be swiftly shut down. High-quality charter models like the ones used by the KIPP program have a role to play in the plan, the goal of which is to change the cultures of chronically failing schools. Charter operators could be brought into some schools, but other schools might need to simply force out the current staff and bring in a new one. In other cases, states will need to shut down chronically failing schools and enroll students elsewhere. 
 The secretary should focus intently on the dropout factories, the relatively small number of schools that produce so many of the nation's dropouts. Efforts at especially difficult schools will need to include social service and community outreach programs, modeled on those already in place in the Harlem Children's Zone in Upper Manhattan. 
 Mr. Duncan is on the mark when he says the country needs bold action. It can no longer tolerate schools that have trapped generations of students at the margins of society and locked them out of the new economy.

HEADLINE: For Symantec and McAfee, 'Arms Race' for Security

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: SANTA CLARA, Calif. 

 BODY:
The two leading makers of computer security software, Symantec and McAfee, are like preachers who conduct dueling tent revivals. 
 They boast and frighten and denounce each other while trying to convince the crowd that their particular brand of salvation will ward off the devil -- in this case, malicious e-mail viruses and evil Internet worms. 
 The stakes are huge: millions of global followers willing to donate a steady sum every year for protection against online threats. 
 Recently, the competition between the two has become fiercer, as both have tried to get their software tied to more new personal computers, Web sites and Internet service providers. McAfee has been particularly aggressive, using a string of deals with large PC makers in a bid to usurp Symantec's leadership position. 
 ''It's like an arms race,'' said Albert A. Pimentel, the chief financial officer of McAfee, who goes by the pugilistic nickname Rocky. Security companies must constantly persuade customers and partners to renew subscriptions or switch from a competitor with similar products.
 For years, McAfee served as a self-defeating also-ran, cleaning up the scraps left by Symantec. The company, based in Santa Clara, suffered from a decade of legal and accounting problems that left it in poor competitive shape, and employee morale low. 
 Things, however, have changed in the last two years since David G. DeWalt left his post as head of sales at the storage company EMC to run McAfee, succeeding George Samenuk, who stepped down in a stock-option backdating scandal. Under Mr. DeWalt, the company has expanded well beyond antivirus software, acquired some niche security players and increased sales to consumers and large businesses. 
 McAfee is poised to overtake Symantec next year in sales to the business market if current trends hold. 
 Symantec, based in Cupertino, Calif., remains the overall security market leader, with just about double the market share of McAfee, according to the research firm Gartner. 
 In the consumer market, Symantec holds an even larger lead, with 52 percent share and $1.8 billion in revenue last year, compared with 18 percent of the market and $624 million in revenue for McAfee. A host of smaller players like Trend Micro, CA and Kaspersky Lab round out the field.
 ''It is really Symantec and the seven dwarfs,'' said Enrique T. Salem, the chief executive of Symantec. 
 In a bold and somewhat risky bid to raise its stature with consumers, McAfee has tried to win over PC makers with something they all like: lots of cash. In the last year, it spent $55 million, more than any of its rivals, to get McAfee security software preloaded onto new computers. It now counts Dell, Acer, Toshiba, Sony and Lenovo as partners. 
 ''We are shipping on twice as many computers as the year prior,'' Mr. DeWalt said. 
 Up to 40 percent of all computers bought by consumers this year will include McAfee's software, the brokerage firm Jefferies & Company estimates. 
 Hewlett-Packard, the world's largest computer seller, has an exclusive deal with Symantec on its consumer PCs. Mr. DeWalt said that deal should come up for bids within the next year, and Symantec will have to fight to keep it. 
 ''They didn't have much competition back then, but they will this time,'' he said.
 Mr. Salem shrugs off Mr. DeWalt's tough talk. ''I love the rhetoric and the chest-pounding,'' he said. 
 ''We need to be on as many computers as possible without being irrational,'' Mr. Salem said. If McAfee bids too high, Symantec will walk away from the deal and direct its money toward building some of its other, nonsecurity products, he said.
 But, in another breath, Mr. Salem boasts that Symantec has won eight out of the nine PC deals up for bid so far in 2009. Symantec, for example, has chipped away at parts of Dell not covered by McAfee, like gaming PCs.
 The payments that both companies make to partners have their own byzantine accounting, and critics complain that the companies are not being straightforward with shareholders.
 Quite often, the deals with the PC sellers require the security companies to make upfront payments. Both parties then share revenue over the lifetime of the deal, as some people extend their subscriptions beyond the initial free trial period and begin paying annual fees for the software. 
 McAfee incurs larger upfront costs than most for its deals while waiting months before it can begin booking subscriptions as revenue. Investors must guess at how many of the trials will turn into actual sales as they weigh the business value of McAfee's payments. 
 Thus far, it is difficult to tell exactly how successful the payments have been.
 Gartner shows McAfee gaining just 0.5 percentage points of market share in the consumer security software market in the last year, with Symantec losing about 4 percentage points. 
 Mr. DeWalt says McAfee will begin showing more significant market share gains and higher deferred revenue totals as the trial and payment process plays out. ''We haven't seen the full impact of them yet,'' he said.
 McAfee says that the upfront payments are small when compared with the total potential value of the PC deals and that conversion rates have been strong to date. In addition, the company says it has tried to explain the deals to Gradient and characterizes the firm as shaping its research in a sensationalistic way that is meant to attract short-sellers, who sell borrowed shares of a company's stock, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price.
 As with many technology companies, McAfee's shares fell in the last year, but at $41 last week, its share price is about the same as prerecession levels. 
 Executives from McAfee and Symantec say the partner deals are minor items. McAfee makes more money selling corporate security products than consumer products. At $6.2 billion a year in revenue, Symantec is one of the largest software companies in the world. 
 In addition, both companies are in a part of the market that has done well in the global technology spending slump. According to Gartner, the security software market grew 19 percent last year. McAfee has proved particularly resilient to the downturn, with revenue rising 22 percent last year to $1.6 billion, largely on the back of a more diverse product mix. 
 One long-term risk for both companies is the popularity of free basic security software packages offered by some vendors, including Symantec's PC Tools brand. In addition, Microsoft, which dominates the overall PC software market, has just released a test version of free security software. 
 McAfee and Symantec argue that true deliverance from malicious software requires more commitment -- and more money. Both companies try to persuade customers to buy whole suites of security software, including firewalls and online backup services. 
 ''Last year, we saw a 500 percent increase in malware,'' said Mr. DeWalt. 
 That's a lot of demons to ward off.

HEADLINE: A Father of Netscape Begins a Silicon Valley Venture Firm

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
The man who popularized the Web browser has started a venture capital fund to back the next generation of new technologies. 
 Marc Andreessen, who co-founded Netscape, is announcing on Monday that he and Ben Horowitz, a longtime business associate, have raised $300 million that they intend to invest in technology companies. The venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, will risk small sums, as little as $50,000, on new ideas. 
Then, if they work, they will put in more money, as much as $50 million, for the companies to grow globally. The fund will have its offices on Sand Hill Road, the stretch in Menlo Park, Calif., that is home to top venture firms. 
 Andreessen Horowitz will be testing a theory of investing, one that has lost favor in recent years in Silicon Valley, that smaller funds making smaller investments in very young companies will yield higher returns. 
 Five-year returns in the venture capital industry, which reached 48 percent in 2000 at the height of the dot-com bubble, were just 6 percent through 2008, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Venture investors make much of their money when their start-ups go public, but only four have sold shares to the public this year. 
 Andreessen Horowitz plans to look for companies like Facebook, where Mr. Andreessen is a director. Facebook started with just $500,000 but has since raised $600 million to grow. 
 The partners, who also co-founded Opsware, a software company they sold to Hewlett-Packard, said they planned to stick with what they know. Almost all of the companies in which they invest will be in Silicon Valley, they said. That is unusual these days, when many funds set up shop in China, India and other countries. 
 They will also invest only in information technology companies -- ''anything with a chip or anything that runs software,'' Mr. Andreessen said -- another rarity these days. ''We will not be doing biotech or clean tech,'' he said, then added jokingly: ''We probably won't even recycle.'' 
 Instead, they will focus on start-ups that do networking and storage, consumer Internet services and cloud computing. They are also excited about consumer electronics. ''Silicon Valley companies are becoming a major force in consumer electronics again. It's sort of back to the future,'' Mr. Andreessen said, pointing to the success of the Flip video camera, whose maker, Pure Digital, was sold to Cisco in May. 
 Mr. Andreessen and Mr. Horowitz have already been making angel investments together for four years. They have put $4 million into 45 companies, including Twitter; Qik, a service that publishes live video from mobile phones; and Aliph, which makes the Jawbone Bluetooth headset. 
 Through that investing, they have a method to figure out whether to bet on a new idea. Mr. Andreessen focuses on a new technology and the potential market, while Mr. Horowitz analyzes whether an entrepreneur is capable of executing, they said. 
 ''In the venture capital business, 15 companies a year still deliver 97 percent of returns,'' Mr. Horowitz said. ''The key to success is still finding those 15.'' 
 This is a more complete version of the story than appeared in print.

HEADLINE: President's Vacation: Classified, but Not Much of a Secret

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
He does not own a sprawling Texas ranch, a family compound on the coast of Maine or a retreat tucked away in the Santa Ynez Mountains of California.
 So President Obama, in this regard at least, is much like Bill Clinton: He has no vacation home to call his own.
 With the summer getaway season in full swing, the White House is busy arranging the president's first vacation since taking office. The destination -- officially, at least -- is classified. Yet it is hardly a secret to the people on Martha's Vineyard, several business owners and others said, where reservations have been made and preparations are under way for the Obama family's August arrival.
 Still, questions abound on the Massachusetts island. 
 Will they settle in Oak Bluffs, Chilmark or another town? Will they rent the home of the filmmaker Spike Lee? Will they be there at the same time as the Clintons? 
 ''The rumor mill is rampant because people want to get information and want to flesh out their plans,'' said Charles J. Ogletree, a law professor at Harvard, a summer Vineyard resident and a longtime friend of the Obamas. ''I hope that people will respect their privacy and need for rest. The best thing we can do is let him recharge his batteries and prepare for the tasks ahead.''
 The White House is mum on the dates, duration and precise destination of the trip. 
 First, advisers said, the administration does not want to distract from the work of Congress, which will spend at least some of the summer grinding away on health care legislation and the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Sonia Sotomayor.
 Second, as the unemployment rate inches ever closer to 10 percent, an oceanfront respite filled with tee times and dinner dates could be seen as out-of-touch with the economic hardship facing many Americans.
 And third, the president is really never off duty, so wherever he chooses to vacation -- and for how long -- sends at least some type of a message and is sure to draw scrutiny.
 Last August, when Mr. Obama flew to his native Hawaii, some Washington commentators criticized his vacation choice. Mr. Obama, who also spent time visiting his dying grandmother in Honolulu, told aides he was particularly agitated by a remark from Cokie Roberts of ABC News, who said, ''It has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign, exotic place.'' She added, ''He should be in Myrtle Beach.''
 This year, aides said, a handful of destinations were discussed. (Myrtle Beach was not among them.) But since the Obamas have previously visited Martha's Vineyard, and the Secret Service is accustomed to protecting presidents there, it became a top choice.
 The island, which is 23 miles long and 9 miles wide, has six towns with distinctive traits. The Obamas are likely to stay in or near Oak Bluffs, where upper-class black families have been vacationing for decades.
 ''Vineyarders allow people to enjoy their time here without bothering them,'' said Nancy Gardella, executive director of the Martha's Vineyard Chamber of Commerce. ''They pride themselves on kind of ignoring celebrities and let them relax without being hassled or followed.''
 That does not mean, of course, that Mr. Obama will not be hassled from afar.
 During his Hawaiian trip last summer, the Republican National Committee carefully tracked his itinerary, sending out pictures and news accounts of his whereabouts on Oahu. This year, the themes of criticism could well come from the words of previous Republican presidents. 
 ''Most Americans don't sit in Martha's Vineyard, swilling white wine,'' George W. Bush once said when asked why he chose to relax in the broiling Texas sun as opposed to the cool Atlantic breezes. And Lyndon B. Johnson disparagingly referred to the Vineyard as the ''female island,'' upon discovering that his aides chose Martha's Vineyard for their vacation instead of joining him at his ranch in Texas.
 The full-time residents of the island pay little attention to the jokes and are eager to welcome the Obamas to a place that has also felt the sting of the depressed economy.
 ''Having the Obama family pick us is great for business,'' said Susan Goldstein, the owner of the Mansion House hotel, who has lived on the Vineyard for 40 years. ''It's like our own islandwide recovery package.''
 In 1993, Ms. Goldstein hung a welcome banner when the Clintons arrived for a 10-day vacation. She said that she planned to do the same for the Obama family, but that she suspected the presidential trips would be entirely different. On one of Mr. Clinton's summer visits, he attended nine cocktail or dinner parties in 13 nights, captivating the island social scene.
 Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, are planning a far more low-key visit, several aides and associates say. A few Chicago friends are expected to join the vacation, as they have trips to Hawaii. And golf outings on any of the island's five courses -- two public, three private -- are expected to be with friends, rather than the celebrity partners Mr. Clinton played with.
 ''It won't be a constant series of public events, but a genuine opportunity to spend quality time with their daughters and some important time with a group of friends,'' Mr. Ogletree said. ''I hope and pray this is not a working vacation, where they don't have any time for themselves, and go back to Washington more exhausted than they came. That would be a tragic and unfortunate intrusion on their time.''
 While Mrs. Obama and the couple's two daughters, Malia and Sasha, are planning to stay longer, aides said Mr. Obama was likely to take only a week of vacation. The Obama administration is intent on avoiding any parallels to Mr. Bush, who spent 27 days at his Texas ranch during the first August vacation of his presidency, which came only days before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 But unlike Mr. Bush, who established a Western White House in Crawford and invited members of his cabinet and his senior aides to join him, Mr. Obama intends to be away from most of his team. Rahm Emanuel, the president's chief of staff, is heading to Montana. David Axelrod, a senior adviser, is going to his lakefront house in Michigan. Valerie Jarrett, another senior adviser, will be on the Vineyard but at a house she has rented for years.
 With the exception of a few weekend trips to Camp David, the presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland, Mr. Obama has taken no vacation in his first five months in office. Last year, he waxed aloud about the importance of getting away.
 ''The most important thing you need to do is to have big chunks of time during the day when all you're doing is thinking,'' Mr. Obama said. If not, he said, ''you start making mistakes or you lose the big picture.''

HEADLINE: For Obama Visit, Russia Mutes A TV Pastime: Ranting at U.S.

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
When Barack Obama and Dmitri A. Medvedev meet behind closed doors here on Monday, among those on tenterhooks will be the television commentator Mikhail V. Leontyev, who has built a career on his relentless hectoring of the West.
 In his prime-time slot on state-controlled Channel One, Mr. Leontyev, equal parts Rush Limbaugh and Oliver Stone, has derided the United States as ''a great power with a broken back,'' ''a country where armed psychopaths regularly roam educational establishments'' and ''a parasite that owes the world $53 trillion.'' 
 Now, though, there is a sense of uncertainty here about what lies next in the Russian-American relationship. In sync with the Kremlin, Russian news media have reflected this state of suspended animation, muting their criticism of Washington and especially of President Obama. That is not good news for Mr. Leontyev. 
 As soon as Mr. Obama began making overtures toward Russia this spring, he said in an interview, ''The will of the elite turned into porridge. We have this great desire for everybody in the world to love us, and to relax. At this moment, the brain starts turning into liquid.'' 
 Opinion polls show a slight thaw in Russian perceptions of the United States, which have been in a long decline. The departure of George W. Bush, who was loathed here, does not fully account for this; it is an expression of hope, or curiosity, about what Mr. Obama will offer. That does not mean the grievances have gone away. Anti-Americanism has become a central fact of Russian politics -- a populist rallying cry and proof, as people here love to say, that the country has risen from its knees. 
 Whether Russian opinion makers drift back to the paint-stripping rhetoric of last summer seems to depend greatly on what happens at the summit meeting.
 ''There is a pause, I would say,'' said Vladimir Solovyov, a prominent talk-show host. ''A lot of people are not willing to blow this big horn. I think for guys like Leontyev that have made it their profession -- anti-Americanism is sort of their profession -- I think they are just waiting.''
 ''It's extremely tough for us to change 180 degrees, because for the last couple of years we have been very tough on American policy, especially when it comes to Georgia, Iraq, Iran,'' Mr. Solovyov said. ''It's sort of like, 'O.K., so, we'll see.' '' 
 Over the past 20 years, Russia has gone from one of the most pro-American countries in the world to one that is deeply wary of Western intentions.
 The fundamental dynamic is disillusionment. As the Soviet Union crumbled, Russians pinned their hopes on the West; 80 percent of Russians viewed the United States positively in 1991, and only 6 percent negatively, according to statistics from the Levada Center, a public opinion and market research agency. Those warm feelings curdled before the decade was out. 
 Russians blamed America for supporting the economic reforms of the Yeltsin era and for the social chaos that ensued. They were infuriated by American-backed wars in Yugoslavia and Iraq, by the expansion of NATO eastward and most recently by the Georgian attack on South Ossetia. Vladimir V. Putin, the former president and now prime minister, transformed this anger into a doctrine, saying in 2007 that Russia faced an enemy comparable to the Third Reich, with ''the same contempt for human life and the same claims of exceptionality and diktat in the world.'' 
 By this May, the same Levada poll showed that 36 percent of Russians viewed the United States positively, and 50 percent viewed it negatively. 
 Television, the key source of information for 80 percent of Russians, according to Levada, invigorates this trend. Mr. Leontyev's ''Odnako,'' or ''However,'' is a four-minute blast of invective that is shown after the nightly news. Because the time slot is so precious, he said, the channel's executives put the show on only when they think it will give ratings a boost -- principally, it seems, at moments of confrontation with the West. Last August, after the brief war with Georgia, ''Odnako'' was broadcast 13 times; this spring, it slowed to three or four shows per month, according to the show's Web site. 
 Vladimir V. Pozner, who hosts a political talk show on Channel One, compared Mr. Leontyev to Soviet-era ''agitators,'' who were dispatched to collective farms and factory floors to explain the party's policies to the people. 
 ''He is an instrument used to support and increase anti-Western sentiment in this country, and that's what he does,'' Mr. Pozner said. 
 Every show is conceived, Mr. Leontyev said, to find an answer to the question: ''Who is the bastard?'' or, who should be the object of Russians' outrage? And the answer, quite frequently, winds around to Washington. 
 Mr. Leontyev has reported that not only President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia but all of his political opponents were hand-picked by ''Washington casting,'' and said that the Western-oriented political revolutions in some post-Soviet countries had had ''an external client, and that client can only sit in Washington.'' 
 He has called the International Monetary Fund ''a standard instrument of American diktat'' and Europe ''a collection of American satellites.'' He has dismissed Mr. Obama's ability to ''reset'' American policies toward Russia, saying that real power lies elsewhere in the United States government, and that ''Comrade Obama is only a front, which can be changed or reversed.'' 
 He says he is capturing a deep vein of feeling in Russia. For elites, he said, ''anti-Americanism is now as proper as wearing pants.'' For ordinary people it is a visceral feeling. 
 ''My task on television is to verbalize, in a certain formula, the real public consciousness that exists,'' Mr. Leontyev said. ''So people will hear what they want to hear. So they can say, 'Yes, that is what I thought!' '' 
 The last few months have left commentators in a sort of waiting period as they watch for concrete changes to America's Russia policy, said Alexei Pushkov, who anchors the current-events program ''Post Scriptum.'' Mr. Pushkov said he had avoided the topic of Mr. Obama for at least three months, except to note when the American president killed a fly on camera. The softened tone will continue if the so-called reset in American-Russian relations succeeds, Mr. Pushkov said. 
 He laughed when asked about Mr. Leontyev. 
 ''He will find another enemy,'' Mr. Pushkov said. ''He is a highly flexible, multiple-re-entry targeted vehicle. He will find things to talk about.''
 If, on the other hand, Mr. Obama sticks with the regional policies he inherited from Mr. Bush, the waiting period will not last much longer, Mr. Pushkov said. 
 ''If this is the case, I think that somewhere by autumn, the Russian media will probably go back to the old skepticism,'' he said. 
 Mr. Leontyev himself sounded uneasy, anyway, as the summit meeting approached. A stalwart supporter of Mr. Putin's, he is less sure of Mr. Medvedev, whom he called ''a bear cub.'' The very idea of shared interests between Russia and America, he said, is as unnatural as a soccer team shooting the ball into its own goal. 
 ''I think Medvedev will not be allowed to yield too much,'' he said. ''What I don't like is his open desire to be liked. If this desire is not curtailed, it is not good for these negotiations. Of course Medvedev would like to have a breakthrough, but we have already yielded what we had to yield. 
 ''All that is left for us is to tear our skin off,'' he added. ''That is the only thing we have to give away.''

HEADLINE: Thompson, the Stealth Candidate

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
He is rarely on television. He has not begun to advertise. He is far behind in the polls, yet seems in no rush to get going.
 The all-but-invisible mayoral candidacy of William C. Thompson Jr., the city's comptroller, is baffling even to those who wish to see him elected. He has raised $5 million but has been so low key, some Democrats wonder if he is actually running.
 And often, when Mr. Thompson travels, he hears the same question: Where have you been?
 The incumbent, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, is everywhere: on television, with a $12 million barrage of ads touting his re-election bid; in mailboxes, with a constant stream of glossy literature; and online, with ads popping up on Web sites from Facebook to local blogs. 
 A woman approached Mr. Thompson in the Bronx not long ago and asked if she would be receiving campaign literature from him.
 ''Not anytime soon,'' he said. 
 The comptroller, a mild-mannered, wonkish and careful politician, said he had no choice but to hold back. The only way he can defeat Mr. Bloomberg, he said, is to bite his lip for several months, conserve his campaign money and deliver a last-minute assault in the fall. 
 But concern inside Democratic circles about Mr. Thompson's retiring style is taking on new urgency, given Mr. Bloomberg's success in unveiling endorsements almost every day from a wide range of groups, including from several prominent Democratic elected officials and groups traditionally aligned with Democrats, like Naral Pro-Choice New York and the New York League of Conservation Voters.
 And some worry that Mr. Thompson's approach is less a function of strategy than a lack of drive and energy.
 Either way, his approach is the political equivalent of trying a rope-a-dope for 14 rounds and hoping to land a knockout in the 15th. 
 ''To try to go toe to toe with the mayor makes no sense,'' he said during a recent interview at a downtown restaurant. ''There is no way we can compete on TV and radio.''
 Mr. Thompson is taking a cheaper, grass-roots approach, visiting three to four union halls and neighborhood Democratic clubs a night and testing messages that his aides hope will build a loyal following and erode support for the mayor.
 In a stump speech he can recite from memory, he attacks the mayor as an out-of-touch, Manhattan-centric billionaire whose policies have protected the wealthy and ignored the middle class. 
 In what passes for a rousing punch line, he claims that Mr. Bloomberg sandbagged voters by tearing up the city's term-limits law, which allowed him to seek a third term. Mr. Thompson calls it ''the day democracy died in New York.''
 In general, the crowds are small -- often fewer than 30 people -- and the applause is tepid. Even news conferences sometimes veer off the script. On Tuesday, as he was garnering the endorsement of a Chinatown civic organization, a would-be supporter blurted: ''The Puerto Rican people behind you! Don't worry!'' followed by a vulgarity aimed at the mayor.
 Mr. Thompson cringed, and said: ''O.K., we're on camera. Why does this always happen to me?''
 Outside political circles, most people do not even know who he is. In a recent poll taken by The New York Times, Cornell University and NY1 News, almost three-quarters of respondents said they did not know enough about Mr. Thompson to form an opinion. 
 To some degree, Mr. Thompson has been overshadowed by the turmoil in the State Senate in Albany. But he has also failed to seize on a signature issue or define himself in a way that has grabbed the public, Democrats complain privately. 
 Mr. Thompson's aides say that a Bloomberg victory is far from inevitable and that New Yorkers are jittery about the economy, rising taxes and the school system. 
 Indeed, the recent poll suggests that Mr. Bloomberg has vulnerabilities. While most New Yorkers still approve of the job he has done, he is hardly beloved, and is skewered by critics as an imperious tone-deaf billionaire who cares mostly about people with money. A majority of people in the recent survey said that they disapproved of Mr. Bloomberg's successful effort to change the city's term limits law last fall and that they would like to give someone else a chance as mayor.
 By November, Mr. Thompson's supporters believe, voters may be ready for a new occupant at City Hall. The challenge is to convince them that Mr. Thompson should be that somebody else, even as the mayor outspends him by a rate of nine to one.
 At times, Mr. Thompson gets frustrated by the lopsided financial fight. 
 A couple of months ago, he stormed into a strategy session at his campaign headquarters in Lower Manhattan. He had seen the latest Bloomberg television commercial, and demanded that his aides produce a matching ad, said a person who was in the room.
 Stunned aides furiously scribbled down his instructions. But a few minutes into his tirade, Mr. Thompson cut himself off.
 ''We can't take the bait,'' he told the aides, and called off the plans.
 Even without TV advertising, Mr. Thompson is having a hard time curbing his spending, burning through his campaign money at a faster rate than the last Democrat to lose to Mr. Bloomberg: Fernando Ferrer.
 Unlike Mr. Ferrer, however, Mr. Thompson may have the luxury of a stress-free -- and relatively cheap -- primary in September. His strongest potential rival, Representative Anthony D. Weiner, announced in late May that he would not run for mayor. That leaves City Councilman Tony Avella, an outspoken and colorful Queens Democrat, who has raised less than $250,000 so far and remains a long shot for the nomination.
 That gives Mr. Thompson months to introduce himself to New Yorkers and, crucially, raise money. 
 Mr. Thompson is finding inspiration in the mayoral campaign of Michael Nutter of Philadelphia, who was hailed as the Seabiscuit of Pennsylvania politics for staging an unexpected, last-minute victory in the Democratic primary in 2007. 
 Mr. Nutter's profile, like Mr. Thompson's, was that of an uncharismatic, by-the-book politician. And like Mr. Thompson, Mr. Nutter was a decided underdog in a contest that included a billionaire businessman. 
 So Mr. Thompson has hired two people who worked on the Nutter campaign: Geoffrey D. Garin, a pollster with the Garin-Hart-Yang Research Group; and Doc Sweitzer, a political consultant from the Campaign Group. If it can happen in Philadelphia, Mr. Thompson's thinking goes, then why not in New York?
 ''Little by little, Nutter peaked at the right time,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Appointees Who Really Govern America

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
PACKING THE COURT 
 The Rise of Judicial Power and the Coming Crisis of the Supreme Court 
 By James MacGregor Burns 
 326 pages. The Penguin Press. $27.95. 
 In the wake of the Supreme Court's infamous Dred Scott ruling, which effectively made slavery legal in the territories, Lincoln declared in his first Inaugural Address that ''if the policy of the government, upon vital questions, affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made'' then ''the people will have ceased, to be their own rulers, having, to that extent, practically resigned their government, into the hands of that eminent tribunal.'' 
 Lincoln is hardly alone, of course, in questioning the activist role that the Supreme Court has assumed intermittently -- some would say, frequently -- in American history. In fact, both liberals and conservatives have taken turns denouncing the court for overstepping its bounds -- depending on which political direction a given set of justices has pushed the court. 
 In his provocative and timely new book, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian James MacGregor Burns observes that during one 18-month period in Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, the court (which was then a bastion of the old economic order) struck down more than a dozen federal and state laws, threatening the implementation of the New Deal and causing Roosevelt to lament in June 1936 that conservatives had created a '' 'no-man's land' where no government -- state or federal -- can function.'' 
 In contrast, in the 1960s, when the Warren Court put itself in the vanguard of change through its championing of equality and civil rights and in the process nullified dozens of federal, state and local statutes, some conservatives angrily argued that judicial review had no basis in the Constitution. (Today, with President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor awaiting confirmation hearings, conservatives are again the ones issuing warnings about judicial activism.) 
 It is Mr. Burns's contention in ''Packing the Court'' that ''as the ultimate and unappealable arbiters of the Constitution, the justices of the Supreme Court have become far more than the referees in constitutional disputes that the framers intended. They have gone beyond interpreting the rules -- they have come to create them.'' 
 He argues that the liberalism of the Warren Court is the exception, that the Court's historic role has been ''as a choke point for progressive reform,'' and that in ''the Gilded Age of the late 19th century'' and the ''Gilded Age at the turn of the 21st,'' the justices ''fiercely protected the rights and liberties of the minority of the powerful and the propertied.'' The American people, he concludes, ''cannot expect leadership from unelected and unaccountable politicians in robes.'' Some of Mr. Burns's proposals are bound to be controversial: for instance, he suggests near the end of the book that a president could challenge judicial authority by announcing ''flatly that he or she would not accept the Supreme Court's verdicts because the power of judicial emasculation of legislation was not -- and never had been -- in the Constitution.'' 
 Happily for the reader, the bulk of this volume is less didactic, charting the fallout that ''the passions of the day,'' in Justice Felix Frankfurter's words, have had on its rulings, while analyzing the role that chance, timing and the mysteries of human personality have played in shaping the institution and its decisions. 
 Mr. Burns uses his intimate knowledge of America's past -- he is the author of a three-volume history of the United States, as well as of biographies of Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy -- to situate judicial rulings within a political and social context, even as he dissects the practical consequences of particular decisions. In this respect ''Packing the Court'' (which refers to Roosevelt's controversial and failed proposal to pack the court by enabling him to name up to six new justices) serves as a kind of historical bookend to Jeffrey Toobin's compelling 2007 book, ''The Nine,'' which focused more on the court's recent history and personal dynamics within the current court. 
 As Mr. Burns sees it, John Marshall, a Federalist who was sworn in as chief justice in March 1801, made the Supreme Court ''a driving force'' for nationalism. With rulings in cases like Marbury v. Madison the Marshall Court laid ''the basis for a power of judicial review of acts of Congress -- indeed over the acts of all branches of the national and state governments.'' 
 This power would be claimed in full a half-century later, Mr. Burns says, when Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, writing in the Dred Scott decision, declared void the Missouri Compromise (which had forbidden slavery in parts of the Louisiana Purchase), arguing that Congress had no power to make such rulings, that slaves were property, and that masters were guaranteed their property rights. The ruling, a clear victory for the slave-holding states, would fuel tensions between the North and South and push the country down the path toward civil war.
 With the end of the war, Amendments 13, 14 and 15 were ratified, abolishing slavery and guaranteeing the rights of due process and equal protection, as well as the right to vote, but as Mr. Burns points out, ''the interpretation of these amendments -- the extent of the rights and liberties they guaranteed and the reach of federal power to enforce them -- became the province of the Supreme Court.'' And in ruling after ruling the court found exceptions and limits to those amendments, effectively denying African-Americans the rights and protections they had been promised. 
 Instead, Mr. Burns says, the recipients of ''beneficent decisions from the United States Supreme Court'' in the post-Civil War years were entrepreneurs and corporations, who benefited from the justices' eagerness to abet the country's economic expansion. He writes that all of President Ulysses S. Grant's appointees ''were railroad attorneys'' and that during the 1880s ''a flock of major railroad cases arrived'' at the court's doorstep, and that in general, a philosophy of laissez-faire capitalism and ''economic liberty'' informed the court's decisions. 
 He argues that with the 1895 case United States v. E. C. Knight Company, the court drastically narrowed ''the scope of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which had been hailed as the first federal effort to regulate the huge monopolistic corporate combinations that were rapidly forming,'' and that the court went on to frustrate many of Theodore Roosevelt's efforts at reform, remaining wed to what Mr. Burns calls a ''long outgrown economic philosophy.'' 
 Indeed, Mr. Burns states that the principle of lifelong tenure has ''produced a critical time lag, with the Supreme Court institutionally almost always behind the times''; since 1970, he notes, the average tenure of justices has increased to more than 26 years. 
 ''Justices throughout the court's history have clung to their seats long after their political patrons have retired,'' he observes, ''and long after their parties have yielded to their opponents or even disappeared. They have often perpetuated ideologies and attitudes that are outdated or that Americans have repudiated at the ballot box.'' 
 As a result, Mr. Burns concludes in this tough-minded book, ''too often the Supreme Court has seemed to be fighting the progress of history.''

HEADLINE: Debating Climate Change

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Betraying the Planet'' (column, June 29), Paul Krugman asserts that those of us who oppose government regulation to deal with climate change are committing ''treason against the planet.'' I think Mr. Krugman is committing treason against reasoned debate. 
 One of the most compelling arguments against climate-change regulation is not that global warming isn't occurring but, rather, that the dangers of further regulation far outweigh its likely benefits. Government regulation is inevitably a political animal; it's never guided purely, or even largely, by disinterested science.
 Is it treasonous to worry about the influence of interest groups on regulation? Is it treasonous to fear that centralizing more power in Washington will result in unforeseen negative consequences? Is it treasonous to believe that the threat to our well-being posed by further constraints upon markets is worse than the threat posed by higher temperatures?
 Donald J. Boudreaux Fairfax, Va., June 29, 2009
 The writer is chairman of the economics department at George Mason University.
 To the Editor: 
 Re ''Climate in the Senate'' (editorial, July 1):
 It is surprising that you would advocate public policy based on a controversial theory with no scientific consensus. By suggesting that the Senate include emissions from unquantifiable indirect land use changes, known as ILUC, in biofuels carbon accounting, you are putting policy biases ahead of sound science. 
 International ILUC is the notion that expansion of American biofuels leads to cultivation of pristine ecosystems elsewhere in the world. No credible science exists showing any link between American biofuels and deforestation in Brazil. More than 110 scientists recently wrote that the current body of ILUC science cannot be relied upon for regulatory purposes. 
 The House's climate bill establishes an exhaustive scientific review of ILUC. The Senate should follow suit. If we allow hyperbole to drive this debate, we risk undermining the evolution of an important industry to our nation's future.

HEADLINE: France, Unlike U.S., Is Deep Into Work on Stimulus Projects

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Alice Pfeiffer contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: FONTAINEBLEAU, France 

 BODY:
French workers normally take off much of the summer, but this month, there is something of a revolution going on here at this former royal chateau roughly 30 miles southeast of Paris. The throngs of tourists will be jostling alongside stonemasons, restoration experts and other artisans paid by the French government's $37 billion economic stimulus program.
 Their job? Maintain in pristine condition the 800-year-old palace of more than 1,500 rooms where Napoleon bid adieu before being exiled to Elba and where Marie Antoinette enjoyed a gilded boudoir. 
 Besides Fontainebleau, about 50 French chateaus are to receive a facelift, including the palace of Versailles. Also receiving funds are some 75 cathedrals like Notre Dame in Paris. A museum devoted to Lalique glass is being created in Strasbourg, while Marseilles is to be the home of a new 10 million euro center for Mediterranean culture.
 All told, Paris has set aside 100 million euros in stimulus funds earmarked for what the French like to call their cultural patrimony. It is a French twist on how to overcome the global downturn, spending borrowed money avidly to beautify the nation even as it also races ahead of the United States in more classic Keynesian ways: fixing potholes, upgrading railroads and pursuing other ''shovel ready'' projects.
 ''America is six months behind; it has wasted a lot of time,'' said Patrick Devedjian, the minister in charge of the French relance, or stimulus. By the time Washington gets around to doling out most of its money, Mr. Devedjian sniffed, ''the crisis could be over.''
 Gallic pride aside, Mr. Devedjian has a point. While he plans to spend 75 percent of France's stimulus money this year, the White House is giving itself until fall 2010 to lay out that big a share of the American expenditure. And many experts predict that Washington will fall short of that goal.
 As it turns out, France's more centralized, state-directed economy -- so often criticized in good times for smothering entrepreneurship and holding back growth -- is proving remarkably effective at deploying funds quickly and efficiently in bad times.
 ''All projects must start in 2009,'' Mr. Devedjian said. ''We want rapid results.''
 The confidence evident in the words of Mr. Devedjian, a close adviser to President Nicolas Sarkozy, echoes a broader pride among French business and political leaders that their government has done a better job dodging the worst of the economic turmoil than its European neighbors like Britain, Germany and Spain.
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development expects France's gross domestic product to drop 4 percent from the peak of the economic cycle, far less than the 7.4 percent plunge expected in Germany, the nation's economic rival.
 The economic decline and loss of jobs are also likely to be significantly milder than in Spain, Belgium and Britain, according to the group, a Paris-based intergovernmental research and policy advisory agency for the world's industrialized countries. (By comparison, the American economy is expected to shrink by 3.5 percent before starting to grow again.) 
 While many economists predict Germany and much of western Europe will remain in recession through mid-2010, France's official statistics agency expects the economic situation to stabilize by the fourth quarter of 2009, about the same time many analysts predict that the American economy will finally start to improve.
 ''There's a growing possibility that G.D.P. could grow in the third or fourth quarter,'' said Eric Dubois, head of the short-term analysis department of Insee, the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies.
 For all the confidence expressed by the French, though, France remains highly vulnerable to the threat of rising unemployment. The O.E.C.D. expects the French jobless rate, currently 8.9 percent and lower than the 9.5 percent rate in the United States, to hit 11.2 percent by the end of 2010, above the expected American peak of 10.1 percent.
 ''There has been a lag with unemployment, but now it will start to bite,'' said Herve Boulhol, head of the France desk at the O.E.C.D.
 Paying for all those jobless French will not be cheap. Under French job regulations, unemployed workers are guaranteed up to 67 percent of their former salary and can collect as much as 70,000 euros ($98,000) annually in benefits for two years.
 Indeed, without major changes in government policies, France faces costs that will probably be crippling in the long run. ''We're insulated from the shocks, but the next generation will pay for it,'' Mr. Boulhol warned.
 For now, though, the deluge seems far off into the future at Fontainebleau, much as it did to Louis XIV, the Sun King, who spent each fall here for his annual hunt. The well-tended gardens and canals shimmer in the summer sun, while artisans clean stonework and repair the courtyards and kitchen buildings where royal feasts were once prepared.
 ''This was the heart of the castle because court life revolved around meals,'' said Jacques Dubois, a spokesman for the Chateau de Fontainebleau. ''And this money allows us to finish construction that's been going on for years.''
 It is easier to find money for castles and cathedrals, of course, in a country that believes ''art is equal to other investments, not secondary,'' as Mr. Devedjian puts it. But the largess is driven as well by President Sarkozy's support for more spending to combat the recession, even if it means borrowing more and running up big deficits. 
 That contrasts sharply with the commitment by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to hold down stimulus spending and move as quickly as possible to curb her government's budget deficit.
 So what about the criticism that Europe is not being as aggressive as the United States in combating the global slowdown, with only tepid stimulus packages?
 That's not the way the French see it.
 ''You lost time with changing a president and no decisions were made in the last three months of 2008,'' Mr. Devedjian jibed. ''Nothing happened in January 2009, and in February, there was just a speech.''
 ''The country that is behind is the U.S.,'' he said, ''not France.''

HEADLINE: In Step to Enhance Currency, China Allows Its Use in Some Foreign Payments

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Banks in China and Hong Kong began wiring Chinese renminbi directly to one another on Monday to settle payments for imports and exports, as China took another step toward establishing the renminbi as a global currency -- and, eventually, an international alternative to the dollar.
 China has tempered its recent calls for a global reserve currency other than the dollar going into a meeting of the world's major industrialized countries and biggest emerging economies in Italy on Thursday. He Yafei, China's vice foreign minister, said on Sunday that the dollar would remain the world's dominant currency for ''many years to come.''
 But the Chinese government is accelerating the process of making its own currency, the renminbi, more readily convertible into other currencies, which gives it the potential over the long term to be used widely for trade and as a reserve currency.
 The day that the renminbi is fully convertible -- more than a few years away, but perhaps less than a few decades -- will most likely signal a huge shift in global economic power, and a day of reckoning of sorts not just for China but also for the United States, which will no longer be able to run up huge debt without economic consequences. 
 Despite the slow, cautious pace at which China is moving, few experts on Chinese monetary policy doubt that the long-term direction of policy is toward strengthening the renminbi as an alternative to industrialized countries' currencies.
 ''To many minds here in China the U.S. dollar's time is almost up,'' wrote Stephen Green, an economist in the Shanghai offices of Standard Chartered, in a research note last Thursday. ''The euro zone suffers from political paralysis and a too-conservative central bank, while two decades of economic stagnation and a shrinking population do the yen no favors.''
 For decades, China has shielded the renminbi behind high barriers. Authorities in Beijing prevented sizable amounts of the currency from building up beyond China's borders to allow them to control the exchange rate and tightly regulate the financial system.
 By keeping the exchange rate low, China keeps its exports competitive.
 But, as a result, almost all payments for China's imports and exports, as well as international investment in China and Chinese investment abroad, are made in dollars. Smaller sums cross China's borders as euros and yen, but seldom renminbi.
 China is now starting to tear down these walls and free the renminbi -- a decision driven partly by recognition of China's rising role in the world economy and partly by disenchantment with the currencies and financial systems of the industrialized world during the current downturn.
 ''China definitely wants to reduce its dependence on the U.S. dollar,'' said Xu Xiaonian, an economist at the China Europe International Business School. ''Given the quantitative easing of the Fed and the risk of worldwide inflation, it is understandable why China would want to accelerate the convertibility of the renminbi.'' 
 China's leaders tend to plan far ahead, however, and full convertibility for the renminbi is likely to take years, said three people who have discussed the issue with China's central bank policy makers. All three said that China's recently announced goal to turn Shanghai into an international financial center by 2020 meant that China probably wants a renminbi that is fully convertible into other currencies by then.
 Full convertibility is necessary for other countries' central banks to hold renminbi in their foreign exchange reserves instead of the dollar, but not sufficient by itself. China also needs to show long-term economic and financial stability -- something it has demonstrated over the past year in greater abundance than most countries.
 Currency specialists and economists estimate that China still holds close to three-quarters of its $2 trillion in foreign reserves in the form of dollar-denominated assets. But these holdings have nearly stopped growing since the global financial crisis began last September, as Chinese authorities have also shifted away from the longer-maturity bonds and the securities of government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae, and toward shorter-dated securities, especially Treasury bills.
 Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, called this spring for a greater role in the global financial system for special drawing rights, a unit of account used in dealings with the International Monetary Fund. But Mr. He, the vice foreign minister, said on Sunday that such discussions were an academic exercise.
 Eswar S. Prasad, the former head of the I.M.F.'s China division, said that senior Chinese central bankers had told him that Mr. Zhou's suggestions about using special drawing rights as a kind of global currency were intended to stimulate debate, and that China's main goal is to enhance the role of its own currency.
 ''The Chinese authorities see full convertibility as a long-term objective, recognizing this is essential for the renminbi to become an international reserve currency,'' Mr. Prasad said.
 Full convertibility of the renminbi is not an unalloyed benefit for China, because it would be harder, although not impossible, for China's central bank to continue controlling the currency's value in terms of the dollar. A sharp rise in the renminbi could drive thousands of export factories out of business and cause large-scale layoffs, which the Communist Party fears as potentially destabilizing. A more volatile currency would also require Chinese businesses to develop more sophistication in managing risk, and most likely involve losses along the way among those that fail to do so.
 In the last several months, Beijing authorities have begun moving to let central banks from Argentina to Malaysia settle payments in renminbi with China's central bank. On Monday, the government moved gingerly toward allowing the private sector to handle more renminbi beyond mainland China's borders.
 The new program is restricted to companies in Shanghai and in the biggest cities of Guangdong Province, a center of exports next door to Hong Kong. Companies in these cities are now eligible to send or receive payments in renminbi with customers or suppliers in Hong Kong, Macao and Southeast Asia.
 Chinese exporters have been eager to see the renminbi used more widely for trade -- particularly after many suffered losses a year ago, when the Chinese authorities allowed the renminbi to rise 8 percent against the dollar from December 2007 until the exchange rate was frozen through market interventions in late July 2008. That rise in the renminbi hurt Chinese companies that had signed contracts to export goods for payments in dollars, only to find that those dollars did not go as far as they hoped in covering expenses incurred in renminbi.
 ''Expanding the renminbi usage area and making it more flexible is great news as we sell a lot to various countries overseas -- this should also remove the risks associated with currency fluctuations,'' said Wang Yapeng, a sales manager at Shanghai Electric International Economic and Trading Company Ltd., which exports a wide range of machine parts.

HEADLINE: Venture Capitalists Look For a Return to the A B C's

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
For a group accustomed to looking outward for the next big thing, Silicon Valley's venture capitalists are getting very introspective these days. 
 Much of the soul searching along Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, where many of the venture capitalists have offices, is leading to the same conclusion: venture capital needs to go back to basics. The biggest names in the industry are concerned about low returns and are blaming several factors: funds that have grown too large, the M.B.A.'s that have invaded the industry and older partners who have lost touch with what is new in technology. 
 ''I personally believe and I think the evidence proves that the venture industry has gotten too big, the funds have gotten too big,'' said Alan Patricof, an investor for 40 years who backed America Online and Apple, at a recent venture investing conference in San Francisco. ''Our biggest challenge today for venture capital is to think smaller.'' 
 Mr. Patricof is part of a growing chorus of voices calling for the amount of money in venture funds to shrink drastically to levels last seen two decades ago. His firm, Greycroft Partners, is taking a retro approach with a $75 million fund that makes smaller investments. 
 Many in the industry predict that a third to a half of the 882 active venture capital firms could disappear, if only because poor returns will force underperforming firms to shut down. It is already happening: Investment in venture capital funds shrank to $4.3 billion in the first quarter, from $7.1 billion in the same quarter a year ago. 
 There will be ''a ton of venture capitalists who disappear over the next 18 to 20 months, and it's going to be painful for a while,'' said Bryan Roberts, a partner at Venrock. ''But the best thing that could have happened to V.C. is this economic crisis, because it's lowering the flow of capital into these funds.'' 
 The source of concern is lower returns brought on in part by a dearth of public stock offerings. Five-year returns in the venture capital industry, which reached 48 percent in 2000 at the height of the dot-com bubble, were just 6 percent through 2008, according to the National Venture Capital Association. 
 Most venture capitalists say the trouble began amid the excesses of the dot-com era. Before then, most of the investors in venture capital were university endowments, foundations and wealthy families. But in the late 1990s, endowments sharply increased their stake in illiquid assets, including venture capital. Big pension funds saw how much money these investors were making and wanted in as well. The amount invested annually by venture capitalists swelled to $104 billion in 2000, from $2.7 billion in 1990, according to the venture capital association. Today it is about $30 billion. 
 The surge of money is in large part to blame for the recent poor performance, many in the industry say. ''The big financiers of venture capital are force-feeding the industry, and it's like force-feeding cows -- it makes the industry sick,'' said Paul Kedrosky, a senior fellow at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation who recently called for the venture industry to contract by half. ''It's a returns-driven business, and the only way you can post better returns is by shrinking.'' 
 Instead of figuring out how much start-ups actually need, too many firms calculate how much they have in their funds, divide it by the number of partners and the number of boards they can sit on, and come up with a sum to invest in each start-up, said Ben Horowitz, a partner in a new venture firm, Andreessen Horowitz. That often means forcing $3 million into a company that needs $300,000, he said. 
 Overfinancing results in too many firms backing too many start-ups that do the same thing, some critics say, and it inflates the valuation of companies so that investors get smaller returns when they eventually sell. 
 The good news is that Web start-ups do not need as much money today, said Dana Settle, a partner at Greycroft Partners. ''You can actually make a nice venture return if you sell them for less than $100 million, you just have to go in at the right price,'' she said. 
 Greycroft has a $75 million fund, invests $500,000 to $3 million in each start-up and does not always demand a board seat. Neither does Andreessen Horowitz, which will invest as little as $50,000 in a start-up from its $300 million fund. 
 ''That is a much better model than putting a bunch of money in upfront,'' said Marc Andreessen, Mr. Horowitz's partner. 
 Mr. Andreessen and Mr. Horowitz also attribute the venture industry's struggles in part to the business school graduates who now populate Sand Hill Road offices, taking the place of the entrepreneurs who first formed venture firms. (Mr. Andreessen is a founder of Netscape, and he and Mr. Horowitz founded Opsware, a software company bought by Hewlett-Packard.) 
 When too many venture capitalists serve on a start-up's board with ''no proper judgment, who have never built a company,'' they tend to get too involved in running the company and, in high-pressure situations, imagine problems that do not exist, Mr. Horowitz said. ''Their insecurity and own anxiety filters into the advice,'' he said. 
 Franklin Pitcher Johnson, a veteran venture capitalist known as Pitch who founded Asset Management Company in 1965, agrees. He had this advice for would-be venture capitalists at a recent conference: ''Get a real job in an operating company, because what we back is operating companies -- until you understand that, you can't be much of a venture capitalist.'' 
 Still others blame the fact that money flows to firms with the biggest past successes, even though the venture field can be an industry of one-hit wonders. 
 ''The people who were venture gods in the 1990s are 10 years older than they were,'' said Judith Elsea, co-founder and managing director of Weathergage Capital, which invests in venture funds. Experience is an advantage in any industry, but venture might be different, Ms. Elsea said, because ''technology is so dynamic.'' 
 Despite all the calls for a return to the old-school model of venture capital, some new technologies, like those in clean energy, require huge amounts of money, so some firms will need to remain large. 
 And certain investors dispute that too much money is the problem. Timothy Draper, founder of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, thinks there should be more venture capitalists, not fewer. ''I don't think we have enough venture capitalists to spread the wealth to the seven billion creative minds out there,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Too Precious for a Recession

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
In a different economy, Billy Mitchell and Nicole Drucker of San Francisco might have splurged on a $10,000 engagement ring. But Ms. Drucker is out of work and they need to save for a house. So in April, Mr. Mitchell got down on one knee on the Golden Gate Bridge and proposed with a $4,000 diamond ring he had bought on the Internet.
 ''We had to decide, where do we want the money?'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''On her finger?'' 
 In this economy, many consumers would rather keep their money in their wallets than on their fingers, necks or ears. As people re-examine their budgets, jewelry is turning out to be one of the easiest places to cut back -- or trade down. 
 ''The half-carat is the new three-carat,'' explained Hayley Corwick, who writes under the pseudonym Lila Delilah for Madison Avenue Spy, a blog about designer sales. 
 Yet the understandable penny-pinching by consumers is putting a painful squeeze on the jewelry industry. 
 The new frugality has forced diamond mines to curtail production, led to deep discounting at jewelry chains, spurred hundreds of store closings and resulted in job cuts at boutiques and department stores. Because jewelry is expensive inventory that moves slowly even in better economic times, many stores are laden with debt -- even though wholesale global prices of polished diamonds were down 15.4 percent in June compared with a year earlier.
 Experts say that when the shakeout is over, far fewer jewelers will be left standing. About 20 percent more American jewelers will go out of business this year than did last year, according to Kenneth Gassman, president of the Jewelry Industry Research Institute, an independent research practice. 
 The jewelry chains that have filed for bankruptcy in the last year or so include Fortunoff, Whitehall Jewelers, Friedman's, Christian Bernard and Ultra Stores (which operated jewelry departments inside Filene's Basement and other chains). 
 Still in business but posting losses, meanwhile, are big jewelry chains, both high end and low -- from Harry Winston and Bulgari to Zales and Claire's Stores. 
 And while the venerable Tiffany & Company is still making money, sales have dropped 34 percent at its stores in this country that have been open at least a year.
 Major mass-market retailers including Wal-Mart, J. C. Penney, BJ's Wholesale Club and Costco have cited jewelry as one of their worst-performing categories this year. Even online jewelry and watch sales are down, declining 7 percent in the first quarter, according to the Web analysis firm comScore. 
 ''You're seeing the traffic fall off a cliff at all price points,'' said Stacey Widlitz, a retailing analyst with Pali Research. 
 Of the consumers still buying jewelry, many are trading down. Blue Nile, the giant online jeweler, said some people were opting for less costly engagement rings made of semiprecious stones instead of diamonds. 
 And yet, sales of diamond rings and wedding bands seem to be holding up better than for other kinds of jewelry. Retailers and analysts say a decent engagement ring is still seen as a necessity for men hoping to get a yes to a marriage proposal. 
 Even Mr. Mitchell, of San Francisco, who knew the outcome because his fiancee had collaborated in the planning, considered the ring to be ''hugely'' important. And he spent hours learning about diamonds on BlueNile.com. But ''we knew that we only wanted to spend so much,'' he said, ''and this Web site really enabled you to get the best diamond for the dollar.'' 
 Many consumers still intent on expanding their jewelry collections are now doing so with costume and vintage pieces instead of new, fine jewelry.
 Megan Wishnow of Long Island City, Queens, trolls eBay for pieces. ''It's become a little bit gauche in a way to walk around, to flaunt, whether you have it or not,'' said Ms. Wishnow, who sells vintage clothes on the Web after years of working in public relations for high-end fashion brands like Gucci. ''I think women are definitely more conscious of how they come off. And everyone wants to be respectful of what's going on, especially in New York City.'' 
 Instead of buying jewels, some people are even renting them by the week or month for glamorous events or for gallivanting around town, as one might do in a leased Mercedes. At Avelle, an online rental site for swanky goods, more and more consumers are signing up to rent jewelry by the likes of Chanel and Louis Vuitton, resulting in double-digit year-over-year growth in jewelry rentals, according to the company's senior vice president of product management, Dana Palzkill. 
 Some bargain hunters have taken to haggling -- even at Tiffany. After all, consumers are loath to overpay in a down market. 
 ''I think everyone feels compelled to ask the question for fear of being, feeling foolish after the fact,'' Michael J. Kowalski, chairman and chief executive of Tiffany, said last month at a Thomson Reuters luxury and retail industry conference in New York. 
 Tiffany has lowered prices on diamond engagement rings, a core part of its business, by about 10 percent since the holiday season. 
 ''We're not going to discount or run short-term sales,'' Mark L. Aaron, vice president for investor relations at Tiffany, said in a telephone interview. ''We're simply going to take a little bit less gross margin in the engagement category. It was our gesture to a young couple. We just made it a little bit more affordable.''
 Tiffany hopes it is laying the groundwork for a lifelong relationship with the newly betrothed. 
 Not surprisingly, the more expensive the jewelry, the greater the sales declines in the last year. In Tiffany's most recent reporting period, sales of jewelry above $50,000 were softest. 
 Even selling midpriced jewelry has been brutal for chains because the market is awash in marked-down goods from so many liquidation sales. ''This is forcing luxury players to make one of two decisions,'' said Ms. Widlitz of Pali Research. ''You either chase the consumer downstream or you stay the course. Tiffany is staying the course.''
 As a result, Tiffany is among the jewelers expected to gain market share amid the industry shakeout. 
 ''Tiffany has the balance sheet to really withstand a prolonged period of weakened demand,'' said Bob Drbul, a retailing analyst with Barclays Capital who tracks the company. The company's stock price peaked around $56 in autumn 2007 and fell to about $17 this March before rebounding. The shares closed Monday at $24.70, up 41 cents. 
 To weather the recession, many chains are slowing new store growth and making cuts to capital expenditures, inventory and their advertising budgets. Harry Winston, Tiffany, Zales and De Beers have collectively cut hundreds of jobs. 
 In February, Finlay Enterprises -- a major operator of licensed fine jewelry counters in department stores like Macy's, Dillard's and Lord & Taylor -- said it would exit the department store business and close about 40 of its approximately 100 specialty jewelry stores, which include Bailey, Banks & Biddle. 
 For the retailers the good news, relatively speaking, is that the chains say the rate of deceleration has slowed in the last three months. No one is declaring a recovery, or even that the market has reached a bottom. But Tiffany, which has been selling its signature six-pronged diamond solitaire engagement rings through booms and busts since 1886, is confident the sparkle will return once again. 
 ''We're going through a business cycle,'' said Mr. Aaron of Tiffany. ''There will eventually again be a rising tide of affluence around the world.''

HEADLINE: Built to Win Now, the Mets Face the Future at Their Peril

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Even before the Mets were swept in Philadelphia last weekend, some of their fans were calling on the team's general manager, Omar Minaya, to wave the white flag. They had seen enough inept play, deflating losses and debilitating injuries to call for Minaya to trade the team's older players and stars for young prospects and try to field a more competitive team next season.
 ''Throw in the towel and break up the Mets,'' went one entry on The New York Times's Bats blog from a writer named Ceadan. The writer added: ''A midseason fire sale is needed. The Mets need to 'weed and seed' and hope for the best with a revamped 2010 lineup.'' 
 The Mets are in third place, four and a half games behind the front-running Philadelphia Phillies, and they are certainly aware of the bind they are in. Minaya could trade some of the team's few prospects for a midlevel player like Aubrey Huff, the Orioles' first baseman. But that may not be enough to keep the Mets in contention, and it could hobble them in years to come when they try to replace their aging players.
 Yet trading away stars, or even productive veterans, for prospects with no guarantee that they will perform as hoped could cause a more destructive chain of events. Sales of season tickets, luxury suites, concessions, parking and merchandise may decline. Advertising in the ballpark and on SNY, the team's regional cable network, may slip, too.
 That is why people who follow the business of baseball say that the Mets are unlikely to make wholesale changes to their roster during the season, as some fans hope.
 ''It would really impact their business model,'' said Vince Gennaro, the author of ''Diamond Dollars: The Economics of Winning in Baseball'' who is a consultant to the Cleveland Indians and other teams. ''It's not just the perception of the lack of demand for tickets, but also the core problem of 10,000 empty seats that would cost them a fortune in lost revenue. SNY's ratings would tank, too.''
 Teams in New York, where fans expect winners year after year, have been brutalized when they overhauled their clubs. Shea Stadium turned into a ghost town for seven years after the Mets traded Tom Seaver and Dave Kingman in 1977. When the Knicks finished in last place two seasons ago, there were thousands of empty seats at Madison Square Garden and chants of ''Fire Isiah,'' referring to Isiah Thomas, then the team's president.
 The situation is different now for the Mets because they play in a new $800 million ballpark, not Shea Stadium, which was owned by the city. Like other new ballparks, the financing for the 41,800-seat Citi Field was based on the assumption that the team would have a steady stream of customers for its luxury boxes and premium seats, some of which cost $500 a game.
 If Minaya and the Mets organization signal to fans that 2009 is a lost cause and that 2010 may be, too, ticket sales for the remaining home games will suffer. Fans with tickets, already struggling to resell them at face value because of the team's poor play, will be stuck with even bigger losses.
 At the same time, representatives from the Mets' ticket office would have a harder time trying to market season-ticket plans and suite rentals for 2010. When the team is in contention, fans feel more compelled to renew their ticket plans.
 But if they see that the team is being dismantled and sinking in the standings, they may opt for a cheaper plan or none at all. Companies, particularly smaller ones with limited entertainment budgets, may drop their seats or suites.
 ''It just shows that when the dollars are that high, patience isn't high on the list,'' said Dan Migala, the director of the graduate school of sports business at Northwestern University. ''You expect great things and great returns, whether you're a fan spending a lot on tickets or owners spending a lot on players.''
 The Mets, of course, expect great things from their team. Executives at the club say that the team is a very good one that has been hit with a string of unfortunate injuries. When players like Jose Reyes, Carlos Beltran and Carlos Delgado return as expected after the All-Star break, the team should rebound. 
 ''Any talk of overhauling the team is grossly exaggerated at this point,'' said Dave Howard, the Mets' vice president for operations. 
 Howard added that the team's finances were strong and would remain so once the economy rebounded.
 To be sure, the bonds issued to pay for Citi Field are backed partly by revenue from luxury suites and premium seats. Because the companies and individuals who buy them sign multiyear contracts, the Mets are in no imminent danger of failing to meet their obligations to bondholders.
 But if the team goes into a swoon that lasts several years, the situation could change, said Kurt Krummenacker, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, which rates the bonds issued to pay for the stadium at Baa3, the lowest investment grade.
 ''We only have one year of revenue to work off of, and that's benefited from the bump of the new stadium and the new-car feel,'' he said. ''But what happens next year is an open question.''

HEADLINE: Midlevel Exception Becoming a Norm

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
The biggest winner in N.B.A. free agency so far is an undersize shooting guard who has never made an All-Star team or played in the conference finals and has spent half of his career as a reserve.
 The runner-up is a 6-foot-10 small forward who has never averaged 20 points or 6 rebounds and did not become a household name until this spring, in his ninth season. 
 Meanwhile, Jason Kidd, whose Hall of Fame bust is already half-formed, just took a $13 million pay cut and will make less than Ben Gordon (the undersize shooting guard) or Hedo Turkoglu (the nearly anonymous small forward).
 It is early yet, but the 2009 off-season may be remembered as the year when the richest teams got richer, the richest players got squeezed and the middle class got crowded.
 Or it may simply be remembered as the weirdest N.B.A. summer in recent history.
 Since free agency opened Wednesday, eight noteworthy players have come to terms. Befitting the nation's economic climate, most of them took pay cuts.
 Kidd, who made $21.4 million in Dallas last season, will re-sign for about $25 million over three years. Rasheed Wallace, a four-time All-Star who made $13.7 million last season, is joining the Boston Celtics for a two-year, $11 million deal.
 Kidd is 36 and Wallace 34, which was surely a factor. But in more flush times, their star power would have offset the age concerns. They were still in high demand last week.
 In better times, Ron Artest surely would have joined the double-digit millionaire club. He is 29, healthy and in his prime, and is one of the best two-way players in the N.B.A. But Artest will make about $5.6 million with the Los Angeles Lakers next season, after earning a below-market $7.4 million with Houston.
 More jarring pay cuts are on the way. Allen Iverson and Stephon Marbury, two tarnished former stars, have drawn scant interest and may have to settle for the veteran's minimum, $1.3 million. They each made $20.8 million last season, ranking them sixth in the league.
 Shawn Marion, whose $17.8 million salary ranked 13th, may make one-third that amount next season. Toronto has to renounce Marion's rights in order to make room to sign Turkoglu to a five-year, $53 million deal.
 So Marion, a four-time All-Star, will probably settle for the midlevel exception, about $5.6 million -- the same amount that Marcin Gortat, an unaccomplished backup center, will receive from the Mavericks.
 No one can remember a summer like this. In the past, even declining stars could find a huge payday. And a rising talent like Trevor Ariza -- whose role grew in the Lakers' championship drive -- would have easily cashed in for $50 million. Ariza will be signing with Houston for the midlevel exception, earning about $33 million over five years.
 Several young stars are still waiting for big offers that may never come. That group includes the Knicks' David Lee, Utah's Paul Millsap, Atlanta's Marvin Williams and Milwaukee's Ramon Sessions. Some of them had figured to make $8 million to $10 million a season. Few teams have the cap space to make that sort of offer, leaving the players with no leverage.
 Several established stars are also still waiting for deals, including the Lakers' Lamar Odom, Atlanta's Mike Bibby and Philadelphia's Andre Miller.
 The recession and a projected drop in the salary cap have made owners more conservative. Also, about a dozen teams are saving cap space for 2010, in order to chase LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and several other stars.
 So players from every point on the talent spectrum are signing for the midlevel exception, the equivalent of the average player salary. That, in turn, has allowed the rich teams to get richer.
 Because elite teams are usually over the salary cap, they rarely get the chance to sign marquee free agents. But already, the Lakers have added Artest and the Celtics -- the 2008 champions -- have added Wallace, for bargain prices.
 ''Everyone's getting squished to the midlevel, so now the top-level teams can play a little easier,'' a Western Conference general manager said.
 Cost-cutting was also behind the trades of Vince Carter (to Orlando), Richard Jefferson (to San Antonio) and Shaquille O'Neal (to Cleveland). In every case, an elite team acquired a frontline player without giving up much.
 A few teams have been willing to spend. Detroit came to terms with Gordon (five years, about $55 million) and Charlie Villanueva (five years, $40 million). Portland is still trying to spend its $9 million in cap space after being spurned by Turkoglu.
 There is still the possibility for more weirdness. Consider Iverson's plight.
 He is one of the most dazzling players of his era and a 10-time All-Star. He can still fill baskets and arena seats, even at 34. Last week, he was reportedly soliciting an offer from the Memphis Grizzlies, a dysfunctional franchise with no winning tradition and little talent.
 The Grizzlies cannot offer Iverson the chance to win a title, or even a playoff series. They can, however, offer about $9 million in cap space.

HEADLINE: A Doctor by Choice, a Businessman by Necessity

BYLINE: By SANDEEP JAUHAR, M.D.. 
Sandeep Jauhar is a cardiologist on Long Island and the author of the recent memoir ''Intern: A Doctor's Initiation.''

 BODY:
To meet the expenses of my growing family, I recently started moonlighting at a private medical practice in Queens. On Saturday mornings, I drive past Chinese takeout places and storefronts advertising cheap divorces to a white-shingled office building in a middle-class neighborhood. 
 I often reflect on how different this job is from my regular one, at an academic medical center on Long Island. For it forces me, again and again, to think about how much money my practice is generating. 
 A patient comes in with chest pains. It is hard not to order a heart-stress test when the nuclear camera is in the next room. Palpitations? Get a Holter monitor -- and throw in an echocardiogram for good measure. It is not easy to ignore reimbursement when prescribing tests, especially in a practice where nearly half the revenue goes to paying overhead.
 Few people believed the recent pledge by leaders of the hospital, insurance and drug and device industries to cut billions of dollars in wasteful spending. We've heard it before. Without fundamental changes in health financing, this promise, like the ones before it, will be impossible to fulfill. What one person calls waste, another calls income. 
 It is doubtful that doctors and other medical professionals would voluntarily cut their own income (even if some of it is generated by profligate spending). Most doctors I know say they are not paid enough. Their practices are like cars on a hill with the parking brake on. Looking on, you don't realize how much force is being applied just to maintain stasis.
 I recently spoke with a friend who dropped out of medical school 20 years ago to pursue investment banking. Whenever we meet, he finds a way to congratulate me on what he considers my professional calling. He often wonders whether he should have stuck with medicine. Like many expatriates, he has idealistic notions of the world he left.
 At our most recent meeting, we talked about the tumult on Wall Street. Like many bankers, he was worried about the future. ''It is a good time to be a doctor,'' he said yet again, as I recall. ''I'd love a job where I didn't have to constantly think about money.''
 I didn't bother to disillusion him, but the reality is that most doctors today, whether in academic or private practice, constantly have to think about money. Last January, Dr. Pamela Hartzband and Dr. Jerome Groopman, physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine that ''price tags are being applied to every aspect of a doctor's day, creating an acute awareness of costs and reimbursement.'' And they added, ''Today's medical students are being inducted into a culture in which their profession is seen increasingly in financial terms.''
 The rising commercialism, driven in part by increasing expenses and decreasing reimbursement, has obvious consequences for the public: ballooning costs, fraying of the traditional doctor-patient relationship. What is not so obvious is the harmful effects on doctors themselves. We were trained to think like caregivers, not businesspeople. The constant intrusion of the marketplace is creating serious and deepening anxiety in the profession.
 Not long ago, a cardiology fellow who had been interviewing for jobs came to my office, clearly disillusioned. ''I was naive,'' he said. ''I never thought of medicine as a business. I thought we were in it to take care of patients. But I guess it is.'' 
 I asked him how he felt about going into private practice. ''I'll be too busy vomiting for the first six months -- I won't have much time to think about it,'' he replied.
 Of course, there has always been a profit motive in medicine. Doctors who own their own imaging machines order more imaging tests; to take an example from my moonlighting work, a doctor who owns a scanner is seven times as likely as other doctors to refer a patient for a scan. In regions where there are more doctors, there is more per capita use of doctors' services and testing. Supply often dictates demand. 
 But financial considerations have never been as prominent as they are today, probably because so many hospitals and doctors, especially in large metropolitan areas, are in financial trouble. More and more doctors are trying to sell their practices, or are negotiating with hospitals for jobs, equipment or financial aid. 
 At hospitals, uncompensated care is increasing as patients suffering from the economic downturn lose health insurance. Admissions and elective procedures -- big moneymakers -- are declining. Hospitals are cutting administrative costs, staff and services.
 ''More and more you'll see people in medicine get M.B.A.'s,'' a doctor told me at a seminar, in a prediction borne out in my experience. ''We are in a total crisis, and I don't know the answer.''
 I must admit that part of me wants to see doctors master the business side of our profession. When I hear about executives at health companies getting tens of millions of dollars in bonuses, I am nauseated by the blatant profiteering. As a loyal member of my guild, I want to see doctors exert more control over our financial house.
 And yet the consequences of this commercial consciousness are troubling. Among my colleagues I sense an emotional emptiness created by the relentless consideration of money. Most doctors went into medicine for intellectual stimulation or the desire to develop relationships with patients, not to maximize income. There is a palpable sense of grieving. We strove for so long, made so many sacrifices, and for what? In the end, for many, the job has become only that -- a job.
 Until I went into practice, I never had an interest in the business side of medicine. I sometimes yearn to be a resident or fellow again, discussing the intricacies of a case rather than worrying about the bottom line. ''You need to learn a little of the private-practice mind-set,'' a doctor friend recently advised me. ''You can't survive with your head in the clouds.''
 But something fundamental is lost when doctors start thinking of medicine as a business. In their essay, Dr. Hartzband and Dr. Groopman talk about the erosion of collegiality, cooperation and teamwork when a marketplace environment takes hold in the hospital. ''The balance has tipped toward market exchanges at the expense of medicine's communal or social dimension,'' they write.
 How this battle plays out will determine to a great extent what medicine will look like in 20 years. This is about much more than dollars and cents. It is a battle for the soul of medicine.

HEADLINE: Health Co-op Offers Model For Overhaul

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
As Dr. Harry J. Shriver III examined 70-year-old Eleanor L. Riley one recent morning, he seemed in no hurry. He asked about her phlebitis and her gall bladder, and whether her gout was acting up. They discussed her blood pressure readings and whether she was getting any exercise.
 ''I surprise my patients by asking, 'Is there anything else you want to talk about today?' '' said Dr. Shriver, chief of a clinic near Seattle run by Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound. ''They've never heard a doctor say that.''
 Dr. Shriver has the time because Group Health, one of the country's few surviving health insurance cooperatives, has recently embraced electronic medical records and a collaborative model of primary care, allowing him to practice proactive medicine for the first time in years. 
 On Capitol Hill, those innovations have made Group Health a prototype for a political compromise that could unclog health care negotiations in the Senate and lead to a bipartisan deal. After a month of brainstorming, including briefings from Group Health executives, the Senate Finance Committee seems poised to propose private-sector insurance cooperatives -- instead of a new government health plan -- as its primary mechanism for stoking competition and slowing the growth of medical costs.
 But state officials say Group Health's impact on holding down costs has been mixed. And its successes may have less to do with its governance -- by a board that is elected by patients -- than with its ownership of a vast network of clinics and specialty care centers.
 Above all, Group Health's physicians are paid a salary and can earn bonuses of up to 20 percent for high-quality performance. Unlike most doctors, who are paid by the visit or procedure, they have little incentive to churn patients through and order unnecessary tests and operations. 
 At Group Health, doctors are rewarded for consulting by telephone and secure e-mail, which allows for longer appointments. Patients are assigned a team of primary care practitioners who are responsible for their well-being. Medical practices, and insurance coverage decisions, are driven by the company's own research into which drugs and procedures are most effective.
 As Congress and the White House debate a national health care overhaul, many in Washington agree that one reason health premiums have grown at four times the rate of inflation this decade is a dearth of competition. In 40 of 42 states studied by the American Medical Association last year, the two largest health insurers claimed at least half of all enrollment.
 The question is how best to invigorate the system. Republicans and some moderate Democrats are concerned that competition from a government-run insurance plan would eventually drive private companies out of business and leave government as the sole insurer. 
 If the bill now being finalized by the Finance Committee includes cooperatives, it could set up a confrontation with the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which has written legislation to create a government plan along the lines of Medicare.
 House Democrats also prefer a public plan, as does President Obama. But Mr. Obama has signaled that he might settle for cooperatives if it would gain Republican support for the broader legislation.
 There is much about the Group Health model that Congress and the White House would like to replicate. Whether that requires a cooperative structure is open to debate. 
 A number of company officials acknowledged that it is Group Health's ability to directly manage its doctors that really drives innovation. The cooperative structure's primary contribution, they said, is to create a consumerist ethos that keeps the company focused on patient care. 
 ''There's a kind of accountability to the patients in our system,'' said Scott Armstrong, president of Group Health. ''And when you bring the principles of a cooperative to bear, patients feel responsibility for holding the system together and for their own health.'' 
 But Carolyn A. Watts, a health economist at the University of Washington, said the cooperative structure made little difference. ''In the end, it's not about who owns the place,'' she said. ''It's about the incentives.''
 Technically, Group Health Cooperative was misnamed when it was founded by trade unionists and Grange members in 1947. Structured as a not-for-profit corporation, its revenues ($2.6 billion last year) are reinvested rather than distributed among members. But it is governed like a cooperative -- and calls itself one -- because its board consists of and is elected by members. 
 With 550,000 enrollees in Washington, Group Health is the smallest of three major insurers in the state, with a 9 percent market share. It often does raise premiums by less than its competitors, but that does not mean the increases have been insignificant. Annual increases for individual policies have averaged 12.3 percent since 2000, peaking at 24.2 percent in 2003. 
 Mike Kreidler, formerly a Group Health optometrist and now Washington's insurance commissioner, said governance by consumers had sometimes translated into generous benefits. ''They haven't had the dramatic impact on cost in this market that you might have anticipated,'' he said.
 Group Health is a rare survivor among the hundreds of rural health insurance cooperatives that formed in the 1930s and 1940s in the face of fierce resistance from organized medicine. But there is a feeling in Seattle that it has endured only by becoming more like its competitors.
 In the 1980s, it ended the practice of charging all enrollees the same premiums, regardless of their health status, and it has since introduced deductibles, co-payments and out-of-network benefits. Only seven-tenths of 1 percent of enrollees voted in the last board election.
 Senator Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat who first proposed cooperatives as a compromise last month, said the Finance Committee was debating how a national network might be structured and how much seed money would be needed for state and regional branches. Mr. Conrad has said it would take up to $4 billion, while others have projected $10 billion. 
 Mr. Conrad estimates that cooperatives would need at least half a million members, about the size of Group Health in its 62nd year, to wield meaningful leverage. That scale will be possible, he said, if the Democrats succeed in bringing tens of millions of the uninsured into the market by mandating coverage and subsidizing premiums. 
 But supporters of a public plan argue that it will be a challenge to form pools that large any time soon. They predict that cooperatives will become dumping grounds for the sickest patients, and that they will have difficulty forming networks of physicians.
 ''The idea that these things will spontaneously erupt all over the country is just completely a dream,'' said Timothy S. Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University.

HEADLINE: Summer Brings a Wave of Homeless Families

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
As the school year sailed to a close last month, Arielle Figueras crossed the stage in her cap and gown and proudly accepted her fifth-grade diploma. 
 The next day, she was homeless.
Arielle, a petite 11-year-old, and her parents, brother and sister packed their belongings and arrived at the intake center for homeless families in the South Bronx. Though they had been fighting with their landlord for months and their gas and electricity had long been shut off, they refused to leave their apartment while school was in session.
 ''She was graduating, so we had to wait,'' Arielle's mother, Marilyn Maldonado, said. ''We just didn't want to disrupt their routines. We couldn't do that to them.'' 
 Many New Yorkers view summer as a time for vacations, camp and lazy days at the beach. But city officials have been preparing for quite a different summer ritual: the swelling of the population of homeless families. 
 They call it the summer surge, and say that this year could be the worst yet. 
 Because the homeless population this spring was up more than 20 percent over last spring, possibly because of higher unemployment, officials are girding for an all-time high in the number of families in shelters at once, expecting close to 10,000. Already, the number has reached 9,420. 
 Other cities are noticing a similar trend. In Toledo, Ohio, one overcrowded shelter has been turning away dozens of people each night. In Charlotte, N.C., a shelter that is typically open only in winter has stayed open for the summer to meet demand, which is 20 percent higher than last summer. Across town, a Salvation Army shelter is so full, it has set up mats on the floors.
 The reasons are varied but simple. Landlords who are reluctant to evict during winter are less hesitant when it is warmer. Parents like the Maldonados, who have endured poor housing conditions to spare their children agitation and humiliation at school, finally pack up and leave. And relatives who have taken in families in cramped apartments lose patience when children are suddenly underfoot all day long.
 ''When school's open, families tend to stay where they are,'' said Deronda Metz, the director of social services for the Salvation Army in Charlotte. ''And when school's out, they're told it's time to go.''
 In New York, the number of homeless families applying for shelter in the summer has been 28 percent higher than the rest of the year the last three years. Their first stop is the intake center, a 24-hour, sprawling 66,000-square-foot brick building in the Bronx. They must walk through metal detectors, must submit to questioning from social workers and, after hours of waiting for their names to be called, are bused to a temporary hotel room or apartment. 
 Workers have begun to make room for the hundreds of extra families that are expected at the center this summer. On the second floor, all of the cubicles in one room were dismantled, replaced by rows of plastic chairs to make a waiting room for up to 114 people. Rows of boxy light gray metal lockers -- each large enough to hold several suitcases -- were installed. Employees at the intake center are being limited to one week of vacation during July and August.
 Just a few hours after the public schools let out for summer, families began trickling into the center, their faces tight with stress. One woman walked briskly inside with her young son, who wore a bright blue backpack and held an armful of books. Another woman, who would not give her name, waited outside with her daughter, who had just finished second grade. ''My sister said we couldn't stay with her anymore,'' she said, fanning herself for some relief from the humidity. ''I said once she's done with school, we'd get out.''
 Arielle's father, Douglas Maldonado, said that their landlord had stopped making repairs and had altered the building's electric billing to make the Maldonados pay for other apartments' power, up to $8,000 a month. But they held onto their apartment just long enough for Arielle's graduation and for their son, Sabino Figueras, to graduate from eighth grade the week before.
 The Bloomberg administration has run into trouble before with its handling of the summer influx of homeless families. In 2002, there was a public relations debacle when officials allowed hundreds of parents and children to wait in the intake office each day, more than three times the number that city fire codes allowed. Other families were placed in an empty men's jail in the Bronx that was later discovered to have been contaminated with lead paint.
 This summer, the administration will use a combination of existing homeless shelters that are not quite full and vacant apartment buildings that have been fixed up for homeless families, said Robert V. Hess, the commissioner of homeless services. 
 ''We have a variety of options, so that we can be as nimble as possible,'' Mr. Hess said. ''We keep some reserve.''
 One essential part of the city's plan is to place families in hotels temporarily, some of which are used for both homeless people and paying customers. 
 Mr. Maldonado's family spent its first few nights in a hotel on 145th Street in the Bronx. One of the mattresses in the room, Mr. Maldonado said, was filthy and stained with urine. 
 On June 28, Tarshima Dixon, a mother of four, went to the intake center with her 14-year-old son, Jason. Two more sons, Craig Dixon, 13, and Nahjee Johnson, 8, waited outside with their grandmother and cheerfully bounced a basketball on the sidewalk as Michael Jackson's ''Billie Jean'' played from their minivan's stereo.
 The family was evicted in April, and Ms. Dixon's mother did not have room for all of them. So Ms. Dixon, along with Craig, Nahjee and another son, Gregory, 16, moved into a shelter in Brooklyn soon after. Jason had been living with his father in Camden, N.J., but Ms. Dixon wanted him back with his brothers. They had to come to the intake center to let the city know there would be one more homeless person needing a bed.
 ''He just finished school this week,'' said Ms. Dixon, who added that she was determined that the whole family would move into an apartment by August. ''I wasn't going to bring him here until he was done.''

HEADLINE: Snapshot Of Economy Is Its Best In 9 Months

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A trade group's measure of the health of the services sector in the United States contracted less than expected in June, reaching its highest level in nine months. 
 The Institute for Supply Management's services index was 47 in June, up from 44 in May. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a reading of 45.5 last month.
 Any reading below 50 indicates the services sector is shrinking, and June was the ninth consecutive month of deterioration. But it was the best showing since September, when the index was at 50.
 Service industries like retailers, financial services, transportation and health care make up about 70 percent of the country's economic activity. Any turnaround in the sector requires improved consumer spending.
 The country's restaurants, shops, professional and other service providers have been hurt as consumers save more and spend less amid the longest recession since World War II.
 The government said Americans' savings rate was the highest in more than 15 years in May, while the Conference Board said consumer confidence fell in June as unemployment grew to a 26-year high of 9.5 percent.
 The Institute for Supply Management is a Tempe, Ariz.-based trade group of purchasing executives in 18 industries. Its index is based on a survey of members and covers new orders, employment, inventories and other indicators.
 Business activity, new orders and employment all slid at a sharply slower pace in June than in May, according to the survey. All three hit their highest levels since September, and business activity, at 49.8, is nearly in growth territory.
 Real estate, finance and insurance, and food and hotel companies were among the six industries that reported actual growth last month.
 The 11 sectors that posted declines included agriculture, retail, health care, educational services, and corporate support and management. Utilities were flat.
 However, the prices businesses paid grew for the first time since October. Many commodities, including oil, have had prices rise recently. The cost of future oil supplies last week hit their highest level in eight months

HEADLINE: Who Cares About Zelaya?

BYLINE: By ROGER MARIN NEDA. 
Roger Marin Neda is a columnist at the Honduran daily El Heraldo.

DATELINE: Tegucigalpa, Honduras 

 BODY:
 LAST week I asked my friend Julia what she thought about the coup d'etat that deposed our president, Manuel Zelaya. Julia owns a mercadito, an old-fashioned grocery store that she set up in her garage. Like many middle-class housewives here, she started a business to contribute to the shrinking family budget. 
 Not far from Boulevard Morazan, the main avenue near the affluent Colonia Las Lomas, Julia's store is a good place to hear the latest news and gossip. 
 ''Oh, I love the curfew,'' she joked. ''I haven't seen my husband come back home before 10 at night since my honeymoon.'' 
 ''But what do you think about Zelaya?'' I insisted. ''And what about Roberto Micheletti'' -- the president of Congress who is now interim president? She replied: ''Micheletti, Zelaya, what do I care? Things will continue as usual. Nothing will change. All I want is that they let me live in peace to run my business.'' 
 After almost 30 years of formal democracy, Julia, like most Hondurans, has lost all trust in politicians. While we have had basic liberties and precarious growth, our leaders have thoroughly failed to ease this country's poverty and longstanding social divide. For these reasons, many Hondurans are apathetic about politicians -- and politics in general. 
 Of course, over the past few weeks our political reality has been difficult to ignore. This past weekend, thousands of Zelaya supporters clashed with troops defending the airport in Tegucigalpa where Mr. Zelaya, flying in from Washington, tried to land. At least one person is reported to have died. But despite this commotion, life for many Hondurans has continued as usual. Banks, malls, stores, factories, farms, restaurants, taxis, buses, streets -- everything looks normal, at least during the day. By night the country enjoys the peace of a cemetery, thanks to a curfew that now starts at 6:30 p.m.
 Meanwhile, the outside world seems to be shocked and riveted by the ouster of Mr. Zelaya, who is now getting attention usually reserved for an international movie star. So why are we Hondurans so blase? 
 Our weak political memory is a defense mechanism. Too many times we've greeted the inauguration of a new president with optimism, only to eventually feel fooled and frustrated by the political incompetence and corruption that followed. If he is not restored to power, something that seems less and less likely to happen, Mr. Zelaya will probably soon fade from our collective memory, just like so many of his predecessors.
 And Mr. Zelaya, in many ways, is a typical Honduran politician. He began his four-year term in January 2006, and by mid-2008, the idea of a second term was already in the air, even though it is forbidden by the Constitution. Since its independence from Spain in 1821, Honduras has had 16 constitutions, as these documents were vulnerable to leaders' desire to extend their stay in office. The current constitution, which came into effect in 1982 after many years of military rule, was written to forever protect the country against presidents' overstaying their welcome.
 But over the years, the lust for power has proved too strong. The first president under the 1982 Constitution, Roberto Suazo Cordova, sought to eliminate the constitutional prohibition. Most of his successors have also tried, one way or another, to stay in the presidential palace longer than they were constitutionally allowed. 
 But only Mr. Zelaya had the guts to go all the way to plan a referendum, laying the groundwork for an assembly to remake the Constitution to allow him to serve one more term. His larger goal seemed to be a change from our democratic system into a kind of 21st-century socialism. In other words, he wanted to create a Hugo Chavez-type of government. 
 Such plans aroused the fears of this conservative society, whose middle-class members look at Venezuela and ask why we should adopt the ways of a country that does not seem to have progressed very much over the past decade, and where freedom of the press and other liberties have been suppressed. 
 Many abroad are obsessing over the question of whether Mr. Zelaya's ouster was legal, or a classic military coup. But this debate obscures the fact that for many years, Honduras has just been one big crisis waiting to happen.
 The economic reforms of 1990 led to a strong devaluation of our currency and an inflation that decreased real salaries, and important sectors of the middle class were forced into destitution. These dismal economic realities are interwoven with corruption and a system where the profits from drug trafficking are apparently used to finance political parties. 
 Mr. Zelaya's attempt to land in Tegucigalpa on Sunday reaffirms his fearless but unreasonable temperament. Yet even in the chaos were signs of hope: Among thousands of protesters, only a relative few tried to storm the airport's fence and confront the soldiers. This could mean that most Hondurans are looking for a peaceful solution to the crisis.
 Mr. Zelaya may or may not return to serve the remaining months of his term. But for the future of Honduras, does it really even matter? Until a new generation of young, uncontaminated, democratic politicians take control -- and the deep inequalities in our economic system are addressed -- we will not be able to trust our leaders.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths HARRIGAN, ARTHUR W.

 BODY:
HARRIGAN--Arthur W.,former Chief Financial Officer of the Western Electric Company and of International Paper Company, died on June 20, 2009, in Vero Beach, Florida, at the age of 90. Mr. Harrigan graduated from NYU in 1942 while serving in the US Navy, received his MBA from NYU in 1949 and, while employed at Western Electric, earned his PhD in Economics from the Stern School of NYU in 1959. During World War II he first served in Naval Intelligence and, after attending Supply Officers School at Harvard, saw sea duty as an officer on a supply ship carrying landing craft in the Pacific. He recalled the "cheers of the crew when the last B-29 returned from its mission." In 1947 he joined Western Electric, where he served as Comptroller, then Financial VP and, then until 1972 as CFO and a board member. In 1972, he joined International Paper as its CFO and a member of the board. 
After he retired in 1982, he taught business management courses at the Stern School. He married Margaret Marrin in 1941. During most of their married life, Margaret, who earned her Masters Degree in Social Work from Columbia University, worked as a family counselor, and became a highly sought-after speaker on these subjects. They were a very close couple who excelled at combining family life with two careers long before this life pattern became common. They were happily married for fifty-three years until her death in 1994. Mr. Harrigan was an exceptionally thoughtful, kind and generous man who steadfastly maintained these qualities in his business life as well as in his private life. He was liked and admired by his colleagues and loved by his family. He is survived by his daughter, Patricia Nadosy, of New York City, by his son, Arthur W. Harrigan, of Seattle, Washington, their spouses Peter Nadosy and Carol Wilder, and by four grandchildren, Meghan Magyar, Andrea and Lara Nadosy and Aaron Wilder. A Memorial Mass will be celebrated 10:00 a.m., Thursday, July 23, 2009 at Holy Cross Catholic Church, Vero Beach, FL

HEADLINE: For a Wilder Rockies

 BODY:
One of the most ambitious environmental bills in years, the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act, is awaiting action in Congress. It could be waiting a while. A version was first introduced in 1991, and while the bill has become a perennial focus of great hopes and fierce objections, it has never come up for a vote. 
 The bill, sponsored in the House by Representatives Carolyn Maloney of New York and Raul Grijalva of Arizona, would designate more than 20 million acres of federal public land -- mostly in Idaho and Montana, with parts of eastern Washington, eastern Oregon and western Wyoming -- as wilderness, the law's highest protection. That means no roads, no logging, no ski resorts, no off-road vehicles. It would continue to allow certain traditional, nonmotorized uses, like hunting, fishing and rafting. 
 The great strength of the bill lies in the breadth of its vision. Recognizing that animals and plants thrive best within intact ecosystems, not governmental borders, it would reach across state lines to secure biological corridors where animals can roam freely. 
 Yet while the bill has more than 90 co-sponsors, none are from the districts affected. That is not a good sign. Congress traditionally shows great deference to local delegations in deciding whether to set aside land as permanent wilderness. And the bill's conspicuous lack of local lawmakers' support -- and in many cases resistance -- is evidence of the passions it arouses from hunters, fishermen, skiers, snowmobilers. For that reason, many wilderness advocates say, land-preservation deals, particularly in the West, require finely wrought compromises and piecemeal progress.
 But that is no reason for Ms. Maloney or Mr. Grijalva or the bill's co-sponsors to give up on this bill or on the noble idea of preserving large, connected, intact ecosystems. The proposed legislation offers a vision of where a truly enlightened environmental policy could lead, balancing the needs of both nature and local economies. 
 Big ideas often stumble on the ground, where this particular ski trail or that fishing lake is loved and ferociously defended. But horse trading won't save whole ecosystems. The bill's supporters are holding out for a truly wild wilderness bill in the hope that someday politics will catch up with their farsighted idealism.

HEADLINE: Seeking Stimulus, India to Lift Spending and Cut Taxes

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
India's finance minister introduced a budget on Monday aimed at stimulating the economy through increased government spending and tax breaks. But the plan disappointed many foreign investors, especially after the Congress Party's re-election victory in May raised hopes that more market-friendly economic policies might be at hand.
 The new budget was largely silent on foreign investment and the sale of shares in state-owned companies -- areas in which investors had been anticipating significant changes. 
The budget speech usually sets the tone for the Indian government's economic policies for the coming year.
 The stock market, which had rallied in recent weeks on expectations of major financial reforms, tumbled as the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, spoke to Parliament, and it continued falling afterward. The S.& P. CNX Nifty stock index closed down 5.8 percent. The Indian rupee depreciated 1.2 percent, trading at 48.48 against the dollar.
 ''Change will be gradual and incremental; don't expect any radical, dramatic movements,'' said Subir Gokarn, chief economist at Standard & Poor's Asia-Pacific, referring to the Congress Party's likely policies. 
 True to the Congress Party's focus on the common man, Mr. Mukherjee spent most of his 90-minute speech discussing government programs for the poor, like a rural employment program guaranteeing 100 days of work a year to each indigent family. The government will increase spending by 144 percent on that project, to 391 billion rupees ($8.1 billion) this fiscal year.
 Mr. Mukherjee said the government would return India's economic growth rate to 9 percent, but he said it would do so in a ''more inclusive'' manner. He set a goal of cutting in half the percentage of the population that is poor within five years. The government estimates that 27.5 percent of Indians were poor in 2005, the latest year for which data is available. (India classifies people as poor if they consume less than a certain number of calories a day.)
 ''I am sensitive to the great challenge of rising expectations of a young India,'' Mr. Mukherjee said. ''It reflects a population that is restless, yet engaged and is ready to seize the opportunities that it is presented with. There are new and powerful reasons for us to create, facilitate and sustain those opportunities.''
 Over all, government spending will increase 36 percent and the deficit for the 2009-10 fiscal year will reach an estimated 6.8 percent of gross domestic product, up from an estimated 6.2 percent last year. Rating firms had warned that they might reduce India's credit rating to junk status if its deficit rose too much, but they did not make any changes Monday.
 While India has withstood the global economic crisis better than the United States, Europe and export-dependent emerging markets, its economy has slowed from more than 9 percent growth in recent years to 6.7 percent in the year that ended March 31.
 To resume faster growth, economists say the country will need big doses of investment from businesses and the government. The financial crisis has significantly slowed foreign investment, and the government has struggled to improve the country's poor infrastructure because of entrenched corruption, bureaucracy and political meddling. The Planning Commission has said India needs to spend $500 billion by 2012, a target few analysts expect it to meet.
 Mr. Mukherjee said the Congress Party planned to increase infrastructure spending to 9 percent of G.D.P. by 2014. India now spends about 6 percent of its G.D.P. on roads, ports, airports and similar facilities, compared with about 9 percent in China.
 Several executives welcomed the focus on infrastructure and the poor but said the government had to show that it could make good on its promises. ''The delivery has to happen with alacrity,'' said Bharat Wakhlu, resident director for the Tata Group in New Delhi.
 There was more disappointment among multinational companies, foreign investors and overseas universities who were hoping for a relaxation of investment limits in banking, retail, education and other areas.
 Among those limits, foreign retailers who sell just one brand need to find a joint venture partner to sell products in India. Retail chains that sell more than one brand, like Wal-Mart Stores, are limited to setting up wholesale stores in India, which can sell to shopkeepers or restaurants but not directly to consumers. And foreign life insurance companies are restricted to owning 26 percent of Indian life insurance firms.
 The new budget provided ''nothing specific at all'' for foreign investors, said Sanjay Nayar, chief executive of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in India and a former head of Citibank's Indian operation.
 Rather than talk about foreign investment, Mr. Mukherjee noted how well big Indian banks had performed in the current economic crisis thanks to their nationalization 40 years ago by Indira Gandhi, the prime minister at the time.
 ''Her approach continues to be our inspiration,'' said Mr. Mukherjee, who was finance minister for three years under Mrs. Gandhi in the 1980s. (He added that the government would sell minority stakes in nonfinancial state-owned companies, raising a modest $230 million.)
 Suhel Seth, a marketing executive and trustee of the Indian Brand Equity Foundation, a public-private partnership between the government and Indian industries that aims to burnish the country's image abroad, said the speech ''tells every foreign institutional investor that India is back in the 1960s.''
 The government has proposed a range of tax incentives like raising exemptions for the elderly and women; eliminating a fringe-benefits tax that companies pay on employee perks; and lowering taxes on goods and services bought by exporters, construction companies and technology firms.
 Many analysts had hoped that the government would reduce various subsidies for fuel, food, fertilizers and other products. Mr. Mukherjee said the government would move to reduce and overhaul fertilizer subsidies so that the money would go directly to farmers, rather than fertilizer makers.
 ''This may help farmers if implemented properly,'' said Kishore Tiwari, a farmer and advocate in a region where many farmers have committed suicide in recent years because of financial pressures. ''There are a lot of farmer friendly announcements but it is to be seen how they are implemented.''

HEADLINE: To Succeed, New G.M. Must Win Fans Quickly

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
After racing through the bankruptcy process, General Motors needs to move just as fast to win back wary consumers with new and better products.
 G.M. appears poised to exit bankruptcy as soon as Thursday, when it is expected to complete the sale of its best assets to a newly formed company that will be smaller and unencumbered by huge debts and liabilities.
 But G.M. executives do not have the luxury of time to rebuild consumer confidence or reverse the company's steadily shrinking market share. 
 ''This is sink-or-swim time for G.M.,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with IHS Global Insight. ''Now is the time to execute, and there's a short window in which to do it.''
 A federal bankruptcy judge, Robert E. Gerber, paved the way on Sunday for the next phase of the auto giant's reorganization by approving the sale of assets like Chevrolet and Cadillac to a new, privately held G.M. that will be 60 percent owned by the United States government.
 G.M. and the Obama administration are hoping to close the sale by Thursday, when a four-day stay ordered by the judge expires.
 Then the real work begins on rebuilding G.M, which tumbled into bankruptcy on June 1 after decades as the dominant automaker in the American market.
 G.M. executives were unavailable for comment on Monday, but a senior member of President Obama's auto task force said he expected the company to be a ''leaner and meaner'' competitor once bankruptcy was in its rear-view mirror.
 The adviser, Steven Rattner, said the government would not ''micromanage'' G.M., or interfere with decisions made by its chief executive, Fritz Henderson, or its new board, led by the former chairman of AT&T, Edward Whitacre.
 But Mr. Rattner emphasized that G.M. could not continue to lose ground to rivals like Ford and Toyota in its home market.
 ''The share loss has to stop at some point for this company to be truly viable,'' Mr. Rattner said on a conference call with reporters.
 G.M.'s market share in the United States fell just below 20 percent during the first six months of this year -- a far cry from the 50 percent share the company had at its peak in the 1960s.
 Sales will dwindle even further once the company cuts ties with its Saturn division, shuts down its Pontiac brand and sells off its Saab and Hummer units.
 The new core of the company will consist of four brands -- Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick -- and international operations primarily in Asia and South America.
 A pending sale of G.M.'s European operations will leave the company with, at most, a minority stake in that business.
 In addition, Mr. Henderson is expected to move soon to cut G.M.'s executive ranks by a third and to streamline its management structure. 
 Once the financial and organizational restructurings are complete, the pressure will be squarely on Mr. Henderson and his team to breathe new life into G.M.'s vehicle lineup and its marketing efforts.
 ''The restructuring has changed the company's cost structure, and now it has to prove it can sell cars,'' said John Casesa, a veteran automotive consultant.
 That has not been easy for G.M. for some time, particularly with United States auto sales slumping to their lowest levels in more than 25 years.
 Despite its financial troubles, G.M. has had some successful vehicle introductions this year, including a new version of its Equinox sport utility vehicle and the comeback of its iconic Camaro muscle car.
 But G.M. will also be cutting slower-selling models, in addition to closing down Pontiac and other brands. Once that is done, G.M. will be a middle-of-the-pack manufacturer rather than the biggest player in the marketplace.
 Ms. Lindland predicted that G.M.'s U.S. market share would fall to about 17 percent next year, and 16 percent by 2011. That would put it on par with the current shares of Toyota and Ford.
 ''The only way G.M. will be able to pull in new buyers is with home-run products,'' she said. ''And it can't just be one product. They need layers and layers of product.''
 That will be hard to achieve in the short term. The company has some promising cars, like the compact Chevrolet Cruze, coming in 2010. But reinvigorating its overall lineup will take several years.
 Gone are the days when G.M. could flood the market with new models and hope that some percentage of them would capture the public's fancy.
 Now every new product, in the words of Mr. Henderson, has to ''pay the rent.''
 Mr. Henderson, who succeeded Rick Wagoner as chief executive in late March, also has a short time frame to overhaul G.M.'s management and instill a culture that prizes speed and risk-taking.
 The government, Mr. Rattner said, hoped to begin selling off its ownership stake in G.M. to the public by early next year.
 ''We are here to get the government out of the auto business,'' he said.
 For that to happen, G.M. must be an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. That will not occur until the new G.M. begins making inroads with skeptical consumers.
 For now, G.M. remains on life support from the federal government.
 The company received $19.4 billion in federal loans this year before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The government has committed to providing another $30 billion by the end of the year.
 Since its filing, G.M. has received $10 billion to $11 billion -- about a third of the remaining commitment. Mr. Rattner said money was being pumped into the company on a weekly basis, but declined to be more specific.

HEADLINE: Financing Health Care Reform

 BODY:
If health care reform falls apart again in Congress, the most likely cause will be failure to agree on how to subsidize coverage for tens of millions of uninsured Americans. The cost will almost certainly be at least $1 trillion over the next decade and perhaps much more, depending on how generous the reform might be.
 President Obama is right to insist that reform be fully paid for over the next decade lest it drive up the federal deficit and lead to higher interest rates that might deepen the recession. That means either cutting spending or raising additional money. 
 Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has decreed that reform must be financed entirely by savings or revenues within the health care system. He believes that that would force greater efficiencies from a notoriously wasteful enterprise. Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the Democrat who is chairman of the committee, seems inclined to accept that notion to win Republican votes for a filibuster-proof majority.
 Our preference would be to extract savings from the bloated, inefficient health care system -- but also to raise revenues from a wider pool, preferably from well-to-do Americans who could be taxed more for a badly needed reform that would benefit all Americans.
 The first task is to find savings. Some respected analysts suggest that as much as 30 percent of all health care spending in this country -- some $700 billion a year -- may be wasted on tests and treatments that do not improve the health of the recipients. If even half that money could be recaptured, the amount saved would be more than enough to finance health care reforms. 
 Overspending, however, permeates the system and would be devilishly difficult to eliminate in any systematic manner that reaped savings within the decade. Most of the truly ''game-changing'' innovations that could slow the rate of increase in health care costs -- electronic medical records, research comparing the effectiveness of treatments, restructuring the way doctors organize themselves -- will take years to affect costs and quality. 
 Still, it is important to push ahead quickly. Even if the benefits won't show up for two or three decades, it is imperative to slow the rise in costs to a more affordable rate. And some respected analysts believe the big long-term reforms could yield some relatively quick savings.
 Meanwhile, it will be important to get some guaranteed fast savings from the health care industries by cutting and reallocating hundreds of billions of dollars from projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid, as the Obama administration has proposed and Congress is considering. Just to be sure, Congress ought to establish a fail-safe mechanism that could impose additional cuts after a few years if savings are less than projected. 
 Even with all the cuts people are considering, new fees or taxes will almost certainly be necessary. Most health economists believe that the current tax exemption for employer-provided health benefits should be capped or eliminated. They say it is regressive and encourages generous policies that can lead to excessive use of medical care. A cap might make sense and would draw revenues from within the health care system. But surely it would be wise to cast a wider net -- taxing products that are bad for one's health, such as sugared drinks and alcohol, or limiting itemized deductions for wealthy Americans as Mr. Obama has suggested.
 Any talk of new taxes provokes criticism and doubt that the nation can afford to reform the health care system in the midst of a deep recession. But the president is right, as he told a town hall meeting in Virginia recently, that ''the costs of inaction, of not doing anything, are even greater.'' 
 The nation can either make the hard choices needed to reform health care in the next decade or watch during that time as costs continue to soar, millions more people lose their health insurance and individuals and families face rising premiums and greater cost-sharing as employers shift more of the burden or drop their coverage.

PERSON: Robert McNamara 

HEADLINE: Robert McNamara, Architect of Futile War, Dies

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

 BODY:
Robert S. McNamara, the forceful and cerebral defense secretary who helped lead the nation into the maelstrom of Vietnam and spent the rest of his life wrestling with the war's moral consequences, died Monday at his home in Washington. He was 93. 
 His wife, Diana, said Mr. McNamara died in his sleep at 5:30 a.m., adding that he had been in failing health for some time.
 Mr. McNamara was the most influential defense secretary of the 20th century. Serving Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson from 1961 to 1968, he oversaw hundreds of military missions, thousands of nuclear weapons and billions of dollars in military spending and foreign arms sales. He also enlarged the defense secretary's role, handling foreign diplomacy and the dispatch of troops to enforce civil rights in the South.
 ''He's like a jackhammer,'' Johnson said. ''No human being can take what he takes. He drives too hard. He is too perfect.'' 
 As early as April 1964, Senator Wayne Morse, Democrat of Oregon, called Vietnam ''McNamara's War.'' Mr. McNamara did not object. ''I am pleased to be identified with it,'' he said, ''and do whatever I can to win it.'' 
 Half a million American soldiers went to war on his watch. More than 16,000 died; 42,000 more would fall in the seven years to come.
 The war became his personal nightmare. Nothing he did, none of the tools at his command -- the power of American weapons, the forces of technology and logic, or the strength of American soldiers -- could stop the armies of North Vietnam and their South Vietnamese allies, the Vietcong. He concluded well before leaving the Pentagon that the war was futile, but he did not share that insight with the public until late in life. 
 In 1995, he took a stand against his own conduct of the war, confessing in a memoir that it was ''wrong, terribly wrong.'' In return, he faced a firestorm of scorn. 
 ''Mr. McNamara must not escape the lasting moral condemnation of his countrymen,'' The New York Times said in a widely discussed editorial, written by the page's editor at the time, Howell Raines. ''Surely he must in every quiet and prosperous moment hear the ceaseless whispers of those poor boys in the infantry, dying in the tall grass, platoon by platoon, for no purpose. What he took from them cannot be repaid by prime-time apology and stale tears, three decades late.''
 By then he wore the expression of a haunted man. He could be seen in the streets of Washington -- stooped, his shirttail flapping in the wind -- walking to and from his office a few blocks from the White House, wearing frayed running shoes and a thousand-yard stare. 
 He had spent decades thinking through the lessons of the war. The greatest of these was to know one's enemy -- and to ''empathize with him,'' as Mr. McNamara explained in Errol Morris's 2003 documentary, ''The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara.'' 
 ''We must try to put ourselves inside their skin and look at us through their eyes,'' he said. The American failure in Vietnam, he said, was seeing the enemy through the prism of the cold war, as a domino that would topple the nations of Asia if it fell.
 In the film, Mr. McNamara described the American firebombing of Japan's cities in World War II. He had played a supporting role in those attacks, running statistical analysis for Gen. Curtis E. LeMay of the Army's Air Forces. 
 ''We burned to death 100,000 Japanese civilians in Tokyo -- men, women and children,'' Mr. McNamara recalled; some 900,000 Japanese civilians died in all. ''LeMay said, 'If we'd lost the war, we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals.' And I think he's right. He -- and I'd say I -- were behaving as war criminals.''
 ''What makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?'' he asked. He found the question impossible to answer.
 From Detroit to Washington
 The idea of the United States' losing a war seemed impossible when Mr. McNamara came to the Pentagon in January 1961 as the nation's eighth defense secretary. He was 44 and had been named president of the Ford Motor Company only 10 weeks before. He later said, half-seriously, that he could barely tell a nuclear warhead from a station wagon when he arrived in Washington.
 ''Mr. President, it's absurd; I'm not qualified,'' he remembered protesting when asked to serve. He said that Kennedy had replied, ''Look, Bob, I don't think there's any school for presidents, either.''
 Kennedy called him the smartest man he had ever met. Mr. McNamara looked steely-eyed and supremely rational behind his wire-rimmed glasses, his brown hair slicked back precisely and crisply parted on top. Mr. McNamara had risen by his mastery of systems analysis, the business of making sense of large organizations -- taking on a big problem, studying every facet, finding simplicity in the complexity. 
 His first mission was to defuse the myth of the missile gap. Kennedy had argued in his 1960 presidential campaign that the strategic nuclear arsenal of the United States was less powerful than the Soviet Union's, and that the gap was growing. His predecessor as president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, called the missile gap a fiction in his final State of the Union address, on Jan. 12, 1961.
 Mr. McNamara took office nine days later. He recalled that ''my first responsibility as secretary of defense was to determine the degree of the gap and initiate action to close it.'' 
 ''It took us about three weeks to determine, yes, there was a gap,'' he told an oral historian at his alma mater, the University of California, Berkeley. ''But the gap was in our favor. It was a totally erroneous charge that Eisenhower had allowed the Soviets to develop a superior missile force.'' 
 The problem was a lack of accurate intelligence; the estimate of Soviet forces had been a product of politics and guesswork. 
 By year's end, new American spy satellites had determined that the Soviets had as few as 10 launchers from which missiles could be fired at the United States, while the United States could strike with more than 3,200 nuclear weapons.
 At the same time, Mr. McNamara was enmeshed in plans for the Bay of Pigs invasion, in which some 1,500 Cubans, trained and equipped by the Central Intelligence Agency, were badly defeated by Fidel Castro's forces in a bloody battle in April 1961. Mr. McNamara doubted that the C.I.A.'s Cubans could overthrow Mr. Castro, who had taken power in 1959, but he asked few questions beforehand and gave his go-ahead to the plan, which had been conceived under the Eisenhower administration. 
 Kennedy's first order to Mr. McNamara after the invasion of Cuba collapsed was to develop a proposal for overthrowing the Castro government with American military force. Ten days later, he submitted a plan of attack that included 60,000 American troops, excluding naval and air forces. The plan proved impossible to fulfill.
 One lesson of the Bay of Pigs, Mr. McNamara told the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was that ''the government should never start anything unless it could be finished, or the government was willing to face the consequences of failure,'' according to the State Department's official record of American foreign policy, ''The Foreign Relations of the United States.''
 At a White House meeting on Nov. 3, 1961, Kennedy authorized a program designed to undermine the Castro government, code-named Operation Mongoose. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's handwritten notes on the meeting say Mr. McNamara was assigned to survey the situation and help him devise ways ''to stir things up on island with espionage, sabotage, general disorder.'' This operation also failed.
 By 1962, the White House and the Pentagon had devised a new strategy of counterinsurgency to combat what Mr. McNamara called the tactics of ''terror, extortion and assassination'' by communist guerrillas. The call led to the creation of American special forces like the Green Berets and secret paramilitary operations throughout Asia and Latin America.
 ''Counterinsurgency became an almost ridiculous battle cry,'' said Robert Amory, who in 1962 stepped down after nine years as the C.I.A.'s deputy director of intelligence to become the White House budget officer for classified programs. 
 While the United States flailed at Cuba, the Soviet Union decided, in the words of its leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, ''to throw a hedgehog at Uncle Sam's pants.'' It began sending nuclear missiles to Cuba, establishing a direct threat that evened up the balance of power with the United States, which had placed its own missiles near the Soviet border in Turkey.
 At the height of the missile crisis, on Oct. 27, 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that Cuba be invaded within 36 hours. As the secret White House taping system installed by Kennedy recorded his words, Mr. McNamara laid out the prospects for war. 
 ''The military plan is basically invasion,'' he said. ''When we attack Cuba, we are going to have to attack with an all-out attack.'' 
 He continued, ''The Soviet Union may, and, I think, probably will, attack the Turkish missiles.'' The United States would then have to attack Soviet ships or bases in the Black Sea, he said. The chances of an uncontrolled escalation were high.
 ''And I would say that it is damn dangerous,'' he said. ''Now, I'm not sure we can avoid anything like that if we attack Cuba. But I think we should make every effort to avoid it. And one way to avoid it is to defuse the Turkish missiles before we attack Cuba.'' 
 That idea -- a secret deal in which Kennedy offered to withdraw his missiles in Turkey if Khrushchev removed his warheads from Cuba -- resolved the crisis. ''In the end, we lucked out -- it was luck that prevented nuclear war,'' Mr. McNamara said in ''The Fog of War,'' 40 years after the fact.
 Mr. McNamara spent countless hours as secretary of defense trying to fine-tune American plans for nuclear war, turning what had been a hair-trigger, all-or-nothing strategy into a series of more limited options. The underlying principle of nuclear deterrence became known as ''mutual assured destruction'' -- meaning that Washington and Moscow each knew it could destroy the other even if the other struck first.
 In retirement, Mr. McNamara argued that planning for nuclear war was futile. ''Nuclear weapons serve no military purposes whatsoever,'' he wrote. ''They are totally useless -- except only to deter one's opponent from using them.''
 He had come close to that conclusion after the Cuban missile crisis. ''In wars prior to the advent of nuclear weapons, damage was reparable and victory attainable,'' Mr. McNamara said on Dec. 14, 1962, in a speech to NATO foreign ministers in Paris. ''But after a full nuclear exchange such as the Soviet bloc and the NATO alliance are now able to carry out, the fatalities might well exceed 150 million.''
 ''The devastation would be complete and victory a meaningless term,'' he said. 
 Remaking the Pentagon
 ''This place is a jungle, a jungle,'' Mr. McNamara said after a few weeks at his desk at the Pentagon. He sent teams of bright young civilians -- the whiz kids, as they were known -- out across the Pentagon to tame it. 
 They set out to make sense of a cacophony of war strategies, weapons systems and budgets among the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. The office of the secretary of defense had been established in 1947 for precisely that purpose, but the task had defeated everyone who held the job before Mr. McNamara. He applied the tools of systems analysis and succeeded in clearing some swaths through the jungle. But he alienated key members of Congress and military commanders in battles over choosing weapons and closing bases. 
 The Pentagon consumed nearly half the national budget when he took office. He had 3.5 million employees -- including 2.5 million in uniform, a number that increased by a million during his tenure. He said his goal was ''to bring efficiency to a $40 billion enterprise beset by jealousies and political pressures.'' 
 Under Mr. McNamara, the Pentagon's budget increased to $74.9 billion in fiscal 1968, from $48.4 billion in 1962. The 1968 figure is equal to $457 billion in today's dollars. 
 That was largely the cost of the war that erupted in Southeast Asia.
 ''Every quantitative measurement we have shows we are winning this war,'' Mr. McNamara said after returning from his first trip to South Vietnam in April 1962. His statistical analysis showed that the military mission could be wrapped up in three or four years.
 After Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, Mr. McNamara found that Johnson depended on him to win the war, which became a full-fledged conflict for the United States the following year. The new president thought so highly of Mr. McNamara that he asked him to be his running mate in 1964. 
 ''I said no,'' Mr. McNamara recounted in his Berkeley oral history. ''You shouldn't start your elective career running for the vice presidency.'' (Johnson chose Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota.)
 Johnson relied on Mr. McNamara in other sensitive matters, including negotiations over weapons sales to Israel and the full racial integration of the armed services, the reserves and the National Guard after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. When Johnson, early in his presidency, announced he wanted to keep the federal budget below $100 billion, Mr. McNamara ordered weapons programs canceled and military bases closed in a matter of days. 
 But by the fall of 1964, Vietnam was the all-consuming obsession.
 Congress authorized the war after Johnson contended that American warships had been attacked by North Vietnamese patrol boats in the Gulf of Tonkin on Aug. 4, 1964. The attack never happened, as a report declassified by the National Security Agency in 2005 made clear. The American ships had been firing at radar shadows on a dark night. 
 At the time, however, the agency's experts in signals intelligence, or sigint, told Mr. McNamara that the evidence of an attack was iron-clad. ''McNamara had taken over raw sigint and shown the president what they thought was evidence,'' said Ray Cline, then the C.I.A.'s deputy director of intelligence. He added, ''It was just what Johnson was looking for.'' 
 Nor was this the only case of faulty intelligence underlying American military action under Mr. McNamara. In April 1965, Johnson ordered 24,000 American troops to the Dominican Republic after a revolt against the government; it was the first large-scale American landing in Latin America since 1928. 
 In public, Mr. McNamara said the deployment had showed the ''readiness and capabilities of the U.S. defense establishment to support our foreign policy.'' In private, he voiced dismay. The C.I.A. had told the White House and the Pentagon that the rebels were controlled by Cuban revolutionaries. But Mr. McNamara had deep doubts.
 ''You don't think C.I.A. can document it?'' Johnson asked him, according to tapes of White House telephone conversations recorded on April 30, 1965. 
 ''I don't think so, Mr. President,'' McNamara replied. ''I just don't believe the story.''
 Johnson nonetheless insisted in a speech to the American people that he would not allow ''Communist conspirators'' to establish ''another Communist government in the Western Hemisphere.'' This led some newspapers to assert that the president and the Pentagon had a ''credibility gap.'' The phrase stuck when applied to Vietnam. 
 Turning on Vietnam
 In 1965, tens of thousands of American combat troops were arriving in Vietnam and American warplanes were pounding the enemy in a bombing campaign code-named Rolling Thunder, which sent 55,000 flights with 33,000 tons of bombs over North Vietnam; the next year, it was 148,000 flights with 128,000 tons. The number of aircraft lost went from 171 in 1965 to 318 the next year; the costs soared to $1.2 billion, from $460 million. 
 Rolling Thunder never stopped the flow of enemy arms and soldiers into South Vietnam. 
 When Mr. McNamara held a rare private briefing for reporters in Honolulu in February 1966, he no longer possessed the radiant confidence he had always displayed in public. Mr. McNamara said with conviction, ''No amount of bombing can end the war.'' 
 By 1966, Mr. McNamara was planning to build an electronic barrier across the demilitarized zone that separated North and South Vietnam. Soldiers called it the McNamara Line, after the Maginot Line, a futile French defense against Germany built before World War II. The barrier proved to be worthless.
 On Aug. 26, 1966, Mr. McNamara read a book-length C.I.A. study called ''The Vietnamese Communists' Will to Persist,'' which concluded that nothing the United States was doing could defeat the enemy. He called in a C.I.A. analyst, George Allen, who had spent 17 years working on the question of Vietnam.
 ''He wanted to know what I would do if I were sitting in his place,'' Mr. Allen wrote in his 2001 memoir of Vietnam, ''None So Blind.'' ''I decided to respond candidly.''
 ''Stop the buildup of American forces,'' he said he told Mr. McNamara. ''Halt the bombing of the North, and negotiate a cease-fire with Hanoi.'' 
 After that moment of truth, Mr. McNamara told his aides to begin compiling a top-secret history of the war -- later known as the Pentagon Papers -- and he began asking himself what the United States was doing in Vietnam. Many Americans were asking the same, giving rise to a growing antiwar movement that even Mr. McNamara's own son participated in as a student protester at Stanford.
 On Sept. 19, 1966, Mr. McNamara telephoned Johnson. 
 ''I myself am more and more convinced that we ought definitely to plan on termination of bombing in the North,'' Mr. McNamara said, according to White House tapes. 
 He also suggested establishing a ceiling on the number of troops to be sent to Vietnam. ''I don't think we ought to just look ahead to the future and say we're going to go higher and higher and higher and higher -- 600,000; 700,000; whatever it takes.'' 
 The president's only response was an unintelligible grunt.
 Departure and Guilt
 The turning point came on May 19, 1967, when Mr. McNamara sent a long and carefully argued paper to Johnson, urging him to negotiate a peace rather than escalate the war. 
 The war, the paper began, ''is becoming increasingly unpopular as it escalates -- causing more American casualties, more fear of its growing into a wider war, more privation of the domestic sector, and more distress at the amount of suffering being visited on the noncombatants in Vietnam, South and North.''
 ''Most Americans,'' Mr. McNamara continued, ''are convinced that somehow we should not have gotten this deeply in. All want the war ended and expect their president to end it. Successfully. Or else.'' 
 That was the last straw for Johnson, who came to believe that Mr. McNamara was secretly plotting to help Robert Kennedy, then a Democratic senator from New York, run on a peace ticket in the 1968 election. The president announced on Nov. 29, 1967, that Mr. McNamara would give up his defense post to run the World Bank. Mr. McNamara left the Pentagon two months later, never comprehending, in his words, ''whether I quit or was fired.'' It was clearly the latter.
 Mr. McNamara had sought to transform the armed services. But his often aloof and occasionally arrogant conduct left him with few allies inside the Pentagon when the war began to go wrong. At a going-away luncheon given by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Mr. McNamara wept as he spoke of the futility of the air war in Vietnam. Many of his colleagues were appalled as he condemned the bombing, aghast at the weight of his guilt.
 He had thought for a long time that the United States could not win the war. In retirement, he listed reasons: a failure to understand the enemy, a failure to see the limits of high-tech weapons, a failure to tell the truth to the American people and a failure to grasp the nature of the threat of communism.
 ''What went wrong was a basic misunderstanding or misevaluation of the threat to our security represented by the North Vietnamese,'' he said in his Berkeley oral history. ''It led President Eisenhower in 1954 to say that if Vietnam were lost, or if Laos and Vietnam were lost, the dominoes would fall.'' 
 He continued, ''I am certain we exaggerated the threat.''
 ''We didn't know our opposition,'' he said. ''We didn't understand the Chinese; we didn't understand the Vietnamese, particularly the North Vietnamese. So the first lesson is know your opponents. I want to suggest to you that we don't know our potential opponents today.'' 
 An Analytical Mind
 Robert Strange McNamara -- Strange was his mother's maiden name -- was born June 9, 1916, in San Francisco to Robert and Clara Nell McNamara. His father, the son of Irish immigrants, managed a wholesale shoe company. 
 ''My earliest memory is of a city exploding with joy,'' he said in ''The Fog of War.'' It was Nov. 11, 1918 -- the end of World War I. He remembered the tops of the streetcars crowded with people cheering and kissing.
 In 1937, Mr. McNamara graduated with honors in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, where he also studied philosophy. After two years at Harvard Business School, he spent a year with Price, Waterhouse & Company, the accounting firm. He returned to Harvard in 1940 as an assistant professor of business administration. 
 That year, he married his college sweetheart, Margaret Craig. She created Reading Is Fundamental, a literacy program for poor children, while he was at the Pentagon. By the time she died in 1981, the program served three million children.
 Mr. McNamara and his second wife, the former Diana Masieri Byfield, were married in 2004 in San Francisco.
 Besides his wife, Mr. McNamara is survived by his son, Robert Craig, of Winters, Calif.; two daughters, Margaret Elizabeth Pastor and Kathleen McNamara, both of Washington, and six grandchildren.
 When World War II came, Mr. McNamara taught young air officers the statistical methods he had learned at Harvard, with the aim of orchestrating the air war in Europe by determining how many planes could fly each day in every theater. He served in England, then India, and held the rank of lieutenant colonel at war's end in 1945.
 ''After the war, my wife and I both came down with polio, if you can imagine, infantile paralysis,'' Mr. McNamara remembered in his memoir. ''My case was relatively light; I was out of the hospital in a couple of months. But she was in the hospital for nine months, and they thought she'd never lift an arm or a leg off the bed again.''
 Unable to pay the hospital bills on a Harvard salary, he accepted a job offer from the Ford Motor Company.
 He and nine other air-war statisticians, none older than 30, were hired by Henry Ford II to reorganize a mismanaged company.
 ''He wanted some individuals who he could feel were his men, if you will, because the company was staffed with old-line executives who had been associated with his father and grandfather,'' Mr. McNamara recalled. 
 The company lost $85 million in the first eight months after Mr. McNamara's arrival, the equivalent of about $925 million adjusted for inflation today. But Mr. McNamara and his young team turned Ford around. He rose swiftly -- comptroller, general manager of the Ford division, vice president for all car and truck divisions. 
 In November 1960, one day after Kennedy's election, Mr. McNamara was named president of the company, the No. 2 position under Mr. Ford, who was chairman and chief executive. Five weeks later, Kennedy asked him to run the Pentagon. 
 The World Bank Years
 Mr. McNamara's time at the Pentagon came close to breaking his spirit. But he immediately followed that ordeal with 13 years as president of the World Bank. He set out to expand the bank's power and to attack global poverty. He succeeded in part, but with unintended consequences.
 The industrialized nations created the bank at the end of World War II to help rebuild Western Europe, but it later expanded its membership and shifted its focus to lending in the third world to increase economic growth and forestall war. In 1973 Mr. McNamara dedicated himself to the reduction of what he called ''absolute poverty -- utter degradation'' in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
 As he had done at the Pentagon and Ford, Mr. McNamara sought to remake the bank. When he arrived on April 1, 1968, the bank was lending about $1 billion a year. That figure grew until it stood at $12 billion when he left in 1981. By that time the bank oversaw some 1,600 projects valued at $100 billion in 100 nations, including hydroelectric dams, superhighways and steel factories. 
 The ecological effects of these developments, however, had not been taken into account. In some cases, corruption in the governments that the bank sought to help undid its good intentions. Many poor nations, overwhelmed by their debts to the bank, were not able to repay loans. 
 The costs of Mr. McNamara's work thus sometimes outweighed the benefits, and that led to a concerted political attack on the bank itself during the 1980s. 
 Mr. McNamara saw some of these problems as they developed and shifted the emphasis of the bank's lending toward smaller projects -- irrigation, seeds and fertilizer, paving farm-to-market roads. But progress was often hard to measure. At the end of his tenure, the bank estimated that the world's poorest numbered 800 million, an increase of 200 million over the decade.
 Public Contrition
 Mr. McNamara left the bank when he turned 65, after his wife died, and for a time he tried to unwind and get away, taking a 140-mile hike up to the 18,000-foot level of Mount Everest. But within two years, he began to speak out against the nuclear arms race. In 1995, 14 years after leaving public life, he published his denunciation of the Vietnam War and his role in it, ''In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam'' (Times Books/Random House), for which he was denounced in turn.
 Unlike any other secretary of defense, Mr. McNamara struggled in public with the morality of war and the uses of American power.
 ''We are the strongest nation in the world today,'' Mr. McNamara said in ''The Fog of War,'' released at the time of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. ''I do not believe that we should ever apply that economic, political, and military power unilaterally. If we had followed that rule in Vietnam, we wouldn't have been there. None of our allies supported us. Not Japan, not Germany, not Britain or France. If we can't persuade nations with comparable values of the merit of our cause, we'd better re-examine our reasoning.''
 ''War is so complex it's beyond the ability of the human mind to comprehend,'' he concluded. ''Our judgment, our understanding, are not adequate. And we kill people unnecessarily.''

HEADLINE: Memorial In Los Angeles Takes On Air Of Spectacle

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Rebecca Cathcart contributed reporting.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
After winning a random drawing for tickets to the Michael Jackson memorial, fans danced and sang on Monday, and some tried to make a buck, while city officials girded for the throngs expected to show up at the Tuesday event, invited or not.
 As organizers distributed free pairs of tickets on Monday to 8,750 of the more 1.6 million people who had applied online for them, offers of tickets priced from a few hundred to several thousand dollars appeared on Web sites like eBay and Craigslist. Site administrators rushed to remove the postings, saying such sales were not authorized by the Staples Center, the downtown arena that will host the event. Organizers of the memorial said they were confident security measures would limit illegitimate ticket holders. 
 But the efforts at selling tickets, as well as signs of downtown hotels filling and the police preparing for thousands of people, if not more, by ringing a security perimeter around the event, added to a sense that the memorial was taking on shades of spectacle.
 Late Monday night, local television broadcast live images of Jackson family members and others arriving and departing from Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills, a San Fernando Valley cemetery studded with celebrity graves where Mr. Jackson's private service is expected Tuesday morning. A hearse was seen driving from one building to another, backing nearly into it through a large entrance way where men then removed a coffin covered by a dark cloth. 
 The official list of participants in the service for Mr. Jackson, who died suddenly on June 25 at 50 of undetermined causes, included some of the biggest names in music, past and present, including Stevie Wonder, John Mayer, Jennifer Hudson, Smokey Robinson and Usher. More than a dozen television channels, including the big broadcast networks, planned live coverage of the memorial, which is set for 10 a.m. California time on Tuesday.
 Elizabeth Taylor, one of Mr. Jackson's closest friends, sent word through her Twitter feed that she had turned down an offer to speak to avoid what she called ''the public whoopla.''
 Debbie Rowe, a former wife of Mr. Jackson and the mother of two of his three children, changed her mind about attending, saying through a spokeswoman that ''the onslaught of media attention has made it clear her attendance would be an unnecessary distraction.'' Ms. Rowe, who was shown on local television Monday screaming and cursing at photographers trailing her near her home, has not announced whether she will seek custody of the children, whom Mr. Jackson had wanted raised by his mother, or failing that, Diana Ross.
 Mr. Jackson's body will not be at the memorial. There were reports that he would be buried Tuesday before the memorial at a cemetery in the San Fernando Valley. A large squad of police and security officers was at the cemetery, but officials declined to comment.
 Councilwoman Jan Perry, who is the city's acting mayor while Antonio R. Villaraigosa is on vacation this week, said she believed the city was ready for the event, though she had not received any responses to her pleas for private donors to offset the city's costs, which she said were expected to include overtime for the police, transportation and sanitation departments.
 First Assistant Chief Jim McDonnell said a ''substantial'' number of police officers would be deployed to control a crowd he said could include least 100,000 people. ''Some people are coming in from around the world to be part of it,'' Chief McDonnell said. ''They just want to be close to it.''
 The tickets were among the most coveted in a town with no shortage of big entertainment. 
 In the Staples Center, which holds nearly 20,000 people for sporting events, 11,000 seats were reserved for fans, along with 6,500 at an adjacent theater, where the event will be shown on large video screens.
 Donte Zierway, 33, who flew to Los Angeles from Buffalo after entering the online lottery on Saturday, moonwalked with joy upon picking up his two tickets.
 ''I spent $700 to come here,'' said Mr. Zierway, who works for a collections agency. ''I just came. I entered my name, I prayed, and I got on a plane. Then I found out today that I had a ticket.'' 
 He gave one of his tickets to a stranger he met at the Staples Center, Celine Althaus, 27, who had just arrived after a 30-hour flight from Switzerland and did not win a ticket. ''We're friends now,'' Mr. Zierway said. ''We had a few drinks last night. We're both here for the same reason, and we both traveled a distance.''
 Joey Daniel, 22, said he had considered selling his tickets but could not pass up the memorial. ''This is a part of history,'' Mr. Daniel said. ''We could probably sell these for a lot of money, but it wouldn't be worth it. I'm going to tell my children and grandchildren that I was there.''
 Although city services may be taxed, the event could give a bump to the local economy. Just considering hotel bookings, souvenir sales, dining and other spending, an estimated $4 million would be infused into the local economy, said Robin McClain, a spokeswoman for LA Inc., the city's tourism office. Ms. McLain said that some hotels had reported a 40 percent increase in bookings in the past week but that a clearer accounting would be known after the event.
 ''It is important to know,'' she said. ''This is an unprecedented event for L.A.''

HEADLINE: Palin's Fireworks on the Third of July

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Palin Resigning Governor's Job; Future Unclear'' (front page, July 4):
 If it had not been for the wisdom of the electorate and a bit of luck, the inept and rambling Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska could have been our nation's second-in-command to the septuagenarian Senator John McCain and a single heartbeat away from assuming the presidency.
 Arthur L. Yeager Edison, N.J., July 5, 2009 
 To the Editor:
 Sarah Palin's loopy and incoherent explanations for the clearly self-serving decision to quit the governor's job highlight all her flaws as a political figure and even manage to add a new one. We now know that when things get tough, or maybe just boring, Sarah Palin quits.
 Janice Gewirtz Mountain Lakes, N.J., July 4, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Taking Sarah Palin at her word for the moment, she seems to be telling us that she believes she can accomplish nothing in the final year and a half of her term. In other words, she admits that she is incapable of exercising leadership for even one full term as governor of a thinly populated state hitherto more economically advantaged than nearly any other. 
 It will be interesting to see her supporters try to explain how abandoning her duties and shirking her job qualifies her for higher office.
 Mitchell Zimmerman Palo Alto, Calif., July 4, 2009
 To the Editor:
 It is appropriate that Sarah Palin announced her bold decision to resign as governor of Alaska on the Fourth of July weekend. She is one of the few politicians today who still embody the same ideals and characteristics of those brave individuals who gave us this country. 
 Our forefathers chose not to tolerate the unreasonable behavior of the English, and Ms. Palin decided that she and her family could no longer tolerate the unrelenting, vicious attacks of her enemies.
 Her altruistic qualities that appealed to so many obviously worried the liberal Democrats, and they continually harassed this honorable, charismatic woman, even half a year after the election was over.
 Nobody should have to endure such mean-spirited attacks, and those who inflicted them should not be allowed to profit by them.
 Bonnie O'Neil Newport Beach, Calif. July 4, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Palin and Her Enemies'' (column, July 6):
 Ross Douthat shrewdly analyzes the mistake Sarah Palin made in saying yes to John McCain's invitation to join his ticket. But the overall tenor of Mr. Douthat's column strongly suggests that what did her in was elitist classism. 
 I disagree. Her greatest strength on Mr. McCain's ticket was her direct appeal, in her own words, to ''Joe Sixpack.''
 It was not, as Mr. Douthat suggests, her lack of an Ivy League degree that derailed her; it was her own obvious lack of knowledge, and contemptuous attitude toward answering legitimate political questions in depth, coupled with her own exploitation of xenophobic patriotism.
 Linda Charnes Bloomington, Ind., July 6, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Regarding Ross Douthat's column: My dislike of Sarah Palin has nothing to do with her sex or class. It has everything to do with her policies, her anti-intellectualism and her contempt for me.
 Her remarks stating that because my political views are different from hers and suggesting that because I live on the East Coast I'm not a real American are offensive, to say the least. I work hard. I pay my taxes. And the America I believe in is tolerant of our differences.
 If that makes me un-American, so were our founding fathers.
 Kenneth J. Davis Scotch Plains, N.J., July 6, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 Gail Collins and Maureen Dowd can poke fun at Sarah Palin all they want (''Sarah's Straight Talk,'' column, July 4, and ''Now, Sarah's Folly,'' column, July 5), but I begin each day with a silent, heartfelt ''thank you!'' to the soon-to-be former governor of Alaska. 
 If not for her breathtaking ignorance, which she refreshingly coupled with soaring arrogance, and if not for her coldblooded disdain for the lives of wolves, moose and polar bears, Barack Obama might not have won the presidency. 
 America and indeed the world are infinitely indebted to her. Thank you, Sarah Palin, thank you, thank you, thank you.
 Jim Krieger Fort Lee, N.J., July 5, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Gail Collins, commenting on Sarah Palin's rambling resignation, asks: ''People, what is going on with governors in this country? Are we doomed to see them go bonkers one by one, state by state?''
 With the Republican Party in disarray, those who have achieved the office of governor by espousing the rhetoric of social and/or fiscal conservatism without themselves having a core sense of public responsibility are beginning to show the shallowness of their political/philosophical credentials (without the party discipline to ''keep them in line'').
 Perhaps their constituents will now pay more attention to the serious problems we face as a country and choose to vote for perhaps less ideologically driven candidates who can articulate real solutions to our problems.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Is Blamed For Trade Center Delays

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
It appears that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's attempt to usher in an era of reconciliation and compromise at ground zero is over.
 The developer Larry A. Silverstein, who is to build three towers at the World Trade Center site, opened up a new front Monday in his dispute with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, saying the authority has violated the development agreement at ground zero and is hopelessly behind schedule.
 Mr. Silverstein said the authority's delays and failures over the past seven years prevented him from obtaining financing for the three office towers at the trade center site ''in a much more positive economic climate'' than exists today. 
 Mr. Silverstein's latest move seems designed to pressure the authority to acquiesce to his demand that it guarantee as much as $3.2 billion in financing of two of the three office towers he is to build at the site. It also highlights the failure of Mayor Bloomberg's highly publicized effort to resolve the impasse between the two sides. 
 After more than two months of high-level meetings among Mr. Silverstein and city, state and Port Authority officials, Mr. Bloomberg released a statement Monday afternoon acknowledging that the two sides were farther apart than ever, although he blamed it on the Port Authority's intransigence. 
 ''Unfortunately, not everyone worked as hard as necessary to find a solution,'' Mayor Bloomberg said in the statement. ''We are one step closer to stalemate today, but a solution does exist -- and we will not stop working until we get there.''
 But Christopher O. Ward, executive director of the Port Authority, laid the blame on Mr. Silverstein for ''walking away from the negotiating table simply because the public has been unwilling to sacrifice critical transportation projects to subsidize private speculative office space.''
 Mayor Bloomberg held a meeting at Gracie Mansion in May in an attempt to prevent a logjam after the authority and Mr. Silverstein stopped talking. Recriminations, rather than resolution, followed when various proposals failed to satisfy one side or another.
 In a letter to the Port Authority Monday, Mr. Silverstein formally started an arbitration process, claiming that the authority had violated a 2006 agreement governing development at the 16-acre site. 
 Mr. Silverstein is demanding that within the next two weeks, the authority detail how it will fix the problems at ground zero, where, he contends, the authority is years behind in completing the transit hub, a vehicle screening center for buses and trucks, and the underpinning of the subway line that bisects the site. 
 The developer says that he has paid more than $800 million in rent and has started building his first tower, but no longer knows when or if related elements of the project will be completed.
 If the two sides fail to come to terms, the matter would then go to a panel of three arbitrators and Mr. Silverstein would seek damages. 
 The authority is already paying Mr. Silverstein $300,000 a day in penalties -- more than $100 million since July 2008 -- for failing to complete the predevelopment work on two of Mr. Silverstein's three sites. Executives at the authority say they expect to finish by this fall.
 ''We are certain that Silverstein Properties understands that an arbitration decision under the development agreement will not resolve when there will be a market for two private office towers on the site, and how this speculative private office space should be financed,'' Mr. Ward said.
 The authority has insisted that it would have to slash its capital budget and postpone or eliminate projects in New York and New Jersey if it were to guarantee the financing.
 Mr. Silverstein was to build the towers with a combination of insurance proceeds, tax-free bonds and private equity and financing. But lenders are reluctant to finance real estate projects today, and few, if any, tenants are willing to lease expensive new towers when rents are falling sharply at existing buildings. 
 Some real estate executives, civic groups and Port Authority officials say that the towers should be built over time, while Mr. Silverstein and Mayor Bloomberg want it done now. 
 After years of delay, Mr. Ward emphasized that work continues at the site, where the authority is building the Sept. 11 memorial, the transit hub and its own office tower. At the same time, Mr. Silverstein is erecting the first of his three towers along Church Street.
 But many officials fear that the momentum at the trade center site will collapse if the dispute lingers.

HEADLINE: Calculus and Compassion

BYLINE: By PHILIP BOBBITT. 
Philip Bobbitt, a law professor at Columbia, is the author, most recently, of ''Terror and Consent: The Wars for the 21st Century.''

 BODY:
FOR Christmas in 1963 we gathered at the ranch that had belonged to my great-grandfather, a few miles outside the town -- Johnson City -- named for our family.
 Lyndon Johnson, my uncle, presided over the noisy feast, and the unwrapping and the prayers. By the fire, that afternoon, he quizzed me on the cabinet he had inherited. I was 15, a high school senior. Could I name all the cabinet members? I could. Did I know which ones were from Wall Street, which ones had served in Congress, which ones had been governors? I did. It went on and on -- not so unlike the quizzes he must have given his students 30 years earlier when he coached a high school debate team as a young teacher in Houston.
 But now, he said, he had a question that was sure to stump me. Who was the most compassionate member of the cabinet? I guessed, rather unconfidently. Wrong. I guessed again, wrongly. He laughed and said: ''You'll never get it. It's Bob McNamara. By far.'' And it was a surprise, because we all thought of Bob McNamara as the no-nonsense numbers man from corporate America. The steel-rimmed glasses and the steel-trap mind were perfectly suited to an industrial mentality. 
 Lyndon Johnson was a good reader of men and he was right about Robert McNamara, who died this week at the age of 93, after seven years at the Defense Department and then 13 at the World Bank. Just a glance at Mr. McNamara's tenure at the World Bank shows a man driven by a desire to help the poor. 
 During his presidency there, lending to the developing world grew from 60 loans totaling under $1 billion to 250 loans of almost $12 billion. His efforts to move governments to increase their contributions to the poorest countries earned him the reputation in the underdeveloped world as ''the conscience of the West'' (a phrase unlikely to be associated with him at home). At the time of the Cuban missile crisis, his was one of the few voices ardently opposed to invasion.
 At one point early in their relationship, Johnson was so taken by Bob McNamara's commitment to social justice that he mused openly about whether he could make him the vice presidential candidate in 1964. As Clark Clifford observed, ''In my years in Washington, only a handful of people below the presidential level have dominated the scene: George Marshall, Dean Acheson and Henry Kissinger all come to mind. But no one held the capital in sway more powerfully than McNamara, from 1961 until the end of 1967.'' 
 What happened?
 Robert McNamara went to the Pentagon to reform it, to rationalize its decision-making and systematize analysis. From the outset he was unpopular with many high-ranking officers who were more comfortable with the institutionalized cross-purposes of the defense establishment and the educated intuition of experienced military personnel. 
 Of course, Mr. McNamara was right, and it was in part his confidence in this sensible effort at reform that blinded him to the need for a change in strategy in Southeast Asia. He was used to hearing mindless criticism and became wedded to relying on those analytic methods that were superior to the ones he found at the Pentagon, not quite appreciating their limited utility in Vietnam.
 Unfortunately, just as he was trying to liquidate the bureaucratic practices that governed the Army in the first half of the 20th-century, he found himself in the midst of a sudden shift away from the strategic context that had structured American warfare since the Civil War. The ''total warfare'' of the industrial state, at which Bob McNamara excelled, was no longer either acceptable or effective.
 He was not the only one to miss the need for this kind of change, a change in the war aim rather than simply its practices. Strategic planning is an extrapolation from the past and, in Southeast Asia, the United States confronted warfare for which its past provided no guidance; Mr. McNamara's obsession with quantitative planning tended to make matters worse: though we killed more and more of the enemy, we were never able to protect civilians adequately.
 That this failure haunted him is doubtless to his credit. It is a sign of just how much his role troubled him that both he and McGeorge Bundy, the national security adviser to Kennedy and Johnson, broke their silence about the conduct of the war in the mid-1990s to claim that President Kennedy, had he lived, would not have escalated the conflict in 1965, an implausible assertion from two brilliant men that depended upon the assumption that the president would have rejected the very advice they jointly urged in 1965.
 BOB McNamara found it difficult to accept the human situation of inevitable tragedy. If only we worked harder, thought more clearly, marshaled our resources more prudently, if only.... And so, late in life, he published an apologia claiming that he had known for some time that the war would fail but had not been willing to undermine American morale to say so, even to the president. He seems to have been unwilling to accept that a stalemate was about as good an outcome as was available, at least until we learned new tactics and goals that we are only now coming to appreciate.
 Though it may be hard for our contemporaries to view the numbers-crunching, data-driven warlord as a person of deep compassion, his naive refusal to accept an agonizing inevitability was related to his compassion. He thought there was a way out of Southeast Asia that would save its people from ruthless dictatorships without an endless sacrifice of American and Vietnamese life. In the language of the game theorists, he believed there was an equilibrium, a stable option that would maximize freedom and minimize harm. In the end, American frustration achieved just the opposite.
 There are some who have recently expressed contempt for Robert McNamara. I'm not surprised. But what's called for, I think, is something much harder to sustain: compassion.

HEADLINE: Mapping a Bird's-Eye View of Foreclosure Misery

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
When it came to representing the sprawling nature of the foreclosure crisis in New York City, the artist Damon Rich figured out that the best thing to do was to shrink it down to size. 
 And so he used the 9,335-square-foot Panorama of the City of New York, the intricate architectural model built for the 1964 World's Fair, and hundreds of neon-pink triangles to demonstrate just how the city has been marked by economic troubles. 
 Each plastic triangle represents a block where there have been three or more home foreclosures. Visitors on the balcony walkway that surrounds the Panorama, at the Queens Museum of Art in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, can see in a single glance precisely where subprime lenders wreaked the most havoc. 
 Hundreds of these pink stigmata cover Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, East New York and Canarsie in Brooklyn like an invading army. In Queens most markers are camped out in Ozone Park and Cambria Heights, as well as in parts of Jamaica and Corona. As for Manhattan, there are precisely two. 
 This mapping of the 45-year-old Panorama is part of a larger exhibition about housing, in which politics intersects with art. 
 ''I hope that my work operates on a principle of opening up a set of issues for exploration,'' Mr. Rich said.
 Titled ''Red Lines Crisis Housing Learning Center,'' the show includes photographs, models, drawings and sculptural installations -- like a large, three-dimensional wooden graph of interest rates over the past 70 years -- that offer an explanation of how the private housing market works, beginning with the federal government's involvement during the Depression. 
 Mr. Rich said the exhibition provided a ''physical experience'' that engages people in a way that a book, a Web site or a television show cannot. ''In some way, I hope my exhibitions function as strange educational playgrounds for adults,'' he said.
 As well as an artist, Mr. Rich is an urban designer and waterfront planner for Newark. He originally created a version of the ''Red Lines'' exhibition for the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was an artist in residence in 2007. When one of the center's curators, Larissa Harris, was hired at the Queens Museum, she asked Mr. Rich to recreate the installation there. 
 The museum's director, Tom Finkelpearl, suggested that Mr. Rich use the Panorama. When first built, the Panorama was supposed to simulate the sense of a helicopter ride over New York. Where the walkway now stands, helicopter-shaped cars on elevated tracks gave visitors a nine-minute tour.
 ''This was built as an urban planning tool,'' Ms. Harris said of the Panorama. ''I feel so proud of this because we are using it that way.''
 The Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project collected the foreclosure information, Ms. Harris said, as she slowly circled the Panorama. The Regional Plan Association, an independent planning group, then crunched the numbers using the Geographic Information System -- a mapping program -- to create maps of every inch of the city indicating where there had been foreclosures of single- to four-family homes in 2008. 
 Ms. Harris opened a door off the walkway and descended a few steps to a second door that opened onto the Panorama. She bent down and tilted her head so that her eyes were level with the blue floor that represents the waterways surrounding New York. ''When you look at it this way, you can imagine you're on a boat and coming into Staten Island,'' she said. 
 The first challenge was figuring out how to mark the more than 13,000 foreclosures. ''We had a brainstorm,'' Ms. Harris said. The small plastic dividers put on the top of a delivered pizza to prevent the cheese from sticking to the top of the box would work perfectly. ''We bought 2,000 of them and spray-painted them pink,'' a color that would not clash with the Panorama, but would still stand out, Ms. Harris said.
 Volunteers from the Center for Urban Pedagogy, a nonprofit organization in Brooklyn of which Mr. Rich is the founder, translated the information from the maps to the Panorama. ''We got an amazing crop of kids who just love maps,'' Ms. Harris said.
 Figuring out how to place the markers without damaging the Panorama proved to be another problem. To get to the East New York section, for instance, volunteers would have had to walk through the rest of Brooklyn, the equivalent of a cadre of building-crushing Godzillas. Ultimately, team members discovered that they could sit on thick squares of foam without damaging the Panorama's wood and plastic models. 
 ''We took off our shoes, put on little slippers and went out with these maps and pieces of foam,'' Ms. Harris said.
 The Panorama was last significantly updated in 1992, so the group made ''educated guesses'' when computer maps differed from the Panorama, Ms. Harris said. The museum, whose only recent addition to the Panorama is Citi Field, the new Mets stadium next door, has begun a new update called Adopt-a-Building. That effort asks people, schools and businesses to sponsor or buy a building for the Panorama. (So far, there have been no foreclosures.)
 As for the pink triangles, there are 582 in Brooklyn; 551 in Queens; 140 in Staten Island; and 151 in the Bronx, mostly in the Wakefield section. The areas are predominantly African-American and Latino, Ms. Harris said, the same neighborhoods that used to be starved of credit by discriminatory redlining before it became illegal in the 1970s. The smaller numbers in the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island, she explained, are due to a combination of income (too rich or too poor) and building type (apartments instead of single- or multifamily homes). 
 Ms. Harris acknowledged that most of ''Red Lines,'' which runs through Sept. 27, is political; it emphasizes predatory and racist lending practices. On Wednesday night the museum is hosting a celebration for housing advocates, featuring a lecture by the urban historian Kenneth T. Jackson. 
 But she argued that mapping the Panorama was not about taking sides. ''I don't see how it gives a political view, mapping the facts,'' she said. ''I don't think you can argue with this. That's why it's so powerful.''

10 P.M. (13) HEART OF JENIN In 2005 Ahmed Khatib, a 12-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank city of Jenin, was killed by Israeli soldiers when they mistook his toy gun for a real one. In their grief, his parents decided to donate their son's organs to six Israeli children facing death. Ahmed's kidneys went to an Orthodox Jewish girl and a Bedouin boy. Ahmed's heart, which his parents had initially been reluctant to donate, now keeps a Druze girl alive. ''Wide Angle'' follows Ismael Khatib, above, Ahmed's father, on his journey from northern Israel to the Negev desert and finally to Jerusalem to visit these three recipients two years later. ''I see my son in these children,'' he says.
 9 A.M. (CBS) THE DOCTORS Shocking health trends, a chair that offers a sitter a good abdominal workout while seated at a desk, and dance moves from Lisa Rinna. 
 8 P.M. (HBO2) THE CONSCIENCE OF NHEM EN The order to the 16-year-old soldier was simple: photograph the men, women and children passing through a processing center at Tuol Sleng Prison in Phnom Penh on their way to execution by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia 30 years ago. Nhem En, right, did what he was told, snapping pictures that bear witness to unspeakable suffering and loss. This Oscar-nominated documentary short from Steven Okazaki tells the story of Mr. Nhem En, who took about 6,000 portraits between 1977 and 1978, and 3 of the 8 prisoners, out of 17,000, known to have left the center alive. ''People do what they have to do to survive,'' Mr. Nhem En says. ''I guess it's a matter of conscience.''
 8 P.M. (13, 49) TIME TEAM AMERICA This new series looks over the shoulders of scientists as they uncover secrets at some of the country's most intriguing archaeological sites in only three days. The clock starts ticking in Fort Raleigh, N.C., where the ghosts of the 1587 Roanoke Island settlement -- which vanished within three years, leaving only the word Croatoan carved in the gatepost of a fort as a clue -- are thought to linger. The team will also try to establish the exact location of the first British colony in America and examine the remains of a science center, discovered in 1991, where archaeologists believe the colonists were testing metal ores.
