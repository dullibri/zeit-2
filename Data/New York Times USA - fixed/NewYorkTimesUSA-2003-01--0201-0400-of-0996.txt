HEADLINE: BUSH AND THE ECONOMY: THE OPPONENTS' IDEAS; 
Democrats in House Propose A Package Rivaling Bush's

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
Setting the stage for a partisan fight in Congress over how to revive the sagging economy, House Democrats today unveiled a $136 billion stimulus plan that they said would create as many as one million jobs, increase consumer spending and help states out of their fiscal straits.
 The announcement was timed to give the Democrats a one-day jump on President Bush, who is to outline a much larger package, with an estimated 10-year cost of $600 billion, in Chicago on Tuesday. The centerpiece of Mr. Bush's plan is the elimination of taxes that shareholders pay on dividends, a provision that Democrats say would benefit the wealthiest Americans almost exclusively. 
 The Democrats' plan calls for a 26-week extension of unemployment benefits and a tax rebate of up to $300 for every working American. It would permit businesses to increase their write-off on new investments, and provide $31 billion to state and local governments to help defray the cost of domestic security, Medicaid, highway projects and other programs.
"This is about the job market rather than the stock market," Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said in outlining the plan this afternoon.
Mr. Spratt called the proposal "front-loaded and fast-acting." By that, he meant that it would provide a quick lift to the economy without increasing the deficit in future years, as opposed to the White House plan, which Democrats describe as fiscally irresponsible.
Democrats also said that while their package called for spending $136 billion, the net cost to the Treasury over 10 years would be only $100 billion, in part because of the added economic activity that they said would be generated by the plan.
Republicans, who now control both houses of Congress, immediately criticized the initiative as shortsighted and too narrow.
"The Democrat plan offers little stimulus beyond an increased appetite for more federal spending," said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority leader in the new Congress. "To put people back to work, a stimulus must contain the dynamic elements that can empower economic growth and job creation."
Mindful that they failed to make headway in the November elections in part because the public perceived them as lacking an economic plan, Democrats have been working on an economic agenda since shortly afterward. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the new House minority leader, said her party had been determined to come up with "a package that has clarity, that has credibility and that has consensus within our caucus."
In addition to extending unemployment benefits and offering a tax rebate, the plan would allow small businesses to write off up to $50,000 of the cost of new investments made in 2003, as opposed to the current maximum write-off of $25,000. The plan would also permit companies to depreciate 50 percent of the cost of new plants or equipment in 2003; current law permits them to depreciate only 30 percent.
The plan would give states, which are struggling with budget shortfalls, a one-time increase in the federal share of Medicaid payments, amounting to $10 billion. It would also give them $10 billion in grants to help pay for domestic security needs like airport protection and public health preparedness, as well as $5 billion in federal aid for highways and $6 billion for "critical state needs" to help those most hurt by unemployment and the lackluster economy.
But the package does not offer long-term solutions, which Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would begin considering on Wednesday.
In proposing that all workers receive a refundable income tax rebate of up to $300 per person, or $600 per working couple, Democrats said they wanted to put money in the hands of people who needed it most and who would quickly spend it: those of lower or middle income. They were also seeking to draw what Representative George Miller, a senior Democrat from California, described as "a clear distinction" between themselves and Mr. Bush.
"The president really is investing, you know, $600 billion on an old, old Republican theory of trickle-down economy," Mr. Miller said. "We're saying no: give it to the people who need it."
Mr. Spratt said that extending unemployment benefits was one of the plan's most important features. But while there is general consensus in Congress on a need to help people who have lost their jobs, there are serious divisions between the parties over how long the benefit extension should be.
The House Democrats are calling for a 26-week extension, beyond the standard 26 weeks of benefits. Many Republicans, however, are talking about a shorter extension, of 12 or 13 weeks, and today Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee, said his party would introduce legislation on Tuesday to extend benefits for 12 weeks.
Democrats said today that they had developed a plan they believed would create common ground with Republicans. But asked if he thought the plan demonstrated common ground, Mr. Grassley shook his head. 
"No," he said, without elaborating.

HEADLINE: BUSH AND THE ECONOMY: GENESIS OF A PLAN; 
Nurturing the Tax Cut Idea Since the Era of Reagan

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
Charles Schwab, founder of the discount brokerage firm, has been widely credited with selling President Bush on what is now a White House plan to eliminate the tax that people pay on dividends. 
 "That makes a lot of sense," Mr. Bush said approvingly last summer in Waco, Tex., after Mr. Schwab put forth the idea at a one-day economic conference near the president's ranch. 
 In fact, the idea dates from at least 20 years ago, from the Reagan administration, when it was a favorite of Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan. It remained in favor in the first Bush administration, when H. Glenn Hubbard, a Treasury official who is an economic adviser for George W. Bush, was in charge of a study that promoted eliminating the tax.
After eight years of Bill Clinton, the new Bush administration revived the idea, first in the presidential transition and then in the internal White House debates that led up to Mr. Bush's initial tax cut in 2001. But at that time, Republicans said, White House officials decided that reducing the income-tax rate was more important than tackling dividends.
Finally, last summer, as Wall Street was in the midst of its third down year in a row, the idea gained momentum in the White House as a way to bolster the stock market. Mr. Schwab's comments at the Waco conference were undeniably influential. But so was a cacophony from conservative economists and influential Republicans, including the host of a talk show on CNBC-TV, Lawrence Kudlow, a former Reagan administration economist who is close to Vice President Dick Cheney.
All summer long on his program, which is watched by White House officials (although not President Bush), Mr. Kudlow hammered at the idea of dividend tax cuts. At the same time, conservative economists kept up pressure on the White House.
After the economic conference, in early September, Lawrence B. Lindsey, who was then Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, invited a group to his office.
"There was virtual unanimous agreement that reducing the tax on dividends would provide the most help for the stock market in the shortest period of time," said Stephen Moore, president of a conservative lobbying group, the Club for Growth, who attended the meeting with Mr. Lindsey.
The group was already preaching to the converted, because Mr. Lindsey had long been a fan of the dividend cut, which senior White House officials had been seriously considering for much of last year. 
"It's just well-established doctrine among free-market economists," said Daniel J. Mitchell, a tax economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation who also attended the meeting. "We have -- it seems like -- endless conversations where we're badgering the administration to do x, y and z, and sometimes we're tempted when they actually chose to do x, y and z to say, 'Oh, they listened to us.' But if you're remotely centrist or right of center as an economist, you're going to see the double taxation of dividends as one of the sore thumbs in our tax code."
At most, Mr. Mitchell said, "We were a straw in the camel's back."
Throughout the fall, administration officials worked on the plan, coordinated from the office of Joshua Bolten, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Initially, administration officials had worked with the idea of a 50 percent reduction in the tax, and as recently as Christmas said they were still actively pursuing that as a favorite proposal.
But over this last weekend, while Mr. Bush was at his ranch conferring with White House officials back in Washington, the president's advisers said the reduction would be the more dramatic, politically bold idea of eliminating the tax entirely. 
Today, Mr. Bush, who after two years as president has a history of springing surprises, enthusiastically embraced the plan as a principled statement of his presidency.
"It's unfair to tax money twice," Mr. Bush said after a cabinet meeting at the White House. "There's a principle involved. The government ought to be content with taxing revenue streams or profits one time, not twice. And in dividends, we tax the corporate profit, and then we tax the money being sent to the shareholder. And that doesn't make any sense."

HEADLINE: The Majority Starts a Step Behind 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
Senate majority leaders usually set out their legislative goals on the first day of a Congressional session, but when the 108th Congress convenes on Tuesday, Senator Bill Frist, the incoming majority leader, will not be introducing his top 10 bills, his spokesman said today.
 Republicans in the Senate said today that they simply had not yet had enough time to organize for dealing with the well-prepared Democrats, having been preoccupied for nearly a month with the leadership crisis brought on by their former leader, Senator Trent Lott. They plan a daylong caucus on Wednesday to set priorities, but they acknowledged that their plans would in large part be shaped by President Bush's State of the Union address later this month. 
 Although the delay will cost the Republicans only a few weeks of momentum, it illustrates how sobering the transition has been from the heady weeks of November, when the party won control of both houses of Congress and promised a swift and bold domestic agenda. Even when party leaders get up to speed, they will have to spend the first few weeks of the session clearing away a bramble of unfinished business from last year, and they may then find that their slim majority will produce a battle on each element of their plan. 
"We're trying to fit into two weeks what most people take two months to do," a frazzled Republican leadership aide said today.
Republicans say they will first have to deal with expired unemployment insurance and old spending bills that the last Congress failed to complete, and will probably wait until after Wednesday's caucus, behind closed doors at the Library of Congress, to open their catalog of new legislation. It will include the administration's tax cuts and Medicare revisions, along with curbs on abortion, oil drilling in Alaska and a prescription drug plan. A spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said the House Republican agenda was unlikely to differ in any substantial way from the one the president will unveil in his State of the Union address.
Dr. Frist has given no interviews since he was chosen to replace Mr. Lott on Dec. 23, and he has barely begun to hire a staff and move into his new office, let alone establish a list of legislative priorities. Several Republican senators said they were not sure which matters he would press first and said they hoped to find out at Wednesday's meeting. Their one-vote controlling majority in the Senate, however, will mean that most items on their agenda will produce a battle, and will in most cases require a few hard-won Democratic votes to enact.
"This new leader is going to put it right on the Democrats' backs," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico. "Do they want us to get these things done or not?"
But Democrats have used the delay caused by Mr. Lott's downfall to prepare their own lengthy policy agenda, and they plan to seek every possible advantage to press it, including taking advantage of Dr. Frist's lack of legislative experience. Although Republicans asked him to hold back, Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, said he planned to introduce his top 10 bills on Tuesday whether or not the Republicans were ready to do so. He said the list would be led by a patients' bill of rights and expansion of Medicare, increased spending for education, pension reform and an increase in the minimum wage.
"If the Republicans are willing to come to the middle, then we may be able to find some common ground," Mr. Daschle said. "I've had some encouraging conversations with Senator Frist about the agenda that left me optimistic. But if they want to privatize Medicare as the price for prescription drugs, or if they refuse to finance the education bill -- well, that doesn't sound like common ground to me."
Looming over the 108th Congress is the strong possibility of war with Iraq later this year, which could constrain the plans of both parties, and the continuing threat from international terrorism and North Korea. House leaders announced plans today to create a special committee to oversee the construction of the Department of Homeland Security, and the Senate is also considering changing its committee structure to respond to new security priorities.
The first priority for both parties will be an extension of unemployment benefits for about a million workers whose insurance ran out late last month. A vote on the matter could come as early as Tuesday, Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, said today. The issue could be among the first to expose the ideological divide that could dominate the new Congress. Democrats want a package that will cover workers in all states, while House Republicans prefer a less expensive proposal that would cover workers in only 15 or 20 of the states with the highest unemployment. There are also sharp differences over how many workers in each state will be covered.
"This is an issue we cannot dawdle on," said Mr. Santorum, the third-ranking member of the Senate leadership, who has supported a plan more generous than that of the House. "This is not an issue that politics should be played with."
A measure that must be taken up quickly is a temporary bill to fund the operations of government, because the current stopgap spending allowance runs out on Saturday. Partisan disagreements prevented the last Congress from enacting most of the basic spending bills for government departments in the current fiscal year, and officials of both parties said they had reached agreement to pass an omnibus spending bill by early February that would carry the government through the current year.
Within the first few months of the session, Republicans must also decide whether to make amends to African-Americans and others who were angered by Mr. Lott's remarks last month that appeared to express nostalgia for the days of segregation. There have been suggestions from within the party that one or more of the judges whose civil rights records have been criticized might not be renominated by the Bush administration or that a measure might be enacted to prohibit racial profiling by states. Republican leaders have been silent on their plans, except to say that some kind of gesture is expected.
By winter's end, the battle should be fully joined on President Bush's economic plan, which includes the elimination of the tax on stock dividends and an accelerated rate cut in all tax brackets. Democrats have already blasted the plan as favoring the rich and providing an inadequate economic stimulus, but Republicans say it will pump $100 billion into the economy this year and rekindle growth. With Democrats offering their own plan more targeted to the middle class, the issue is likely to dominate this session.
Health care, particularly prescription drug coverage for the elderly and a Republican plan to introduce private competition into Medicare, will figure prominently on the agendas of both houses. Mr. Bush has said he does not want a prescription drug benefit without Medicare reform, and Dr. Frist, whose background as a heart surgeon will push the issue high on the agenda, agrees.
Control of Congress will also give Republicans an opportunity to advance the stalled social agenda of conservatives, including legislation to ban the procedure called partial birth abortion by its opponents and a bill to prohibit human cloning. Republicans also want to limit legal damage awards and restrict malpractice and class-action lawsuits.
Debates over energy and the environment are also likely. Against the backdrop of a potential war with Iraq, Republicans are expected to argue that Americans need sources of energy outside the Middle East. They have promised to revive President Bush's stalled national energy plan, which includes a proposal to allow drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Democrats hold up the proposal as a symbol of what they regard as the Bush administration's weakening of environmental protections.

HEADLINE: BUSH AND THE ECONOMY: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
The Politics Of Portfolios

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
In calling for the elimination of taxes on stock dividends, President Bush is embracing the idea that the financial health of investors, particularly the millions of people who got into the stock market for the first time over the last decade and are now suffering the consequences, will be vital both to renewed prosperity and to his own electoral success.
 It is a gamble on both counts. 
 For all that is said of Wall Street as an important barometer of economic activity and national psychology, it is not clear that putting more cash in the hands of investors and trying to give the market a lift will provide much help to the economy in the short run, economists said.
Similarly, it is a matter of intense debate among political analysts whether investors make up a definable voting bloc that can be won over with a break on investment income or even a boost to the value of depleted portfolios. Some of Mr. Bush's Democratic critics even question the existence of a so-called investor class as anything other than an excuse for Republicans to cut taxes again for the wealthy. 
For years, some Republican strategists have made a case that their party has an opportunity to attract the millions of middle-class people who make up the new investor class by emphasizing that its agenda of lower taxes, less regulation and more trade will be good for their efforts to build wealth. About half of all households now have some investments in stocks and bonds, either directly or through mutual funds and retirement accounts. 
More important in political terms, about two-thirds of voters are investors, making the stock market an increasingly compelling subject -- especially with stock prices having just completed their third consecutive year of losses.
"Bush is responding to Americans where they were hit hardest," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. "Usually when you think of the economy getting worse, you think about unemployment, but this time it's stock-market driven. He has provided a tax relief package that will affect more voters than almost anything else he could have done. It will matter to them because they haven't seen their incomes go down, they've seen their retirement savings go down."
But some of the administration's critics dismiss the entire notion of a mass investor class. To the degree that anyone cares about taxation of dividends, Democrats said, it is a thin slice of the very richest Americans who are already the Republican party's patrons rather than the average working families that determine the outcome of elections.
For all that investing became the national pastime when the market was rising, they said, stock market wealth is still so concentrated that Mr. Bush's proposal is nothing more than a new way of justifying tax cuts for wealthy Republican benefactors. They said the focus on dividends came about because other options appealing to conservatives, like corporate tax cuts, became politically problematic for the White House in the aftermath of last year's corporate accounting scandals.
"This is so flagrant," said Kevin Phillips, a political commentator and the author of "Wealth and Democracy: A Political History of the American Rich." 
"It's not aimed at the little investor," Mr. Phillips said of the Bush plan. "It's aimed at the big investor and shrouded by a fog of phoniness. This isn't even trickle-down economics. It's mist-down economics."
Eliminating taxes on dividends paid by corporations to their shareholders would amount to a tax cut of around $300 billion over the next decade, roughly half the total value of the economic plan Mr. Bush intends to unveil on Tuesday.
In remarks to reporters after a cabinet meeting at the White House this afternoon, Mr. Bush cast his proposal on dividends as a potent way of getting the economy firing on all cylinders. Anticipating a rising chorus of Democratic charges that the Bush plan benefits only the wealthy, the president and his spokesman said the plan would help not only the economy but also a broad swath of the public. 
"It will encourage investment, and that's what we want," Mr. Bush said. "Investment means jobs."
But he also said the change would be a matter of fairness, both in economic terms and for individuals, including many retirees, because it would end the practice of taxing dividend payments made by corporations to their shareholders after the same money has already been taxed as profit. 
"There's a principle involved," the president said.
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said today that there were 35 million people who received dividend income, including 10 million elderly people. "The president does not think it is right to tax savings and to penalize people who save, and the president does not think it is right to penalize people who plan for their future," Mr. Fleischer said. 
Responding to a question about whether Mr. Bush's proposal spread its benefits fairly among income groups, Mr. Fleischer responded that the president's plan would contain elements "that will help lower taxes for all Americans, give a boost to the economy, give a boost to growth."
Although White House officials have in the past estimated that eliminating the tax on dividends could send the stock market rising by as much as 20 percent -- the Dow rose 171.88 points, or 2 percent, today -- Mr. Fleischer said it was "impossible to predict any kind of stock market performance based on announcements out of Washington."
But some liberal analysts said an investor class, at least as a mass phenomenon, was a political marketing myth. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, cited an analysis of Federal Reserve data today showing that 85 percent of the value of stocks and bonds was held by the top 10 percent of the income spectrum in 1998, the latest year for which comprehensive data is available. Citing I.R.S. data from 2000, the group said 22 percent of taxpayers with incomes under $100,000 reported any dividend income, while 72 percent of filers between $100,000 and $1 million and nearly all filers above $1 million reported dividend income.
Mr. Bush's plan amounts to "an old, old Republican theory of trickle-down economics," said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California.
Democrats also tried to link Mr. Bush's actions to the corporate accounting scandals and political firestorm over the Securities and Exchange Commission last year. They said Mr. Bush would do better to grant a big budget increase to the commission and assure that the accounting oversight board would act aggressively to restore investor confidence.
"That's what will bring back confidence in the stock market," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, "not some gimmick like dividend deduction."

HEADLINE: BUSH AND THE ECONOMY: THE OVERVIEW; 
WHITE HOUSE AIDES LAUNCH A DEFENSE OF BUSH TAX PLAN

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
White House officials rolled out statistics and new details of President Bush's sweeping tax plan today in an effort to head off criticism that it favors only the rich.
 One day before Mr. Bush unveils the $600 billion plan in Chicago, a White House official outlined a proposal to create $3,000 "re-employment accounts" that unemployed workers could use to help find or train for new jobs. 
 Other administration officials produced statistics to show that the tax cuts would benefit millions of middle-income workers. 
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said that the plan would provide 92 million taxpayers with an average tax cut of $1,083 this year and that a family of four with $39,000 in earnings could save about $1,100.
But Democrats were having none of it, accusing Mr. Bush of proposing tax cuts that would overwhelmingly benefit the nation's wealthiest taxpayers and outlining a much smaller rival plan that would give rebates to all taxpayers and provide more help for unemployed workers. Page A16. 
In making the centerpiece of his plan a proposal to eliminate taxes on corporate dividends paid to shareholders, Mr. Bush electrified investors on Wall Street who sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by 171.88 points today.
But in focusing on the dividend plan, which could cost the federal treasury $300 billion over 10 years, Mr. Bush also selected the one proposal that most emphatically benefits a sliver of the nation's richest households.
And while investors rushed to buy up stocks because the tax-free treatment of dividends is expected to increase corporate valuations, most economists remained skeptical that the plan would provide much of a jolt to either corporate investment or consumer spending.
"It is not at all clear how the plan is going to stimulate the economy in the near term," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the Bank One Corporation in Chicago. 
David Rosenberg, chief North American economist for Merrill Lynch, predicted that the plan would increase economic growth by only about two-tenths of 1 percent.
Calculations by the Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit research group run by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, indicate that the wealthiest 1 percent of all taxpayers would receive 42 percent of the savings from making dividends to shareholders tax-free.
People earning more than $316,895 a year, according to the center, would on average save $13,243 in taxes. By contrast, people with taxable incomes of $21,350 would save just $47.
Those calculations are based primarily on analysis of previous tax data, which shows that the overwhelming bulk of dividends are paid to people at the highest income levels. 
Mr. Bush stunned lawmakers in both parties with the breadth and boldness of his proposal. The plan is twice as expensive as most people had been expecting, and its heavy reliance on tax breaks for the wealthy set the stage today for a profound battle over fairness and economic growth.
"This is for the wealthiest people in the country," said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House. Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats announced an alternative plan that would provide $136 billion through tax rebates, aid to state governments and expanded unemployment benefits.
Yet Mr. Bush appeared determined to outbid them, pushing hard for his favorite proposals while adding billions more for many of the same causes espoused by Democrats.
Catering to demands to help middle-income families, White House officials said today that Mr. Bush would propose an immediate increase in the child tax credit to $1,000 from $600 and to make the increase available in the form of a tax rebate.
That item alone could cost about $87 billion over 10 years, but the benefits would flow primarily to middle-income families.
In what White House officials hope to showcase as an example of "compassionate conservatism," Mr. Bush will also propose giving states $3.6 billion for "re-employment accounts."
As outlined tonight by a senior administration official, a jobless worker who appears in danger of running out of normal unemployment benefits could be eligible for up to $3,000 to spend in looking for work or training for work.
The new twist is that a worker who finds work in less than 13 weeks would be able to keep the money he or she has not yet spent. Administration officials see the idea as an antidote to one of their longstanding philosophical complaints about standard unemployment insurance, which is that it gives people a financial incentive to remain unemployed.
One of the biggest surprises in Mr. Bush's plan is how little it would provide directly to corporations. Business groups had lobbied for a big increase in the speed with which large companies could depreciate the cost of new equipment and factories. 
But that is not in the tax package at all. The main incentive for business is a proposal that would greatly increase the ability of small proprietorships to write off investments in new equipment as an expense at one time.
That provision, business lobbyists said today, was included mainly as a "payback" to small-business groups that had been angered when a similar provision was dropped from Mr. Bush's 2001 tax-cutting bill at the last moment.
Business lobbyists lined up today to support Mr. Bush's plan even as they acknowledged that they had never really had much interest in cutting dividend taxes in the past. 
"We have decided to support whatever it is that President Bush thinks is necessary to promote economic growth," said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. 
Wall Street investors were clearly startled today by news reports over the weekend that Mr. Bush planned to propose twice as much money as administration officials had been suggesting and push for a full repeal of taxes on dividends paid to shareholders.
"It's pushing up the stock market," said James Glassman, chief economist at J. P. Morgan, adding that investors appeared to be buying up shares of utilities and other "old economy" companies that tend to pay higher dividends than younger technology companies that reinvest their profits.
Yet many economists predicted that even this plan, bigger than the one many had come to expect, would provide only a limited kick to the economy.
"The biggest economic impact is going to be the fiscal cost," said Alan Auerbach, a tax economist at the University of California who has studied the issue of dividend taxes. "There might be some more investment, but I don't think it will be that big."
Mr. Fleischer, the White House spokesman, suggested that the plan would pump at least $100 billion into the economy during 2003 -- equal to about 1 percent of the total economy -- but many economists said a big chunk of benefits would not reach taxpayers until 2004.
Still, economists said the long-term impact of eliminating dividend taxes entirely could be profound. The move would favor utilities, old-line manufacturers and other companies that pay dividends and would put pressure on technology companies like Microsoft or Cisco Systems that reinvest all their money and have accumulated huge cash reserves.
Over time, however, analysts said, many companies will shift their financial strategy to pay out more of their profits in dividends.

Financial Dominoes and Dividend Taxes

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The elimination of taxes on corporate dividends, as President Bush is expected to propose today, could provoke sweeping changes in the way companies raise money and Americans invest. It could make American corporations less likely to go broke in bad times, while making it more expensive for states and cities to borrow money.
 Wall Street could see a boom in fees as companies rush to issue preferred stock, a relatively obscure security that could become the most popular way for many companies to raise money. And it could encourage more companies to pay dividends. 
 For investors, the saving would be likely to accrue more to those who hold their stocks in taxable accounts -- as opposed to 401(k)'s and individual retirement accounts. That could make such retirement accounts less popular, or at a minimum make investors less likely to use them for their stock investments. 
President Bush's stimulus package is also expected to include aid for hard-pressed state and local governments, many of which face large budget deficits that otherwise must be eliminated by raising taxes or cutting spending. Either remedy would tend to offset any federal stimulus.
But the dividend plan could hurt those same state and local governments, by raising their borrowing costs and reducing their tax revenues.
Individual investors seeking to minimize their taxes have long purchased municipal bonds, issued by state and local governments, because they owe no federal income tax on the interest, and often no state income tax either.
"The principal attraction of muni bonds is that the interest income is exempt," said Robert Willens, a tax analyst at Lehman Brothers. "If dividends were exempt, and you also had the potential of capital gains, some stocks would look a lot more attractive than muni bonds."
The existence of another investment that offers tax-free income would probably mean that issuers of municipal bonds would have to pay higher interest rates when they borrowed money. 
In addition, many state tax laws incorporate the federal law's definitions of taxable income, so a change in federal law would automatically stop those states from taxing dividend income. That would reduce state tax revenues unless the legislatures amended their own laws.
Because stock dividends would become more attractive to investors, all interest income could become less attractive. Investors could thus demand higher rates on everything from savings accounts to corporate bonds and even Treasury bonds. But the impact would be relatively small and could be overwhelmed by other trends in the economy.
The proposed elimination of all taxes on dividends goes well beyond what had been expected as recently as last week, and helped to send stock prices up yesterday, with some of the largest gains coming among companies that pay relatively high dividends. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, most of which pay dividends, rose 2.25 percent. The New York Stock Exchange utility index, which is dominated by companies that pay relatively high dividends, rose 5.55 percent. That was its best performance since Oct. 20, 1987, when stock prices rebounded after the 1987 crash.
The elimination of taxes on dividends would lead to a lot of questions about details to prevent abuse. Current law allows corporations to pay a low tax rate on dividends they receive from other companies in which they have invested, a fact that led to a series of tax strategies that Congress legislated against by requiring that companies cannot get the lower tax rate unless they hold the stock for a certain period -- up to two years in some cases.
"I expect these laws to have the various anti-abuse provisions in them, as they do now for corporations," said Robert Gordon, president of 21st Securities, which specializes in tax strategies for investors. "If they don't, there will be some great opportunities from this, but I can't believe the government will be that obtuse."
Congress may also have to consider what to do about investors who have borrowed money -- whether through margin accounts or otherwise -- to buy or hold shares that pay dividends that would become tax-free. The interest paid on such loans can now be tax-deductible, but that would probably change.
A related issue concerns capital gains and losses. "A lot will depend on how the proposal deals with extraordinary dividends," said David Hariton, a tax partner at the large New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, referring to dividends of at least 10 percent of a share's value. He said that without rules to prevent it, "a shareholder could buy stock, receive a large tax-free dividend, and then sell the stock for a capital loss that offsets a capital gain" from another investment. Rules that prevent corporate buyers of stocks from doing such things "might have to be extended to the individual level," he said.
Dividends are defined as money paid to shareholders by companies from their profits. Shareholders include holders of common stocks and preferred stocks.
The investment advantages of common stocks that pay dividends would be increased, but not enough to alter the investment climate fundamentally. High-dividend stocks would be more attractive, but the most important investment criterion would continue to be the outlook for the company's profit, since a downturn could lead to a price decline that would more than offset the benefits of the dividend, whatever its tax status.
Preferred stocks, at their simplest level, promise the investor a certain payment every year, just as a bond does. Preferred stocks now have relatively little appeal to most individual investors, in part because their yields are held down because the tax benefits for corporate holders of such securities are not available to individuals.
But the elimination of taxes on dividends would mean that individuals who bought preferred stock could get tax-free income with risks similar to those of investors who buy bonds in the same company. That would be likely to drive up the price of existing preferred shares, while also leading many companies to sell new issues of preferred stock.
Mr. Willens of Lehman Brothers suggests that Wall Street might move aggressively to issue such products as zero-coupon preferred stock. Such a share might cost $25 now and pay no annual dividend, but be redeemable in eight years for $50. "Under new rules, that could be very popular, for purposes like funding college tuition," he said.
For companies, a movement to borrow less through the bond market while raising more cash from selling preferred stock would have the advantage of leaving them in a better position if they ran into hard times. Companies that are financially pressed can usually defer or eliminate dividend payments. But if they are unable to pay interest on loans, they can be forced into bankruptcy.
Companies would still no doubt want to borrow money because interest payments would remain deductible from income in computing corporate taxes, while dividends would remain nondeductible. But if rates fall on preferred stock, as seems likely, there would no doubt be much more preferred stock sold.
Real estate investment trusts now avoid paying corporate income tax by distributing all or virtually all their income to shareholders, who are taxed on the income they receive. Presumably, since income has not been taxed at the corporate level, it would still be taxed at the individual level, and thus make such investments less attractive compared with high-yielding stocks on which dividends would be tax-exempt. That could lead to declines in prices for such trusts. Yesterday, however, the S.& P. REIT index rose 1.08 percent, a gain that was smaller than the overall market's.
The interplay of dividend taxation on retirement accounts could be important. Retirement accounts now collect income, whether from interest, dividends or capital gains, and pay no immediate taxes on it. Years later, when the owner of the account has retired, he or she pays individual income taxes on all the profits from the account.
If dividends become nontaxable, that would make owning stocks, or mutual funds that invest in stocks, less desirable for such accounts, simply because taxes would still be owed when the profits were distributed to the investor. That could be changed, to make dividends on retirement accounts not subject to eventual taxation, but keeping track of such dividends over the years would require large amounts of paperwork and make the tax laws even more complicated, not to mention the impact it would have on government revenue.
If retirement accounts do not benefit from the elimination of dividend taxes, however, that would mean that millions of Americans whose only investment in the stock market is through I.R.A.'s or 401(k) accounts would not benefit from the tax change.
In that case, investors who have money in both retirement and taxable accounts might choose to revamp their investments, leaving taxable bonds, and possibly stocks whose expected profits will come largely through capital gains, in retirement accounts, while shifting preferred stocks and high-dividend-paying stocks to ordinary taxable accounts.

HEADLINE: 'The Greatest of Great Men' 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
While in North Korea years ago, I barged into as many private homes as possible, and every single one had The Speaker.
 The Speaker is like a radio, but permanently on and without a choice of stations. It's the electronic umbilical cord from the Great Leader, waking citizens up each morning and putting them to bed each evening with a mix of heroic songs, denunciations of "the American war-maniacs" and tributes to Kim Jong Il, "the greatest of great men produced by heaven." 
 (Oops. Now North Koreans are going to wake up to hear The Speaker declare that even the imperialist reactionary New York Times has hailed the Great Leader as, quote, the greatest of great men, unquote.) 
The Speaker is a reminder that North Korea is like no other country in the world today. It was eerie to interview groups of North Koreans and then hear them praise Kim Jong Il in unison, like synchronized robots, a feat of hagiography unmatched except in Washington when White House aides give interviews. 
It's also a reason that our North Korea policy seems bound to fail. Since October the White House has tried to use economic pressure to squeeze the Great Leader to give up his uranium program. Economic pressure? In a country so regimented and totalitarian that its leaders yawned through a famine that killed two million people in the 1990's?
As one of the few Americans who have traveled around both North Korea and Iraq, I believe the problem is far deeper than just a muddle of our priorities. The White House's champing at the bit to invade Iraq alarms me, but I have to admit that so far the champing has had an excellent effect: It has put backbone into the United Nations, returned inspectors to Iraq and made containment of Iraq a more viable option.
On the other hand, the White House North Korea policy is baffling and is aggravating the crisis. 
My guess is that President Bush is deferring North Korea until Iraq is out of the way, and he's hoping that Chinese pressure will bring North Korea around. It won't. China won't squeeze North Korea because it doesn't want a collapsed neighbor and millions more refugees.
Moreover, China's influence on North Korea has always been wildly exaggerated. North Koreans speak openly of their contempt for Chinese officials, and Chinese and North Korean border guards have on occasion even fired at each other. I realized the strains a decade ago when one North Korean introduced me to another by saying "The Chinese government hates Mr. Kristof" -- and they both beamed and pumped my hand warmly. 
Unless the administration switches gears, here's what may happen: North Korea will reprocess spent fuel at its Yongbyon reactor, giving it enough plutonium for five to eight nuclear warheads by May 1. The North will also resume construction of a much bigger reactor at Taechon, accelerate its enriched uranium program, possibly drop out of the Nonproliferation Treaty, and test a Taepodong 2 missile that, in three stages, could reach New York (although it might be so inaccurate that it would miss and wipe out Newark).
In five years, North Korea could have 100 nuclear weapons and be churning out more like a fast-food chef. With nothing else to keep its economy going, North Korea will peddle them to the highest bidder ("One free Taepodong 2 missile with every three warheads you buy!")
This scenario is so horrendous that by late spring the Pentagon will be preparing options for a military strike on Yongbyon, even though President Bush has sensibly resisted that approach so far because the result could be another Korean War.
And this is, as Colin Powell calls it, "not a crisis"?
The only way out that I can see is to negotiate with North Korea, despite the administration's legitimate concerns about rewarding bad behavior. We could save face by getting Vladimir Putin to sponsor an international conference on North Korea, and then working out a deal in which the Great Leader verifiably gives up his nuclear and long-range missile programs, while the West offers normalization, trade, Asian Development Bank loans and pledges of nonaggression.
This would be a deeply unsatisfying solution, but it is less unsatisfying than the options we're now speeding toward: a nuclear factory peddling bombs on the North Korean eBay, or Korean War II.

Less than two months after imposing the largest property tax increase in the city's history, the Bloomberg administration has told most city agencies to find ways to cut their budgets an additional 6 percent for the 2004 fiscal year, which begins in July.
 Including the latest round of proposed trims, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has asked city agencies to reduce costs between 20 percent and 35 percent through cuts or other savings since taking office last year. While most city agencies have been asked to cut 6 percent in the latest round, the Department of Education and all uniformed services are being asked to trim their budgets 3 percent. 
 Bloomberg officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity yesterday, said that this round of cuts -- the fourth since last January, were needed because the City Council approved an 18.5 percent tax increase, rather than the 25 percent increase the administration initially sought, and because of continued sluggishness in the economy. The administration, which faces the worst fiscal crisis in decades, hopes to save more than $500 million from this round of cuts. 
"Forecasts of the national economy have recently delayed and flattened the outlook for economic recovery," Mark Page, the city's budget director, said in a letter sent yesterday to agency heads. "These forecasts are an important underlying factor in the city's own economic outlook, which drives our expectations of city tax collections. The holiday retail experience, fourth-quarter Wall Street results and recent tax collection experience all suggest that we must be prepared to address a further decline in our tax revenue resources." 
For the fourth time in a year, city agencies must report back to the mayor's Office of Management and Budget with their proposals for cutbacks. The Fire Department, for instance, will need to cut about $28 million from its budget, although the obvious way to save money -- closing firehouses -- is off the table for now as a special panel examines which houses are duplicative. The city agencies' suggestions for cuts are due on Jan 13. Further, a citywide hiring freeze imposed last October remains, officials said.
Last night, the mayor's press secretary, Edward Skyler, declined to comment. 
The mayor is expected to discuss his plans later this month or in early February for closing next year's roughly $3 billion budget gap. He foreshadowed next year's gap in November when the budget for the current fiscal year was modified and he sought cuts in the 2003 budget that would trickle into the next year. 
City agency officials, who have trimmed about $1.7 billion during the past several months, will likely be displeased with this latest round of cuts, but few will be surprised, because Mr. Bloomberg has spoken in blunt language about pain that the city will endure over the next few years.
"Times are bad and so it's not surprising," said one city official. "I think it will be difficult after you've gone though your budget already. We'll look everywhere we've looked before."
Before Mr. Bloomberg and the City Council raised property tax rates 18.5 percent and ordered more spending cuts last month, the city was projecting a $6.4 billion shortfall for the 2004 fiscal year. The mayor has said that recent actions have reduced that deficit to closer to $3 billion. 
However, The New York State Financial Control Board, a monitor created by the state after the 1975 fiscal crisis, recently estimated the gap to be $3.5 billion, citing the administration's reliance on state and federal aid, so far not forthcoming, to close its projected gap. Another group, The Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan city agency, put the gap much lower, at $2.3 billion, in anticipation of improved tax revenues over the next year. In either case, the administration is counting on substantial union concessions and other forms of aid to see it thought the crisis.
In November, the credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's reduced the city's credit outlook to negative from stable, a possible harbinger of a future downgrade to the city's bond rating.
It was unclear yesterday whether this latest round of cuts foreshadows another year of large-scale trimming. The city is still hoping for the local economy to pick up, but has yet to begin to negotiate in earnest with the state for the variety of aid requests it has made. 
"Of course, this is a potentially huge problem," said William B. Eimicke, a professor of public administration at Columbia University. "But it is too soon to get worked up about it. There is still a lot of waiting and seeing what the economy will do, and what the state will do. The cuts will probably not be as draconian as we thought."

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS PICK NEW YORK AS SITE OF '04 CONVENTION 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
The Republican Party tentatively designated New York City today as the site of its 2004 national convention, selecting one of the most heavily Democratic cities in the nation as the place to renominate President Bush in about 18 months.
 It would be the first time in the city's history that it played host to a Republican convention. 
 Republican officials said they chose New York over two competing cities, Tampa and New Orleans, in part because of what they described as the enormous political and emotional symbolism that has become attached to the city since the terror attack on Sept. 11, 2001. They also said New York had offered the best package of financial incentives, including a pledge to raise $53 million in private contributions to defray the estimated cost of $80 million for the gathering.
New York officials, led by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki, both Republicans, had lobbied urgently for the convention to be held at Madison Square Garden, arguing that it would be a psychological and financial lift to the city during difficult times. 
The recommendation was made unanimously today by the Republican site selection committee in a telephone conference call. 
It is expected to be ratified by the 165 members of the Republican National Committee at its annual meeting in Washington this month.
Mr. Bloomberg was called away from a news conference announcing the city's Winter Festival at Lasker Rink in Central Park this morning to take a call from Marc Racicot, the Republican national chairman. Mr. Racicot, a former governor of Montana, was relaying the results of the conference call approving what was, in reality, a White House decision. Mr. Bloomberg returned to his lectern, an ice sculpture chiseled for the occasion, to share a bit of news that his administration had been anticipating for more than a month.
"I just got a call from Gov. Marc Racicot, informing me that he recommended to the site selection committee a host city for the next Republican National Convention, and that the host committee unanimously endorsed his recommendation," Mr. Bloomberg said, with conscious understatement. "I am pleased to inform you that that is New York City."
The Republican Party's selection of New York, an event that would have seemed almost unfathomable just two years ago, was the result of a confluence of factors that has made the city an increasingly irresistible choice to the White House. 
It started with the terror attack itself, which shaped Mr. Bush's presidency and now seems certain to provide a constant backdrop to his renomination, party officials said.
In addition, New York, a Democratic city and a symbol of ethnic diversity, offered itself as a stage for the Republican Party at the very time that the party has been seeking to portray itself as appealing to moderate and minority voters. That effort has been complicated over the past month by the remarks by Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi that even Republicans described as racially insensitive and forced him to step down as Senate majority leader.
While few Republicans believe that holding the convention in New York would improve Mr. Bush's chances of winning a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2 million, several argued today that they achieved the admittedly mischievous result of forcing Democrats to pay attention to a state that they would prefer to take for granted.
Finally, New York now has a Republican governor and New York City a Republican mayor, which is helpful both logistically and symbolically. 
The city is the home of the nation's best-known ex-mayor of either party, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is expected to figure prominently in the convention. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, is up for re-election in 2004, and the party presumably would use the convention platform to help the prospects of his Republican opponent. 
In an initial display of support after the attack, both the Republican and Democratic Parties had said they would consider holding their conventions in Manhattan. The Democratic Party ultimately decided against holding what would have been its sixth convention in New York since 1868, choosing instead to go to Boston, after party leaders said they would consider coming back to New York only if the city abandoned efforts to recruit the Republicans.
Aides portrayed the decision as a major victory for Mayor Bloomberg, and disputed the suggestion that it was an emotional calculation driven by the Sept. 11 tragedy.
"9/11 was never part of our pitch," said Kevin Sheekey, a special adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. "Either they felt the emotional impact and wanted to be there for that reason or they didn't, and it wasn't something we could affect. What we could do is negotiate rates with hotel rooms."
Mr. Racicot said in an interview today that New York was chosen because it had offered the best package of benefits to the Republicans, and he also cited the "enthusiasm that they displayed and the opportunity to showcase our party and our candidates" to the nation. He said gathering in a city so closely identified with tragedy and patriotism was clearly a factor as well.
"I think the entire country has become more closely connected, or reconnected, with the city in a very intimate way," he said, "in a very important way, and being able to coincidentally further that relationship is a good thing." 
The city held one of its pivotal negotiating sessions with the Republican site selection committee last month at the new Ritz-Carlton in Lower Manhattan, where the windows on one side of the hotel offer a view of the Statue of Liberty and the windows on the other side look out on the clearing amid what was once a dense wall of buildings where the twin towers had stood.
Roland W. Betts, a member of the committee of Republicans assembled by Mr. Bloomberg to lobby the White House, is a close friend of Mr. Bush. Mr. Betts said he directly pressed the events of Sept. 11 in lobbying for the convention with both Mr. Bush and Karl Rove, the president's senior political adviser.
"What we focused on was that New York was the best background for the convention, growing out of the events of Sept. 11," Mr. Betts said in an interview. "The alternatives were inappropriate. Florida would have been all about the last election, and we would have to relive hanging chads."
New York officials said the convention, scheduled for the last week in August, would bring 50,000 people and $150 million into the city.
Republican and city officials said that the convention would cost about $80 million to put on, but that the city's only expense would be about $25 million for police overtime and other law enforcement costs.
The incentives package of $53 million from private sources would help defray convention expenses. City officials provided data to Republican officials to demonstrate that the city has been a prime source of political contributions to Republican candidates.
The city also provided Republican officials with signed promises from labor leaders that they would not conduct the kind of strikes or work slowdowns that have troubled other convention planners in New York, and that any disputes would be submitted to binding arbitration.
City officials guaranteed convention planners 22,000 hotel rooms, including 17,000 within a mile of Madison Square Garden, and promised that 9,000 would be available to delegates for $156 a night. In addition, an estimated 15,000 reporters, who in other cities have worked in tents, trailers and spare office space, would be placed across Eighth Avenue from the arena in the Farley Post Office Building, which is to be converted into the new Pennsylvania Station.
Republican officials said that Tampa was unable to match the offer on hotel rooms, and that in Florida delegates would have been scattered far from the convention site. The other major competing city, New Orleans, was unable to match New York City's promise of financial assistance.
"I was disappointed," said Pat Brister, the Republican chairwoman of Louisiana. "I would have loved to have it in New Orleans. We gave it our best shot."
A spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, Jennifer Palmieri, said Democrats were neither surprised nor concerned by the Republicans' decision. "We always thought the Republicans would go to New York, and that is one of the reasons we felt we couldn't go," she said. "We knew the Republicans would be the governor's and the mayor's first priority, and we would always be playing second fiddle."

HEADLINE: In Anti-Strike Step, Venezuela Plans to Split Oil Company 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON with NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez said today that the government planned to take the state-owned oil company, the world's fifth largest, and break it in two, hoping to snap the back of a devastating six-week strike aimed at driving President Hugo Chavez from power.
 Mr. Ramirez, who offered preliminary details of the plan in an interview, said the government intended a sweeping restructuring of Petroleos de Venezuela. 
 The company, widely known by its Spanish acronym, Pdvsa (pronounced peh-deh-VEH-sah), controls the largest oil fields outside the Middle East and is an important supplier to the United States. 
He said the government would "decentralize" the company by dividing it into Pdvsa East and Pdvsa West and hollowing out the Caracas-based management. 
Such a move would effectively gut the company of middle- and upper-level executives who have joined a coalition of business and labor leaders in opposing Mr. Chavez, whose left-leaning policies they say are destroying the country. 
Opponents said floating such a plan amounted to government bluster aimed at breaking the morale of what they estimate are 30,000 oil workers who have joined the strike. 
Mr. Ramirez said the goal was to restore the company's production capacity of some 3.1 million barrels of crude oil a day while reducing "exorbitant bureaucratic costs," which he estimated at $1 billion. He said the company produced about 14 million barrels last month and was currently turning out 800,000 barrels a day, a quarter of what output was before the strike.
Outside experts expressed doubts that the company was producing even that much oil, and they were immediately skeptical that the plan could revive production to pre-strike levels. 
Ramon Espinasa, a former Pdvsa economist and now a consultant to the Inter-American Development Bank, said such a plan could have a devastating impact on what was once considered a model among state-run oil companies, and an equally devastating impact on Venezuela's oil-dependent economy. It could also reverberate through world markets and in the United States, which imports about 14 percent of its oil from Venezuela. 
"We could talk about the need to diversify the economy, but those are long-term goals," Mr. Espinasa said. "But right now, Venezuela's economy needs oil. If not, the country could collapse." 
The plan, experts said, appeared to be far less an economic strategy than a political one, aimed at purging the company of Chavez opponents once and for all and wresting more political control over the industry, even if it means enduring sharp declines in production. 
Moises Naim, former minister of trade and industry and now editor of Foreign Policy, drew comparisons between what is happening in Venezuela today and what happened in Iran after the Islamic Revolution in 1979. 
Iran's oil production, which rivaled Saudi Arabia's, plummeted from six million barrels a day to less than two million. In the decades since, Iran's oil output has been about half the pre-revolution levels. But, Mr. Naim said, the Iranian government has tighter political control of the industry.
"He may be willing to live with a smaller oil industry, and a less competitive oil industry, as long as he has more control over it," Mr. Naim said, referring to President Chavez. "What we know is that Chavez intends to stay in power at any cost."
In a televised address on Sunday night, Mr. Chavez said he had assumed the rank of "oil commander" and promised to rebuild the state company into "a new Pdvsa, a patriotic Pdvsa."
"Pdvsa is being restructured for the benefit of all Venezuelans," he added. "In the near future we will see the fruits that we're sowing."
Mr. Ramirez rejected the view from critics, saying President Chavez remained committed to upholding the industry's strong performance. He acknowledged that getting the fallen industry up again was a Herculean task. The strike has virtually paralyzed Pdvsa, shutting down refineries and strangling exports.
But, he said, the strike had shown the government that the industry could run with a significantly reduced labor force. Restoring oil operations had been delayed by sabotage at most installations, he said. 
But, he added, signs of a slow but steady recovery were clear. He cited a number of tankers that have left Venezuelan ports and the restarting of two main oil refineries, at Puerto La Cruz and El Palito. 
No one outside the national oil company is certain of the current state of Venezuela's oil fields. Opposition leaders, including Luis Pacheco, a former director of corporate planning at Pdvsa, dismiss government industry reports as "pure fiction." He estimated that the government was producing about 200,000 barrels a day, enough to meet minimal domestic demands and fulfill some export commitments.
Government estimates seem to vary by the hour. On Sunday night President Chavez said the industry was exporting 1.5 million barrels a day. On Monday morning the Pdvsa president, Ali Rodriguez, reported that the industry was producing 600,000 barrels a day. Mr. Ramirez put daily production at 800,000 barrels. 
Outside experts estimate that the government is producing at most 400,000 barrels a day.
"Clearly, by inflating production figures, his game plan is to psychologically wear down the workers," said Michael Shifter at the Inter-American Dialogue, referring to President Chavez. "As time passes, he believes, the workers will get fatigued and come back to their jobs, before they lose them forever."
But, he said, exaggerated rhetoric runs both ways. Every day, the opposition issues oil industry reports promising that President Chavez is close to running out of gas -- literally and politically.
"They are desperate," Mr. Shifter said of the opposition. "They feel this is their last battle, and that if they lose, there will be no way to get Chavez out."
Industry experts concur that "the longer the strike goes on, the more problems Venezuela will have in reactivating their wells," said George Beranek, manager of market analysis at the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting group. 
Much of the difficulty in restoring output arises from the unique properties of the country's crude oil. Of the three million or so barrels of oil a day that Venezuela once produced, about 75 percent was heavy oil, Mr. Beranek estimated.
Heavy crude is particularly viscous, and the petroleum from Venezuela's vast Orinoco belt is so thick that it is classified as bitumen and must be processed at specially outfitted domestic refineries before it can even be called oil and shipped to standard refineries overseas. Heavy oil has a tendency to gum up unless it is under the constant pressure and flow that is used to extract it. 
So Venezuela risks permanently losing hundreds of thousands of barrels a day in production capacity from a protracted shutdown. 
In 1998, for example, when very low oil prices led Venezuela to shut some wells, the country permanently lost 500,000 barrels a day in capacity, said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
He estimated that about one-third of Venezuelan fields could be restored quickly, in about two weeks, based on his discussions with experts from Petroleos de Venezuela. Most of the rest would take another four to six weeks, he said, with about 400,000 barrels a day of bitumen from Orinoco requiring even more time.
All that assumes that the fields were shut down properly, but few outside Pdvsa know for sure. "From a technical standpoint, if a field is shut down properly, it should come on properly," said a representative of one Western oil company active in Venezuela. "But no one really knows how the fields were shut down."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 8, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Venezuela's plans to reorganize the state-owned oil company as part of an effort to recover from a strike misstated the amount of crude oil exported by the country to the United States. It was about 1.45 million barrels a day before the strike; that is about 14 percent of the United States' total imports of 11 million barrels -- not 14 percent of the 19 million barrels that the United States consumes daily.

PERSON: John S. Dyson 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
He Loves New York, Right Down to Its Wine

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
"A BEAUTIFULLY hued wine," the vintner's description of Hunt Country Red reads, "with jammy blackberries and plum on the nose. It's mouthfeel is medium-weight and soft, revealing more intense flavors of black raspberry and gooseberry."
 From whence does this nectar spring? The storied hillsides of Bordeaux? Actually, not. The merlot, cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon grapes that all get mushed together are grown just up the road in Millbrook, N.Y. 
 Goes well with pizza, it is said. And, best of all, thanks to a hard-fought battle in the United States District Court in Manhattan, you should be able to order it delivered wherever you live, direct from the vineyard. In a heavily footnoted, 32-page decision last month, Judge Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled it was unconstitutional for New York State to forbid interstate shipment of wine direct to the consumer.
This is good news for John S. Dyson, economic development czar for the city and state, inventor of the "I <heart> N.Y." campaign, wealthy investor, and now, as a winemaker with properties not only in the Hudson Valley but also more traditional viticulture turf in California and Tuscany, a principal figure in the suit challenging the traditional middleman role of distributors in the wine industry.
"We're trying to open the market to make life easier by getting rid of the middleman," Mr. Dyson said. His interest in wine goes way back. Unlike the rest of the Alpha Delta Phi brothers at Cornell in the early 60's, he didn't much like beer. So he bought a big round jug of wine -- Almaden Mountain chablis, as he recalls -- for himself and his date at a house party. Pretty suave. Others thought so, too, and soon "we had to send out for reinforcements."
The fraternity social chairman, a brewski holdout, deemed the subject "too complicated, too snooty," Mr. Dyson said, but responded by putting him in charge of wine procurement. Mr. Dyson even went to the dean asking to take the wine and spirits course in Cornell's famed hotel school, an unheard-of effrontery from a student in the agriculture college. Soon, he was conducting regular Friday evening wine tastings. 
Like many students at the time, Mr. Dyson was inspired by John F. Kennedy and stunned by the president's assassination in his junior year. When he graduated with a degree in agricultural economics in 1965, he vowed -- "perhaps naively" -- to go into public service. He went on to the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton for a master's in economic development. At Princeton, he finished up an Army R.O.T.C. course that led to a Vietnam tour as an officer in military intelligence -- "one of the better oxymorons," he said, chuckling.
But first there was an introduction to politics, as an aide to an upstate Democratic congressman, Joseph Resnick. In 1968, Mr. Resnick made the unwise decision of challenging the long-serving Republican Senator Jacob K. Javits. With a dearth of Democrats, Mr. Resnick suggested that young Mr. Dyson run for his old office. There was a strong third-party candidate, a Conservative named G. Gordon Liddy, who might draw votes from the Republican, Hamilton Fish Jr. But the Republicans enticed Mr. Liddy out of the race with the promise of a White House job, giving, as Mr. Dyson recalls it, Mr. Fish a narrow victory.
"So I'm inadvertently responsible for Watergate," Mr. Dyson said.
This is not the only thing Mr. Dyson has to answer for. He also negotiated the contract with Disney that, depending on your point of view, led either to the revival of Times Square or the clogging of the Crossroads of the World with bovine lumps of out-of-town gawkers.
HE grew up in Bronxville and Scarsdale and, from age 14, worked during the summers at his family's farm in the picture-book village of Millbrook. Originally part of a dairy farm, the barn has been converted into a winery; a porch extends out from what was once a hayloft for sipping and viewing the Hudson Valley and the distant Catskills.
A relatively rare upstate Democrat, Mr. Dyson helped write the state party's platform in 1974 and when Hugh Carey won, he was appointed agriculture commissioner at 32. With the economy in deep distress, he took on the job of commerce commissioner, adding 100,000 jobs and millions in revenue with his advertising campaign. He was also chairman of the state power authority and, under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, deputy mayor for economic development and a key figure in repairing the infrastructure damage after the attack on the World Trade Center.
Mr. Dyson's wine business began modestly enough in 1979 with a single test acre planted in several varietals and rootstocks -- part of a boutique farming movement in the Hudson Valley ranging from fois gras to fallow deer that aims to keep the land in agriculture. Now, the Millbrook winery alone produces 12,000 cases a year.
Early on, Mario M. Cuomo, then a candidate for governor, called to talk politics one day and Mr. Dyson's wife, Kathe, said he was out in the garage, making wine.
"What?" a startled Mr. Cuomo said. "The WASP's are making wine, and the Italians are running for office? Am I missing something?"

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE WHITE HOUSE; 
Bush Welcomes Slower Approach to North Korea

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
The White House sought today to defuse a worsening confrontation with North Korea, applauding the International Atomic Energy Agency's decision to condemn North Korea's nuclear activities but delay taking the issue to the United Nations Security Council for sanctions.
 President Bush repeated three times this afternoon that he had no intention of attacking North Korea -- an effort, it seemed, both to give the North a security guarantee and ease a diplomatically embarrassing difference with South Korea and Japan over how to handle the crisis. 
 "I'll repeat that," Mr. Bush told reporters after a cabinet meeting today to start off a new year of domestic and international initiatives. "We have no intention of invading North Korea." 
Only a week ago, as Mr. Bush vacationed in Texas, his aides were saying they would support the atomic energy agency in taking the issue straight to the Security Council, which would then consider economic penalties.
Now that approach appears to have been reconsidered. In recent days, some senior officials have warned that penalties could prompt a military response from the North -- just as the administration is preparing forces for the Persian Gulf.
Tonight, as Tuesday unfolded in North Korea, its government warned of exactly that. "Sanctions mean a war and the war knows no mercy," the official Korean Central News Agency said. "The U.S. should opt for dialogue" with North Korea, it added, "not for war, clearly aware that it will have to pay a very high price for such reckless acts." The statement echoed a similar warning to the Clinton administration in 1994.
Despite the apparent shift in approach by Mr. Bush, his aides said he would not budge on his refusal to talk to North Korea until it readmits inspectors and refreezes its nuclear programs.
A senior South Korean official criticized that approach today, saying: "Talk is essential here. How do we know what the North will say until there is some dialogue with the United States?"
North Korea is only one of a number of issues that the president confronts as he approaches his second anniversary in office. 
Israel's announcement that it would bar Palestinian officials from traveling to London for talks on the Middle East later this month complicated his effort to show that some progress is being made on those issues even as he heads toward a military confrontation with Iraq.
Pakistan continued its arguments over whether American forces could pursue suspected members of Al Qaeda into its territory, once again calling into question the administration's claim that the country has been a full partner in its effort against terror.
While Mr. Bush planned to use the next few weeks to make the case for action to remove Saddam Hussein of Iraq from power, one leader of the inspection teams admitted that nothing incriminating had yet been found -- and some allies began to question whether there was enough evidence yet to build a coalition for military action. "We haven't yet seen any smoking gun," the head of the atomic energy agency, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, said in Vienna. He said laboratory tests of samples taken at sites visited by his inspectors -- presumably guided by some American intelligence data -- "have not raised any eyebrows."
Such assessments only complicate the issue for Mr. Bush, as he faces the question of how -- and whether -- to make the case in the Council in the next few weeks that Iraq remains in violation of its resolutions, and that military action is required.
North Korea's actions in recent months have been far more provocative than Iraq's. In October, it acknowledged a secret program to enrich uranium, violating its 1994 agreement with the United States. The Bush administration and its allies responded by cutting off oil shipments. And in December, the North disabled cameras, broke seals and ejected inspectors at a nuclear plant capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium.
Its flagrant violation of its nuclear commitments has put Mr. Bush in the position of arguing that Mr. Hussein, who is letting inspectors move freely even as he rails that they are gathering "intelligence," poses a more imminent threat to world security than North Korea. The North is believed to already possess two nuclear weapons and could reprocess its stockpile of spent nuclear fuel rods to produce enough plutonium for five or six additional nuclear weapons by this summer, the Central Intelligence Agency estimates. 
"Part of the reason that we don't want to get North Korea's problems in front of the Security Council too quickly," one senior official suggested today, "is that the other Security Council members will be overwhelmed by too many problems at once. And these problems are different enough that you don't want one polluting the other."
At the United Nations, American diplomats say Mr. Bush has not yet decided whether to return to the Security Council to seek a second resolution authorizing war against Iraq. They concede, as Dr. ElBaradei seemed to suggest today, that the weapons inspections in the country are not yet far enough along to produce evidence that would convince skeptical Council nations that Iraq cannot be disarmed peacefully. Even Jack Straw, the British foreign minister, suggested today that it would be helpful to secure broad Security Council support for any military action -- though he stopped short of saying that should be a prerequisite for a strike. 
France, China and Russia, three of the other four permanent veto-bearing members of the Council, insist on a second debate and vote before they will support any military action against Baghdad. They contend that this second step is laid out in Resolution 1441, which was adopted unanimously in November to start the weapons inspections.
Top State Department officials are inclined to go for a second vote, one official there said. In December Secretary of State Colin L. Powell denounced the omissions in Iraq's declaration of its arms programs as a "material breach" of Council resolutions. But if the weapons inspectors do not uncover any secret weapons programs, American officials have little choice but to wait for a broad progress report that Dr. ElBaradei and Hans Blix, the chief United Nations inspectors, will give the Council on Jan. 27.
Mr. Bush plans to make the case, aides say, that the inspectors' failure to find evidence only proves Mr. Hussein's cleverness as an adversary -- that he has spent the past four years hiding evidence of his weapons of mass destruction. Today Mr. Bush pressed his case anew, describing Mr. Hussein as "a threat to our friends and neighbors in the Middle East," though he did not describe Kim Jong Il of North Korea as a threat to American allies in Asia.
Over the next few days, the White House's diplomatic focus will shift back to North Korea. At a meeting planned for Tuesday among senior Japanese, South Korea and American officials, South Korea is expected to present a compromise proposal under which the United States and North Korea would make reciprocal moves -- the former toward a nonaggression pact and aid, the latter toward nuclear commitments.
But today, Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said the issue was not who moved first, but the North's track record of going back on its agreements. "South Korea was in the midst of its 'sunshine policy,' " he said, "when North Korea was setting the sun on its word."

HEADLINE: Silver Says Only U.S. Aid Is Likely to Stop a Tax Rise 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
As the governor and lawmakers waited to see what help President Bush might offer the state in his speech to the nation on Tuesday, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly said that unless Washington comes to the rescue, the state is likely to have to increase taxes to close a giant shortfall in next year's budget.
 Republicans in control of the State Senate immediately rejected the idea of tax increases of any kind, but Gov. George E. Pataki, who has been tightlipped about his budget plans, did not rule them out. He said the public would have to wait until his annual address to the Legislature on Wednesday for a clue to his plans. 
 "I think suspense is a good thing," he said.
One possible reason for Mr. Pataki's reticence is uncertainty over what aid the state may be getting from Washington. President Bush plans a major address on Tuesday in which he will propose cutting taxes to stimulate the economy and providing about $10 billion in aid to financially troubled state governments.
What that means for New York State remained unclear this evening. Members of the state's Congressional delegation said the president's aides have not told them precisely how the $10 billion will be divided among the states or where it will come from. Among the ideas under discussion is changing the formulas driving Medicaid and highway grants, to direct more money to the states.
New York faces at least a $2 billion gap in this year's $89.6 billion spending plan. The shortfall next year will be at least $8 billion and perhaps as much as $10 billion, according to Senate and Assembly legislative aides, as well as independent budget analysts.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said such a large gap could not be closed without either raising revenue, gaining more money from the federal government or cutting education and health care, two areas he vowed he would not allow to shrink. He said that a temporary income tax surcharge on the wealthy or on corporate income would be a good choice, if a tax increase proved necessary. He also said he favored lifting a cap on state borrowing, to weather the crisis.
"Tax increases are not out of the question here regardless of the rhetoric you may hear from some people," he said. "I would like to avoid it, like everybody else, but I also, specifically, do not want to cut education aid."
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, however, said he and his Republican colleagues would kill any proposal for a broad-based rise in taxes. "The speaker's knee-jerk reaction is always raise taxes, just raise taxes, and that's how you settle your problems, and it just doesn't work that way," Mr. Bruno said in a radio interview.
Mr. Bruno maintained that the state had lost hundreds of thousands of jobs under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo because of the state's high tax rate. "We are not going back to those days, I can tell you that," he said. "The speaker can talk all he wants about raising taxes. That's not on our horizon."
For his part, Governor Pataki said he was still shaping his plan for closing a budget gap for the fiscal year starting on April 1 and would not even know the size of the shortfall until the middle of January, when December tax revenue is counted and people with large investment incomes make partial tax payments.
During the election, the governor successfully avoided saying how large the deficit in the coming fiscal year would be, and in recent days he has only referred to the state's straits as "a crisis" or "enormous challenges." Today he edged closer to quantifying the shortfall, saying, "We are facing perhaps as much as a $2 billion gap in this fiscal year, and many times that in next year's budget."
Mr. Pataki promised to lay out his plan in broad terms in his speech to a joint session of the Legislature this week, but he said the details will come on Jan. 29, when he presents his budget to lawmakers. "We will be late, as late as we can, to see what the numbers look like," the governor said.
The governor has been lobbying the White House to provide federal assistance to help the state government make up for plummeting revenues ever since the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001, his senior aides said.
Senator Charles E. Schumer said he had not been informed how much aid New York might expect from President Bush's proposal, but if the federal government allocated $10 billion according to population, the state would get approximately $700 million. "My guess is this will be done on a per capita basis, because they don't want to reward states with deeper deficits," he said.
Representative John E. Sweeney, a Rensselaer County Republican, said White House officials were keeping details of the proposal under wraps, though he had been told the Medicaid and highway grants were being considered as a vehicle for increased state aid.
"We haven't seen anything yet," he said. "I don't know yet that it's settled. Our job is to try to make sure New York gets its fair share."

HEADLINE: Fund Manager to Meet His Irate Investors in Court 

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Kenneth Lipper, money manager to the stars before his hedge fund collapsed a year ago, will try to persuade a judge today that he can pay his investors back -- most of their money, at least. But many of the investors are furious, saying that the plan favors some clients over others.
 Among hedge fund failures, his is a memorable one. Mr. Lipper startled the financial industry when he announced last February that his Lipper Convertibles Fund had lost $315 million, or 40 percent of its value. The fund was full of telecommunications and energy bonds that plummeted in value for much of 2001, though he says the real damage was obscured until a couple of his leading managers left early last year. 
 Mr. Lipper cuts an unusual figure for a hedge fund manager. He was a deputy mayor in the administration of Edward I. Koch and a Hollywood figure who advised Oliver Stone on the filming of "Wall Street." He produced and helped to write the screenplay for "City Hall" in 1996 and, as a co-producer, won an Oscar in 1999 for "The Last Days," a Holocaust documentary. 
Early on, he seemed to have an eye for the bright lights. Mr. Lipper was always on the periphery of fame and celebrity, but never quite able to achieve it.
He grew up in the South Bronx with Al Pacino in the 1950's, was a Salomon Brothers partner with Michael R. Bloomberg in the 1970's and early 80's, and pitched movie projects to Steven Spielberg in the 1990's.
The clients in his fund included Michael D. Eisner, Julia Roberts and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, and spanned the upper reaches of society in Hollywood and in New York.
While their losses may seem like pocket change to celebrities, Mr. Lipper is losing a lot more. His funds have been shut down, his clients have left him and he is expected to be liable for what is sure to be many millions of dollars in legal and restitution payments. Most painful to him, his friends say, is the evisceration of his reputation in Hollywood and on Wall Street.
Though there is one investor lawsuit against him, Mr. Lipper is presenting a petition in court today to distribute the remaining money in the fund. Mr. Lipper, not normally camera-shy, is expected to let his lawyers speak for him in court.
While he has cultivated an array of identities over the years -- Hollywood producer, screenwriter, book publisher, patron of the arts and deputy mayor -- he is, at root, a product of Wall Street. As a scrappy young banker at blue-blood Lehman Brothers in the early 70's, Mr. Lipper made the important social and financial connections that would lay the base for his eventual hedge-fund career. As a Salomon Brothers partner in 1982, he made the big money that would help finance his evolution into a Renaissance man of sorts.
In quick order, he became a New York deputy mayor, and in 1985 he signed on as a technical adviser to Mr. Stone in the filming of "Wall Street."
"Ken doesn't get to Oliver Stone without Lehman Brothers," said Michael M. Thomas, a former Lehman Brothers partner who hired Mr. Lipper in 1969. "Hollywood is tricky. I think Ken tasted one drop too much of the nectar, and that drop was the difference between balance and intoxication."
While the collapse of Mr. Lipper's fund may seem to some like a captivating morality tale, its dissolution is not so unusual. The hedge fund industry, unlike its mutual fund counterparts, is largely unregulated. Hedge funds are predicated on the notion that well-heeled investors are ready to take on higher risk for higher returns.
With Mr. Lipper's convertibles fund, for example, clients had to invest at least $1 million to become a partner. Implosions, especially in today's volatile markets are common. According to Tremont Advisors, of the 1,797 hedge funds it followed at the start of 2002, one-fifth had ceased operations by the end of this year.
Like many such funds, Mr. Lipper's was a kind of mom-and-pop shop. Working in one of his offices was James Atlas, who edited a series of brief biographies that Mr. Lipper was supporting financially. A daughter, Daniella, worked as an analyst for the funds, and his No. 2, Abraham Biderman, is a longtime friend from his days in the Koch administration. While the fund employed a compliance officer and was audited every year, the internal controls were lax enough to allow Mr. Lipper's portfolio managers to misprice securities for a six-year period.
But a question remains: Did Mr. Lipper have any hand in the mispricing of the securities or did he simply take his eye off the ball? 
Convertible arbitrage investing is meant to be low risk, with a built-in hedging mechanism. Mr. Lipper's fund, though, suffered as its holdings of telecommunication and energy bonds collapsed in 2001.
According to Mr. Lipper's version of events, he discovered that something was amiss only a year ago when Edward Strafaci, the portfolio manager for the convertibles fund, abruptly resigned on Jan. 14. Mr. Strafaci also oversaw a smaller offshore fund, which suffered similar losses and has since been liquidated.
Mr. Lipper quickly determined that holdings of convertible securities had been mispriced, meaning that the fund's value had been artificially inflated. Many of these securities -- bonds convertible into stocks -- are thinly traded, if at all, and determining a market price can seem like a subjective exercise.
In a Feb. 20 letter to investors, Mr. Lipper attributed the 40 percent loss that the fund would suffer in 2001 to fallout from the Enron debacle, the decline of telecommunications companies and the economic losses from the attacks of Sept. 11. In a subsequent letter he announced that the fund would be closed and that the remaining assets would be returned to investors. Investors would not be able to withdraw funds until he had completed a top-to-bottom re-evaluation of the fund.
Recently, Mr. Lipper has begun to suggest that it is his portfolio manager, Mr. Strafaci, who is at fault for the mispriced securities. Mr. Strafaci could not be reached for comment and has not been the subject of investor lawsuits. 
On Dec. 12, Mr. Lipper sent investors a summary of a report conducted by the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. The report concluded that the securities in the Lipper convertibles fund and the smaller offshore fund were mispriced by their managers, resulting in the distorted valuations, and cited Mr. Strafaci.
In an accompanying letter, Mr. Lipper stated: "You may be aware that the United States attorney's office is conducting an investigation into the funds. We are advised that none of the current directors, officers or personnel of Lipper Holdings or the funds is either the subject or target of the investigation." 
In the same letter, he outlined his plan to pay back his investors. It is this plan that a New York State Supreme Court judge, Karla Moskowitz, is to rule on today. For a start, Mr. Lipper plans to revalue the remaining assets based on an examination by the accounting firm BDO Seidman.
According to Mr. Biderman, the plan aims to return to investors, on average, 83 percent of their invested funds. "We are working to redistribute the money to whom it belongs," Mr. Biderman said. "We just want to do what is right. So far, 65 percent of our investors support the plan."
Mr. Lipper declined to comment.
The remaining 35 percent or so are opposed, some vehemently so. These partners are among the early investors in the Lipper funds and, in a brief filed to Judge Moskowitz, they state that the Lipper plan discriminates against them, in favor of investors who came on board in 2000 and 2001, when much of the fund's money was raised.
"You can't rewrite history," said Mark P. Ressler, a lawyer representing these investors. "The plan violates the partnership agreement. Plus, based on these mispricings, Lipper took in $40 million in performance fees. If he is going to revalue the capital account, he should revalue his performance fees."
A number of investors, both in support of and against the plan, are planning to sue Mr. Lipper on grounds of negligence and fraud, lawyers say.
Those that worked with Mr. Lipper on Wall Street say his strength was as a relationship banker, and he was not an expert in arcane areas like convertibles arbitrage. Without an acute understanding of these investment fields, it is all the easier to lose money.
Mr. Lipper's supporters say they find it hard to believe that he would be involved in an attempt to distort the fund's value. After all, he had much of his own money at stake, along with that of his four daughters and his former wife, Evelyn Gruss. 
"I've known Ken for more than 30 years; we joined up at Lehman Brothers in 1969," said Roger Altman, a former deputy Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and the chairman of Evercore Partners, an investment bank. "Ken always had a natural aptitude for finance, and I know him to be an honest person."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Commercials for the Super Bowl return to the tried and true.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
JUST as the identities of Super Bowl XXXVII's two foes become clearer with each playoff matchup, so, too, do the plans of marketers for running commercials during the game, the biggest advertising event of MMIII.
 The traditional formula followed by advertisers -- sponsoring spots that are replete with stars, humor, surprises, music and animals -- is back in style after the recent spate of dot-com hyperbole and post-9/11 patriotism. 
 For instance, a prominent victim of the taxman, the singer Willie Nelson, will appear in a commercial for the tax preparer H&R Block. And PepsiCo and its agencies are enlisting the shilling skills of the Osbourne family and Michael Jordan to sell two beverage brands, Pepsi Twist and Gatorade, respectively.
Only a half-dozen of the 61 half-minute commercial slots in the game remain to be sold on the ABC broadcast of the National Football League championship game, to be played on Jan. 26. "We're right where we should be at this time," said Ed Erhardt, president for customer marketing and sales at ABC Sports and its sibling, ESPN, both part of the Walt Disney Company. 
"We're better than 90 percent sold today," Mr. Erhardt said yesterday. "We expect good demand for what's left, and there's not a whole lot left." Fox, which broadcast the game in 2002, had sold slightly less commercial time at this point last year.
The commercial time remaining in this year's Super Bowl is in the third and fourth quarters, which typically sell more slowly than spots in the first half. Usually, Super Bowl viewing does not significantly drop off as a game goes on, unless the score is tremendously lopsided; if the score is close at the end, as it was last year, the ratings often grow.
Though Mr. Erhardt declined to discuss prices for Super Sunday spots, agency and media executives say they are paying or being asked to pay an average of $2 million to $2.2 million for each 30 seconds. That represents a nice increase from the estimated average of $1.9 million charged for Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002.
Even in a difficult economy, "a leader demonstrates a desire to lead, to grow the company," said Robert Hanson, president for the Levi's brand at Levi Strauss & Company in San Francisco. Levi Strauss will run a commercial in the second quarter to introduce the Type 1 line of jeans.
"It's the Super Bowl of advertising, too, so running a commercial makes a statement," he added, "asserting our stature as a category leader for a product launch that's the most important in Levi history."
The commercial, by the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, will provide the final clue in a contest now under way on the Levi Strauss Web site (www.levi.com) to win a package valued at $150,000, for the 150 years the company has been in business. The spot, which features a stampeding herd of buffalo to salute the Levi Strauss Western heritage, carries the theme "Bold since 1853," which morphs into an updated promise of "Bold since 2003."
Speaking of updated, the commercial for Gatorade uses special effects to depict the present-day Michael Jordan being challenged to a game of one-on-one basketball by a 1987 version of himself. The spot, which began running last week during the college football bowl games, ends when a college-age Jordan seeks a chance to play. While Gatorade is seen each year on the sidelines during the game -- and on the field if a team carries a barrel into dousing range of its coach -- the spot is the brand's first appearance as a Super Bowl advertiser.
"It's a very purposeful choice," said Dennis Ryan, chief creative officer at Element 79 Partners in Chicago, the Gatorade agency, which is part of the Omnicom Group. "Gatorade is coming off its most successful sales year ever, and we want to build on that momentum."
The commercial was produced with digital effects from Digital Domain and directed by Joe Pytka, who has worked with Jordan on many commercials.
Another reason for Gatorade's Super Sunday foray is that it is now owned by PepsiCo, which acquired its former parent, Quaker Oats, in August 2001. "PepsiCo has done well by this media venue," Mr. Ryan said, referring to the popularity of spots for snacks sold by the Frito-Lay division as well as soft drinks sold by the Pepsi-Cola division.
Two soda brands -- Pepsi Twist, a lemon-flavored version of Pepsi-Cola, and Sierra Mist, a lemon-lime rival to 7Up -- are to be advertised during the game. Last month, a Pepsi Twist commercial with the Osbournes was filmed at the family's Los Angeles home, and that spot is expected to turn up during the Super Bowl. Executives at Pepsi-Cola and its agency, the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of Omnicom, declined to discuss their Super Bowl ad plans.
Also mum on specifics of their Super Sunday strategy are H&R Block and its agency, Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The agency gained attention for a spot during the Super Bowl last year using a re-recorded version of the Beatles song "Taxman." All that Richard Goldsmith, a spokesman for H&R Block, would say is that the commercial would be humorous and feature "a well-known and appropriate celebrity."
That celebrity, according to Promo magazine, a trade publication, will be Mr. Nelson, the country singer who had to pay the government after his home and other assets were seized in 1990 by the Internal Revenue Service for nonpayment of $16.7 million in taxes. The commercial is part of an advertising and promotional campaign to pitch a service from H&R Block called Double Check, which reviews a customer's previously filed tax forms.
(Mr. Nelson's appearance will evoke a commercial for a brokerage firm around three decades ago featuring the boxer Joe Louis, whose tax and financial difficulties were notorious, in which -- if memory serves -- Louis asked, "Edwards & Hanley, where were you when I needed you?")
Other advertisers returning from last year include the two job-search Web sites that will have faced off for five consecutive Super Bowls: Monster, formerly Monster.com, part of TMP Worldwide, and HotJobs, formerly HotJobs.com, part of Yahoo.
"It's our Christmas, if you will," said Marc Karasu, vice president for advertising at HotJobs in New York, as job seekers pursue New Year's resolutions to find better posts and companies firm up hiring plans.
"Marketers are constantly striving to find a way to reach the right person with the right message at the right time," he said. "And here we have people receptive to our message who are actually looking for commercials, because people watch the Super Bowl as much, if not more, for the commercials as for the game."
HotJobs and its agency, Brand Architecture International in New York, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of Omnicom, are still discussing plans for their spot, Mr. Karasu said, which is likely to run in the third quarter. Monster and its agency, Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas, declined to reveal their Super Bowl ad plans.
Other advertisers that are buying commercials in the game include Anheuser-Busch, FedEx, General Motors and Visa.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Farewell, Sauteed Foie Gras, It's Time for Steak and Spuds

BYLINE:  By William Grimes 

 BODY:
LET'S open the menu and see what looks good to eat in the New Year. I see a juicy sirloin steak at Savannah Steak. I'm sure you could get a baked potato with that. There's a New York strip steak at M. J. Grill, an offshoot of Mark Joseph Steakhouse, and plenty of the same at Frankie & Johnnie's. Terrance Brennan, of Picholine and Artisanal fame, has just opened a seafood and chops house, where, lo and behold, one cannot help noticing the filet mignon, porterhouse and other big-shouldered members of the beef family. Just for variety, there's the 48-ounce steak at Shula's Steak House in the Westin New York, where the menu is written on a football.
 Tender steaks for tough times. That's the forecast. It's doubly glum, because the spoiled diners of this overindulged city were living in a culinary paradise through the late 1990's and well into last year. Never have so many been so gloriously fed, even as the economic storm clouds gathered. Year after year, in unfeigned amazement, the Zagat Survey reported an abnormally high number of openings and a low number of closings. In an industry notorious for its near-lethal failure rate, opening a first-class restaurant in New York almost made sense. 
 A confluence of trends helped ensure that the restaurants that did open were, by any standard, of very high quality. The honor roll, in just the last couple of years, is extraordinary, with restaurants like Ilo, Pico, 71 Clinton Fresh Food, Town, Alain Ducasse, Craft, Atelier, Fiamma Osteria and L'Impero. Wall Street money and a booming tourist economy encouraged restaurateurs to roll the dice. Daniel Boulud calculated, correctly, that New York could handle a $29 hamburger. With a little hemming and hawing, the city even adjusted to the almost insolent prices at Alain Ducasse. 
The steady improvement in the city's fortunes, and safer streets, made the city attractive to tourists as never before. Making up for lost time, developers built hotels. Each of those hotels had a restaurant. In fact, there seemed to be an unwritten law that a hotel, to rate as chic, had to have a first-rate restaurant. It might be French, but not necessarily. These prestige showcases allowed a new generation of American chefs -- the successors to the likes of David Burke, Charlie Palmer and Larry Forgione -- to step forward. They turned out to be a nervy, highly talented bunch. 
The city's rising fortunes made formerly fringe neighborhoods ripe for colonization. Just as the Flatiron district lured forward-looking restaurateurs a decade ago, the meatpacking district and the Lower East Side in Manhattan, and Smith Street in Brooklyn, attracted chefs and backers with big ideas and limited budgets. Wylie Dufresne, operating out of a space the size of a coat closet on Clinton Street, established the model for a new kind of restaurant, a supercafe with tiny tables, no decor to speak of and huge ambitions in the kitchen. With the Red Cat and the Harrison, Jimmy Bradley created a new kind of American brasserie, and the long-suffering Upper West Side got its fair share of quality restaurants, led by the splashy Ouest. 
New Yorkers never had it so good. But last year, the luck ran out. The city's restaurant economy, already dealt a stunning blow by the attacks on the World Trade Center, succumbed to the inevitable, as bad economic news became routine. Yes, there were fine restaurants. Italian food got a classy setting and a top-notch chef, Michael White, at Fiamma Osteria. Scott Conant, who labored valiantly at City Eatery on the Bowery, turned up at L'Impero in Tudor City, of all places. His cleanly executed, powerfully flavored cooking, a kind of Italian-Mediterranean hybrid of his own creation, put him in the first rank of younger New York chefs, and Rick Moonen, after an abrupt departure from Oceana, worked the old magic on a new cramped stage at RM. 
I had a few quibbles with Atelier when it opened, but I also sensed enormous potential and genuine daring in the refined, herb-based cuisine of Gabriel Kreuther. This is the restaurant I most want to revisit in the coming year. I suspect it is the last truly brave restaurant New York is likely to see in quite a while.
If anyone needed a tip-off that the dining climate had changed, the sudden disappearance of Cello provided it. Opened to universal acclaim three years ago, it epitomized the late 90's spirit in Manhattan. It was expensive, exquisite and highly dependent on the kind of money that was simply not being spent in the last couple of years, especially by the Wall Street companies that make the wining and dining of clients a multimillion-dollar subindustry in New York. Restaurants that seemed to be doing brisk business night after night were often dying a slow death, as their highly profitable private dining rooms remained unbooked. If Cello, one of the finest restaurants to open in the last decade, could not survive, what hope was there for serious dining in New York? 
Downtown, David Bouley's imperial vision also came to grief. His grand plans for a combination cooking school, Asian restaurant and all-around culinary Xanadu in the Mohawk Building had to be abandoned after the attacks on the World Trade Center forced Bouley Bakery and Danube to close for months. 
For entirely different reasons, the Russian Tea Room limped to an ignominious end three years after Warner LeRoy tried to remake it in his gaudy image. It was a doomed effort. The Tea Room was always more and less than a restaurant. It served as a kind of social club and business center for the agents, performers and power brokers in the cluster of entertainment businesses that grew up around Carnegie Hall over the decades. The business changed. The old agents and moguls died off. The Russian Tea Room lost its reason for existence, and its soul. Nothing could have brought it back to vigorous life, but the idea that the old place could become a golf museum is shocking.
I suspect that 2003 will shape up as the year of living timorously. Already, restaurants all over town are simplifying their menus, dropping their prices and trying to present themselves as bistros, brasseries or diners. Guastavino's has refashioned itself as an American brasserie, and Pico, a restaurant that by rights should be turning away business, has opened a cafe up front. Increasingly, the smart money seems to be flowing toward restaurants that serve the dual function of restaurant and lounge, like Theo, Hudson Cafeteria or Meet. The food may or may not be good at such establishments, but it can get away with being truly bad, as Hudson Cafeteria and Tao have shown. Food is present, but it is not the point. The way it looks is often more important than the way it tastes.
There are points of light on the horizon. The smallest may be the brightest, WD50, Mr. Dufresne's economically named follow-up to 71 Clinton Fresh Food, up the block on Clinton Street. Expectations could not possibly be any higher. Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the last chef on earth who needs to open another restaurant, plans to open one anyway. This one, in TriBeCa, called 66, will be devoted to the cuisine of Shanghai.
Alain Ducasse, perhaps the only chef who can make Mr. Vongerichten seem lacking in get-up-and-go, plans to open a populist dining spot called the Mix, at 68 West 58th Street. Jeffrey Chodorow, who brought New York Hudson Cafeteria and Tuscan Steak (soon to be reborn, with the help of Rocco DiSpirito, as Tuscan), is Mr. Ducasse's partner in this venture, as yet only hazily defined. Mr. Ducasse has given Paris macaroni and cheese. Now let's see what he can do with a root-beer float. Mario Batali is on the verge of opening Otto, at 1 Fifth Avenue, his attempt to show New York what pizza should be. 
Yes, 2003 looks like the year when New York holds its breath for a pizza parlor. Meanwhile, the hapless AOL Time Warner has a corporate palace ready to open on Columbus Circle, just as its stock is flirting with single digits. Naturally, as if the recession never happened, there will be no shortage of budget-breaking restaurants to marvel at. Gray Kunz, at loose ends ever since leaving Lespinasse, looks ready to raise the curtain on the third act of his career. Thomas Keller, perhaps the most critically celebrated chef in the United States, will open a branch of the French Laundry. Masa Takayama plans a Manhattan version of his brutally expensive Los Angeles sushi restaurant, Ginza Sushi-Ko. And the inescapable Mr. Vongerichten is scheduled to chime in with -- what else? -- a steakhouse. 
I'll bet you can't get a baked potato with that.

HEADLINE: WINES OF THE TIMES; 
1998 vs. 1999 Cabernets: Call It a Draw

BYLINE:  By FRANK J. PRIAL 

 BODY:
WHEN we think of Bordeaux, we think almost automatically about vintages. When someone observes, "The 2000's may be the best since the 82's," no one has to ask, "Whose 2000's?" Bordeaux enthusiasts can recite the names of the great vintages -- and the poor ones -- back into the 19th century. 
 California's best wines, taking their cue from Bordeaux, are also vintaged. But there the similarity ends. For all its fame, Bordeaux is a marginal area for growing grapes, and its destiny is controlled by the weather. California's weather patterns can be challenging too but, in the end, it will almost always be more conducive to grape growing and winemaking than Bordeaux's. 
 The 1998 and 1999 vintages in California, which underwent the scrutiny of the Dining section's tasting panel, have emerged in the shadow of a huge 1997 harvest that produced a large quantity of rich, beautifully balanced wines, especially among the cabernets and cabernet-based wines. Both 1998 and 1999 were years in which difficult weather conditions, and El Nino, decreed that winemakers had to work hard to produce good wines from yields that were substantially smaller. 
In spring 1998, heavy and continuous rain made it look for a time as if the vines would never flower, which meant that many grapes would never ripen. The result: a short crop of less than fat, juicy fruit. Spring was laggard in 1999, too, but the fall was sunny and kind to those who waited to pick. Two problematic years that, in fact, turned out better wines than they should have. And, taking their cues from the high-priced '97 wines, winemakers probably set prices higher than they should have been for these less successful vintages. 
Since critical opinions have differed in the last two or three years over which of these two vintages was the best, our tasting panel looked at '98 and '99 California cabernet sauvignons to see just how much, from the consumer's point of view, the vintage designations mattered. As it turned out, very little. In putting together our Top 10 list, there were five each of the '98 and '99 vintages. The panel consisted of three regulars, Amanda Hesser, Eric Asimov and me, along with David Gordon, the wine director of Tribeca Grill, a New York restaurant. 
California produces cabernet from one end to the other, from almost the Mexican border all the way to Oregon. To impose some order on our sampling we concentrated on wines from the premium cabernet growing region in the state, the Napa Valley, with a few Sonoma wines added for contrast. There were 15 pairings of 1998's and 1999's, three of them from Sonoma. Prices ranged from a high of $100 a bottle to a low of $20, with the average just over $43.
Our overall impression was one of consistently good if not outstanding quality, but we sought in vain for any characteristics that defined either vintage or any particular winemaker. As Mr. Asimov noted, "There's consistency here, not individuality." From the least to the most expensive among these 30 bottles, there was a similarity of style that belied so many claims by growers and their advertising agencies that they produce something unique. Napa, I have found, is like Detroit, where they change the door knobs and leave everything else the same.
That said, we did have our favorites. And in those that we preferred we found depth, lushness, a lovely rich fruit aroma and a touch of elegance. Those qualities -- along with the word "expensive" -- certainly fit our top two cabernets, each of which received three stars: one from Sonoma, the 1999 Chateau St. Jean Cinq Cepages ($70), and one from the Napa Valley, the 1998 Grgich Hills ($55). 
The Chateau St. Jean was a big rich wine for a 1999, apparently the result of severe selection. For Mr. Gordon, the wine's structure was formidable, with the tannins and fruit melding into a delicious wine. Mr. Asimov thought it was a "full wine, with a good cabernet aroma."
The Grgich had good body, too, along with the beautiful cabernet bouquet that has been a Mike Grgich signature. Mr. Asimov appreciated its "softness" and its "herbal qualities" and Ms. Hesser its "freshness."
Our best value, the 1999 Honig from the Napa Valley, was rated at two and a half stars and cost $28 -- or $15 less than the average price for the tasting. Ms. Hesser thought it was smooth and elegant, and I thought it was a well-knit, fairly complex wine. 
There were few other wines in our tasting that sold for less than $30, and the least expensive of them all, the 1999 Franciscan Oakville Estate, from Napa, at $20, made our Top 10 chart with two stars, while its 1998 vintage, barely missed. Both Mr.Gordon and Ms. Hesser called the '99 easy to drink. "Very quaffable," they both said.
Two other wines to garner two and a half stars were the 1998 Robert Mondavi from Napa, at $27, and the 1998 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Napa at $95. Stag's Leap's 1999, at $100, also barely missed the Top 10. I liked them both as big, California superripe wines.
A note on prices: One might have hoped that the wine glut and the economy would have combined to lower some of these cabernet prices. An average price of $43 means that the average price of these wines in good restaurants would be more than $60. In these obviously leaner times, that is unacceptable. What's more, in almost every instance, the '99 cost more than the '98, sometimes considerably more.
True, these were both relatively small crops, a factor that might justify increases in better times. But retailers across the country are reporting growing interest in moderately priced wines, meaning $20 or less. Italy, the South of France, Australia and New Zealand, to name a few sources, are producing better wines every year and selling them at attractively low prices. It's time for American producers to take heed. 

Tasting Report: Some Like It Lush and Intense, Others Soft and Restrained

Chateau St. Jean $70
*** rating: three stars
Sonoma County Cinq Cepages 1999
Frank J. Prial summed it up as rich, complex and intense. Eric Asimov called it dense with a long finish. Amanda Hesser said it was nicely fruity, and David Gordon liked its richness. The '98, which was judged lighter and greener, received one star.

Grgich Hills $55
*** rating: three stars
Napa Valley 1998
Firm, rich and dense, Gordon said. Asimov called it fruity and easygoing with enticing aromas, while Prial and Hesser liked its freshness and harmony, with Prial saying it had a true cabernet flavor. The panel liked the '99, too, but felt that it had slightly less depth, giving it two stars.

BEST VALUE
Honig Napa Valley 1999 $28
** 1/2 rating: two and a half stars
The '99 edged the '98, which received two stars. Hesser called the '99 smooth and elegant, and Gordon agreed, saying it was more elegant than the '98. Prial said it was complex and well made, and Asimov preferred the concentration and balance of the '99.

Robert Mondavi $27
** 1/2 rating: two and a half stars
Napa Valley 1998
No question here, the panel clearly preferred the '98, finding it more substantial, intense, lush and fruity than the '99, which received one star. For Gordon, the aromas were too earthy, and Prial said it was too vegetal.

Stag's Leap Wine Cellars $95
** 1/2 rating: two and a half stars
Napa Valley S.L.V. 1998
The panel was split on these big wines; the '99 got two stars. Asimov chose the more restrained '98, finding the '99 overripe and almost syrupy, but Prial voted for the fruitier '99. Gordon called the '99 a fruit bomb, but found more similarities than differences, while Hesser found the '98 more pleasing.

Mount Veeder $40
** rating: two stars
Napa Valley 1998
Another very close call, but the '98 squeaked by the '99, which also got two stars. The panel noted the consistency of the two vintages, but was surprised to find that the more closed-in of the two turned out to be the '98, which opened up with exposure to air. Hesser found the '99 luscious and soft.

Turnbull Napa Valley $37
** rating: two stars
Oakville 1999
Another narrow victory, with the '99 overcoming the '98, which received 1 1/2 stars. Asimov found the '99 rich but soft, and judged the '98 as fleeting. Gordon preferred the fruitiness of the '99 over the vegetal '98, but Prial found the '98 more powerful and rich. Hesser liked them equally, calling the '99 more subtle and the '98 clean with a nice finish.

Franciscan Oakville Estate $20
** rating: two stars
Napa Valley 1999
The '99 scraped by the '98, which also got two stars. Gordon liked the longer finish of the '99, found it easy to drink, while Asimov found it more reticent than the obvious '98. Hesser thought that the '99 was a big wine, but needed more follow-through. Prial preferred the easygoing '98, detecting barnyard qualities in the '99.

Jordan Sonoma County 1999 $48 ** rating: two stars
Asimov and Prial both liked the fruitiness, complexity and long finish of the '99, compared with the '98, which was rated at 1 1/2 stars. Asimov called the '98 simple, and Prial said it was flat, but Hesser preferred the '98, calling the '99 watery. Gordon, who judged the two evenly, found the '98 bigger and the '99 more polished.

Napanook Napa Valley 1998 $38
** rating: two stars
The '98 melded in the mouth, Hesser said. Asimov found the '98 closed but with more potential than the harsh '99, which received one star. He speculated that the '99 would improve with age. Gordon called the '98 dense and the '99 light, while Prial preferred the flowery '98 over the strong '99.

WHAT THE STARS MEAN
(None) Pass it by
* Passable
** Good
*** Excellent
**** Extraordinary

Ratings reflect the panel's reaction to the wines, which are tasted with names and vintages concealed. The panelists this week are Frank J. Prial, Amanda Hesser, Eric Asimov and a guest, David Gordon, wine director of Tribeca Grill. While the number of wines tasted will differ depending on the category, they will represent the selection of wines generally available in good retail shops and restaurants. Prices are those paid in wine shops in the New York region.

HEADLINE: Korea Feeling Pressure as China Grows 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
Half a century ago, the waves of Chinese coming to Korea were soldiers pouring over the Yalu River to impose Communism. Today, the waves of Chinese are delegates to trade and investment conferences or are other foot soldiers for capitalism.
 With Japan, Asia's largest economny, stagnating, South Korea, No. 3 in Asia, is experiencing extraordinary growth in trade and investment with China, which is No. 2. 
 "In five years, we built a route network in China that took us almost 30 years to develop with Japan," said Kim Yong Jin, the manager for Korean Air Lines at Incheon, Seoul's $5.6 billion airport, where China traffic is jumping 20 percent a year. China, already the largest destination for South Korean investment, is now South Korea's largest export market, based on sales, which expanded 29 percent in 2002.
But as China has become South Korea's largest economic partner almost overnight, it has also become a threat. 
"For years, Korea has long been the low-cost, high-efficiency producer, but now Chinese labor is eating into the South Korean margins," said Scott Snyder, Korea representative for the Asia Foundation, a research group partly financed by the United States government. "The Koreans have to run faster -- they are starting to feel the warm breath of China on their backs."
Korea's leading exports to China last year were cellphones and computers, displacing steel and petrochemical goods. By 2010, the Korean government forecasts, China will be on a par with Korea in such major industries as cars, semiconductors and shipbuilding. In other industries, the gap is measured in months.
South Korea's shipbuilders, the world's largest, are turning to building liquefied natural gas carriers and other value-added vessels, since China's shipbuilding industry is already focusing on the market for simpler vessels.
In 2000, Korea's $53.4 billion in information technology production amounted to 5 percent of world production, below China's 6 percent.
And Korea's information technology production is not growing as fast as China's, several recent studies warn.
China has already outstripped Korea in desktop production, printed circuit boards, semiconductors and videotape recorders.
"China is going to, sooner or later, compete with us and catch up in all sectors," said Lee Jung Hoon, a Yonsei University international relations professor.
By 2007, South Korea's industrial hollowing is expected to spread to such technology-intensive industries as electronics and automobiles, as production lines may start moving to China.
Already, almost half of the major production companies around Seoul have moved lines offshore, largely to China. In 2001, for the first time, South Korea recorded an absolute drop in manufacturing workers, a loss of 45,000 jobs.
"Thank God, Mao Zedong gave us a 20-year head start," Song Hee Yhon, dean of the College of Northeast Asian Studies, said, referring to the founder of modern China's low-growth Communist economics. "In three to five years from now, Korea could face the same difficulties as Japan."
Already, Korea is experiencing trade skirmishes with its new biggest economic partner.
China, dismayed by its large trade deficit with Korea, has imposed restrictions on 16 types of Korean products, while Seoul did the same with 6 of China's. Last year, most famously, Beijing put tariffs on South Korean mobile phones to retaliate against Seoul's tariffs on Chinese garlic.
Still, China seems destined eventually to overtake other countries' economic presence here, including that of the United States.
There has already been some shifting. In finance, for instance, American banks like Bank of New York, Bank of Hawaii and Fleet National Bank are closing South Korea branches, as are the Japanese banks Fuji and Asahi. At the same time, branches are being added by two Chinese banks -- the state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation unit of HSBC Holdings.
"The U.S. is still extremely important because of the investment we have here, the technology we bring here -- we have 40,000 Korean students in the states," said Tami Overby, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea. 
But in a decade, Korea's economic ties with China will eclipse those with the United States, a majority of 51 future leaders of South Korea, age 30 to 49, predicted when they were interviewed a year ago by Gallup Korea for a project commissioned by the National Defense University in Washington.
Koreans, who love surveying themselves, give clear signs of making an unchecked investment stampede into China.
In one study, almost 7 out of every 10 Korean overseas investors chose China as their destination, according to the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry. (A Federation of Korean Industries report calculated that the average price of land and the average wage in China are, respectively, one-fourth and one-eighth the levels in Korea.)
In a survey of executives at South Korea's 50 largest business groups, 56 percent said they planned to expand investments in China this year. None planned to reduce investments, according to the Federation of Korean Industries, which released the poll last week.
The pace of deals announced here is dizzying.
Last month, the Hyundai Motor Company, South Korea's largest car company, started producing cars in China, the first step in a planned $1.1 billion investment to produce 500,000 cars there by 2010. Initial sales have been so promising that Hyundai just doubled its 2003 sales target to 50,000.
As evidence of the increasingly two-way flow in investment, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, China's No. 3 carmaker, announced in October that it was investing $60 million in a partnership with General Motors to revive three Daewoo auto plants.
In November, Shinsegae, South Korea's largest retailer, announced plans to invest $400 million in China, starting with two supermarkets in Shanghai next year. At the same time, the SK Group, South Korea's third-largest conglomerate, announced plans to increase its investment in China eightfold next year, to $100 million.
In the last decade, the Samsung Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate, has invested $2.5 billion in China, creating 10 sales subsidiaries and 26 production companies, employing a total of 42,000 people. Aiming at China's growing middle class, Samsung produces double-door refrigerators, automatic washing machines and liquid-crystal-display televisions there, and is considering passenger cars, notebook computers and LCD computer screens.
With Seoul a 90-minute flight to places in Northeast China where there are large populations of ethnic Koreans, South Korean companies are studying the possibility of moving offshore Korean-language back-office units like call centers and data processing.
South Koreans are setting up two industrial parks in Chinese cities near North Korea: one in Shenyang, the other in Dandong.
Speaking Chinese has become as valuable a skill as speaking English. "The number of member companies seeking Chinese-speaking employees increased fivefold last year," according to Lee Kwang Seok, president of Incruit, an Internet-based employment agency.
Outside a Chinese-language institute in Seoul, Hwang Chung Tae, a high school junior, gave his thumbnail view of Northeast Asia: "South Korea is such a small country, and the population is way too high. Japan is dying now. But China is getting to be a big star. We like China."
Travel agencies have been offering discount tours to China, and an estimated 1.8 million South Koreans, or 4 percent of the population, visited there in 2002.
Korean Air Lines and Asiana Airlines, the nation's two largest airlines, now have competing route networks, with each airline flying from Incheon to 13 cities in China and to 13 cities in Japan. Korea is midway between much of Japan and eastern China, and Incheon hopes to become the regional hub.
Seong Y. Park, honorary chairman of the Kumho Group, which owns Asiana, also has great expectations. "I see big opportunities in China," he said. "I can imagine one billion passports."

HEADLINE: Minolta and Konica Plan to Merge by Endof 2003 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
It is a two-front war of Napoleonic proportions: battling against bigger, more cash-rich rivals at home while trying to fend off leaner, hungrier competitors overseas. 
 Konica and Minolta, two major Japanese makers of cameras and office equipment, found themselves in similar strategic straits, trying to squeeze out profits on crowded commercial battlefields dominated by the likes of Canon, Ricoh and Sony. So they have decided that the answer is to band together: they announced today that they would merge by year's end. 
 At first glance, the combination, to be called Konica Minolta Holdings, seems to be as synergistic as they come. Konica's strengths are in film and lenses, while Minolta is best known for cameras and printers. Together, they will rank fourth in Japan's precision equipment industry, which includes photographic equipment; they said today that they hoped to increase sales by 18 percent and to more than double profit, to 150 billion yen ($1.25 billion), by March 2006. 
"We should win a large share in the fields we think are valuable," said Yoshikatsu Ota, president of Minolta. "I don't think we will lose out" to bigger rivals.
But like many Japanese merger partners, the two companies are choosing to bulk up and butt heads with their opponents, rather than focus more narrowly on the most profitable parts of their businesses. The pattern is a ritual in nearly every industry that matters in Japan, from airlines to banking to construction. So is the usual outcome: the combined company typically controls more of its market but ekes less profit from it than before, its stock price falls and its debts mount.
The Konica-Minolta combination will be big, starting with sales of 1.1 trillion yen ($9.2 billion) and nearly 39,000 workers, but not big enough to displace Canon, Fuji Photo Film or Ricoh. Those three -- the precision equipment industry's top three spots -- have a 90 percent lock on the copier market in Japan. 
The picture is even more challenging overseas, where Minolta makes four-fifths of its sales. In the United States, the companies are up against Hewlett-Packard, Xerox and Kodak; in Asia, they face Samsung and other manufacturers operating in countries where wages and other costs are much lower than in Japan.
"Globally, the Japanese are still technology leaders, but there are too many competitors," said Carlos Dimas, an analyst at West LB Securities in Tokyo. "The market for digital cameras and office equipment is flooded, regardless of whether they are Chinese, Korean or Japanese."
The companies said they would eliminate about 4,000 jobs, or 10 percent of their combined work force, over the next three years to reduce costs. But executives offered few details about debt, saying only that they would continue the two companies' current restructuring plans, which began three years ago.
Cutting costs is crucial, particularly at Minolta, which has debts equal to more than five times equity, making it one of the most deeply indebted in the industry. It has lost money for the last two years, and Moody's Investors Service rates its debt at B2, five notches below investment grade.
By contrast, Canon is expected to report a record profit for the current fiscal year, and both it and Sony are generating extra cash from their businesses.
Minolta is also losing out as the camera industry increasingly turns digital. Global sales of digital cameras are expected to grow 25 percent in 2003, according to the InfoTrends Research Group. Canon, Sony, Matsushita Electric Industrial and other Japanese makers are inundating the market with cheap models that consumers have a hard time telling apart. But they are draining sales from one of Minolta's mainstay businesses, analog single-lens reflex cameras.
Konica has a much healthier balance sheet than Minolta, and has done well selling film in China, Russia and other emerging economies. But it has never gained much traction in the world's most lucrative film market, the United States, where Kodak and Fuji Photo Film dominate.

HEADLINE: Carnegie's Season, With More to Come 

BYLINE:  By ANNE MIDGETTE 

 BODY:
The Berlin Philharmonic's first American appearances under Simon Rattle and a new Perspectives series with Emanuel Ax, Michael Tilson Thomas and Dawn Upshaw: these are some of the offerings on the 2003-4 schedule at Carnegie Hall, announced on Tuesday.
 The formal introduction of the season's biggest innovation, though, the opening of the new Zankel Hall -- a 650-seat performance space beneath the present building -- has been put off to a separate occasion in April. 
 While its concerts remained tantalizingly unannounced, Zankel Hall still made its presence felt on Tuesday. All four new works commissioned by the Carnegie Hall Corporation, for example, will have their world premieres in the hall. 
These include chamber pieces by Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Kaija Saariaho and Steven Stucky, all involving Mr. Ax. Mr. Ax's Perspectives series focuses on Debussy, and these three new pieces are all based on Debussy's plan for a set of six sonatas, left incomplete at the composer's death. The fourth world premiere is a work for soprano and ensemble by Osvaldo Golijov, to be performed by Ms. Upshaw. 
Because of the programming for Zankel Hall, Carnegie is also presenting some 20 fewer concerts in its two other halls, the Isaac Stern Auditorium and Weill Recital Hall. The number of presentations overall will be higher. 
"This season we have managed the institution within the fiscal realities," said Robert Harth, the hall's executive and artistic director, alluding to the straitened circumstances faced by all arts organizations in the current economic client. "I still believe passionately that classical music is alive and well."
In September John Adams is to assume the Debs Composer's Chair, a three-year position. Two of his works -- "My Father Knew Charles Ives" and "Guide to Strange Places" -- will have their New York premieres in the course of the season.
Opening night, on Oct. 1, will be the first of three concerts by the Kirov Orchestra under Valery Gergiev, with the violinist Maxim Vengerov as soloist in Lalo's "Symphonie Espagnole." Mr. Vengerov will return later in the season, performing Bach's solo partitas and sonatas. 
The Berlin Philharmonic's three November concerts range from two Haydn symphonies to the American premieres of a piece by Henri Dutilleux for soprano and orchestra (featuring Ms. Upshaw) and a piece by Heiner Goebbels.
Sir Simon will also lead the Philadelphia Orchestra in the New York premiere of Hans Werner Henze's 10th Symphony.

HEADLINE: REGIONAL MARKET: 14th Streeet; 
Building Gets Face-Lift As Area Turns Upscale

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
The 70,000-square-foot two-story retail building at 25 West 14th Street, empty of tenants since 1990, has been given a face lift in the last two and half years by a new owner who hopes to capitalize on the neighborhood's continued revival. 
 A spa is operating in 25,000 square feet of the top floor of the building. Negotiations continue with several prospects for the remaining space, according to the owner, Mark Holdings, in partnership with Apollo Real Estate Advisors L.P., which frequently focuses on redeveloping properties. Apollo has earmarked $250 million to invest in redevelopment opportunities in New York, including Lower Manhattan, said Richard J. Mack, an Apollo partner. 
 Mr. Mack said the partners bought the 14th Street building, between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, in April 2000 because of its location in a re-emerging retail area with favorable demographics. He said data from several retail brokers showed there were more than 100,000 students in the surrounding area.
Another reason for the $14 million purchase was the opening of Urban Outfitters, a youth-oriented apparel and housewares chain, at Avenue of the Americas and 14th Street. That store "created an anchor from Fifth to Sixth Avenue and a transition from mom-and-pop stores to higher-end retail," Mr. Mack said. He added that the Apollo project would continue the street's transition to more upscale retail tenants from the cut-rate stores that now dominate much of the block to the west. 
Karen H. Shaw, the executive director of the 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement District, said the area's revival was moving from its eastern and western edges to its center, and 25 West 14th Street was part of that.
The 1920's building has had several uses and owners, including New York City, which in the 1980's occupied the top floor as an employment center while bargain shops filled the lower levels. Subsequent owners neither leased nor renovated the building, which became tattered.
The current owners invested some $5 million to give the building, with 75 feet of frontage on 14th Street, a new facade, replete with large windows. 
Robert K. Futterman, a Manhattan retail broker, said the revival of the street as a shopping destination, which he said began in 1987, had been slowed by "the uncertainty surrounding other big sites in the area." Most of those sites have since been redeveloped or filled, he said. The former 14th Street Armory, between Seventh Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, has been replaced by an apartment tower that also houses a Y.M.C.A. At the old Bradlee's site on Union Square, he added, Whole Foods, the grocer, and Forever 21, the women's clothing chain, have leased some of the available space.
Rents in the area of 25 West 14th Street are $75 to $100 a square foot a year, compared with $125 to $200 on 14th Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, Mr. Futterman said.
Mr. Mack said rents at his building were $85 to $90 a square foot for the ground floor, $25 to $30 for the lower level, and "in between the two" for the top floor. The spa, which is named Clay, leased that floor in January 2001, 18 months before the renovation was completed.
As for the rest of the space Mr. Mack said, "we spent a long time negotiating with one tenant for the bottom two floors only to fail to sign a lease." He said the partners could have leased the space to small users but continued to look for national and local tenants needing large blocks of space, which are scarce. 
Luring such tenants to midblock sites has, however, been difficult. Patrick Breslin, a senior managing director at GVA Williams, a commercial brokerage firm, said that "except for corner sites, 14th Street west of Fifth Avenue hasn't grabbed the attention of national tenants."
Apollo's 14th Street redevelopment was part of the $530 million the company has invested in New York since 1993, most of it in redevelopment projects, totaling 12 million square feet of office, retail, industrial and residential space. Mr. Mack said now was a good time to invest $250 million more in part because his company believed that the economy would cause some corporations to sell real estate to raise capital.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
RAND vs. Santa Monica: the New Headquarters

BYLINE:  By MORRIS NEWMAN 

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif. 

 BODY:
When it is completed in the fall of 2004, the RAND Corporation's five-story, elliptical-shaped, 309,000-square-foot building may soon become a local landmark. More important to city planners, perhaps, is that the start of RAND's long-awaited project opens the door to the redevelopment of the Santa Monica Civic Center, an area where RAND, a prestigious research institute, was a major land owner until a few years ago. 
 But what may be most remarkable is that anything is built at all, given the history of 20 years of dashed plans and impasses between RAND and the Santa Monica city government. 
 At issue has been an oceanfront site that looked like an unparalleled opportunity in real estate but turned out to be nearly impossible to develop. The major figures in the story were RAND, a scholarly institution that made its decisions with plodding care, and a city with land-use controls so stringent that its name has become a synonym among developers for slow growth. 
RAND is a private, nonprofit organization that divides its research between military matters, its traditional strength, and other public policy issues including health and housing policy. Currently, it is consulting "with nearly every agency of the federal government," its executive vice president, Michael D. Rich, said. Previous board chairmen include Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and the former Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill.
RAND has occupied the coveted oceanfront site in Santa Monica since the early 1950's, when it began acquiring land near city hall and the municipal auditorium. By the end of the 1970's, RAND had accumulated nearly 15 acres and a sprawling building of 285,000 square feet.
By the early 1980's, the limitations of the building were becoming apparent. Electricity and plumbing were frequently interrupted, and in January 1994, the Northridge earthquake damaged the building.
A lack of air-conditioning caused average indoor temperatures to rise six degrees in the last 20 years, according to Mr. Rich. The second floor became so uncomfortable that people routinely began wearing shorts or working at home. RAND distributed free frozen fruit bars to staff members when the outside temperature exceeded 85.
Starting in the early 1980's, staff members prepared numerous studies on upgrading the existing building (with at least five different approaches) as well as on the benefits of constructing a new headquarters.
"It's not surprising that a research institution would take as long as this" to make a major facilities decision, said Iao Katagiri, a RAND deputy vice president. "The first, knee-jerk reaction here to any question is to make a study." 
RAND had some complex problems to solve. It viewed the Santa Monica property as its real estate nest egg, and hoped to pay for the new headquarters from either a land sale or a development deal.
The property was a rare asset near Southern California's densely developed coast. In the half-century since RAND settled in the city, Santa Monica had grown from a small town of summer cottages and storefronts -- the model for the seedy Bay City in the detective novels of Raymond Chandler -- to an affluent community favored by high-technology companies and the entertainment industry, among others. 
A flood of projects, together with skyrocketing land values, made some residents think they were under siege from developers. Starting in the 1970's, the Santa Monica City Council imposed many limits on commercial construction.
"The city prides itself on being tough on developers," said Dale Goldsmith, a partner in the law firm of Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman Machtinger & Kinsella of Los Angeles, who represented RAND in land-use negotiations with Santa Monica officials. "On a scale of difficulty from 1 to 10, the city gets at least a 12." 
During the mid- to late 1980's, RAND negotiated with three developers at different times to build an addition on a portion of the site. But in 1988, Santa Monica reduced by two-thirds the density that could be built on the site, as part of a sweeping down-zoning of the city. 
In hopes of obtaining more generous development terms, RAND took part in a three-year process to create a new plan for the civic center. The final version increased the density slightly, allowing as much as 500,000 square feet for a new RAND building, 250,000 square feet of commercial office space and 350 housing units. But even with the density increase, developers said they were having trouble coming up with financially feasible projects under the city's growth restrictions. Nearly three dozen developers reviewed and turned down the possibility of building on a site abutting the Pacific. 
Every proposal that developers brought forward "was too large for the community but not large enough to be financially viable" for developers, Mr. Rich said.
This rare asset was beginning to look like a white elephant until 1999, when the city manager at the time, John Jalili, broke the stalemate by persuading the City Council to buy about 11 acres of the RAND property for $53 million. 
"With public ownership of the land," said Mr. Jalili, who is now retired, "the city has more control." The revised plan calls for 330 housing units and new parks on former RAND parking lots. 
Hurdles remained. The city's planning commission turned down RAND's initial proposal for the site in 2000, in part because officials wanted the institute to allow beach-bound pedestrians to walk through the lobby of the new building.
But public access is anathema to an institution that cordons off much of its space from people without security clearances. Santa Monica officials relented only when RAND threatened to leave the city altogether, according to Mr. Rich. The Council approved the present project in November 2001.
The new headquarters is being built on a 3.7-acre site just south of the old building, and will be flanked by 300 housing units and 20,000 square feet of retail space. The old building will eventually be razed and its land converted to a park, in accordance with the new civic center plan, which emphasizes open space. 
If the long gestation of the RAND headquarters had its frustrations, the wait also allowed the staff ample time to determine what was most desirable in a new headquarters. 
Despite its sculptural form, which some people compare to a fish and others to a football, the design of the building was impelled by RAND's organizational and functional needs, said the architect, Paul Danna, a principal at DMJM Design of Los Angeles. "The issue of equality is a constant theme," Mr. Danna said. Accordingly, virtually all offices in the building are identical, measuring 10 feet by 14 feet.
RAND management also sets high value on chance meetings among people from different disciplines and the potential for intellectual cross-pollination. In the computer age, Ms. Katagiri said, "there is a disturbing tendency for researchers to isolate themselves."
Mr. Danna recalled a conversation with James A. Thomson, RAND's president, who said the perfect building would be a circle, "because it had no corner offices or dead ends." 
While a circle would be impractical, according to the architect, the designers arranged the floor plan in the form of two arcs, somewhat like two slices of cantaloupe facing each other. Courtyards on the first three levels connect the opposite wings of the building, while sky bridges on the upper two levels are expected to be lively social areas as well as corridors.
The design of the new building, Ms. Katagiri said, "creates reasons for people to get up from their chairs and meet face to face."

HEADLINE: California Curbed 

 BODY:
The decision by Interior Secretary Gale Norton on New Year's Day to reduce water flows from the Colorado River to farmers in California's Imperial Valley and 17 million urban consumers in Southern California was right on the mark. Though Ms. Norton could have found ways to delay the order, doing so would only have encouraged California to continue its undisciplined and unfair diversion of water to which a half-dozen other states also have rightful claim. 
 Some Bush administration critics called the decision political payback for California's support of Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election, as well as for the state's running quarrel with Washington over environmental and other issues. This argument is beguiling but untrue. Secretary Norton was simply following a path charted by her predecessor Bruce Babbitt. She was also responding, properly, to the wishes of six other states along the Colorado and its headwaters whose explosive population growth has created a thirst for Colorado River water as compelling as California's. 
 These states have been insisting that California start living up to an agreement it signed more than 70 years ago stipulating that it would divert no more than 4.4 million acre-feet of Colorado River water per year. During its long period of rapid growth, California routinely took more than its allotment. Nobody complained until the 1990's, when the other states started expanding too. So Mr. Babbit brokered a complex deal, a "soft landing" that would give California 15 years to break its water habit and return to its original allotment. He told the various parties to work out the details by Dec. 31, 2002.
A key part of the deal called for the farmers of the Imperial Valley -- who use nearly three-quarters of the allotment to begin with -- to sell some of their water to the coastal cities. But the farmers could not agree among themselves, the deadline passed, and Ms. Norton had little choice but to start reducing the flow.
These reductions will cause no immediate harm to either the farms or the cities. But a long-term solution is necessary, and is likely to involve transfers from the farmers to the cities. That will not kill off the farming economy, but it may mean switching to less water-intensive crops. More broadly, though, it will mean that a state that has always had a hard time living within limits will learn some valuable lessons about doing so.

HEADLINE: S.U.V. From Toyota in 2004 To Use Hybrid Technology 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
Toyota announced today that it would start selling a hybrid version of a small S.U.V., the RX 330 from its Lexus brand, by the end of next year. 
 The Lexus hybrid is likely to be the first luxury auto to use the highly fuel efficient technology and the second such S.U.V. on the market. Hybrids supplement the internal combustion engine with electric power. 
 "You can't deny the hybrid potential," said James E. Press, the executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. "The Prius proves the business case," he added, referring to the company's current hybrid, the subcompact Toyota Prius. "We're not losing money on Prius. It works, Customers love it."
The plan, described at a press preview of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit this week, was part of a flurry of announcements here about fuel efficient technologies. Which particular technology was being talked up depended on which automaker was doing the talking.
On the hybrid front, General Motors said Monday that it would make its first foray into hybrids by offering the technology as an option on the Saturn Vue S.U.V. in 2005. G.M. also plans to offer more limited forms of electric power in four other high-volume models by 2007, with a target of improving fuel economy by at least 12 percent. 
Toyota and Honda, which began offering hybrid vehicles in the late 1990's, have been the only two automakers to offer hybrid power so far. The Ford Motor Company plans to sell a hybrid version of its Escape S.U.V. in December.
The public relations frenzy over fuel efficiency comes in the face of increasing regulatory and social pressures to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. European executives, accustomed to wide acceptance of fuel-efficient diesel engines in their markets, said they hoped for a diesel renaissance in the United States. 
Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of the Chrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler, said that he still had considerable doubts about the business case for hybrids -- increased government tax incentives are seen as crucial to their future growth -- and that he believed that modern advances in diesel engines were more promising. 
"We do believe diesel represents a great opportunity for the country altogether; this certainly would be something that would make sense," Mr. Zetsche said. His company plans to start selling about 5,000 diesel versions of its Liberty S.U.V. in 2004. And Chrysler's corporate cousin, Mercedes, said this week that it would offer a limited number of diesels on the E-Class sedan in 2004. 
Diesels are more fuel efficient than standard gasoline-fueled cars and, because of that, would reduce emissions of carbon, which is believed by many scientists to add to global warming. But environmental groups contend that diesels still have unacceptably high emissions of smog-forming pollutants. 
Rick Wagoner, chief executive of G.M., was pessimistic about the prospects for the technology in the United States. "Our read from Washington, the environmental communities, has not been very constructive on diesels, to put it mildly," he said. "We're not anti-diesel, but we're somewhat guarded." 
"Our latest check on this wouldn't indicate there's a groundswell to support it," he added.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Saturn campaign tries using alternate worlds to change its image.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the movie and song "Town Without Pity"? An ambitious campaign to promote the struggling Saturn division of General Motors as a more youthful brand could well be called "Town Without Parents."
 The fanciful towns shown in the campaign, which starts with television commercials that are scheduled to begin a three-month run tomorrow, represent stages in life from childhood and high school to college and marriage. 
 In the spots, four 20-something friends drive through the imaginary cities in new Saturn subcompact cars called Ions. They are startled to find populations composed only, in turn, of children at play, students on prom night, party-hearty fraternity members and young marrieds in tuxedos and wedding gowns. The device is intended to illustrate the idea that the new line of small Saturns, which will replace the undistinguished S-series of sedans and coupes, is "specifically designed and engineered for whatever's next." 
The idea, certainly offbeat for the typically straightforward automotive category, is the creation of Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, the hot creative shop that wrested the $350 million Saturn account from a crosstown rival, Publicis & Hal Riney, almost a year ago.
The commercials are the centerpiece of an estimated $35 million campaign. They will be seen during "reality" shows like "Survivor: The Amazon" and the "MTV Real World/Road Rules Battle of the Sexes," and series like "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and "ER." Ion is also benefiting from product placement in "Cram," a new program on the Game Show Network; contestants are seen in Ions the way the contestants of "American Idol" were shown driving around in Ford Focuses. The campaign also includes print advertisements, radio spots and interactive marketing.
Ion is crucial to efforts by Saturn to at long last broaden its product line as well as stimulate sustained growth instead of the stop-and-go performance of the division since its debut in 1990. (Analysts say Saturn has yet to turn a profit.) 
Ion is also central to attempts by Saturn's parent, the General Motors Corporation, to burnish the images of its brands in an important market, drivers ages 18 to 34. Marketers highly prize members of this demographic group, the so-called Generation Y, because their brand preferences are deemed far more malleable than those of older people.
"Generation Y is up for grabs," said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates in Rutherford, N.J., an automotive consulting company. "The Saturn initiative is in the right direction, but Saturn is one of a crowd heading there."
In fact, Ion is among a veritable freeway-full of marques and models being aimed at younger adults. Among the estimated 50-plus entries are the RAV4 and new Scion line from the Toyota Motor Company; the Focus from the Ford Motor Company; the Jetta and New Beetle from Volkswagen; the Civic and Element from the Honda Motor Company; and just about everything being sold by the Hyundai Automotive Group, under the Hyundai and Kia names, and the Mitsubishi Motors Company.
"Saturn needs a real jolt," said George Magliano, director for automotive industry research at the New York office of Global Insight, an economics consulting company. "It doesn't have a cachet, a following with the younger buyer."
"Everyone is touting Ion as a big improvement over its predecessor, but it competes in the very price-competitive small-car market," probably the toughest place to be, he added.
Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research in Bandon, Ore., an automotive consulting company, said, "It would do better as a Chevy," the division that leads General Motors in sales, market share and, arguably, brand awareness.
Needless to say, executives at Saturn and Goodby, Silverstein, part of the Omnicom Group, disagree.
"We do have a strong brand" that "resonates well with people," Jill Lajdziak, vice president for sales, service and marketing at Saturn in Detroit, said yesterday in a telephone interview.
"Saturn brings in conquest business for G. M.," she added, referring to company data showing that 79 percent of Saturn buyers said their second choice was a vehicle from one of G. M.'s competitors.
As for critics who say it is too late to turn Saturn around because G. M. starved the division of new and redesigned vehicles for too long, Ms. Lajdziak said: "There's absolutely time to do that. It's all about the product, and we're doing that now. We're going to grow the portfolio, and we're not going to stop here."
Besides the Ion sedan, now out, and the coupe, due in the spring, Saturn is selling Vue, a small sport utility vehicle, which was introduced last year, and a restyled version of its larger L-series car line. A hybrid gasoline-electric version of the Vue is set for 2005, Ms. Lajdziak said.
The decision by Saturn in January 2002 to dismiss Publicis & Hal Riney, part of the Publicis Worldwide unit of the Publicis Groupe, shocked Madison Avenue. The agency, originally Hal Riney & Partners, was the only one the division had used. And it established an identity for Saturn as "a different kind of company" that sold "a different kind of car."
Riney "will always be credited with helping us create a tremendous brand," Ms. Lajdziak said, "but as we looked to the future, we had to ensure we had a very contemporary and relevant" approach "to our work, and Goodby, Silverstein is the right partner." The agency is known for its buzz-generating campaigns for marketers like Anheuser-Busch and Hewlett-Packard.
"A lot of advertising done to 28-year-olds tries to establish a relationship between them and the cars, showing how cool you'll be," said Jeff Goodby, co-chairman and partner at Goodby, Silverstein. 
"We want to go beyond that," he added, "and show how the car fits into, and is an integral part of, the lives of these people as they go through different stages."
That echoes the concept behind the first big commercial from Goodby, Silverstein for Saturn, which was introduced in August to acclaim. The spot turned heads because it showed no cars, but depicted people behaving as if they were in cars, walking in crowds on expressways, carrying headlights at night, making turns onto side streets.
"Saturn has always had a heart and soul to its advertising," said Jamie Barrett, creative director and associate partner at Goodby, Silverstein, referring to the warmly emotional work produced by Riney. "We just wanted to contemporize it to reach the younger consumer in a way that would not strain the credibility of the brand."
Showing the friends visiting the towns "says that we're all at different stages of life," Mr. Barrett said, "but we're all moving forward." And they are deliberately presented together rather than traveling alone, he added, to "establish that for this group, driving is not just transportation but a very social experience."
The expectations for the Ion are high. Saturn hopes to sell about 150,000 Ions in 2003, Ms. Lajdziak said, compared with the estimated 117,000 S-series cars sold last year as that line was being wound down. In 2001, Saturn sold 162,000 S-series cars, she added.
Saturn sales have careered in recent years like a car swerving across a multilane highway. In 2002, sales totaled 280,314, up 7.5 percent from 260,730 in 2001 and the division's best performance since it sold 285,674 cars in 1995. In contrast, total G. M. sales last year fell 0.9 percent from 2001. But the Saturn results in 2002 still fell below the record year of 1994, when sales totaled 286,003.

HEADLINE: Spending on Health Care Increased Sharply in 2001 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
Spending on health care is increasing at the fastest rate in a decade, reflecting greater use of hospitals and prescription drugs and the declining influence of managed care, the government reported today.
 The steep increase in spending has put immense new pressures on consumers, employers and public programs. 
 In 2001, health spending rose 8.7 percent, to $1.4 trillion, and accounted for 14.1 percent of the total economy, the largest share on record, the report said.
Spending averaged $5,035 for each person in the United States. The increase came even as the nation slipped into a recession, exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
Experts say the rapid growth may lead to new efforts to rein in health costs.
"Historically, increases of this size have been closely followed by government policy changes or private sector initiatives to put the brakes on health care spending growth," said Katharine R. Levit, an economist who supervises preparation of the government's annual report on health spending.
The steep increase adds to the burden on states, wrestling with severe fiscal problems, and private businesses, struggling with a soft economy. It also intensifies pressure on Congress to move health care to the top of its agenda.
The major reason for the increase in health spending, Ms. Levit said, was an increase in the amount of medical goods and services purchased to care for an aging population.
"There was some increase in prices, but it was not as large as the increase in quantity," Ms. Levit said. The increase in quantity took many forms: more days spent in hospitals, more outpatient services, more diagnostic tests, more prescriptions and greater use of new technology, which has the potential to extend life and improve its quality.
At the same time, consumers have flocked to looser forms of managed care, which impose fewer restrictions than health maintenance organizations.
"Managed care's influence has waned in the last few years, contributing to acceleration in hospital and overall health spending," Ms. Levit said.
Medicare spending, for the elderly and disabled, rose 7.8 percent in 2001, while spending under Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people, soared 10.8 percent. The growth of Medicaid was driven by an increase in enrollment, resulting from the recession and from state efforts to expand coverage.
The report, published today in the journal Health Affairs, describes prescription drugs as the fastest-growing category of health spending. The nation spent $140.6 billion on such medicines in 2001, up 15.7 percent from the prior year. In 2001, for the first time, spending on drugs exceeded spending on nursing homes and home health care combined.
Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana, said the surge in health spending was alarming. "If we don't find a way to reduce the rate of increase in health costs," Mr. McCrery said, "we'll end up with a government-controlled health care system in which we control costs by rationing."
Democrats said the new data to supported their view that Medicare was more efficient than private insurance.
"Medicare increased payments to providers such as hospitals, home health agencies and nursing homes and still managed to keep overall spending growth to 7.8 percent in 2001," said Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California. "Meanwhile, private insurance premiums went up 10.5 percent. Given these results, I cannot understand why Republicans continue to devise plans for turning Medicare over to private health insurers and H.M.O.'s."
But Republicans said that consumers had little incentive to shop for bargains in the health care market because they were insulated from most costs. Of every $100 spent on health care, consumers pay $14 from their own pockets, for co-payments and deductibles and items not covered by insurance.
Even though 41 million Americans are uninsured, the United States devotes more of its economy to health care than other industrial countries. In 2000, health accounted for 10.7 percent of the gross domestic product in Switzerland, 10.6 percent in Germany, 9.5 percent in France and 9.1 percent in Canada, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
From 1992 to 2000, while the United States experienced the longest economic expansion in its history, health spending grew rapidly, but so did the economy. As a result, health care accounted for a stable share of the gross domestic product, 13.1 percent to 13.4 percent. But in 2001, the share grew eight-tenths of a percentage point, the largest increase on record.
The increase is a "warning signal," Ms. Levit said, adding: "We can move about two-tenths of a percent of our economic output to health care each year without too much pain. But when we see these sudden spikes, the adaptation we have to go through in order to pay for it is usually more than we can bear."
The growth in drug spending eased in 2001, after increases of 16.4 percent in 2000 and 19.7 percent in 1999, as fewer new drugs entered the market and employers raised co-payments in a successful effort to encourage greater use of generic drugs.
Pharmaceutical companies say prescription drugs still account for a relatively modest share of total health spending, 9.9 percent in 2001, compared with hospitals and doctors, which together account for more than half.
Spending on hospitals rose at the fastest clip since 1991, reaching $451.2 billion in 2001, up 8.3 percent from the prior year. 
In 2001, spending for doctors and clinical services rose 8.6 percent, to $313.6 billion, the government reported. Ms. Levit said the growth probably resulted from increases in imaging procedures and in visits to doctors' offices. Drug advertising, she said, prompts some people to visit doctors to get prescriptions.

HEADLINE: Records Show Merck Unit Favored Its Parents' Drugs 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
A federal judge in New York unsealed internal records of Merck & Company yesterday that detailed favorable treatment that Medco Health Solutions, a Merck unit, gave to some of the company's most important drugs.
 The records were unsealed by Judge Charles L. Brieant of Federal District Court in White Plains in connection with a group of long-running class-action lawsuits against Merck and Medco. 
 Merck agreed last month to pay $42.5 million to settle the suits, but lawyers for some of the plaintiffs have asked the judge to reject the settlement, which they contend is too lenient. Merck has said it does not admit any liability in agreeing to the settlement. 
The lawyers, who represent operators and members of health plans, have accused Medco of violating fiduciary duties to customers by failing to disclose the extent of Medco's ties to Merck and other manufacturers.
Medco, which had about $30 billion in sales and 65 million members last year, is one of the largest of a handful of pharmacy benefit management companies, which negotiate with drug manufacturers to obtain discounts and rebates on behalf of employers and health plans. Others include AdvancePCS, Express Scripts and Caremark Rx.
According to the documents, which spell out average prices and market share for dozens of drugs from 1995 to 1999, Medco bolstered sales of Zocor, for example, an expensive, Merck cholesterol-lowering treatment.
In spite of a high price, Zocor had 31 percent of all Medco sales of similar cholesterol-lowering drugs in December 1999, the records said, compared with about 25 percent of national sales as compiled by IMS Health, a health care data company. 
At that time, the posted wholesale price of Zocor was $116.22 for a 30-day supply in retail pharmacies, compared with $82.22 for Lipitor, made by Warner-Lambert (now part of Pfizer), and $90.55 for Pravachol, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The price of a three-month supply of Zocor by mail order was $276.17, compared with $212.82 for Zocor and $239.69 for Pravachol. 
Anita Kawatra, a spokeswoman for Medco, said Medco was "doing what every pharmacy benefit management company does," adding that "the whole point of existence for any P.B.M. is to negotiate better deals for clients" by selecting one or two preferred drugs in each therapeutic class. 
Medco's market share computation indicates that its Zocor sales grew mainly at the expense of Pravachol and similar drugs made by Novartis and Zeneca. Lipitor held onto about 46 percent of Medco's sales for such drugs. That was about the same share Lipitor had nationally.
The Medco records substantiate disclosures that Merck made last year in an unsuccessful attempt to spin off Medco as an independent company. Merck said in Securities and Exchange filings that the share of Merck drugs sold through Medco was 37 percent higher than the share for non-Merck drugs.
The prospectus for the sale of Medco stock said that Medco would have to pay penalties to Merck if it was unable to continue selling a larger share of Merck drugs than the national market share of those products.
Merck withdrew the spinoff plan last summer as stock market prices declined broadly. 
The Medco records that were unsealed yesterday were only a fraction of thousands of documents that Merck had produced under questioning by plaintiffs' lawyers. Four news organizations -- The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The St. Petersburg Times in Florida and Reuters -- asked Judge Brieant to unseal all the documents. The judge rejected those requests.
James Tallon, a defense lawyer, said in a letter to the judge last month that only a short list of documents should be unsealed.

U.N. Study Sees 500,000 Iraqis Facing Injury In Case of War

BYLINE:  By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
As many as 500,000 people in Iraq could suffer injuries and require medical treatment if the United States and its allies launch a war there, according to a confidential United Nations contingency planning report made public today.
 The document, called "Likely Humanitarian Scenarios," was posted on a Web site by a British student group, Campaign Against Sanctions on Iraq, which is concerned about the impact of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. The group did not explain how it had obtained the document. 
 United Nations planners paint a dire picture of Iraq after extensive bombing and ground fighting. The large casualty estimate is based on this scenario, which would involve far greater loss of life than the narrow bombing campaign conducted in the American-led Persian Gulf war in 1991.
"It is also likely that in the early stages there will be a large segment of the population requiring treatment for traumatic injuries, either directly conflict-induced or from the resulting devastation," the report says, warning that half a million people "could require treatment to a greater or lesser degree as a result of direct or indirect injuries."
The report also estimates that about three million people across the country will face "dire" malnutrition and require "therapeutic feeding." It paints a picture of a crippled nation with its roads, bridges and railroads shattered, its electricity grid badly damaged and its oil industry battered and paralyzed.
The report warns that "the outbreak of diseases in epidemic if not pandemic proportions is very likely," citing the risk of cholera and dysentery.
United Nations officials declined to identify which agency of the organization had produced the report. But a spokeswoman noted that it was common for the United Nations to make assessments in advance of the human needs that might arise in war crises where it will be involved.
"Any well-run organization has to be prepared for disasters that may occur while hoping they do not," said the spokeswoman, Hua Jiang. She added that the world organization "hopes there will be full compliance with Security Council resolutions and consequently no new crisis."
The report predicts that the warfare will be much more damaging to the civilian population than in the gulf war of 1991, evolving beyond a bombing campaign with narrow targets to "potentially a large-scale and protracted ground offensive." Infrastructure could be damaged by allied bombing or "the withdrawing government forces," the document says.
As many as 900,000 refugees could require food and shelter from the United Nations and other relief groups, the report warns. It also foresees the need to set up transit camps near the Iraqi border for as many as 500,000 people. The document warns that injuries from land mines could increase dramatically. 
It notes that the civilian population in Iraq is much more dependent on handouts from the government now than in 1991, before severe economic sanctions had made a deep impact.
The report assumes that international relief agencies will be forced to carry a much greater burden to care for the population if President Saddam Hussein's government is attacked and stops its services.
The United Nations runs Iraq's oil-for-food program, which uses revenue from Iraqi oil sales to buy food and medicine for the civilian population. In view of the large numbers of civilians who could be caught up in a war to topple Mr. Hussein's government and need help from the United Nations, aid officials here started planning several months ago for a possible conflict.

HEADLINE: At a Texas Foundry, An Indifference to Life 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW and LOWELL BERGMAN 

DATELINE: TYLER, Tex. 

 BODY:
It is said that only the desperate seek work at Tyler Pipe, a sprawling, rusting pipe foundry out on Route 69, just past the flea market. Behind a high metal fence lies a workplace that is part Dickens and part Darwin, a dim, dirty, hellishly hot place where men are regularly disfigured by amputations and burns, where turnover is so high that convicts are recruited from local prisons, where some workers urinate in their pants because their bosses refuse to let them step away from the manufacturing line for even a few moments.
 Rolan Hoskin was from the ranks of the desperate. His life was a tailspin of unemployment, debt and divorce. A master electrician, 48 years old, he had retreated to a low-rent apartment on the outskirts of town and taken an entry-level maintenance job on the graveyard shift at Tyler Pipe. 
 He would come home covered in fine black soot, utterly drained and dreading the next shift. "I don't know if I'm going to last another week," his twin brother recalls him saying. The job scared him; he didn't know what he was doing. But the pay was decent, almost $10 an hour, and his electricity was close to being cut off. "He was just trying to make it," his daughter said. 
On June 29, 2000, in his second month on the job, Mr. Hoskin descended into a deep pit under a huge molding machine and set to work on an aging, balky conveyor belt that carried sand. Federal rules require safety guards on conveyor belts to prevent workers from getting caught and crushed. They also require belts to be shut down when maintenance is done on them. 
But this belt was not shut down, federal records show. Nor was it protected by metal safety guards. That very night, Mr. Hoskin had been trained to adjust the belt while it was still running. Less downtime that way, the men said. Now it was about 4 a.m., and Mr. Hoskin was alone in the cramped, dark pit. The din was deafening, the footing treacherous under heavy drifts of black sand. 
He was found on his knees. His left arm had been crushed first, the skin torn off. His head had been pulled between belt and rollers. His skull had split. "If he fought that machine I know his last thought was me," said his daughter, April Hoskin-Silva, her dark eyes rimmed with tears. 
It was not just a conveyor belt that claimed Mr. Hoskin's life that warm summer night. He also fell victim to a way of doing business that has produced vast profits and, as the plant's owners have admitted in federal court, deliberate indifference to the safety of workers at Tyler Pipe. 
Mr. Hoskin worked for McWane Inc., a privately held company based in Birmingham, Ala., that owns Tyler Pipe and is one of the world's largest manufacturers of cast-iron sewer and water pipe. It is also one of the most dangerous employers in America, according to a nine-month examination by The New York Times, the PBS television program "Frontline" and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. 
Since 1995, at least 4,600 injuries have been recorded in McWane foundries, many hundreds of them serious ones, company documents show. Nine workers, including Mr. Hoskin, have been killed. McWane plants, which employ about 5,000 workers, have been cited for more than 400 federal health and safety violations, far more than their six major competitors combined. 
No McWane executive would be interviewed on the record. But in a series of written responses, the company's president, G. Ruffner Page, acknowledged "serious mistakes" and expressed deep regret for Mr. Hoskin's death. "Our intensified focus on safety speaks to lessons learned," he wrote. At the same time, he sought to explain and strongly defend the company's business methods. 
"Over the years, McWane has grown by the acquisition of troubled companies that had become uncompetitive," he wrote. "Through substantial investment in new plant and equipment and more disciplined management practices, McWane transformed these underperforming companies into efficient and viable operations." Disciplined management, he said, has allowed McWane to stave off foreign competitors who have no regard for safety. 
In the last decade, many American corporations have embraced such a vision of capitalism -- cutting costs, laying off workers and pressing those who remain to labor harder, longer and more efficiently. But top federal and state regulators say McWane has taken this idea to the extreme. Describing the company's business, they use the words "lawless" and "rogue." 
The company's managers call it "the McWane way." 
The story of Tyler Pipe, drawn from company and government documents and interviews with dozens of current and former workers and managers, is a case study in the application of the McWane way. It is the anatomy of a workplace where, federal officials and employees say, nearly everything -- safety programs, environmental controls, even the smallest federally mandated precautions that might have kept Rolan Hoskin alive -- has been subordinated to production, to the commandment to keep the pipe rolling off the line. 
Federal safety inspectors tried to make a difference. They cited and fined and cajoled. But for years, records show, little changed. 
"You put people at risk," a former senior plant manager at Tyler Pipe said. "We did every day." 
Which is why even now the toughest of Tyler Pipe veterans remember the day McWane came to town as the day they were, as one of them put it, "kicked into hell."

Introducing 'the McWane Way'
Tyler, a city of 85,000 an hour and a half's drive east of Dallas, began as a stagecoach town, but it came of age around two precious commodities, East Texas crude and some of the finest roses on earth. Oil and roses still help define Tyler, or at least a certain conjured Tyler. The municipal rose garden alone has 38,000 bushes, and the old oil families still carry clout. 
But by the early 90's, the shuttered storefronts down by the county courthouse explained why local leaders were so endlessly worried about the care and nurturing of Tyler's contemporary crown jewels -- the Kelly-Springfield tire plant, two air-conditioner factories and Tyler Pipe. 
These big manufacturers, they knew, represented something extremely valuable and increasingly rare: places where someone with a high school diploma and a strong back could make $15 an hour, where a Mexican immigrant with little English could firmly grasp the next rung. 
The pipe foundry occupies several hundred acres northwest of downtown. Its smokestacks rise high above a north and south plant, each with its own cupola, a multistory furnace that melts tons of scrap metal to produce smoky white rivers of molten iron. The molten iron is poured into spinning cylinders to form pipes, into molds of packed black sand to make fittings.
The company would not let a reporter tour the plant. But employees describe simply stepping inside as an overwhelming experience. First is the heat, wave upon wave of it, sometimes in excess of 130 degrees. Then there is the noise -- of pipe slamming into pipe, of pneumatic tools that grind and cut, of massive machines that shudder and shake, of honking forklifts and roaring exhaust systems. Dust and fumes choke the lungs and coat the lights, leaving the plant floor a spectral labyrinth of glowing pipes and blackened machinery. 
In the early 90's, Tyler Pipe employed about 2,800 people and did about $200 million in business a year. It was modestly profitable, and the owners, the Tyler Corporation, were conventionally paternalistic. They distributed turkeys at Christmas and door prizes at the annual employee barbecue. Regulators said the plant, while far from perfect, made an effort to comply with safety and environmental rules.
In late 1995, the Tyler Corporation sold the foundry to McWane. In one stroke, McWane had bought one of its main rivals and acquired its largest plant. 
Within weeks, senior executives flew in from Birmingham and set about executing a plan of stunning audacity: Over the next two years, they cut nearly two-thirds of the employees, yet insisted that production continue apace. They eliminated quality control inspectors and safety inspectors, pollution control personnel and relief workers, cleaning crews and maintenance workers. 
"It got pretty bad," recalled Kevin Fowler, the human resources manager from 1996 to 1999. "If I walked into a department people would wonder if I was coming with their termination." 
Alarmed by the layoffs, city leaders sought meetings with McWane executives. Their requests were rebuffed. "They just disassociated themselves from the city," Thomas G. Mullins, the chamber of commerce president, recalled. 
To keep up production, McWane eliminated one of three shifts; instead of three shifts of eight hours, there were two 12-hour shifts. At the end of a shift, supervisors often marched through yelling, "Four more hours!" So employees worked 16-hour days, sometimes seven days a week. 
Men who operated one machine were ordered to operate three. Breaks were allowed only if a relief worker was available, but McWane had reduced the number of relief workers and forbade supervisors to fill in for hourly workers. The policy hit hardest near iron-pouring stations, where workers had to drink plenty of fluids to withstand the heat. The humiliating result, six workers said in separate interviews, was that men were sometimes forced to urinate in their pants or risk heat exhaustion. 
Even the most basic amenities did not survive. The barbecues and 401(k) plan were easy enough targets. But items like soap, medicated skin cream and hand towels were eliminated from the stockroom as "luxuries," company records show. If available at all, they had to be specially ordered with approval from top managers. 
Several workers said they were told by their bosses to bring their own toilet tissue. Near the cupola, managers rationed crushed ice for the workers' drinks, company records show. Out by the loading docks, they eliminated portable heaters used by forklift drivers to warm up in winter. "We do not provide comfort heat for individual employees," Dick Stoker, the works manager, explained in a memorandum. 
Restrictions were placed on safety equipment. Protective aprons, safety boots and face shields were no longer stocked and readily available. Heavy, heat-resistant $17 gloves were replaced by $2 cloth ones. As a result, workers wrapped their hands in duct tape to protect from burns. 
The union was helpless to resist, past and current leaders agree. Organized labor had never been a potent force at Tyler Pipe, and the layoffs devastated the union's membership. The contract barred strikes, permitted 16-hour days and let breaks be canceled. 
"My hands was tied," said Bobby Hopson, former president of Local 1157 of the United Steelworkers of America.
Morale plummeted, but profits soared. Senior managers say they were told that Tyler Pipe earned more than $50 million in 1996 -- double the reported profits for the five-year period before McWane arrived. 
Four years after the takeover, inspectors from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration spent several days taking the measure of the new regime. They found more than 150 safety hazards. They found poorly maintained equipment. They found a work force that was poorly trained, ill equipped, overworked. 
"Throughout the plant, molten metal is seen spilling from the cupolas, bulls and ladles," their report said. "The forklift trucks transport the metal, and the ground behind the trucks often smokes with puddles of molten metal. Workers are covered with black residue from the foundry sand. Many work areas are dark, due to poor lighting and clouds of sand. Despite all the ignition and fuel sources, exit paths are not obvious. Many workers have scars or disfigurations which are noticeable from several feet away. Burns and amputations are frequent. 
"This facility is located in a relatively small town where jobs are not plentiful. Throughout the plant, in supervisors' offices and on bulletin boards, next to production charts and union memos, is posted in big orange letters: REDUCE MAN HOURS PER TON."

Talking Safety, Walking Danger
Any foundry is filled with dangers seen and unseen. For three of the last four years, the cast-iron foundry industry has recorded the nation's highest injury rates. But the inspectors said they were drawn to Tyler Pipe because its rate was so much higher than the industry average, records show. Even with far fewer workers at Tyler in 1996 than in 1995, more workdays were lost because of injuries, records show. 
On paper, the company emphasized safety. "You are expected to work efficiently and as quickly as possible without compromising safety rules or safe practices in any way," the employee handbook states. 
But inspectors and workers alike called the safety program a charade. "In essence, they are doing it in 'form' but not with substance," the inspectors wrote. 
The company prepared extensive written safety rules. But even the most senior supervisors let employees work in clear violation of those rules, the inspectors found. And while the company promised twice-a-week safety inspections, the same hazards showed up week after week. 
Ultimately, the inspectors wrote, it came down to incentives: "They have never developed a mechanism to hold supervisors accountable for safety while, on the other hand, they have mastered a system for holding supervisors accountable for production downtime."
Shutting down machines, taking special precautions before entering dangerous pits, putting safety guards on, taking them off -- all these safety measures "lengthened the 'downtime' taking away from production activities," OSHA inspectors wrote.
It was Elena Glasscock's job to make sure supervisors gave their workers proper safety training. But many supervisors were simply overwhelmed by production demands, she said. What little training they did offer was lost on Tyler Pipe's many Hispanic workers who spoke little English. 
"I would ask the supervisor, if this person could not speak English, how did he know what the work instruction said?" she recalled. Last summer, after 28 years at Tyler Pipe, she resigned in disgust. 
Experienced workers left in droves. Many were fired under a new "no fault" attendance policy that assessed points for each sick day and half points for arriving late or leaving early. Ten points resulted in dismissal. Others quit because of sudden demotions and pay cuts. Mr. Fowler, the personnel director, said he quit because he tired of being seen as a "monster."
New employees are called "pumpkin heads" because of the orange hard hats they must wear, and each week waves of pumpkin heads arrived. But it was not until pumpkin heads started showing up with electronic monitoring bracelets that people realized the company was recruiting at Texas prisons. Many of the newly released prisoners did not last. They worked up to 16 hours a day, sometimes for 14 days straight, then were fired or quit before they qualified for benefits or union protection. 
According to interviews and company documents, turnover at times approached 100 percent. Many rookie employees got hurt and left. It was a vicious cycle: injuries fueled turnover; turnover fueled injuries. 
The plant was filled with workers who barely knew their way around, let alone grasped the dangers they faced. In April 1996, a crew of outside contract workers was sent up onto the roof to clean gutters. One worker, Juan Jimenez, stepped through a skylight and plunged 55 feet to his death. Mr. Page said that Tyler Pipe's safety director had pointed out the skylight to Mr. Jimenez, but OSHA inspectors said the death "could have been avoided" if the skylight had safety rails as required under OSHA rules.
In interviews, dozens of workers said the unrelenting pressure to make production quotas resulted in dangerous shortcuts. Bobby Hopson's younger brother, Jerry, 54 and a father of two, took a shortcut in May 1996. His maintenance crew had finished work on the line and, hurrying to get out of the way, cut through a molding machine. The line started up, and Jerry Hopson was crushed by a piston. A year later, after more than 20 operations, he died. 
"He was just a swell feller," his brother, the former union president, said, brushing back tears. In the local paper, a plant executive had called Jerry Hopson "a good man who made a very big mistake." But Bobby Hopson insisted that senior supervisors were well aware of the shortcut and its hazards, yet made no effort to stop its use. 
"If you lose a minute, you've already lost, you know, maybe a fitting or two," he said. 

Losing Limbs but Not Pipes
On Jan. 22, 1997, another maintenance worker, Ira Cofer, descended alone into a machine pit. "Downsizing had ended the earlier practice of entering the pits with a buddy," OSHA investigators later wrote. When Mr. Cofer's sleeve snagged in an unguarded conveyor belt, he struggled desperately to free himself. It was nearly three hours before his screams were heard. 
"Eyewitnesses said that the friction of the belt had sanded his arm away, so that even his elbow joint was worn smooth and flat," investigators wrote.
Mr. Cofer's arm had to be amputated.
"I was mad for a while, then I was praying," he said of the ordeal. "There was nothing there but the Lord."
In their accident report, plant managers put the blame squarely on Mr. Cofer: "Keep hand away from belt and do not work alone," they wrote.
Within months, four more maintenance workers suffered amputation injuries at Tyler Pipe. In 1999, OSHA cited the plant for 31 instances of inadequate guarding on machines. By 2000, according to OSHA, 60 percent of the north plant's 70 maintenance workers had been hurt. 
Senior managers knew all this, OSHA records show. They knew that guards were frequently left off for weeks at a time. They knew that maintenance mechanics were working on running conveyor belts, entering treacherous machine pits alone.
And so in June 2000, Rolan Hoskin, afraid of the job but too desperate for work to quit, took his turn in the pit. 
His death prompted Mr. Stoker, the works manager, to issue a memorandum. "WE WILL NOT PUT PRODUCTION AHEAD OF SAFETY," he wrote. "If that means that we lose a couple of pieces of pipe or fittings to do the job in a safe manner, so be it. Then we need to figure out how to recover the lost production safely." 
But in a memorandum dated Aug. 2, an engineering manager raised serious concerns about safety. He called for a potentially costly program to build new safety guards. "We are not in compliance on most if not all our belt conveyors," he warned. 
In response, he received a dismissive letter from the human resources manager.

Burn the Tires, Scrub the Toilet
 McWane's senior executives, including C. Phillip McWane, the chairman and chief executive, received regular reports from all their plants. The reports measured seemingly everything -- injuries, lost work hours, dismissals, operating margins. By 2000, it was clear that Tyler Pipe had become an exceedingly profitable enterprise. 
It was also clear that something was very wrong. Red flags were everywhere. 
There had been three deaths since the takeover. The injury rate was climbing, the company's own reports showed. "Safety is without a doubt one of our worst areas," Mr. Stoker wrote in a confidential memorandum to top supervisors. "I have failed in this area, but I can promise you that we will not fail to improve in this area come 2001." 
Meanwhile, the plant had been deemed an "E.P.A. High Priority Violator," and company lawyers were recommending steps to forestall a criminal inquiry of its environmental record, company records show. 
After the takeover, Tyler Pipe's environmental department was virtually wiped out, several current and former employees said. One former senior manager said that when he arrived in 2000, he found an environmental program "in the Dark Ages." 
"It was not humanly possible for one person to handle all of the environmental issues at a plant of that size," he recalled. 
In March of that year, state environmental investigators spent several days at Tyler Pipe. They found that the plant had failed to keep inspections records, to get required permits and to maintain pollution controls and wastewater treatment lagoons. The list ran on and on. 
Now, with federal regulators lurking, Mr. Stoker told his staff, "We are so far out of compliance at Tyler Pipe that I cannot begin to cover our needs in this letter." 
Even so, in a January 2001 memorandum, senior McWane executives outlined an environmental upgrade at Tyler Pipe and several other plants that was relatively low cost -- outside audits, better training, improved manuals, an annual company environmental conference. 
Before long, the company's stated desire for "environmental excellence" was tested in a small way. The question was what to do with a pile of 200 old tires. It would have cost about $750 to have them hauled away to a hazardous waste dump. But company documents show that Mr. Stoker had another solution, even though he had been told that it violated state air-quality laws. 
"He wanted the tires burned and he wanted them burned now," an internal company document stated. And so they were, in the cupola. Buckets of contaminated grease disappeared the same way, workers said.
The biggest worries, though, had to do with safety. Texas workers' compensation laws give McWane broad immunity from negligence lawsuits. But they also required it to pay medical bills and lost wages for injured workers. Company executives complained that they were "hemorrhaging" money on workers' compensation -- many millions of dollars a year and rising. 
Once again, the company chose a minimalist approach, according to company and OSHA records and former safety and health employees. It devised a system of "workers' compensation cost control techniques" that shifted responsibility for safety problems onto the workers themselves. 
It was a system that assumed widespread fraud and often subjected workers reporting injuries to disciplinary action, and sometimes firing, for violating safety rules. 
"Whether the employee is 100 percent or 5 percent at fault is irrelevant," wrote Stephen A. Smith, then president of the McWane subsidiary that owns Tyler Pipe. 
In 2000 and 2001, company records show, more than 350 workers were subjected to disciplinary actions -- known as D.A.'s -- after reporting injuries. "All disciplines short of termination is administered with the intent and purpose to teach," the plant's employee handbook explained. 
But OSHA inspectors concluded that the system was used not to teach but to punish. Disciplinary action was meted out if it was the fault of the employee or not, they said. 
"The true significance of a D.A. is that they move an employee along a track for termination," the inspectors wrote. Even longtime employees with exemplary work records could be fired for a single D.A. Employees say they learned to keep injuries a secret whenever possible. 
In his response, the McWane president, Mr. Page, said no Tyler Pipe worker had been fired in retaliation for reporting an injury. He said managers were encouraged to enforce safety rules "so that there would be no doubt about management's commitment to the safety program." He added, "No judge or jury has ever concluded that Tyler Pipe acted improperly."
As many companies do, McWane insists that injured workers return to work as soon as possible on "modified duty." Mr. Page described modified duty as a beneficial program that speeded recovery. At Tyler Pipe, though, records and interviews show that modified duty often meant humiliating and punitive jobs like cleaning toilets. 
John T. Combs was the senior manager who oversaw modified duty. In an internal company e-mail message, he extolled the benefits of assigning injured workers to toilet duty and described how he assigned "an aggressive, physically imposing supervisor" to oversee them. "This accomplished one of two things," he wrote. "1) the employees would return to work because cleaning toilets is not fun and it paid less than their regular job or 2) they would quit." 
Mr. Combs did not respond to telephone messages.
Around town, Tyler Pipe was approaching pariah status. "You know what the saying in the community is?" a county commissioner asked at a commission meeting in 2001. "That if you can't work anywhere else, go to work at Tyler Pipe." With a work force that had crept up to about 1,200, company records showed there were more than 900 new hires in 2001. 
That December, a group of employees composed an unsigned letter to Mr. Page. It began: "On behalf of the employees of Tyler Pipe Company . . . Please Help!"

'We Do Not Send Flowers'
Michelle Sankowsky, a nurse, was hired in January 2002 as Tyler Pipe's occupational health and compensation manager. It was a new position, overseeing all workers' compensation cases. She met daily with Boyd T. Collier III, the human resources manager, and other senior executives. She quit after four months, she said, because she concluded that the company routinely targeted injured workers for dismissal. 
"You've got to understand," she said. "The mentality is that if it weren't for people looking for a free ride, looking for the paid vacations, if it wasn't for the malingerers, if it wasn't for the fakers, if it wasn't for people being careless and reckless, then they wouldn't have the numbers." 
Ms. Sankowsky said she suggested a variety of low-cost ideas to reduce rampant ergonomic complaints. She proposed conducting warm-up exercises and wrapping brush handles in foam. "Not cost effective," she says she was told. 
In Texas, injured workers have the right to choose their own doctors. At Tyler Pipe, this right came with an important qualification. "We require every employee injured at work to see the company-approved physician if a doctor is necessary," the employee handbook says. "NO EXCEPTIONS!" The labor contract said the same. In a memorandum to all workers, Mr. Collier said he wanted injured workers to see the company doctor first to "ensure the very best care in Smith County for our employees."
Ms. Sankowsky sees it differently. "It all boiled down to that they wanted to be in control," she said. Controlling the care, she said, was viewed as the key to saving money and reducing injury numbers reported to OSHA. And the key to controlling the care, she said, was Occu-Safe, a tiny medical company hired in 1999 to run the plant dispensary and care for injured workers at its downtown clinic. 
Occu-Safe was an unlikely choice for the job. Established only months before, it had no track record and few other clients. It was owned by Mike Adams, whose prior business experience, court records show, included a bankrupt air-conditioning venture. In an interview, Mr. Adams said he won the contract by promising deep reductions in workers' compensation claims. 
Mr. Adams also shared Tyler Pipe's skepticism about injury claims; he says he believes that up to 50 percent are fraudulent, and that "overutilization" of doctors is a "huge problem." At his clinic, he said, doctors are under strict orders to avoid "hope so, think so, want so medicine." 
Tyler Pipe was by far Mr. Adams's largest client, paying him $615,000 in 2001, records show, and Mr. Adams began most days discussing injury cases with Mr. Collier, the human resources manager. Occu-Safe, Ms. Sankowsky said, was simply too small to assert unbiased medical judgment. 
"One of the benefits of having Occu-Safe as your medical provider is that people were not taken off work," she said. 
Mr. Adams denies that Mr. Collier has tried to influence medical decisions. "The day he does, I'll walk away," he said. 
Still, records suggest that Occu-Safe was responsive to Mr. Collier. When a supervisor punctured his arm late one Friday night, emergency room doctors put him on Vicodin, a strong painkiller, and told him to stay off work a week. But according to internal e-mail, Mr. Collier wanted him back right away; Occu-Safe representatives ordered him to switch to a less potent drug and report to work on Tuesday. 
Workers who insisted on seeing their own doctors were assumed to be malingerers. It was called "jumping ship," and employees who did it, Ms. Sankowsky said, were targeted for disciplinary action and termination.
Mr. Collier's hostility toward outside doctors was apparent in an e-mail message on Feb. 19, 2002, to Ms. Sankowsky, who had asked about sending flowers to an employee who had had surgery for a workplace injury. 
"Michelle: Typically we do not send flowers to hourly ee's," he wrote. "And the only time we send flowers to salaried ee's is death in the immediate family; I'd entertain a proposal to fund flowers for cases like Brian but we need to scope it very narrow so it didn't apply for cases that were referred by CARPENTER and his band of outlaws." 
Mr. Collier was referring to Dr. Robert Carpenter, a chiropractor with union ties who has treated approximately 60 injured Tyler Pipe workers over the last two years. About 40 of them have since been fired, said Dr. Carpenter, who has filed a defamation suit against Mr. Collier. He said he no longer gets new patients who work at Tyler Pipe. 
"If I was an injured worker, then I would think that perhaps I might get fired if I went to see Dr. Carpenter," he said. 

A Broken Back and a Bass Boat
Marcos Lopez crossed the Mexican border and found work at Tyler Pipe at the age of 17. He was used to tough work, and he saw plenty of men get hurt. But nothing on earth, he said, prepared him for McWane. 
"You reach this point that you just don't care about you," said Mr. Lopez, who is now 45. "And you set your mind on work. And that's what they want. And that's how people get hurt." 
On March 2, 2002, it happened to him. He was working on some machinery, stretching awkwardly in a tight space, when he slipped and fell. His back slammed into metal. He heard a snap, he said, and felt dizzying waves of pain and nausea. In the dispensary, records show, he was pale and weeping and showing signs of shock. He said his pain -- a "burning in the bone" -- was so intense that it was a challenge just to breathe. 
Had he been sent to a hospital, had an X-ray been done, it would have been clear that Mr. Lopez had suffered a terrible injury, a severe compression fracture in his spine. 
But he was not sent to a hospital. "They just tell me to sit down and wait for the safety man," he recalled. Ms. Sankowsky, in the dispensary that day, recalls that senior safety managers were deeply suspicious of Mr. Lopez. He had a prior back injury, in 2000. Worse still, he had "jumped ship" and been kept off work for months. 
Then, in questioning Mr. Lopez, the managers discovered that he had recently bought a bass boat. They found this highly significant, Ms. Sankowsky recalls. Might he be faking injury to get his boat paid off with disability insurance? When she argued that shock was difficult to fake, Ms. Sankowsky said, the safety manager brushed her aside: "Michelle, don't you think that you could sweat and cry a little bit if you thought you were going to get a free boat and paid vacation?" 
Mr. Lopez was sent by van to the Occu-Safe clinic where, after a brief examination, he was given pain medicine and sent home, records show. The clinic doctor diagnosed a back strain and told the plant to expect Mr. Lopez back in three days. In fact, he was getting worse. He felt a creeping numbness in his legs and hands. 
At Tyler Pipe, Ms. Sankowsky said, Mr. Collier and the safety managers were "really circling their wagons around Mr. Lopez, that he's a fraud, he's a fake, and, you know, we're going to get him before he gets us." At a meeting on March 13, the managers approved a plan to place Mr. Lopez under surveillance, corporate records show. 
The next day, on his third visit to Occu-Safe, Mr. Lopez asked for an X-ray. It showed a "bad compression fracture," medical records state. Still, he was sent home. Nobody informed him of the new findings, he said, and according to Ms. Sankowsky, this was deliberate. 
"Why do you not tell this gentleman that he's got a compression fracture of the spine?" she said she asked an Occu-Safe manager. "And he said to me, 'Well, then he'd know how hurt he was.' " 
The clinic, she said, quietly began to explore the possibility that Mr. Lopez had cancer that had weakened his spine. Mr. Collier, she said, welcomed the news. "So we can deny the claim because it's cancer?" she recalls him asking.
Mr. Collier declined to comment. 
Finally, more than three weeks after his fall, Mr. Lopez was sent to a surgeon. "He said, 'You're one hair to be paralyzed for the rest of your life,' " Mr. Lopez recalled. The doctor told him something else: his fracture had gotten worse since the accident. 
It is when he says this that Mr. Lopez, a proud and reserved man, begins to weep. For months after the surgery, he said, he could not dress himself, or pick up the soap in the shower. "I feel destroyed," he said.
Mr. Adams would not discuss the case in detail; Mr. Lopez has sued Occu-Safe for malpractice. But Mr. Adams insisted that "Marcos got the care that he needed." 
McWane kept Mr. Lopez under surveillance this year, determined to prove him a malingerer. In his response, Mr. Page said Mr. Lopez had been filmed "lifting heavy loads into his car" -- proof, he said, that Mr. Lopez has not suffered any serious disability. A doctor for the Texas Workers Compensation Commission, however, recently determined that despite surgery and months of rehabilitation, Mr. Lopez has a permanent partial disability. 

Epilogue
Last year, Tyler Pipe came under intense scrutiny from federal investigators. 
In the summer, the company pleaded guilty in federal court to deliberately ignoring safety rules that could have saved Mr. Hoskin's life. In the fall, McWane reached a settlement with OSHA, admitting that it had willfully violated safety rules a dozen times. 
Tyler Pipe began publishing a safety newsletter, As the Pipe Turns. The newsletter said many new safety guards had been installed and hundreds of potential hazards eliminated. Under a new incentive program, workers get gifts if they do not "have an OSHA recordable accident that results in discipline." One recent gift, a lunch cooler, was branded with this slogan: "Safety Without Compromise."
But Tyler Pipe remains a dangerous place to work, company records show. A recently completed internal safety audit found 1,219 hazards.

Inside are rivers of molten metal, searing heat, clouds of fumes and sand and the deafening sounds of metal slamming into metal from a labyrinth of constantly moving production machinery and conveyor belts. This simplified diagram shows the main processes at a representative cast-iron pipe and fittings plant. 1. RAW MATERIALTons of scrap iron and steel, including junked cars, are brought to the plant to be melted in a furnace, sometimes called a cupola. 2. MELTINGA river of white-hot molten iron, at 2,800 degrees, flows almost constantly from the furnace to holding DANGERS -- Burns, explosions and heat exhaustion are a constant risk. The air temperature can stay above 130 degrees. AIR POLLUTIONIron furnaces create enormous amounts of airborne particulates and heavy metals, which can be cut sharply by using pollution controls like baghouses and scrubbers. 3. SPINNING MOLTEN IRONMolten iron is poured into rapidly spinning machines. Within seconds, redhot lengths of pipe are formed, measuring 4 inches to 4 feet in diameter and 10 to 20 feet long. DANGERS -- Burns and crushing injuries from moving machinery and pipes. 4. FINISHINGFinished pipes are coated for protection. DANGERS -- Fumes and fire hazards from flammable paint. Mold Casting 5. SAND MOLDSHydrants and pipe fittings are made differently from pipes. Patterns are hydraulically pressed into black sand that is then chemically hardened. Each of two mold boxes get half of a shape, then are fitted together. 6. POURINGSmaller molds have molten iron poured into them while continuously moving along assembly lines; larger molds may be individually poured. DANGERS -- Burns, crushing injuries. 7. SHAKINGMolds are placed on shaking beds, which violently jar and vibrate to free the sand from the castings. Tons of sand pour out and are sent by conveyor belts back through the plant to be reused. DANGERS -- Crushing injuries at the pinch points of conveyor belts moving sand; constant high noise; dust; unstable footing from drifts of sand. 8. FINISHINGExtra metal resulting from the molding process is removed and the parts are smoothed by grinders. DANGERS -- Dust; hand injuries, including repetitive stress. 9. HANDLING AND SHIPPINGForklifts hauling thousands of pounds of pipes and fittings are in constant use, loading trucks for delivery or moving parts to storage yards. DANGERS -- Forklifts can be hard to stop quickly, and in a noisy and chaotic plant, can be hard to see or hear coming. (pgs. 18,19)

Put an Expos Cap On Carter's Plaque

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
GARY CARTER is a sweet man who likes to please everybody, but the most joyous moment of his career is about to touch off hard feelings either in Montreal or New York. 
 One of those team caps will rest atop Carter's curly locks on his official plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame. New York will feel short-changed if he is depicted in the Expos' red, white and blue cap, but the 1986 Mets are already a monument to underachievement, so what is one more sour legacy? 
 The Mets had four great players among those 1986 world champions. Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry self-destructed, while Keith Hernandez, perhaps the best defensive first baseman of any generation, is a victim of guilt by association. That could leave Carter as the only member of that talented, rollicking band ever to reach the Hall. 
Carter was elected yesterday, along with Eddie Murray, a durable, powerful and sound first baseman, who will surely wear the Orioles' cap on his plaque.
It gets a little more tricky with Carter, who played 11 seasons in Montreal -- his first 10 and a cameo farewell season -- and 5 exciting seasons with the Mets. 
Now Carter is part of a very tough call. Theoretically, the Hall of Fame decides which cap goes in with the player, to avoid the unseemly bargaining that just might accompany a great player who moved around a bit, in these days of free agency and contractual inducements and intense marketing.
When players had the option, Dave Winfield chose San Diego, his first team, which retired his No. 31, even though he later went to the World Series with the Yankees. Winfield's choice was seen as mostly a gracious gesture toward the gauche hot-dog-wrapper uniform of his early years, rather than the stately stripes of King George's Yankees. 
Now the Hall of Fame officials do the interior decorating, or so they say. But in Carter's case, with two very deserving loyalties, the Hall will surely consult him.
"I'm glad I don't have to make that decision," Carter said yesterday on WFAN. "They make it for you." Then he added, "Maybe I can share some of my thoughts." He bubbled, characteristically, about winning it all with those 1986 Mets, but he also dwelt loyally on some of the near misses of the snakebitten Expos. 
If the Hall asks him -- and it will -- Carter should pick the red, white and blue cap of the Expos, which is very soon going the way of the passenger pigeon. The Mets already have Tom Seaver as their sole, homegrown representative. Stop and think about it: Gary Carter was Montreal's Tom Seaver -- young, talented, charismatic.
By choosing Montreal's cap, Carter will honor what was once a great baseball town, now the part-time home for vagabonds who will also play some home games in Puerto Rico this season. The franchise is soon to be moved elsewhere because of the weak Canadian dollar and the lopsided, cable-driven economics of baseball. 
The Expos signed Carter out of Fullerton, Calif., a young man with a tinge of sadness from the early death of his mother. They brought him up to Jarry Park and one of the older players called him Kid, which is still his nickname today despite the age and the sun lines in his face.
Carter, 49, smiled. He jumped up and down. He hugged his teammates when they moved a runner over. And all the evidence was that he meant it. He is a very nice man.
He was not the heart or the soul of the Mets' team. Hernandez was, pumping his fist, charging bunts and throwing runners out at third base, driving in the first run of the game from his third spot in the lineup, sometimes even catching Strawberry's attention and reminding him to stroke the outside pitch to left field. Hernandez did not have Murray's power statistics, 504 home runs along with soft hands at first base, but Hernandez was so dynamic that a few of his teammates later opted to wear his No. 17, when he moved on. By that time, Doc and Straw had squandered their Hall of Fame skills, and took everybody else down a notch, too.
The ultimate straight arrow on that team can always remember the homers he hit and the hard collisions at home plate and his single that started the magic rally in the sixth game of the 1986 World Series. 
Gary Carter brought the final piece to that world championship. But he brought it from Montreal, his first home, that ill-fated franchise that should be enshrined in the Hall of Fame a few inches above Gary Carter's warm smile.

HEADLINE: Bridgeport Mayor Joins List Of Corruption Defendants 

BYLINE:  By PAUL von ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Jan. 7 

 BODY:
He is the mayor of Connecticut's largest city. Not so long ago, he was considered a leading contender for the Democratic nomination for governor, a man who had built a reputation for bringing in millions of dollars in development to Bridgeport's bruised and broken downtown. 
 But on Wednesday, Bridgeport's mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, will be on trial on 24 counts of federal bribery, corruption and racketeering charges, the fourth big-city Connecticut mayor in 13 years to face criminal charges. Like all the previous indicted mayors, Mr. Ganim is accused of abusing his official powers; prosecutors said he reaped more than $400,000 in cash, jewelry, wine, food, clothing and improvements to his upscale home here. 
 Like the others, Mr. Ganim, 43, has defiantly professed his innocence since his indictment in October 2001, a tactic that has not been entirely successful for other high-profile municipal leaders. 
In July 2001, federal prosecutors indicted Philip A. Giordano, the three-term Republican mayor of Waterbury, on charges related to what the government said was his habit of arranging paid sexual encounters with two young girls. Mr. Giordano, who pleaded not guilty, remains locked in a federal jail cell in Rhode Island awaiting his trial on those and federal corruption charges.
In April 1992, another former Waterbury mayor, Joseph J. Santopietro, a Republican, was convicted on federal charges that he took $126,000 in payoffs from developers doing business with the city.
Two years earlier, James E. Dyer, the former four-term Democratic mayor of Danbury, was convicted of filing a false income-tax return but cleared of federal charges that he had shaken down local developers who received city contracts.
On Monday, federal prosecutors and Mr. Ganim's lawyers, Richard T. Meehan Jr. and J. Bruce Maffeo, agreed on a jury to hear the case in Federal District Court in New Haven. Legal experts said the government's case would turn heavily on the testimony of dozens of witnesses close to the mayor, including friends, family, city and state officials and private contractors familiar with his actions.
Mr. Ganim is not the first person to be tried in the case; 11 other people, including close friends, business associates and an official in the state government's economic development agency, have pleaded guilty to various corruption charges related to city business conducted on Mr. Ganim's watch.
Prosecutors said they would introduce as evidence 3,392 tapes of intercepted conversations among his friends and associates, including some of those who have pleaded guilty.
"When the federal government goes after you in a political corruption case, there is no expense too great, no witness too minor, there is no evidence they won't touch," said Hugh F. Keefe, a lawyer who represented Mr. Santopietro and Mr. Dyer in their federal trials. "They very badly want to convict you." 
Prosecutors had also sought permission from Judge Janet Bond Arterton to use Thomas Bucci, Bridgeport's mayor in the late 1980's, as an expert on Bridgeport government and on how Mr. Ganim could have abused his office. But the judge ruled that Mr. Bucci could testify only about the general mayoral functions and powers in Bridgeport, not about Mr. Ganim's performance or use of them, Mr. Meehan said. 
Since his indictment and fiery rebuke of the government's allegations, Mr. Ganim has been able to maintain a degree of public support where other indicted mayors have not. He is generally credited as the driving force behind many city projects -- including a $52 million downtown sports arena and a $19 million minor league baseball stadium -- that have given Bridgeport, a largely destitute city of 139,000, a ray of economic hope. 
So intent was Mr. Ganim on controlling the public-relations aspect of his indictment that last year his supporters commissioned a poll that they said found him still an overwhelmingly popular mayor in Bridgeport. 
He is not the first Bridgeport mayor to face federal scrutiny. In the 1970's, officials in Mayor John C. Mandanici's administration pleaded guilty to various charges. 
Mr. Mandanici, a target of death threats and car firebombings who wore a bulletproof vest while campaigning for re-election in 1981, was never indicted. 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 3, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 8 about corruption cases over the years involving Connecticut mayors referred incompletely to the resolution of one against James E. Dyer of Danbury. Although he was convicted in 1990 of filing a false federal income-tax return (and cleared of other charges), an appeals court ordered a retrial because of improper instructions to the jury. Prosecutors did not pursue it.

HEADLINE: Balducci's Flagship Closes in the Village; A New Site Is Planned 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
Balducci's, the pioneering upscale market in Greenwich Village that gave many New Yorkers their first taste of fresh basil, cilantro and other exotic edibles, has closed the storefront it occupied since the 1970's for the last time, its owner said.
 The owner, the chief executive of a Maryland supermarket chain that took control of Balducci's in 1999, said that discussions to remain there had broken down yesterday. But a spokesman for the store's landlord said there had been no discussions since it bought the storefront -- at 424 Avenue of the Americas, at Ninth Street -- last July. 
 The supermarket chain, Sutton Place Gourmet, announced plans to reopen in a different location -- plans the landlord said were in the works before the sale. Sutton Place also said that the smaller, newer Balducci's on West 66th Street would not be affected by the closing. 
"What a shame," said Emily Balducci, a third-generation member of the family that started the store after World War II and was eventually caught up in a soap opera of jealousies and rivalries that ended only with the sale to Sutton Place. Ms. Balducci worked in the store for 24 years.
In the 1970's, long before every block seemed to house a specialty food store, Balducci's was almost as famous for its long lines as for the food it sold -- white truffles from Italy, pink garlic from France and other rarities.
"At its best, Balducci's was the best specialty food market anywhere in America and among the top three or four in the world ever," said Clark Wolf, a food and restaurant consultant. "It was the only place in the East where you could get benchmark flavors seven days a week."
Balducci's storefront was a short walk from the town house where James Beard wrote his cookbooks and taught a generation of chefs. "He was always going to Balducci's," said Clayton Triplette, who was Beard's assistant for 25 years. "He always liked Balducci's vegetables. He said if Balducci's didn't have it, nobody had it."
Balducci's is also involved in a reality check Edward I. Koch says he had a week after he left City Hall.
On his way to Balducci's to buy his own groceries for the first time, Mr. Koch was yelled at by a man on a bicycle: "You were a terrible mayor!" Mr. Koch says he responded with a two-word epithet that he had never used in public.
"Balducci's had always been my favorite store," Mr. Koch said yesterday. But he said the store changed after the family turned the market over to Sutton Place Gourmet. "It wasn't the same after that," he said. "Now I go to Fairway."
The store was quiet yesterday. No signs announced the closing. But some employees echoed rumors that had swirled for months in the chatty circles of chefs and cooks. Hours before Sutton Place Gourmet confirmed that it was closing the store, cashiers and clerks said they expected yesterday to be their last day.
"I've been putting out the word I'm looking for work," said Salvador Concha, who worked at the cheese counter for 10 years, juggling work and computer classes at St. John's University in Queens. "I just got a college degree, and I'll have more opportunities."
At the checkout counter, cashiers said they figured yesterday would be the store's last day because it was the end of a pay period. Darnetha Carpenter, a cashier who worked in the pastry and bread department, said she asked what had happened to vacation pay she was owed, and was told she could apply for unemployment once the store closed.
The chief executive of Sutton Place Gourmet, Cliff Smith, said the storefront had its problems -- dated counters, and refrigerators and air-conditioning that needed to be modernized. "It's an old, tired store," he said. "The amount of work to bring that store up to a reasonable standard is prohibitive. What we were trying to do was negotiate a deal where we could accomplish both."
But Steven Rubenstein, the spokesman for the landlord, Vornado Realty Trust, denied that Vornado had been in talks with Sutton Place Gourmet or its real estate representatives since buying the storefront last July. "If they do want to stay," he said, referring to Sutton Place, "Vornado would be interested in talking to them."
Mr. Smith said that he grew up in New Jersey and first set foot in Balducci's when he was a teenager, in the 1970's. "We really, in our heart, wanted to keep the store where it is," he said, "but the store where it is, being so old is an issue."
And except for the change of owners in the 1990's, Balducci's was one of those New York landmarks that did not seem to change much over the years. It was already an institution, for example, when the restaurateurs Joseph Baum and Michael Whiteman began planning the restaurants in the World Trade Center in the 1970's and hired Beard as a consultant.
"Whenever we needed fresh things that I didn't have any idea of what they tasted like because I was young," Mr. Whiteman said yesterday, "he would take me on a shopping trip to Balducci's." The 5,500-square-foot store that closed last night, which was Balducci's second location after 25 years nearby, had room for "high-quality convenience foods that set the standard for everyone else to follow."
"What happened is the rest of the world caught up with them and passed them, in fact," Mr. Whiteman said. "The supermarket industry learned all about what's now called value-added food in the supermarket world by watching what Balducci's was doing."

HEADLINE: Honeymoon In Brazil: Market's Gift To New Chief 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
After just a week in office, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva appears to be winning over the markets that only months ago demonized him, fearing that his leftist Workers Party could plunge Brazil and the surrounding region into economic chaos.
 Since Mr. da Silva took office Jan. 1, market reaction could hardly have been better. 
 Brazil's currency, the real, has rallied 6 percent against the dollar after slumping 35 percent last year. Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock index, punished last year as Mr. da Silva's victory appeared increasingly likely, has also rallied to its highest level since June. 
Meanwhile, inflation, bond yields and Brazilian country risk -- a pivotal barometer of investor confidence, measuring spreads of Brazilian bonds over United States Treasury bonds -- are ticking down.
Apparently heady with the good news, some Sao Paulo traders are even predicting that by March the Bovespa index will be back to 15,000 -- a level not seen since early 2001, during the market-friendly heyday under former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
Brazil is not out of the woods yet, though.
Despite having one of the world's 12 largest economies, it remains vulnerable to international investors' sentiments and one wrong move by Mr. da Silva's economic team could wipe out the current good will.
"So far, the new administration has shown it can talk the talk, but it remains to be seen if they can walk the walk," said Marcelo Carvalho, chief economist at Bank of America in Sao Paulo. "To consolidate this rally, the government will have to follow through the rhetoric with action."
Brazilian stocks retreated slightly today, as investors locked in gains.
In the long run, one challenge for the government will be whether it can persuade Congress -- where the Workers Party does not have a majority -- to pass crucial changes in public sector pensions, tax and labor laws and a keenly awaited law granting the central bank more autonomy.
It will also need to keep debt-ridden states from squirming out of strict spending controls imposed by Mr. Cardoso.
One sign of whether markets are ultimately convinced Mr. da Silva can deliver will be when international banks restore hundreds of millions of dollars in credit lines to exporters, cut last year amid fears that Mr. da Silva would win and that Brazil might default on its $260 billion public debt.
So far, no major credit lines have been restored, but a number of blue-chip Brazilian companies have managed to tap the capital markets in recent weeks. And shares of Bladex, a multinational bank and a main source of export finance to Latin American companies, have surged in New York, closing at $5.79 today after being as low as $2 in late September.
"Today we have grounds for optimism," said Marcelo Mesquita, chief equities analyst for UBS Warburg in Rio de Janeiro. "What we have been hearing from the people who hold the reins of power in this government has been positive."
"For all its life the Workers Party preached default," he added. "But now the markets are convinced that there will be no default, or at least that is not Lula's intention."
On trading floors, such sentiments have helped the real to rally to 3.34 to the dollar today, its highest level since September. The Bovespa index topped 12,000 points on Monday, its highest close since last June.
The markets have been reassured by Mr. da Silva's choice of a centrist cabinet and of pro-market moderates, including Antonio Palocci as finance minister and Henrique Meirelles, former head of global banking at the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, as head of the central bank.
In his inaugural speech today, Mr. Meirelles pledged "no adventures" in monetary policy and promised to focus on curbing inflation, the primary goal of most central banks in the industrialized world.
Mr. Meirelles also said that budget surpluses and pension and tax reforms were "the most direct forms of reducing Brazil's risk levels and interest rates."
Inflation is expected to rise to around 10 percent this year. While that is well above the 6.5 percent target set by the former government, there were signs that inflation started to slow in December and it could be further reined in by the rallying real.
Some analysts say Mr. Meirelles could even cut the 25 percent benchmark interest rate at the central bank's next policy meeting this month.
That would help get the economy moving, but could unnerve international investors, many of whom are leery of a return of hyperinflation.
"For this government, the unrealistic stance of low inflation at any cost is not a priority," said Walter Molano of BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn. "This economic team is much more in touch with the realities of Brazil, and that's why people are giving them the benefit of the doubt."
Possibly one of the trickiest tasks facing Mr. Palocci and Mr. Meirelles is stabilizing the real at a level that will keep a lid on dollar-linked public debt, while maintaining Brazilian exporters' competitive edge. Brazil notched a $13 billion trade surplus last year, largely because of the weak real and surging commodity prices.
The new government's record will be under scrutiny by the International Monetary Fund next month, when the fund decides whether to release another part of a $30 billion loan negotiated by Mr. Cardoso's team.
According to Mr. Molano, Brazil will pass muster.
"Resources will be kept available," he said. "The last thing the United States wants right now is instability in South America -- its own backyard."

HEADLINE: After The Storm 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: CAIRO 

 BODY:
Here's a prediction: In the end, 9/11 will have a much bigger impact on the Arab and Muslim worlds than it does on America. Lord knows, 9/11 has been a trauma for us, and our response has been to strike back and install better security. But 9/11 has been a trauma for Arabs and Muslims as well -- a shock to their systems that ranks with Napoleon's invasion of Egypt, the creation of Israel and the 1967 defeat.
 For Arabs and Muslims, the shock has been that this act was perpetrated by 19 of their sons in the name of their faith. As a result their religious texts, political systems, schoolbooks, chronic unemployment, media and even their right to visit America have all been spotlighted and questioned -- sometimes fairly and sometimes unfairly. 
 While the shock of 1967 was profound, it ultimately led to very little change in the Arab political or social order. Because the post-'67 shock was blunted by two factors: the existence of the Soviet Union, and Soviet aid, to cushion regimes from the need to reform; and the dramatic rise in oil wealth post-'67, which also bought off a lot of pressures for change.
Today there is no Soviet Union, and because of the huge population explosion in the Arab-Muslim world, there also is not enough oil wealth to buy off pressures anymore. At the same time, thanks to globalization, young Arabs and Muslims have a much better sense of where they stand vis-a-vis the world, and how far behind they are in many cases. Finally, because America was the target of 9/11, a refusal to face up to the local factors that produced the 9/11 hijackers runs the risk of a clash with the U.S. 
Since 9/11 the Arab-Muslim world has passed through three basic stages: shock, denial and, finally, introspection. It is quite apparent here in Egypt, where, at least in part because of 9/11, issues that people did not feel empowered to discuss publicly are being tentatively aired.
"There was a strong collision on Sept. 11 between East and West, between a car and a wall, and you can see the impact on both today," remarked the Egyptian playwright Ali Salem. "You have become more suspicious, and we will become more progressive. . . . Look at Iraq. People do not want to see any Iraqis killed. But few people will speak up for Saddam Hussein now. People are against Saddam, because they know there is no future for tyranny anymore."
Two weeks ago Egypt's most influential newspaper, Al-Ahram, ran a thoughtful series by President Hosni Mubarak's most important political adviser, Osama el-Baz, cautioning Egyptians against buying into European anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and Holocaust denial. His articles were triggered by intense criticism of Egypt for broadcasting, on its state-run TV, a docudrama, "Horseman Without a Horse," that drew on the fraudulent anti-Semitic tract "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion."
"We must uphold the correct perspective on our relationship with the Jews, as embodied in the legacy of Arab civilization and in our holy scriptures," wrote Mr. Baz. "This legacy holds that ours is not a tradition of racism and intolerance, that the Jews are our cousins through common descent from Abraham and that our only enemies are those who attack us. . . . It is also important, in this regard, that we refrain from succumbing to such myths as 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion' and the use of Christian blood in Jewish rituals."
In part as a reaction to the religious intolerance unleashed by 9/11, President Mubarak surprised his country last month by announcing that henceforth Jan. 7 would be a national holiday. Jan. 7 is the Coptic (Egyptian Christian) Christmas, and it has now been elevated to equal status with the Prophet Muhammad's birthday. For the first time the president's son, Gamal, attended midnight mass, a visit carried live on Egyptian TV. 
After the prominent Egyptian journalist Mohammed Heikal raised the question, in a recent TV interview, of who will succeed President Mubarak, everyone has started talking in public about it, and several Egyptians expressed to me their hope that whenever the transition happens it will be the start of a more formal democratization process.
Will it? Will introspection around the region actually lead to a Stage 4 -- fundamental political and economic reform? I suspect that the leaders understand that this is a storm they can't ride out. But they don't know how to change without losing the control they've enjoyed. This tension will be the drama of Arab-Muslim politics for the next decade.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Stimulant 

 BODY:
President Bush did such a good job yesterday talking about the enduring strength of the economy that many Americans might wonder why the nation needs a costly new stimulus plan that imperils its fiscal health. Unfortunately, Mr. Bush wasn't convinced by his own reassurances, and went on to propose a whopping new package of tax cuts. This plan is much less about the economy than about the White House's belief that it needs to take action, any action, to show that the president cares. 
 Mr. Bush is understandably haunted by his father's loss of the presidency in 1992, when the elder Bush seemed indifferent to the economic hardships experienced by many voters. But in this plan, the concern is only for the posture. The president's program itself is a cynical grab bag of unrelated and mislabeled policies that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest, along with belated support for the extension of expired unemployment benefits and a small new federal program to help people find jobs. Inexcusably, the package includes no assistance for states struggling to keep up with rising security and health care costs. 
 The president sounded impassioned yesterday in railing against the double taxation of dividends. That, as we have already said, is a worthy subject for a tax reform seminar, but not for an economic stimulus proposal. Few conceivable tax cuts could do less to provide immediate help to the people with overextended credit card debt who Mr. Bush claimed were the focus of his concern. 
He was equally unconvincing in calling for the acceleration of income tax rate cuts passed by Congress in 2001. This too would prove a huge drain on the Treasury at a time of a quarter-trillion-dollar deficit and mounting national security obligations, with only a minimal immediate boost to consumer spending.
With the economy showing signs of recovery, we remain unpersuaded of the need for a pricey stimulus package. Yet if Mr. Bush is truly concerned about the people who "spend their entire adult lives living paycheck to paycheck," he should be pushing a more targeted plan along the lines proposed Monday by Congressional Democrats. At less than one-fourth the $674 billion cost of the president's extravagant designs, their plan provides short-term relief to states and working-class Americans, thereby doing more to insure against an economic slowdown.

HEADLINE: Israel's Misaimed Anger 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel has every right to respond swiftly and firmly to Palestinian terrorist outrages. But when his actions undermine the prospects for better Palestinian governing and an eventual end to the violence, neither Israel's interests nor America's are well served. Mr. Sharon unwisely decided on Monday to bar Palestinian delegates from attending a meeting in London next week that Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, hoped would encourage internal Palestinian reform. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is right to urge Mr. Sharon to reconsider. 
 Primary responsibility for the cycle of terror and reprisal that has paralyzed Mideast peace efforts for the past two years lies with the fanatical Palestinian groups that organize suicide bombings and weak Palestinian leaders like Yasir Arafat who fail to crack down on them. Still, Israel cannot afford to let the most radical Palestinians drive the Mideast agenda. To do so is to advance the aims of such groups by destroying chances for a compromise peace and easing pressure for a more responsible Palestinian leadership capable of negotiating one. Israel's goal should be to marginalize Palestinian terrorists, not to advance their cause. 
 The London conference was planned to promote better Palestinian governing and more effective security measures against terrorists. Two Palestinian cabinet ministers were scheduled to attend, including Salam Fayad, who, since his appointment last year as finance minister, has introduced a greater measure of accountability into the Palestinian Authority's financial operations. With Washington preoccupied by Iraq, Mr. Blair has constructively tried to sustain some momentum toward Palestinian reform and an eventual renewal of peace negotiations. By preventing Palestinians from attending the London meeting, Mr. Sharon has effectively undermined the Blair initiative. 
Israel's military response to the latest twin suicide bombing, which killed 23 people in Tel Aviv on Sunday, has so far been restrained. But Israel should also reinforce international efforts to encourage reform and moderation among the Palestinian leadership. If Israel and the Palestinians are ever to make their way back to the negotiating table, both camps will have to look beyond the daily bloodshed to the longer-term welfare of their peoples. Israel can do just that by letting Palestinian representatives attend the London meeting.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: THE EFFECTS; 
States Fear Double Whammy From Tax Plan

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DENVER, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush's call to eliminate taxes on corporate dividends, a centerpiece of his economic plan, is raising alarm among state and local officials who say it could add to the growing budget pressures on states and cities.
 Budget experts were still reviewing numbers today, but said the provision on dividends would cost state and local governments tens of millions of dollars a year in lost revenue. 
 The states fear they will lose in two ways. Because state income tax laws are tied to the federal law, the states will also stop taxing dividends. In addition, the removal of taxes on dividends makes stocks a more attractive investment vehicle than the traditionally tax-free municipal bonds. 
Over all, the officials said the potential losses far exceed the $10 billion in state aid included in Mr. Bush's 10-year plan, much of which is earmarked to help the unemployed.
"Clearly, this was not the intended effect of the plan," Bill Pound, executive director of the National Conference of State Legislatures, said of Mr. Bush's proposal. "If the goal is to stimulate the economy through business activity and bring back states more rapidly, this was, perhaps, an unintended consequence."
Phil Angelides, the California treasurer, said, "there is no question" that the Bush plan would cost states more and drive investors "away from bonds that broadly benefit the public at a time we have enormous infrastructure needs."
The National Governors Association said in a statement that because Mr. Bush's plan did not include "direct flexible assistance" to states, it would "exacerbate the current state fiscal problem." 
The sluggish national economy has left many states and cities reeling. Data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows that 43 states are operating in the red, led by California, which is facing a $34 billion budget gap for the next 18 months. 
Over all for 2004, the states are facing their largest shortfall in half a century, as much as $85 billion, a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows.
The financial pressures have led to intense debates in many legislatures over how to balance spending cuts and new taxes to wipe out deficits. At the same time, cities are begging states and the federal government for money to cover costs of security measures since the 9/11 attacks, vaccines and long-delayed capital improvements. 
Mr. Bush said today that his plan would kick-start the sputtering economy and produce new jobs, a stimulus which would also help states with their own budget difficulties.
The worry of states and cities, analysts said, is that the 41 states that have personal income taxes will automatically lose state revenues as a result of the federal decision to stop taxing corporate dividends -- unless they enact their own changes in tax law to keep them from automatically following the federal government's lead. 
That is because state income tax laws generally parallel the federal system. Recently, the economic slowdown has prompted many states to break from custom by passing tax laws that preserve their own revenue streams. 
For example, after Congress in 2001 approved a 10-year plan to phase out the federal estate tax, 16 states decided to continue collecting such taxes. 
Iris Lav, a policy analyst with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, estimated that the elimination of dividend taxes would cost states a combined $4.5 billion.
Even if states wanted to continuing collecting the tax, she said, they might find it almost impossible to do it because after eliminating dividend taxes, the Internal Revenue Service would no longer require taxpayers to fill out forms listing their dividends. Since states use the same forms to calculate dividend income, "there's a high likelihood they won't be able to because there would be no paper trail," she said.
Despite such difficulties, dire economic conditions are likely to lead many state legislatures to find ways to continue collecting dividend taxes, the executive director of the Federation of Tax Administrators, an association of state agencies, Harley Duncan, said .
"Given the states' fiscal affairs," Mr. Duncan said, "I think they will go their own way on this."
State and city officials also said they were concerned that eliminating dividend taxes would make municipal bonds a less attractive option for investors. Such bonds, which offer tax-free dividends, are a lifeline to cities and states, which use them as a way to finance expensive projects, like school construction and highways. They are viewed as a safe haven for many investors even if their yields are modest compared with those offered by stocks in more robust times.
But under the Bush plan, bonds would have to compete with tax-free stocks, a race that probably would force state and local governments to increase interest rates, driving up pressures on budgets to service the debt.
"It's another loss of revenue for cities, which are getting hit, hit and hit again with more inopportunities to collect money," Susan Gaffney of the Government Finance Officers Association said of the president's plan. "There don't seem to be a lot of provisions that address the needs of state and local government."

HEADLINE: Mayor Says New York Is Worth the Cost 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
Taking aim at the notion that New York's high costs discourage business growth, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that the city is a luxury product and that businesses should be willing to pay more to operate here.
 Addressing an audience of corporate, cultural, government and labor leaders attending an economic conference at Rockefeller University that was closed to the press, Mr. Bloomberg said the city needed to act like a private company and strengthen its brand to market itself better to those businesses that can afford it. 
 "If New York City is a business, it isn't Wal-Mart -- it isn't trying to be the lowest-priced product in the market," a draft of the speech reads. "It's a high-end product, maybe even a luxury product. New York offers tremendous value, but only for those companies able to capitalize on it." 
Mr. Bloomberg's address signaled, in perhaps the starkest terms yet, his change from a man who thought higher taxes would "destroy this city" to one who sees the city he governs as a value-added commodity. 
"New York City is never going to be the lowest-priced place to do business; it is just the most efficient place to do business," Mr. Bloomberg told reporters later. "You have to get value for the moneys that you're going to spend."
The words underscored the direction in which Mr. Bloomberg has been moving as his administration struggles to find a way out of the city's fiscal crisis. Some of his positions -- raising taxes, specifically -- have been surprising, coming from a businessman and a nominal Republican. At the same time, he has also remade the mayoralty to reflect his style and the lessons learned through years in private business. Yesterday, both aspects were on full display.
"I've spent my career thinking about the strategies that institutions in the private sector should pursue, and the more I learn about this institution called New York City, the more I see the ways in which it needs to think like a private company," the speech draft reads.
Mr. Bloomberg outlined a strategy to encourage economic development, saying the city needed to focus more on those companies that would pay extra for the unique advantages the city offers, as well as companies that can help the city, too. 
"Successful companies figure out which customers they have a chance to get and which customers, if they get them, will contribute to their bottom line," Mr. Bloomberg told reporters. "And we're trying to do that, we're trying to understand which companies can take advantage of the things New York has to offer." The city is working with McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm, to study ways to attract and retain businesses.
Mr. Bloomberg maintained that higher crime, subpar education and a lack of city services would drive businesses out of the city faster than higher costs, a message that appeared well received at the conference.
"I think he struck a note with every executive in the room," said Ira Millstein, a senior partner at the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, because he showed that he was thinking about his business in the same way the executives think about theirs.
Robert E. Rubin, a director at Citigroup and a former secretary of the Treasury Department, said, "When you start to get to the higher value-added businesses, the advantage of being here is so enormous that it seems to me it's going to continue to hold and attract businesses." Still, he added, taxes "are a detriment" and "a cost that you have to weigh against the benefits."
Lorraine Cortes-Vazquez, president of the Hispanic Federation, a coalition of New York health and human-service groups, sounded a note of caution about seeing the city as a brand. "If that approach is used to attract new businesses, then that's fine, but that approach cannot be used to solve the social and human problems of the city," she said.
Jerome A. Chazen, the former chairman of Liz Claiborne who is now chairman of Chazen Capital Partners, an investment company, said people who have grown up in the city might be more tolerant of its high costs than newcomers are. "When you make a decision about coming here, it's a different kind of mentality," he said.
E. J. McMahon, an analyst with the Manhattan Institute who has criticized the mayor's decision to raise taxes, suggested that his thinking reflected his experience running a company with a high profit margin. "If you're making a lot of money doing something that wouldn't be nearly as profitable anywhere else than in New York, you could understand that," said Mr. McMahon, who did not attend the conference.
Treating the high-cost environment "as a given -- as something that is unchangeable -- is debatable," he said, adding that balancing all the financial factors, including the recent property tax increase and the possibility of an income tax increase, could cause businesses to flee. "There is a last-straw phenomenon for some businesses some of the time."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 9, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a shift by the Bloomberg administration to market New York City as a luxury product misstated the meaning of a comment by Jerome A. Chazen, an investment company executive who said that those who have grown up in the city might be more tolerant of its high costs than newcomers are. He was speaking of companies, not people.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: THE LEADER; 
For Frist, an Exultant but Tentative Debut

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
The door of the Senate Republican leader's suite lacked a nameplate today as its new occupant walked up, in part because he had not yet decided what it should say.
 Should it be a simple "Bill Frist," he mused aloud, or perhaps a full "William H. Frist?" And what about the "M.D." at the end -- his father would have been furious, he said, if the nameplate did not reflect his medical degree. 
 "I don't know," he told the last Tennessean to occupy the office, Howard H. Baker Jr., for whom the suite is named. "I'm not sure if the parliamentarian will let me say M.D. on the door." 
Former Senator Baker gently reminded Dr. Frist just who was in charge.
"You're the majority leader now," he said. "I think they'll let you do anything you want to do."
Bill Frist never aspired to the job he acquired this morning, and the banter at the doorway was only one of several times during his first day where he seemed slightly uncomfortable with the authority granted to him by his colleagues. There were moments of tentativeness as he stood in the front row of the Senate, shepherding the legislative minutiae, along with one telling instance of bitterness when a compromise he tried to forge on unemployment insurance appeared to fall apart.
But generally he compared the day to the greatest achievements of his life.
"It's like my first heart transplant," Dr. Frist said. "It's a good day, and I'm excited, but I can't forget the enormous responsibility I have now assumed."
All day, on and off the floor, colleagues grabbed his arm and congratulated him, and the chaplain added his name to the opening prayer. But there was no public discussion of the reason he was now in command. Senator Trent Lott, who would have been the leader had he not made a remark last month that suggested a fondness for segregation, sat two rows behind Dr. Frist in an unaccustomed position of subordinancy, an observer now rather than a major player. He was greeted warmly after returning to the Capitol for the first time in nearly a month, but the leadership huddles on the floor took place without him.
The baton had been firmly transferred to Dr. Frist's hands, but if he had developed a set of goals and a strategy to achieve them, he did not reveal his plans today. He held no news conference and did not introduce his top 10 legislative priorities, breaking with an opening-day tradition because of the short time he has had to prepare. Floor aides helped him through the details, and he openly acknowledged how much he intended to rely on his colleagues for advice.
"The learning curve I'm not too worried about," he said on the ABC program "Good Morning America." "I have a team of 50 other Republican senators and 99 senators on the floor. Together we'll capture the greatness of this institution and do what's best for the American people."
In his maiden floor speech as leader, he said only that he hoped to meet the challenges of the fight against terrorism, the need for economic growth and the resolution to a crisis in health care.
"I am convinced that we will find, based on our own principles, common ground to bridge this aisle between us," he said to his Democratic counterpart, Tom Daschle, who then crossed the aisle to shake Dr. Frist's hand and made his own vow of civility.
Of course, the bipartisan collegiality lasted only moments, and given the Republicans' one-vote majority, it could hardly have been otherwise. Dr. Frist had spent the last several days working to broker a compromise with the House on extending unemployment benefits, and had helped persuade his Republican colleagues in the other chamber to agree to a more generous package. But to his surprise, several Senate Democrats, led by Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, asked for an even larger unemployment grant that would cover more workers.
The Democrats briefly objected to Dr. Frist's compromise, and for about an hour, it appeared the deal that he had helped broker had fallen victim to partisan differences. As he experienced the first of what will undoubtedly be many moments of political frustration, he allowed his annoyance to show.
"After a lot of hard work, I'm obviously disappointed because this is the first move out for me after it had been cleared on both sides," he said. "But I guess that is what I can come to expect." He urged the Democrats to rethink their objection, and later in the afternoon they did so, producing his first legislative victory. Suddenly he was exultant.
"They threw a little curveball, but we hit it out of the park," he said.
If it was a home run, however, it was an expensive one, as Don Nickles, the Republican sponsor of the unemployment bill, jokingly reminded him.
"Two hours on the job, and already he's spent $7.2 billion," Mr. Nickels said. "That didn't take long."

Germany to Lead Iraq Sanctions Panel

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
Despite initial opposition from the United States, the Security Council appointed Germany today to the chairmanship of the committee monitoring economic sanctions against Iraq. 
 The Bush administration had tried to block the appointment after Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said he would not send German troops in case of a war with Iraq. 
Washington dropped its objections after France and Russia supported Germany's bid. 
 Germany, one of five countries to join the Council last week for a two-year term, held the committee chairmanship in 1995-96 and is taking over from Norway. The committee decides the price of oil exported from Iraq and the kinds of goods sent to Iraq. 
Chile and Spain, Washington's candidates for the position, will take over committees monitoring Al Qaeda and counterterrorism, respectively.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: FAMILIES; 
Plan Gives Most Benefits To Wealthy and Families

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
The rich would make out the best, but President Bush's mammoth tax plan would give something to almost everybody.
 An analysis of Mr. Bush's plan by Deloitte & Touche shows that the income tax reductions are smallest for low-income workers, especially single people without children, and are potentially huge for people at the very top. 
 The analysis, along with those from other tax experts today, shows that almost all workers would receive at least some income tax reduction. But the pattern of benefits are unabashedly skewed in two directions: toward the wealthy and two-parent households with lots of children. 
An unmarried person with no children who earns $40,000 a year would have federal taxes drop by $126, or 2.53 percent, to $4,860. By contrast, a married couple with two children would see their federal income taxes almost evaporate from $1,178 under current law to a mere $45.
Married couples with children would do significantly better than single people at every income level. They would get an extra $400 a year in tax credits for every child, and they would receive more relief from the so-called marriage penalty, which now pushes two-income couples into higher tax brackets.
In general, the dollar value of proposed income tax cuts climbs roughly in line with a person's income. But the biggest chunk of Mr. Bush's $674 billion package is a call to eliminate taxes on corporate dividends, and that change would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers.
Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group in Washington that uses government tax data and a respected computer model to analyze tax changes, calculated today that nearly half of the tax benefits in Mr. Bush's program would flow to the wealthiest 10 percent of taxpayers. The wealthiest one percent, who earn an average of $1 million a year, would see their taxes decline about $32,000, the research group said.
Those conclusions are not inconsistent with the analysis by Deloitte & Touche.
"The tax cuts are set up in such a way that the people with the biggest burden get the biggest tax relief," said Mark Garay, deputy director of tax policy for Deloitte & Touche in Washington. "The goal is to look at who is paying the taxes, and give them the relief."
For Robert and Bee Moorhead of Austin, Tex., who together earn about $88,000, the Bush plan is not impressive. Though they both have good jobs -- she as the director of a nonprofit group and he as a multimedia developer at a textbook publisher -- they have only about $1,000 in stocks and virtually no dividend income.
"They're trying to sell this once again as trickle-down economics," Mr. Moorhead said today. "I have my doubts."
In a rival plan proposed by Democratic lawmakers on Monday, the tax relief would be more evenly distributed but it would also be smaller and much cheaper than Mr. Bush's plan. The Democrats' key proposal would be to provide a one-time rebate of $300 to every taxpayer in the country, regardless of income. The entire plan would cost the federal government $136 billion over 10 years, while the White House plan would cost $674 billion over the same period.
Mr. Bush's tax plan to eliminate dividend taxes overlooks a huge population of taxpayers: more than 40 million people who put money into tax-deferred individual retirement plans like the 401(k) plan.
Neither the money set aside in a 401(k) plan nor the dividends that accumulate are subject to any tax until a person withdraws the money after reaching retirement age.
But when a person does withdraw money, the government taxes all of it as ordinary income -- regardless of whether the money came from dividends, stock market profits or the person's original contributions.
In effect, that means that people who buy stocks and accumulate dividends in a tax-deferred retirement plan will eventually be taxed on those dividends. But the much smaller number of people who currently pay big taxes on dividends will get a big new break.
Today, a senior administration official confirmed that the government would not change the rules and that stock dividends earned in 401(k) plans would indeed be taxed as ordinary income when it is withdrawn.
"They didn't get taxed when it was going in," said the official when asked about the issue today. "It all works out in the end," she said. "Trust me."
The decision is important, because the tax-deferred retirement plans cater much more to ordinary salaried employees, while the great bulk of taxable dividend income currently goes to a small segment of the population.
According to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit research group in Washington that has also analyzes tax changes, 64 percent of the benefit from eliminating dividend taxes would flow mostly to the wealthiest five percent of taxpayers -- about 4.7 million tax returns.
Such details are likely to give Mr. Bush's Democratic opponents more ammunition to attack the tax plan as a gift to the rich.
What Democrats are less likely to emphasize is that Mr. Bush's plan would provide bigger tax cuts for many people at middle-income and lower-income levels than theirs would.
The expanded child credit, given as a $400 per-child rebate this year, would be bigger than the Democratic rebate. Though many details today remained unclear, administration officials said that the child credit would continue to be partly refundable for people whose federal income tax bill is lower than the actual credit.

Excerpts From Bush's Speech on His Proposal to Stimulate the Economy

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's remarks today on his economic stimulus plan, as recorded by Federal News Service. A complete transcript is online at nytimes.com/washington.
 Today in Washington a new Congress convenes, and I will ask members of both parties to work with me to secure our economic future. We cannot be satisfied until every part of our economy is healthy and vigorous. We will not rest until every business has a chance to grow and every person who wants to find work can find a job. 
 So today I'm announcing a growth and jobs plan to strengthen America's economy, specific proposals to increase the momentum of our economic recovery. . . . 
Too many Americans today are wondering about our economy. They're asking, How is the economy really doing? Well, the American economy is the strongest and most resilient economy in the world. In spite of the terrible shocks that our nation has received, our economy is growing, and the entrepreneurial spirit in America is strong. 
We've made great progress these past two years, remembering the summer of 2000, during the presidential campaign. The market had started on a steady decline. Job growth started to dwindle. The economy had begun to slow. When I took office, the signs of recession were real. So, I worked with the United States Congress to reduce income taxes for everyone who pays them. More than 100 million individuals, families and sole proprietorships received tax relief. This tax relief was the largest in a generation, and it gave the economy a boost just at the right time, ensuring that the recession was one of the shortest and shallowest in modern American history. 
Americans should be able to count on those tax cuts as they plan their financial futures. So I will continue to press the Congress to make these tax cuts, including the end of the death tax, permanent. We know that the tax cuts work, and Americans deserve to know their tax cuts will not be taken away. 
We faced a second test with the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. These attacks caused terrible suffering and a massive disruption of the economy. Flights were canceled. Many hotels and stores were empty. Stock trading was halted for nearly a week. So we acted. We reopened the markets. We helped the people of New York City recover. We assisted the airlines. We provided tax incentives for business investment. And we passed terrorism insurance so building and real estate projects could go forward. 
And then our economy was tested a third time when Americans discovered serious abuses of trust by some corporate leaders. So we passed historic reforms to assure corporate integrity, to punish wrongdoers and defend the interests of workers and investors. Corporate greed and malfeasance caused innocent people to lose their jobs, their savings, and, often, their confidence in the American system. For the sake of justice, and for the sake of every honest business in America, I have made this commitment: Corporate misdeeds will be investigated, they will be prosecuted and they will be punished. We have met the tests before us because the American people have worked hard through difficult times. And now our country has entered its second year of economic growth. Our trade with other nations is expanding, bringing lower prices that come from imports, and better jobs that come from exports. 
More Americans are buying and building houses, a central part of the American dream. The homeownership rate is now 68 percent, close to the highest ever. Low interest rates have allowed Americans to tap the rising value of their homes. 
And those obstacles are clear: Many jobs are lost in America because government imposes unreasonable regulations and many jobs are lost because the lawsuit culture of this country imposes unreasonable costs. I will continue to press for legal and regulatory reform, but today I want to talk about these concerns: Americans carry a heavy burden of taxes and debt that could slow consumer spending. I'm troubled by that. I'm also troubled by the fact that our tax system unfairly penalizes some productive investments. And I worry about people who are out of work; they need our help, both in short-term benefits and long-term opportunity. By directly confronting each of these challenges, we can preserve the hard-won gains our economy has made and advance toward greater prosperity. 
Our first challenge is to allow Americans to keep more of their money so they can spend and save and invest. The millions of individual decisions that support the market support business and help create jobs. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of our economy; it has been the driving force of our recovery. Yet, there are warning signs I won't ignore, and I hope the Congress doesn't ignore either. 
Many Americans live in constant and increasing personal debt, with credit card bills so heavy they often cannot pay much more than the monthly minimum. Millions of citizens spend their entire adult lives living paycheck to paycheck, never getting a chance to save for their children's education or their own retirement. Americans today are paying about a third of their income in taxes. All of this puts pressure on family budget, and therefore clouds our economic future. 
Americans facing these struggles are due to receive additional tax relief in 2004, and again in 2006. Republicans and Democrats in Congress already approved these tax rate reductions, and the time to deliver the tax rate reductions is now, when they can do the most good for the American people. For the sake of economic vitality, I'm asking Congress to make all the tax rate reductions effective this year. And the tax cuts should be retroactive to Jan. 1. Upon passage, I'll order the Treasury Department to immediately adjust the amount of money withheld for income taxes so that Americans will keep more of their paychecks right away. 
By speeding up the income tax cuts, we will speed up economic recovery and the pace of job creation. If tax relief is good enough for Americans three years from now, it is good enough for Americans today. 
An additional beneficiary of this tax cut will be small businesses. About 30 million Americans include small-business income when they file their individual tax returns with the I.R.S. Faster tax relief will help these businesses to expand sooner, to hire new people faster, and to build a stronger foundation for the recovery. 
We also know that middle-income families need additional relief. So today I'm asking Congress to speed up three other tax reductions promised in 2001, tax reductions that will help our middle-income families. Instead of slowly reducing the marriage penalty until 2009, we should do it now, to help 35 million married couples. Instead of waiting until 2008 to move more taxpayers from the 15 percent bracket to the lowest bracket of 10 percent, we should make that change now and help two million working Americans. And instead of gradually raising the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per child by the year of 2010, for the benefit of 26 million families, we should raise it now. 
These tax reductions will bring real and immediate benefits to middle-income Americans. Ninety-two million Americans will keep an average of $1,083 more of their own money. A family of four, with two earners and $39,000 in income, will receive more than $1,100 in tax relief. Real money to help pay the bills and push the economy forward. And the sooner Congress acts, the sooner the help will come. 
Taken together, these income tax cuts will put an additional $70 billion to work in the private economy over the next 18 months. And there's no better way to help our economy to grow than to leave more money in the hands of the men and women who earned it. 
Our second challenge is to encourage greater investment by individuals and small businesses, the kind of investing that builds personal wealth and helps a company expand and creates new jobs. 
We are increasingly a nation of owners who invest for retirement and the other financial challenges of life. One-half of American households own stock, either directly or through pension funds. And we have an obligation to make sure, now more than ever, that American investors are treated fairly. We can begin by treating investors fairly and equally in our tax laws. As it is now, many investments are taxed not once, but twice. First the I.R.S. taxes a company on its profit, then it taxes the investors who receive the profits as dividends. The result of this double taxation is that for all the profit a company earns, shareholders who receive dividends keep as little as 40 cents on the dollar. 
Double taxation is bad for our economy. Double taxation is wrong. Double taxation falls especially hard on retired people. About half of all dividend income goes to America's seniors, and they often rely on those checks for a steady source of income in their retirement. It's fair to tax a company's profits. It's not fair to double tax by taxing the shareholder on the same profits. 
So today, for the good of our senior citizens, and to support capital formation across the land, I'm asking the United States Congress to abolish the double taxation of dividends. 
The benefits of this tax relief will be felt throughout the economy. Abolishing double taxation dividends will leave nearly 35 million Americans with more of their own money to spend and invest. This will promote savings and return as much as $20 billion this year to the private economy. 
By ending this investment penalty, we will strengthen investor confidence. See, by ending double taxation of dividends, we will increase the return on investing, which will draw more money into the markets to provide capital to build factories, to buy equipment, hire more people. 
We must also encourage the investments that help turn small businesses into larger ones. Small businesses create the majority of new jobs in America, and they account for half the output of the economy. Currently, tax law permits small firms to write off as expenses up to $25,000 worth of equipment, computers or machinery that they need. I'm asking the Congress to raise that limit to $75,000 and index that number for inflation. This change, together with the faster rate reductions, will benefit more than 23 million small-business owners. My view is this economy can thrive only if our small businesses thrive, and we will provide them every incentive to grow and create more jobs.
A third challenge facing our country is the need to help unemployed workers and prepare them for the new jobs of a growing economy. The unemployment rate today is 6 percent. It's low for an economy coming out of a recession. It's higher than it should be. And the unemployment rate is projected to rise even further in the short run. 
This hardship is concentrated in certain regions and in certain industries. Manufacturing jobs have declined for 28 months in a row. You know what I'm talking about here in the Midwest. You're showing signs of recovery here, yet many people here and across this country are still looking for work. A woman in Arkansas tells a typical story. She talked about the fact that her husband was laid off from his job at a local steel mill, and both she and her husband have been looking for a job for quite a while. Here's what she said: "There's just nothing for me to find. We're trying to save up what little money we have and move to another community and look for jobs there."
You've got to be worried about those kinds of stories here in America. As we encourage long-term growth, we will not forget the men and women who are struggling today. Close to 70,000 workers each week exhaust their unemployment benefits, and we have an obligation to help our fellow citizens. So I'm asking this new Congress to extend unemployment benefits that expired on Dec. 28. And the benefits Congress approves should be retroactive, like the Fitzgerald bill, so that people who lost their benefits last month can receive their benefits in full. Helping America's unemployed workers should be a first order of business in this new Congress, and it looks like it's going to be. 
We must be more creative when we help those who have the hardest time finding work. To encourage innovation and more choices and to help those who are out of work find the dignity of a new job, today I'm unveiling a new approach to helping unemployed Americans through personal re-employment accounts. Under this new program, Americans who face the greatest difficulties in finding work will receive up to $3,000 to use in their job search. They will have great flexibility in how they use that money. A person with a re-employment account will be able to decide whether to use the funds for job training, or child care, or transportation or even to cover the costs of relocating to another city for a new job. If a job is obtained quickly, within 13 weeks, the worker will be able to keep the cash balance as a re-employment bonus. 
As we seek new economic growth, we will need well-trained workers to fill new jobs. So I'm going to ask the Congress to provide $3.6 billion to the states to pay for the re-employment accounts, enough money to help more than a million unemployed men and women across America. 
In order to strengthen this economy in the future, we must help these Americans today. The job and growth proposals I've outlined today are a focused plan to encourage consumer spending, to promote small-business growth, to boost confidence in our markets and to give critical help to unemployed citizens.
Over all, this growth package will reduce the tax burden of Americans by $98 billion this year, and $670 billion over the next decade. I proposed a bold plan because the need for this plan is urgent. And I urge the Congress to act swiftly and pass this bill.

HEADLINE: Few Officials At Companies Expect SurgeIn Dividends 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT and CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
We'll keep our cash, thank you.
 So say many of the large companies that do not pay dividends to their shareholders, predicting that President Bush's plan to eliminate the tax on personal dividends will not impel them to make a quick change. 
 Officials at the companies -- many of them in the technology sector -- say they will continue to use their cash to make investments and buy back shares of stock, rather than distribute profits to their investors as dividends.
Mr. Bush's $674 billion, 10-year economic proposal received generally positive reviews from corporate America after he announced it yesterday in Chicago, even as some executives lamented the lack of direct help for their businesses. The proposal did not include tax cuts for companies or incentives to encourage new investment, but executives said they expected the plan to lift stocks and consumer spending. 
Their reactions to the elimination of the tax could change if investors begin punishing the stock prices of the roughly one-third of big companies that do not pay dividends, economists say. Otherwise, the centerpiece of the White House's economic plan will mainly affect shareholders of companies that already pay them.
The proposed elimination of the tax "brings the issue back on our radar screen," said William D. Zollars, chairman of the Yellow Corporation, a big trucking company that does not pay dividends. But he said it would probably not persuade him to alter the policy.
"We will continue to buy back stock if we think our stock is undervalued," he said.
Similarly, Cisco Systems plans to use its cash to invest in its business and complete an $8 billion stock repurchase program it announced last summer, said Terry Anderson, a company spokeswoman. Microsoft and Starbucks both have no plans to pay a dividend, spokeswomen for the companies said yesterday.
Oracle, the second-largest software company after Microsoft, was among the few technology companies to sound a different note yesterday. At an investors' conference in Scottsdale, Ariz., its chief financial officer, Jeffrey O. Henley, said "we'd certainly have to reconsider our policy" if Mr. Bush's proposal became law. "I don't want to predict exactly what our board of directors would do, but I do think it would have a significant impact on our thought process," he said.
Executives at companies that already pay dividends -- often in older industries -- seemed more willing to step up their payouts in response to the tax change. Some even predicted that technology companies would have no choice but to follow their lead once investors hungry for decent returns began reacting to large cash payments.
"It's going to cause a whole host of companies to reassess the equation," said a senior executive of a pharmaceutical company, who did not want to be identified because the company had not decided how it would react. "People who are saying they aren't going to change are probably being a little too quick."
John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, an association of about 150 chief executives, added, "Clearly, the elimination of the tax on dividends is going to increase the value of them to shareholders, and companies are going to have to react to that."
For example, Sempra Energy, a provider of electricity and natural gas, paid an annual dividend of $1 on $2.52 of earnings per share last year. This year, after it buys some power plants and gas lines, it will consider increasing the dividend further, Stephen L. Baum, the chairman, said.
"Before, if we had even more excess cash, it would go to share buybacks or more capital investment," Mr. Baum said.
By contrast, many technology executives have been loath to turn cash over to their shareholders, seeing it as an admission that they did not have ideas for new investments that would make their companies more profitable. In addition to Cisco and Microsoft, AOL Time Warner, Dell Computer, eBay, EMC and Sun Microsystems all do not pay dividends, according to Louis Navellier's Blue Chip Growth Letter.
"We remain a fairly young company," said Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for eBay, the online auction company. "Our cash on hand gives us opportunities to expand our business. At this point, our thinking is that we will continue not to provide a dividend."
Taryn Lynds, a spokeswoman for AeA, the nation's largest technology trade association, added that few of the group's members were likely to begin paying dividends solely because of a law change.
Dividends became far less popular during the 1990's, when the bull market made investors happy to leave cash in the hands of management, which used it for expansion or to buy back shares. The repurchases allowed executives to set aside millions of shares they awarded to themselves as part of their compensation and to help increase the stock price by reducing the supply.
Last year, with the market falling and investors suddenly skeptical of corporate accounting, many dividend-paying companies increased their distributions. But even after the increases, the dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of stock prices -- of the major companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was only 1.83 percent, down from about 6 percent 30 years ago.
Speaking at the Economic Club of Chicago, Mr. Bush proposed, as the centerpiece of his plan to pump more money into the lagging economy, to stop taxing dividends paid to individual investors at ordinary income tax rates. He said ending the "double taxation" of dividends was the proper way to encourage a healthier economy over the longer run. But critics said the plan, by tilting the tax cuts toward wealthy investors, would do little to stimulate immediate spending and spur growth. 
The Bush proposal would not affect people who own stock in 401(k)'s and individual retirement accounts, because their dividends would remain untaxed initially and would continue to be taxed at ordinary income tax rates once money is withdrawn from the accounts. The proposal would also not change the taxes paid by corporations.
Some economists predicted that this continued tax bite would muffle the plan's effect and not change some companies' inclination to rely excessively on debt because of the tax advantages of doing so.
"It would have made more sense to eliminate the corporate tax on dividends and thus treat interest and dividends the same way," said Paul A. Gompers, a finance professor at Harvard Business School. Under the proposal, "the tax code still encourages corporations to take on too much debt."
Indeed, some Wall Street executives questioned whether the plan would cause enough of a change to affect stocks significantly.
"Nothing in this economic package is a magic bullet that will get me to reconstruct my portfolio," said Anthony M. Maramarco, a managing director at David L. Babson & Company, an investment firm. "And anyone who thinks that it will make dividend-paying stocks soar is practicing voodoo dividend-nomics."
Still, executives largely praised the overall plan yesterday, partly because they think it will increase consumer spending and business revenue and partly because they view Mr. Bush as an ally whom they want to support.
"The president has demonstrated leadership in quickly formulating a comprehensive growth proposal," John T. Dillon, chairman of the Business Roundtable and the chief executive of International Paper, said in a statement. "There is a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the United States economy." 
Even if the plan does not cause an immediate surge in dividend payments, it might contribute to investors' growing preference for conservative strategies. Lately, stocks that pay dividends have outperformed those that do not, a sharp reversal from the 1990's.
"Dividends are one of the easiest ways to gauge the quality of a company's earnings," said Frank C. Sullivan, chief executive of RPM International, a specialty chemical company that has increased its dividend for 29 consecutive years. "You need real cash to pay dividends." 
"You can't pay them," he added, "with Tyco or Enron accounting."
Now, investors who want executives to return cash to them, rather than use it for ambitious new plans, will have a new argument. 
"Our point is, this is shareholders' money," said Peter S. Schroeder, a physicist in Seattle who owns 30,000 shares of Microsoft and stood at last year's annual meeting to argue for a dividend. Companies are "not handling it very well; give it to the shareholders." 
At the time, Microsoft executives said they would use their cash for research, share purchases and possible legal settlements related to its recent antitrust trial. Rachel Wayne, a company spokeswoman, said yesterday that Mr. Bush's plan did not change Microsoft's priorities.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Finds It Likes Much of BushProposal 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Attention getting, that is what some on Wall Street like about the tax plan that President Bush announced yesterday. Others noted that the cost means there is little hope of the federal budget returning to surplus anytime soon.
 These are some of the benefits and disadvantages that analysts, economists and money managers were weighing yesterday as they generally voiced support for components of the president's proposal. 
 Some stock analysts worried that the heart of the plan, repealing taxes on stock dividends, would favor older companies that do not create as many jobs as young companies, which prefer to use their extra cash for investment. Some fret that the plan's economic stimulus might turn out to be more than is needed, especially if a war with Iraq is avoided or is quick and successful. Others are doing calculations that show that much of the boost from the plan will be delayed to 2004. 
"There are a lot of crosscurrents," said Douglas R. Cliggott, president of B & P Research.
The general sentiment was that the president was demonstrating his commitment to the economy. "Credibility is very important," said Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates, because then there is "a better chance of convincing the business sector that better times are on the way."
"Right now, the stock market is looking at it and saying they're serious, and that is the crucial component," he added.
Stocks rose sharply on Monday on news that the president would seek to eliminate and not just reduce the tax on dividends, and were little changed yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average off 32.98 points, to 8,740.59, and the Nasdaq index up 10.25 points, to 1,431.57.
The plan announced yesterday in Chicago includes, in addition to the repeal of the tax on dividends, the acceleration of already approved tax-rate cuts through 2010 to this Jan. 1, and the extension of unemployment benefits. The projected cost over 10 years is $670 billion.
The proposal will add to a federal budget deficit that, with a war against Iraq included, is already around $250 billion for the 2003 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1. But there is little concern on Wall Street about a bigger deficit's impact on interest rates and the economy. 
"Over the last 20 years the fact that inflation has been coming down has been an overwhelming driver of interest rates compared to whether deficits are going up or down," said Dan Shackelford, lead portfolio manager for T. Rowe Price's New Income Fund, which has $2 billion invested in bonds.
Another reason for the minimum concern is that the deficit is still a much smaller portion of the gross domestic product than it was when the deficit reached record highs in the early 1990's. Also, interest rates would move higher anyway if the economy picks up speed and borrowing demand rises, with or without a plan aimed at stimulating the economy.
But the tax plan, which began at a figure around $300 billion, has grown so big that it makes promises of returning to a budget surplus hard to swallow. "If anything of that magnitude is approved, it is unlikely we will return to surplus," said James R. Capra, president of Capra Asset Management in Rye, N.Y., and the chief of budget projections at the Congressional Budget Office in the 1970's.
He said the government would need another revenue surge like the one it had in the late 1990's from capital gains "to credibly make the case that we were to return to surplus." And he thinks that such a surge is unlikely before Social Security becomes a drain on federal coffers in 2017.
Mr. Capra said he thought investors in the bond market had yet to focus on this prospect, and when they do, that might have an impact on interest rates. The increase in the issuing of Treasury bills, notes and bonds to cover the deficit borrowing could edge interest rates a bit higher.
Mr. Shackelford of T. Rowe Price said he was worried that the repeal of the tax on dividends would skew investor sentiment toward stocks and away from taxable bonds. Mr. Cliggott of B & P Research said the repeal would make dividend-paying stocks attractive to investors who now buy tax-exempt municipal bonds, forcing already troubled states and local governments to pay higher interest rates when they sell the bonds. 
Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities, said that ending the tax on dividends would shift incentives in the wrong direction among stocks. "The stock market is full of old, mature companies," he said. "Pushing the prices of these stocks up with tax-free dividends will not do anything to create jobs." Mature companies, he said, create fewer jobs than start-ups.
But Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, disagreed. He said the repeal would encourage companies like Microsoft and Cisco Systems to pay dividends.
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation, said that there were still good reasons for companies not to pay dividends, including the need for cash to reinvest in the company and to use in buying other companies. Most companies that pay dividends, he said, are in the utilities, telecommunications and basic materials sectors.
Mr. Barbera also argued that the change in the taxing of dividends would lead to stronger corporate balance sheets. Companies have financed themselves with as much debt as possible because the interest paid on the debt is deductible. But that has also led to companies' taking on too much debt and being overwhelmed by the interest costs when the economy and sales slow. Now companies should be more interested in selling stock to raise capital because the dividends paid to shareholders would be tax free.
Mr. Crandall of Wrightson Associates and Mr. Shackelford say they think that the economy may have already received enough of a boost from the Federal Reserve's reduction in its short-term interest rate benchmark to a 41-year low of 1.25 percent, and the swing to a federal budget deficit from a surplus. "I hope we don't need this," Mr. Crandall said of the president's proposal. 
Mr. Shackelford said the economy was being held back by geopolitical uncertainties, including the threat of a war with Iraq. "If there is a quick resolution of Iraq," he said, "I would be a little worried that the United States economy is too primed."
But Mr. Cliggott said the concentration on repealing the tax on dividends would delay much of the impact of the proposal until late this year or next year. "I am not saying it is a bad thing," he said. "But if you are trying to maximize the economic stimulus for the economy this year, this is not the way to do it."

Bush Details Tax Package As Democrats Criticize Plan
President Bush proposed a big and swift new round of tax cuts for individuals and small businesses, presenting a plan he said would help the economy recover. But Democrats said the plan was largely made of costly and unjustified breaks for the wealthy.
 The proposal is expected to dominate the early months of debate over domestic policy in Congress. Its outlines have already renewed the debate over how to help the weak economy at a time when the federal deficit is rising, financial markets remain jittery, consumer and business confidence is shaky.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: THE OVERVIEW; 
BUSH UNVEILS PLAN TO CUT TAX RATES AND SPUR ECONOMY

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush proposed a big and swift new round of tax cuts for individuals and small businesses today, formally presenting a plan that he said would help the economy recover but that Democrats said was largely made up of fiscally reckless and unjustified breaks for the wealthy.
 The plan would cut personal tax rates this year, give an additional $400-per-child rebate to many families, end the taxation of most stock dividends and provide incentives for small businesses to buy equipment. 
 Its unveiling in a speech here by Mr. Bush set the stage for another round of ideological battles over whether tax cuts should go mostly to the wealthy, who pay most of the taxes, or to lower- and middle-income people, who many Democrats say need it more. By the end of the day, the two parties were trading accusations of class warfare, with the White House saying the government should not punish success and Democrats saying the administration had put aside fairness. 
The proposal, laid out in general terms by Mr. Bush with details released by the White House during the day, is sure to dominate the early months of wrangling over domestic policy in the new Congress, which convened today. The plan's outlines have already renewed the long-running debate over how to address the sluggish economy at a time when the federal budget deficit is rising, financial markets are jittery, international tensions are high and consumer and business confidence is shaky.
"We cannot be satisfied until every part of our economy is healthy and vigorous," Mr. Bush said. "We will not rest until every business has a chance to grow and every person who wants to find work can find a job." Excerpts, Page A14. 
The centerpiece of the plan is the immediate elimination of taxes on stock dividends, a provision the administration said would put $364 billion in the hands of investors over the next decade, making it the plan's biggest component. Many large corporations that do not now pay dividends said the proposal would not lead them immediately to make a change. Business Day, Page C1. 
Democrats said the White House was already on the defensive about the plan's heavy emphasis on tax cuts for investors and people with high incomes, and for good reason.
"Now that we see the president's proposal, we understand why he would be talking about class warfare because his proposal is an assault on the middle class to the benefit of the wealthy," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York.
The White House said the plan would cut taxes by $670 billion over the next 10 years, and just under $100 billion in this calendar year. If passed by Congress, the plan would bring total tax cuts enacted since Mr. Bush took office two years ago to more than $2 trillion over a decade.
The plan seeks to balance the conservative belief in tax cuts as an economic cure-all against the political reality that a package of tax cuts seen as primarily for the wealthy may be politically unpalatable even in a Congress in which Republicans control both chambers. To that end, the package includes components that allow the White House to argue that its benefits would be spread widely.
"These tax reductions will bring real and immediate benefits to middle-income Americans," Mr. Bush said.
Aside from the ending the dividend tax, the other main provision is a call for immediate enactment of lower personal income tax rates and other individual tax cuts that had been scheduled to take effect gradually between now and 2009 under the $1.35 trillion tax cut Mr. Bush signed into law in 2001. The income tax provisions amount to a reduction in revenues of $261 billion over 10 years.
The lower individual tax rates, which would top out at 35 percent, down from the current top rate of 38.6 percent, would be retroactive to the beginning of this year, as would a proposed expansion of the 10 percent bracket, the lowest, to higher income levels. The plan would also raise the child credit that can be claimed by all but upper income families to $1,000 from $600, and the government would send $400 per-child checks to eligible families this year to put the money in their hands right away. In addition, the plan would immediately provide married couples with a tax break that they would not have started receiving until 2005 and would not have been in full effect until 2009.
"By speeding up the income tax cuts, we will speed up economic recovery and the pace of job creation," Mr. Bush said. "If tax relief is good enough for Americans three years from now, it is good enough for Americans today."
To encourage more investment by companies, the proposal would triple, to $75,000, the amount that small businesses could write off each year for the purchase of new equipment, though it would not offer any new tax breaks to big corporations.
To address the problem of rising unemployment, Mr. Bush proposed providing as many as 1.2 million people who are receiving unemployment benefits and meeting certain other tests with up to $3,000 each to defray job retraining, child care and relocation costs. The president also called on Congress to act immediately to extend unemployment benefits, which lapsed for about 800,000 people last month. The Senate approved the measure today, extending benefits for an additional 13 weeks, and the House is expected to approve a similar measure on Wednesday.
Mr. Bush's address here to the Economic Club of Chicago came at a time when his attention is increasingly on the confrontation with Iraq and the growing tension with North Korea.
But the size of his proposal -- far bigger than had been expected on Capitol Hill or on Wall Street even a week ago -- reflected his administration's determination to reassert at regular intervals that Mr. Bush is highly sensitive to rising joblessness and other economic problems. Republicans in Washington said Mr. Bush is intent on avoiding the political mistakes that dogged his father's losing re-election campaign in 1992: losing the support of his conservative base by failing to be aggressive on taxes and allowing Democrats to cast him as out of touch with the economic concerns of working people.
Even as he talked today of helping people cope with rising debt burdens and tax bills, Mr. Bush repeatedly brought his presentation back to jobs. The White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that Mr. Bush's plan would create 2.1 million jobs over the next three years. 
Democrats attacked the plan as an ineffective way of giving the economy an immediate lift and a recipe for assuring that the budget deficit will grow for years or even decades to come.
The Tax Policy Center, a research organization, said 28.3 percent of the tax cuts proposed by Mr. Bush today would go to the top 1 percent of the population by income. The bottom 80 percent would receive 22 percent, the group said.
In the wake of last year's corporate accounting scandals, there has been little appetite in either party to grant tax breaks to large corporations. But Mr. Bush's plan would help them indirectly through the dividend tax cut, which could make it more attractive for companies to raise money in the stock market.
Despite widespread news reports that the president had expanded the size of the package in recent days, White House officials said he had discussed the broad outlines of the plan, including the proposal for elimination of the tax on dividends, at a White House meeting in November and had settled on them by early December.
But Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, told reporters on Air Force One this morning that Mr. Bush had made the final decisions on some smaller aspects of the plan, including the proposal to provide some unemployed workers with up to $3,000 in assistance, only on Monday.
Among the main challenges Mr. Bush's new economic team will face is explaining why the administration is pushing for expensive new tax cuts at a time when the budget deficit is growing rapidly.
They said the best way to eliminate the deficit was to spur more economic growth, and that tax cuts were the best tool available to do that. Mr. Bush said that deficit reduction efforts should also be focused on reining in the growth of government spending outside of the increases he has sought for the military and for domestic security.
The early reaction on Capitol Hill suggested that Mr. Bush would have trouble getting all that he wants from the Senate, where the rules give Democrats some leverage over the outcome.
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana and a centrist who often works across party lines, said he had "real concerns" about aspects of the plan, especially the elimination of the dividend tax, which he said was too expensive. He said there was room for bipartisan compromise, but that it would require to White House to give up some proposals, especially those that do not give the economy an immediate boost.

HEADLINE: An OPEC Move To Lift Output Of Oil Is Seen 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
In an effort to scale back high oil prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries appears likely to meet in Vienna as early as this weekend to discuss increasing production by up to two million barrels a day, or 8.7 percent, a senior OPEC delegate said yesterday.
 Oil prices, which are about 45 percent higher than they were a year ago, have climbed particularly steeply over the last month because a general strike in Venezuela against President Hugo Chavez has virtually shut down oil production there. The price fell sharply yesterday on reports of the possibility of an emergency meeting, with crude oil for February delivery declining $1.02 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $31.08 a barrel in New York. 
 "With regard to the price, there is an agreement from all the countries that the price should not go any higher than $28 a barrel," said one senior OPEC delegate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A production increase, he said, is driven by "our strong commitment to have enough oil on the market at all times and not to let a shortage take place." 
But oil industry analysts and traders pointed out that any additional oil exported by OPEC would not reach the United States soon. As a result, they said they expected the price of oil in the United States to remain above $30 a barrel. Those high prices, in turn, have pushed up retail prices in the United States of gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel.
"The global oil markets are losing two to three million barrels a day because of Venezuela, so an increase by OPEC of about 1.5 million barrels a day is still a far cry from what the markets need," said Philip J. Flynn, senior energy analyst at Alaron, a Chicago futures brokerage firm. "It's a classic case of OPEC trying to jawbone the market down. And the market is believing it, because the market is a very, very fickle animal right now."
In December, OPEC agreed to curtail rampant overproduction within its ranks as members took advantage of high oil prices by pumping more than their official quotas. But that decision was quickly rendered moot by the disruption of oil supplies from Venezuela, the fifth-largest oil producer in the world. OPEC officially produces 23 million barrels a day.
Instead, OPEC began publicly to consider the possibility of a production increase a few weeks ago, after oil prices climbed above $30 a barrel. The 10 voting members of the group have a loose agreement to confer about production changes if the average price of several kinds of crude oil falls below $22 a barrel or exceeds $28 a barrel for 20 consecutive trading days, or about one month. They consider prices in that range high enough to produce robust revenue without pushing the global economy into recession. In the past, OPEC has cut or increased production by 500,000 barrels a day.
But with the prolonged loss of Venezuelan exports and no end in sight for the strikes, OPEC may have to make more drastic production increases, or risk prices that are so high they could choke global demand for oil, analysts said.
Yet OPEC's intervention may not be enough to push prices down near $28 a barrel. Even if the cartel votes for an increase of two million barrels a day, the actual rise could prove smaller. Of the 10 members, only 3 have spare production capacity: the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and, with the most, Saudi Arabia. No oil producers outside OPEC have any spare capacity, either. 
Together, they may produce an additional one million barrels a day, estimated Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. The Reuters news agency reported that oil shippers said the Saudis had already leased extra tankers to take additional crude oil to the United States, starting at the end of this month.
Even if OPEC brings new production on stream quickly, tankers need 45 to 50 days to bring oil from the Persian Gulf to the United States, where the shortfall of Venezuelan oil is being felt most acutely. It took about five to seven days to ship oil from Venezuela, which was the fourth-largest exporter of crude oil to the United States. Since the strike, American refineries have been scrambling to find crude oil, and when supplies have fallen short, they have cut their output. Refiners may still have to resort to such steps as they wait for OPEC oil to arrive, Mr. Goldstein said.
"They will not have enough supply in the system and will have to cut refinery runs," he said. "That means higher prices, not only for now but in springtime."
Mr. Goldstein pointed out that January is when oil companies start building inventories of gasoline for the spring.But if refineries are cutting output, stocks of gasoline may be less than in the past, which could push prices higher at the pump.

HEADLINE: Bush Economic Plan Has Little for New York 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush's plan for stimulating the economy offered little help to Gov. George E. Pataki and New York lawmakers struggling to close a giant shortfall in the state budget.
 In a much anticipated speech in Chicago, the president did not propose $10 billion in grants to financially troubled states to help them make up for falling revenue, as some in New York's Congressional delegation had been told he would. 
 Instead, Mr. Bush proposed a $3.6 billion grant program to pay for job training, day care and other needs of the unemployed.
Senior administration officials said the president had decided not to cushion the deep spending cuts or tax increases that states like New York must enact to balance their books in the teeth of a national recession.
Mr. Bush's stimulus package focused almost entirely on cutting taxes for consumers and investors.
"The states will have to make their own decisions about what to do with their tax bases," said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Governor Pataki, a Republican who has been lobbying the president for more federal aid, had little to say today about Mr. Bush's proposals. He remained closeted with aides going over his annual speech to the Legislature, to be delivered on Wednesday.
"We are still reviewing the president's plan," said Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for the State Budget Division.
The impact of abolishing the federal tax on dividends, as Mr. Bush proposed, on state tax revenue was unclear. The state might still be able to tax dividends, though legislative action might be required, legislative aides said.
Budget officials and state lawmakers were still puzzling over the details of Mr. Bush's proposal last night.
Aides to the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said the state collects about $550 million a year by taxing dividends.
United States Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, said he was told the president dropped the idea of direct grants to states at the last minute.
Mr. Schumer said the Democratic minority in the Senate would fight for more federal aid to states in the final economic stimulus bill.
"I'm disappointed that this was so low a priority that it was taken off the list at the eleventh hour," Mr. Schumer said. "It's something that is desperately needed to provide a shot in the arm quickly."

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
A Bold Plan With Risks

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush opened a second front in his 2004 re-election campaign here with an economic plan far bigger and bolder than many expected.
 Politically, his proposal today is a daring move intended to show a wartime president battling on the domestic front to pump new vitality into a sagging economy, a lesson learned from his father's loss of the White House. 
 It is also a risk that could cause soaring deficits and do little in the short term to stimulate the economy. And the plan has reignited the battle between Republicans and Democrats that traces back to the Reagan tax cuts of the early 1980's and that flared again in Mr. Bush's first year in office when the president began his bold tax cutting. 
But despite the storm that the $674 billion plan will generate (and the prompt Democratic attacks on it as irresponsible, ineffective and ideological show that it will be of hurricane force), Republicans hailed Mr. Bush as a leader who understood the political power of a big idea and the critical need to tend to his conservative, tax-cut loving base.
"This president is not going to be subject to the criticism that he didn't want to do anything," said Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota who is close to the White House. 
Mr. Weber, a member of the House leadership in the administration of President George Bush, recalled that he was in the middle of the Republican "debacle" when Mr. Bush's father raised taxes in an ailing economy as a way to fight deficits.
"It wasn't just that the country didn't see President Bush as having a bold economic agenda to lift us out of the recession," Mr. Weber said. "Beyond that, his own base thought he was doing the wrong thing. So this president has turned that inside out and around. It puts him in the opposite position that his father found himself in."
Mr. Bush's most conservative supporters bathed the president in adoration today for the plan and even hailed it as a "moral" choice that would entirely eliminate the tax that individual investors pay on stock dividends.
It is unfair, conservatives said, to "double-tax," first by taxing corporate profits and then the money sent to shareholders. But administration officials said as recently as Christmas that they were pushing the president for only a 50 percent cut in the dividend tax. 
"If you go with a 50 percent exclusion, it sounds like you're giving a special favor," said Daniel J. Mitchell, a tax economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "I think they've been brilliant about deciding to go bigger. I had no idea they were going to be this bold and aggressive, and that's an enormously progressive surprise."
Mr. Bush's plan was also striking in that it provided nothing for big corporations, a tainted constituency since last summer's corporate scandals.
Business leaders noted, however, that the dividend tax cut could help corporations by encouraging more investment and making it easier for them to raise money. Overt favors to corporate America, they said, were at the moment untenable for the White House.
"Economically, it doesn't matter whether you provide the tax relief to the corporation or the individual," said Mark Bloomfield, the president of the American Council on Capital Formation, a corporate-financed group that advocates tax cuts. "But politically it matters."
Mr. Bush made his case to a friendly crowd of 2,300 entrepreneurs and business leaders invited to a ballroom of the Sheraton Hotel and Towers by the Economic Club of Chicago, a civic group founded in 1927. He chose a Democratic city with a Democratic mayor in an important heartland state that went soundly for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election, but that the White House thinks Mr. Bush can win in 2004.
"This is one of America's great cities," Mr. Bush said in a speech intended to appeal beyond conservative tax-cutting orthodoxy to an "investor class" that encompasses both political parties. "And one of the reasons why is because you have a great mayor in Richard Daley," he said.
Mr. Bush got warm but not always wildly enthusiastic applause from an audience with a heavy representation from Chicago's affluent North Shore suburbs, including some who questioned the financial practicality of his plan.
"How are we going to pay for security and a war when we flood all this money back to average Americans?" said Ann Rahn, 49, a Republican from Lake Forest.
Democrats spent the day attacking the plan as a beautifully wrapped gift for the nation's wealthiest citizens. According to an analysis by Bloomberg News, Mr. Bush himself would have saved $44,500 in income and dividend taxes on the $711,000 in taxable income he reported on his 2001 return had today's plan been enacted last year. Vice President Dick Cheney would have saved $326,555 on 2001 taxable income of $4.3 million, according to Bloomberg. Mr. Bush's plan calls for an immediate start to all personal income tax cuts now scheduled for 2004 and 2006, with the greatest gains going to the most well-off Americans.
"This is a pig that even a Republican python might not be able to swallow," said Robert D. Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, who is now president of the Urban Institute, a centrist research center. "It's breathtakingly large, considering the deficits and the political pressure to spend more on defense, security and prescription drugs for the elderly. Dividend tax relief is like putting frosting on an unbaked cake."
The White House was clearly ready for such criticism. Today a steady chorus of Republicans close to the administration sounded a remarkably similar theme, as if part of an organized campaign, that the Democrats had called the Republicans the party of the rich and tried to fan the flames of class warfare for more than two decades with little effect. "That argument exists with or without this plan," said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster.
Republicans said that the plan's extension of unemployment benefits and a child tax credit were indisputably geared to ordinary Americans, and that Mr. Bush himself had taken care in his language to reach out to the anxieties of the middle class.
"Many Americans live in constant and increasing personal debt, with credit card bills so heavy they often cannot pay much more than the monthly minimum," the president said. "Millions of citizens spend their entire adult lives living paycheck-to-paycheck, never getting a chance to save for their children's education or their own retirement."

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: THE ACTION; 
Senators Vote to Extend Benefits for Unemployed As House Elects Speaker

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
The 108th Congress convened today under Republican control, and the Senate quickly adopted an unemployment benefits extension after a partisan debate that some saw as a prelude to the next two years.
 After 11 new senators were sworn in by Vice President Dick Cheney and Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the new majority leader, took his place, the Senate sought to resolve the first of the issues left over from the last session, a $7 billion plan to keep unemployment checks flowing this week to about 800,000 people. 
 Republicans had hoped to use the measure to demonstrate that the abrupt change in their leadership caused by the ouster of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi would not stymie their ability to move legislation. But Democrats, pushing for a more generous plan to cover those whose benefits had expired, stalled the proposal for a few hours. 
 "We are leaving over one million people who have absolutely no recourse, have no assistance whatsoever because their benefits have expired," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.
The unemployment plan, similar to one adopted by the Senate in November but blocked by the House, would extend through May compensation for those who have used up their state benefits. The House is expected to pass it Wednesday, allowing President Bush to sign it before the end of the week.
Fifty-four new House members were sworn in, giving the Republicans a 229-205 advantage after a net gain of six seats in the November elections. The Senate is effectively divided 51-49 in favor of Republicans.
In the House, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois was assured re-election as speaker, given the Republican majority. The formal vote, along party lines, was 228 to 201 (one Republican was absent) over the new Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, the first woman to be nominated by her party for the post. 
Three conservative Southern Democrats -- Ralph M. Hall and Charles W. Stenholm of Texas and Ken Lucas of Kentucky -- voted present, registering their philosophical differences with Ms. Pelosi, who has a liberal background. Gene Taylor, Democrat of Mississippi, voted for John P. Murtha, Democrat of Pennsylvania.
 The House had a partisan fight of its own as Democrats opposed changes that critics say will weaken restrictions on travel and food paid for by outside groups. The rules, adopted on a 221-to-203 vote, also lift a four-term limit on the speaker imposed by Republicans after taking over the House in 1994.
"Republicans are returning to that which they criticized bitterly in 1994," said the new Democratic whip, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, referring to earlier complaints about Democratic rule. "They said they were going to reform the House, make it more democratic, make it more open."
Despite the early battles, Republican leaders in both the House and Senate said they wanted to work with their Democratic colleagues to reach some legislative compromises.
"We are going to have our fair share of disagreements, because that is the nature of our two-party system," Mr. Hastert said, addressing Ms. Pelosi, "But together we must always find ways to make America a better and more secure place."
Dr. Frist, the former heart transplant surgeon elevated just a few weeks ago by his colleagues, said he hoped to be able to work with Democrats on what he called the nation's challenges: a fight against terrorism, a troubled economy and crises in health care. And, in an apparent reference to the furor over the racially tinged remarks that cost Mr. Lott his job, Dr. Frist also added "ensuring our agenda is inclusive of all Americans" to the list.
"It is my hope in this Congress that we will be defined by achievement as well as a cooperative spirit," Dr. Frist said.
Opening day came with the usual pomp and ceremony associated with the arrival of new members, many of whom had fought in bruising campaigns to win their seats. Hundreds of family members were on hand for the official Congressional business and scores of receptions. Children roamed the floor of the House, and Tom DeLay of Texas, the tough tactician who is the new majority leader, cuddled his 5-month-old grandson.
With a presidential election next year and Democrats already criticizing Mr. Bush's proposed economic plan as too costly and generous to wealthy Americans, the Congressional session is certain to have its share of fights. Republicans and Democrats are also divided on proposals like Arctic oil drilling and how to provide older Americans with prescription drug coverage. And President Bush resubmitted two judicial nominations today that had been the center of partisan fights last year.
 Democrats promised to press the Republican leadership to follow through on a promise to reconsider some provisions in a domestic security measure passed last year. And Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, introduced legislation to reinstate the draft, saying the move "is necessary to achieve a full sharing of the sacrifice which will be required of the American people if the president chooses to invade Iraq and pursues military options elsewhere." At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld emphatically opposed the idea.
Dr. Frist, in his first Senate floor action, got a taste of the opposition he faces when Democrats balked at the unemployment proposal. He did not hide his displeasure, saying it had been his understanding that both parties had agreed to back the measure. "I guess that is what I can come to expect," Dr. Frist said.
Other Republicans accused Democrats of grandstanding, saying they had helped write the proposal they were contesting. "Let's not play politics out of the box with this," said Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, who said the expanded coverage sought by the Democrats would not pass the House.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who helped work out the unemployment package, said she and other Democrats would continue to press for the expanded coverage.
Some newcomers to the Senate said they were surprised by how quickly the partisan tone surfaced. "If this is the way things are going to be, I should bring my Bible every day," said Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee.
In the House, Republican officials defended the disputed rules changes, saying that allowing House offices to accept food from outside groups was simply a way to help overworked, underpaid staff by allowing them to accept pizza on late nights in the office. They said another change allowing charity groups to pay for travel by lawmakers to golf tournaments and other events would be restricted to those groups that direct most of the proceeds to charity.
Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a watchdog group, called the changes irresponsible, particularly coming on the first day of the new Congress.
 Representative Joel Hefley, Republican of Colorado and chairman of the House Ethics Committee, said the food rule might have to be revisited because it could allow situations where lobbying groups provide dinner for whole committees meeting late. "I think it looks bad," Mr. Hefley said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASIAN ARENA; 
U.S., in a Shift, Is Willing to Talk With North Korea About A-Arms

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, shifting its approach on North Korea under pressure from allies in the region, expressed willingness today to talk with President Kim Jong Il's government about its nuclear weapons program, while still refusing to offer incentives for the program to be dismantled.
 The administration's new position, negotiated during two days of meetings with envoys from South Korea and Japan, was included in a statement from the three nations. The statement also supported continuation of a separate "dialogue" with the North by South Korea and Japan. 
 Since the surprise disclosure of North Korea's nuclear weapons program in October, President Bush and administration officials had maintained that North Korea would have to dismantle the program before Washington would even talk with the North. Today's statement changed that stance. 
"The U.S. delegation explained that the United States is willing to talk to North Korea about how it will meet its obligations to the international community," it said. "However, the U.S. delegation stressed that the United States will not provide quid pro quos to North Korea to live up to its existing obligations."
The joint statement seemed to represent an effort by the administration to defuse a confrontational atmosphere marked by increasingly strident denunciations from the North and a disagreement on negotiating strategy between Washington and Seoul. The abrupt shift also showed an administration apparently scrambling to draft a coherent policy to deal with North Korea's revitalized pursuit of nuclear arms.
 On Wednesday, South Korea lauded Washington's offer to talk, but the official North Korea news agency said the United States was "working hard to bring a holocaust of a nuclear war to the Korean nation." 
 "There is an increasing danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula due to the U.S. criminal policy" toward North Korea, the Korean Central News Agency said. It accused the United States of "deliberately spreading a false rumour" about the North's nuclear program "in a bid to vitiate the atmosphere of inter-Korean reconciliation and unity and foster confrontation among Koreans." 
In the last 48 hours, the administration has sought to lower the temperature on a number of fronts. At a cabinet meeting on Monday, Mr. Bush repeated several times his statement of America's peaceful intentions. The United States also decided to delay taking the issue to the United Nations Security Council, a step that administration officials had said they would push for rapidly.
An administration official maintained that the statement today was more of a shift in emphasis than a policy change. "We are putting more emphasis on talking now," he said.
Nevertheless, diplomats welcomed the statement as a new iteration by an administration that has been seen as changing its policy toward North Korea many times.
Representatives of Russia, China, Australia, Canada and the European Union were briefed on the statement this afternoon at the State Department. One diplomat later called it "a very positive development."
South Korean officials, especially, have said that although they have supported the basics of American policy in demanding that North Korea abandon its nuclear ambitions, they are worried about the situation getting out of hand. The president-elect of South Korea, Roh Moo Hyun, who takes office next month, is said by some advisers to see himself as a potential mediator between Pyongyang and Washington.
An administration official said the joint statement was transmitted to North Korea through its mission at the United Nations. 
It was not clear which country would be the next to test North Korea's reaction. One diplomat said the North and South Korean foreign ministers were scheduled to meet next week in Seoul, which could provide the first opportunity. 
Also uncertain was exactly what North Korea and its interlocutors would talk about, given that the statement today confined the proposed discussions to how North Korea could "meet its obligations to the international community" -- language that an official said referred to its commitments over the years to refrain from making nuclear weapons and to allow inspections.
Mr. Bush's national security aides insisted that any conversation with the North would be limited to freezing and ultimately dismantling its two nuclear projects: a plutonium program at Yongbyon and a hidden effort to develop a weapon by enriching uranium.
At the State Department, Richard A. Boucher, the spokesman, said that for all the language inviting talks with the North Koreans, "they have to end the programs for anything real to happen." Asked about benefits that might accrue to the North, he said a package of aid had been prepared by the administration earlier last year, before the current confrontation. This "remains on the table," he added, but only if North Korea moves toward dismantling its nuclear projects. 
Mr. Bush spoke in Chicago today to outline his economic proposals but demonstrated that the quickening tempo of the North Korea situation was not far from his mind. After renewing his demand that Saddam Hussein disarm in Iraq, Mr. Bush said the United States would "confront" the threat of North Korea, but differently from the way it is dealing with Iraq.
"In this case, I believe that by working with countries in the region, diplomacy will work," he said. "We have no aggressive intent, no argument with the North Korean people."
Yet in a gesture to those who argue that a show of strength is also useful for the North, he added that the United States "will not permit any regime to threaten the freedom and security of the American people or our allies and friends around the world."
The three-nation meeting today involved envoys who have been wrestling with the problem of North Korea for months. The American delegation was led by James A. Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern and Pacific affairs. His counterparts were the deputy foreign minister of South Korea, Lee Tae Sik, and Mitoji Yabunaka, the Japanese Foreign Ministry's director of Asian and Oceanian affairs.
Their handiwork, a statement of about 800 words, addressed several contentious side issues that had arisen in recent days with North Korea, according to an administration official.
For example, North Korean officials have said repeatedly that the United States could solve the current confrontation by signing a nonaggression pact. The statement today emphasized that Japan, South Korea and the United States "reaffirmed" their commitment to a 1991 accord between the North and the South that included a nonaggression pledge.
The policy adjustment today is the latest of several shifts by Mr. Bush. At first embracing the Clinton-era policy of negotiation, he then conducted a re-evaluation that ended up with a policy that somewhat resembled President Bill Clinton's. Last year, after disclosures that North Korea had cheated on its 1994 pledge not to make nuclear weapons, the administration's position hardened.

HEADLINE: MAKING BOOKS; 
Spiking Up Flat Landscapes

BYLINE:  By Martin Arnold 

 BODY:
Where is the next "Lovely Bones" when it's so badly needed? Publishing people returned to their offices this week after their year-end holidaying to wintry fields of unsettling news. Book sales were flatter than desired. Just as forlorn a note was the news that one of the most important and admired independent bookstores in the country had laid off nearly 10 percent of its staff. So there was a chill on the new year before it even started, as publishers looked to a midwinter of heavy returns and less-than-hefty cash register activity.
 That's the bad news. The good news is that publishers are an optimistic lot, and many have their own equipages to cope with the bad as they try to concentrate on the good. 
 For instance, Susan Petersen Kennedy, president of Penguin Putnam Inc., is looking for new ways to market, using the Web not only to research where potential buyers for a particular book might be, but also to reach those buyers. Irwyn Applebaum, publisher of the Bantam Dell Publishing Group, said that "in good times or bad people are going to wake up and want to read a good novel." That's why, among other things, he is counting heavily in gloomy days on the less expensive mass-market paperbacks to have "the greatest entry price to bring readers back" and get them headed once again to the shelves that carry his large hardcover list. "It doesn't matter whether the reader comes to us through mass-market or trade paper or hardcover," he said. "We've got to have the capacity to bring that reader to an author."
When the book people returned from their seasonal break, the first news that gave them the quavers was the awful announcement that Denver's Tattered Cover bookstore, the independent immune from the chain-store syndrome, had laid off 27 of its staff of 300 or so, the first time in its 28 years that employees were let go because of the economy. 
A single bookstore, but one considered a bellwether, even a charm of sorts for the industry. Many a best-selling novel got its blastoff not from a chain, but from the word-of-mouth generated by the independents, making their importance often far greater proportionally than their size.
Other troubling happenings: Colorado Springs's Chinook Bookstore hasn't replaced four employees and has cut wages, and the Oscar Wilde Bookshop in Greenwich Village, the oldest gay and lesbian bookstore in the country, announced it was closing by the end of the month.
So, yes, everyone is asking where is the next "Lovely Bones" (Little, Brown), Alice Sebold's first novel, which has been the surprise runaway of the year. But Laurence J. Kirshbaum, chief executive of the AOL Time Warner Book Group, said: "We also must be realistic. What we need is a lot of singles and doubles rather than home runs." Perhaps it's easy for him to feel that loose, since "The Lovely Bones" is his book and is still churning out money. He added: "If you keep thinking of big books, it can lead to a lot of overpromotion for something that doesn't sell that well."
Still, all the houses have their hopefuls. A few: Alfred A. Knopf is trying to make John Burdett's thriller "Bangkok 8" a big breakout book this summer with a first printing of 100,000 copies, and has sent advance reader copies to 2,500 booksellers accompanied by the usual all-promising letter from its publisher, Sonny Mehta. Warner Books is pushing "Derailed" by James Siegel, a suspense novel, with a first printing of 125,000 copies and advance copies accompanied by a letter from Mr. Kirshbaum; its sister publisher, Little, Brown, has an upcoming Pete Hamill novel, "Forever."
Ms. Kennedy's group is looking to "The Kite Runner" (Riverhead) by Khaled Hosseini, a coming-of-age novel set in Afghanistan, and Caroline Alexander's "The Bounty: The True Story of the Mutiny on the Bounty" from Viking. At Grove Atlantic there will be a big fall push for Frances Itani's "Deafening," a World War I novel centered on a woman who lost her hearing because of scarlet fever.
One must have faith to succeed in producing books. "The great thing about publishing is that we all believe in the next hit -- it's coming," is the way Morgan Entrekin, the Grove Atlantic publisher, described the ethos, adding: "The book publishing business is as soft as I've seen it for a long time. You can tighten your belts but you need new books."
In times like these the romance of publishing doesn't disappear, but the emphasis is on the courting rituals. Ms. Kennedy said, "It's nice to know that among all we publish, lightning can still strike." Nonetheless, publishers, like other gamblers, cut the cards. "We now take a book apart," she said, "and think of all the different types of people who might buy it, and then try to reach them. It's a more sophisticated use of the Web. Three years ago we were paying little attention to that science."
An example: For "The Bounty," the house will use the Web to find readers interested in the mutiny's era (the late 18th century), interested in boats and boating in general, and fans of the several movie versions of "The Mutiny on the Bounty" and bombard them with sales pitches. "In the old days, we had to depend on network television and Time magazine and Vanity Fair to reach customers," Ms. Kennedy said. "We still do, but now there's also this research and communication tool, the Web, for every kind of book. Its a way of reaching even more people." 
Everyone is trying something. HarperCollins has announced what it calls its Invite the Author program, through which reading clubs can have authors take part in the club's book discussions by telephone. Only HarperCollins books allowed, obviously.
Anything that may move books is worth a try. The thought of authors and readers burning up the telephone wires with a bit of confutation is giddying. Check back in 12 months and we'll see if any of this worked. Which book will have been the "Lovely Bones" everyone was hoping to discover? Will there even have been one?

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Still Sees 3.7% Growth This Year 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
An International Monetary Fund official said here today that the organization was sticking with its optimistic forecast that the world's economy would grow 3.7 percent this year, with much of Asia doing even better.
 The official, Thomas C. Dawson, the I.M.F.'s director of external relations and top spokesman, said that the forecast made last autumn would not be revised before the next meeting of the fund's top officials, in April. But he did acknowledge that "the pace of recovery is rather tepid, and downside risks appear to predominate." 
 The three biggest risks, he said, in a speech at the Foreign Correspondents' Club here, are a sustained increase in oil prices, terrorist attacks and further economic deterioration in Japan. 
The International Monetary Fund, like many foreign governments and private economists, has been urging the Bank of Japan to expand the money supply more aggressively, and Mr. Dawson reiterated this today. Doing so would most likely drive down the value of the yen and would tend to increase competitiveness and the volume of Japanese exports to the United States, a possibility that has concerned some American officials.
The I.M.F. is predicting that the Chinese economy will continue to grow this year at its recent rate of 7 to 8 percent annually, while the economies of Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan will expand 3.5 to 6 percent a year, with Hong Kong at the lower end of the range, Mr. Dawson said. For the larger economies in Southeast Asia, notably the Philippines and Indonesia, the fund sees a slight acceleration in growth, to around 4 percent, he added, while it anticipates growth of close to 6 percent in India.
The I.M.F. forecasts are somewhat more optimistic than most private forecasts. Huang Yiping, a regional economist specializing in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan at Salomon Smith Barney, said that the investment bank was predicting global growth of 2.5 percent this year, led by China, with an increase there of 7.6 percent.
But Mr. Huang agreed with Mr. Dawson that "the risk is more in the geopolitical factors" and in the possibility that the Japanese economy may deteriorate further.
After the terror attacks of Sept. 11, some private economists predicted a sharp deterioration in the global economy in 2002 and perhaps even a recession, although Salomon Smith Barney predicted growth of 2 percent. But the I.M.F. forecast that the international economy would expand 2.4 percent, buoyed partly by the continued strength of China.
Mr. Dawson said today that the fund's best estimate now for global growth in 2002 was 2.8 percent.
His long speech today was part of a recent effort by the fund to become more open after being bitterly criticized in Southeast Asia for its secrecy in formulating responses to the region's financial crisis in 1997 and 1998.
Defending the I.M.F.'s actions then, Mr. Dawson said that the organization had realized earlier in the crisis than it had been given credit for that there were benefits in allowing larger government deficits. 
He was critical of Argentina, another economy where a currency board arrangement was undone by huge budget deficits, saying that the country might have been able to sustain its currency peg through the crisis if it had done more to balance its budget or finance its deficit in noninflationary ways.
"It was not a technical inability -- it was a political failure," he said.
I.M.F. officials will probably send a mission to Buenos Aires soon to discuss how the economy's continued difficulties should be addressed, Mr. Dawson said, adding that the fund wants to see a budget surplus and more stable monetary policy.
Mr. Dawson praised Hong Kong's currency board, which has kept the Hong Kong dollar pegged at 7.8 to the United States dollar despite several years of weak economic performance here.
By preventing devaluation and keeping Hong Kong one of the world's most expensive cities in which to live, the currency peg has been widely blamed here for contributing to the territory's severe deflation and rising unemployment. But the peg has preserved the territory's reputation as a safe place to invest with little worry about currency fluctuations.
"There's every reason to believe they will be able to continue" with the peg, Mr. Dawson said. "Markets respect track records, and there's a track record here to respect."

HEADLINE: The World Still Watches America 

BYLINE:  By Neal Gabler; Neal Gabler, author of "An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood" and "Life the Movie," is writing a biography of Walt Disney.

DATELINE: AMAGANSETT, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Once again, we are told, America's cultural hegemony is cracking. The latest proof: American television programs, which had dominated prime-time viewing in Europe and Asia for decades, are now being consigned to the late-night fringes of the schedule.
 One European TV executive was quoted as saying that you can no longer win a prime-time slot with an American show. In markets as diverse as Malaysia, France and Latin America, where "Dallas" and "Baywatch" were once blockbusters, locally produced soap operas and crime shows rule the ratings. Today, "C.S.I.," the top-rated show in this country, cannot attract even 3 percent of the viewers in South Korea. 
 Explanations for the decline range from general anti-American political sentiment to growing resentment of American cultural influence to the rising cost of American shows. There is also the privatization of the old state-run networks, which has resulted in increased competition and greater demand for programs to fill expanded schedules, even as, paradoxically, the popularity of each individual show plummets.
Still, one shouldn't mourn the end of American cultural domination quite yet. There will always be the movies. And the truth is, American movies, not TV shows, are the truly potent examples of our cultural imperialism. 
Films are far more costly than television programs and also face increased local competition, yet American movies don't seem to be suffering a similar diminution in popularity -- they continue to rake in nearly 80 percent of the film industry's worldwide take. Even in France, where sensitivity to alleged American bullying and belief in native cultural superiority may be stronger than anywhere else in the world, Hollywood movies continue to account for 50 percent to 70 percent of box office receipts every year.
All of which leads one to suspect that the reason American television shows are losing popularity has less to do with resentments or economics than with fundamental differences between American television and American film. Movies are universal, TV is not.
In the United States, the film exhibition industry erupted in the early 1900's in working-class urban neighborhoods and movies were regarded, in the words of The Nation magazine in 1913, as a "democratic art" intended specifically for the masses. 
By the 1920's, however, film became the medium of the middle, cutting a wide swath through every demographic group. The studios, which owned the theaters, had made a concerted effort to broaden their films' appeal -- making them longer and better, using marketing to establish the first heartthrobs and sirens, and erecting lavish movie palaces that would elevate the movie-going experience. By decade's end, 90 million Americans were attending the movies each week, three attendees for each American household. 
It was the ability of the movies to appeal to people of all ages, religions, ethnicities and regions that enabled Hollywood to export them. Already by 1925, 30 percent of the studios' profits came from overseas. (Today it is around 60 percent.) Part of this universality was aesthetic. Even after the silent era ended, the scale of American films, their speed and their action made them accessible to anyone. 
Part of the attraction was ideological. American films, concentrating on stars framed in close-ups, promoted the centrality and the efficacy of individual action -- a world that conformed to our vicarious will. Taken together, the artistry and the values made movie-going an otherworldly experience. Movies may be the medium of the middle in the composition of their audiences, but they are the medium of the exceptional in the way they grab those audiences.
Though television arrived in this country in the late 1940's amid fears in Hollywood that it would usurp film's audience, those concerns obviously proved ungrounded. Television couldn't have been more different a medium. Whereas the movies were made to mesmerize hundreds gathered in the dark, television was pitched to families huddled in their living rooms and dens. Whereas the movies emphasized the extraordinary, television relied on the familiar. 
From its inception, television was a medium not of the intrepid or the glamorous individual but of ensembles, and it required an understanding of group dynamics that was not always easily translatable to other cultures. A German colleague of mine told me that "ER" is virtually unintelligible (and unwatched) in his country because Germans don't understand the easy camaraderie between different races and classes on the show. 
To this aesthetic barrier was added a sociological one. Since it was sponsor-supported, television pitched itself to clusters of viewers -- potential buyers -- rather than to the undifferentiated mass. It tried to attract what one might call a vertical audience rather than the large horizontal audience for which the movies aimed. 
While Hollywood didn't tailor its product to blacks or Catholics or children, television always has. In its early days there was "The Goldbergs," about a Jewish family living in a Bronx tenement, "Beulah," starring Ethel Waters as a black maid, and "Life Is Worth Living," a prime-time religious program featuring Bishop Fulton Sheen. (Although there is more of a niche market in movies these days, no studio depends on movies of, say, black interest or religious appeal to hold up the bottom line.)
Television now reaches almost every household in America, but it has never lost its narrowcast mindset. It is still demographically driven, with programs aimed at slices of the audience. The result is that television has a kind of clubbiness, using references, gestures and attitudes that don't always cross our country's demographic lines, much less international borders. 
Indeed, the American shows that have traveled best around the globe are those that deal in the basics -- sex ("Baywatch") and melodrama ("Dallas") -- and even with these shows part of the appeal for foreign markets was that they reinforced the stereotype of American vulgarity. 
The decline of American shows around the world, then, should be seen as a fulfillment of television's destiny, a destiny that had only been postponed until local markets gained the know-how, the money and the corporate structure to make their own programs for slices of their own audience. It also reflects a technological advance -- the new panoply of cable and satellite channels that are breaking TV audiences down into niche groups -- that perfectly mirrors what has been happening in America for the last three decades. 
Our movies continue to be universal, exporting the primal aesthetic of excitement and individualism. Our TV shows continue to be domestic. And the rest of world is likely to continue to be divided between the American movies they love and the American television shows they don't really understand and, more and more, don't really care to watch.

HEADLINE: Alcoa Posts Unexpectedly Large Quarter Loss, and Its Shares Fall 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum producer, reported a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss yesterday, hurt by weak demand for aluminum and charges for an overhaul that will include the elimination of 8,000 jobs and the sale of struggling divisions. 
 Alcoa is moving to cut costs as aluminum prices are under pressure from oversupply and poor demand from companies that use it in aircraft and gas-turbine components. 
 Shares of Alcoa fell $2.53 yesterday, to $21.85, after the company surprised Wall Street by reporting a fourth-quarter net loss of $223 million, or 27 cents a share. In the period a year earlier, when it also took a charge for restructuring, the company had a net loss of $142 million, or 17 cents a share. Even without special items, the quarterly results were lower than the 20 cents to 32 cents a share expected by Thomson First Call. 
As part of its overhaul, Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, will eliminate 8,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of the work force. Most of the job cuts will occur this year and come from Alcoa smelters in the United States and businesses serving the aerospace, gas-turbine and automotive industries. To account for the job cuts and the corporate overhaul, Alcoa took a fourth-quarter charge of $95 million. 
A weak United States economy, including the effects of the terrorist attacks, is hurting big aluminum customers like airlines and utilities. New plane orders are lower, and orders for generators like gas turbines are being canceled or delayed as power companies suffer from relatively low wholesale prices for electricity and from credit problems. 
Alcoa also took a fourth-quarter charge of $221 million for the planned sale of some businesses, including specialty chemicals and specialty packaging equipment, that generated about $1.3 billion in 2002. Proceeds from the sales will be used to repay debt. 
Excluding charges, the company had a profit of 16 cents a share, down from 17 cents a year earlier. Sales fell to $5.06 billion from $5.10 billion.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Report Shows Steep November Drop 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing in November had the biggest decline in 11 years, the Federal Reserve reported today, an indication that Americans are becoming more wary of taking on debt.
 The Fed reported that borrowing through credit cards and other types of loans decreased at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, or $2.2 billion, the first drop since January 1998 and the biggest since October 1991, when the total decreased at a rate of $2.4 billion. 
This follows an increase of $1.5 billion in October. 
 "Households continue to use debt with great caution because of worries about sluggish job markets and an already high debt burden," said Steven Wood, principal economist at Insight Economics in Walnut Creek, Calif. "Although consumers can be tempted to borrow when interest rates are very low, they are growing their nonmortgage debt more slowly."
Economists had expected consumer credit to rise at a $3.8 billion annual rate in November.
The figures are often volatile and previous declines have been revised away in subsequent months.
Last February, the Fed initially reported December consumer borrowing had fallen by $5.1 billion. That figure was revised the next month to show a $3.7 billion gain.
Borrowing by consumers totaled $1.7 trillion in November, the Fed said. The Fed's report on consumer credit does not include loans that are secured by real estate, like mortgages and home equity lines of credit.
Credit card and other revolving debt fell at a $1.6 billion annual pace in the month, after a $2.4 billion increase in October.
Nonrevolving loans, which include those for cars, fell at a $600 million rate in November after dropping at a $900 million pace the previous month.

HEADLINE: Panel Clears Harsher Terms In CorporateCrime Cases 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LICHTBLAU 

 BODY:
The United States Sentencing Commission approved an emergency plan yesterday that would lengthen prison sentences for corporate criminals, rebuffing Justice Department officials who contended that the new guidelines did not go far enough.
 The guidelines, which grew out of the rash of frauds and corporate scandals last year at Enron and other major corporations, increase the penalties faced by corporate offenders in many federal cases by 25 percent or more, officials said. 
 A person convicted of securities fraud who had faced up to six and a half years in prison can now be sentenced to as much as eight years under the new guidelines, officials said. If the offender was an officer or director of a publicly traded company, the sentence could grow to 10 years. 
The commission approved the new guidelines by a vote of 5 to 0. The emergency plan, which creates a new sentencing formula that federal judges are expected to follow in imposing sentences, goes into effect later this month and will last at least through November. The commission expects to come back with a refined and permanent plan in April, which Congress then has the power to review. 
Congress ordered new sentencing guidelines last year when it passed a corporate cleanup measure, known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was intended to help restore consumer confidence after the exposure of widespread accounting scandals in publicly traded companies. 
"The message of today's amendment is very simple: If you do the crime, you'll do the time," said Ruben Castillo, a member of the commission. "Crimes in the suites will be treated the same, if not more seriously, than crimes in the streets."
But the vote brought sharp criticism from both federal prosecutors, who said the plan was too soft on some types of crime, and defense lawyers, who deemed it an overreaction to public pressure.
"These guidelines are extremely harsh," said James Felman, a defense lawyer in Tampa, Fla., who serves on an advisory panel to the sentencing commission. "This is like a nuclear bomb dropped on anyone who has anything to do with any of these offenses. Some people will be facing life in prison."
But officials at the Justice Department, which prosecutes federal white-collar crimes, objected to the plan for just the opposite reason, saying that the new guidelines largely ignore corporate offenders in smaller-scale offenses that involve smaller amounts of money or fewer investors.
Eric H. Jaso, a Justice Department official who is a nonvoting member of the commission, said that the commission had the authority from Congress to "raise penalties across the board." 
"Many smaller-scale frauds cause devastating harm across the country," he said. He added that the department was "tremendously disappointed and frustrated" with the plan and that it "sends the wrong message" to corporate criminals and to the public.
The Justice Department is considering whether to propose toughened legislation in Congress to effectively correct the deficiencies in the sentencing commission's plan, he said.
But commission members defended their plan, saying that it is not clear that the penalties for low-level fraud that the Justice Department was seeking were even authorized by Congress. 
They said that Congress called for stiffer penalties for "serious" offenses, and that the penalties sought by the Justice Department did not fall into that category. "The law says 'serious' fraud cases," said a commission member, William K. Sessions. "We have to do what Congress says." 
The chairwoman of the commission, Diana E. Murphy, said, "There isn't clarity for some in what the term 'serious' means in Sarbanes-Oxley."
In opposing the demands from the Justice Department, the commissioners also said that enacting stiffer penalties for all fraud cases could strain law enforcement resources and add to prison overcrowding. 
Mr. Castillo called for studies on the impact on prisons of the Justice Department's plan. "We must be careful about how we use investigative and prison resources," he said.
He also said that one problem with the department's recommendations was that it could put offenders in prison and prevent them from earning the money to pay back victims. "If they go to jail and they are employed, you take away their ability to make restitution," he said. "Victims, more than anything else, want their money back."
One commissioner, Michael E. O'Neill, said he wished Congress had not requested that the amendment be passed on an emergency basis because it did not give the members enough time to study the issues. "We're not exactly sure what the proper course is," he said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: REPUBLICANS; 
Frist Points to Racial Inequities in Health Care

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Bill Frist, the new Senate majority leader, vowed today to reduce racial disparities in health care as a means of repairing his party's standing with minorities.
 Joining other senior Senate Republicans in presenting the first outline of their priorities for the Congressional session, Dr. Frist did not mention the remarks, widely viewed as racially insensitive, that led to the downfall of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, his predecessor as Republican leader. But he maintained that it was time to address forthrightly issues of racial reconciliation that, he said, many in and out of his party have tried to avoid in the past. 
 To that end, he said, the Republican-controlled Senate will try to increase spending on historically black colleges and will add money to the election overhaul effort that began last year to improve access to voter rolls and polling places.
But Dr. Frist, a physician, also called for intensifying the fight against the spread of H.I.V. in Africa and improving the health care of blacks and other minorities at home.
"For reasons we don't fully understand, but we've got to face and we've got to elevate, we know that African-Americans today do not live as long," he said, flanked at a news conference by six other members of the Senate Republican leadership. "They don't have the same access, and the doctor-patient relationship in some way is colored by the medical training. And that's something I began to address a long time ago and will continue to address."
But the leaders, taking a break in the midst of an all-day Republican strategy session at the Library of Congress, did not list those issues as among their top five legislative priorities. That agenda, as described by Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, begins with passage of President Bush's tax-cut proposal, followed by improvements in domestic and national security, adoption of prescription drug coverage for the elderly, financing of the Bush education program enacted last year and approval of an energy bill that features new oil exploration in the Alaskan wilderness.
The list offered no details of new legislative initiatives, many of which will apparently have to wait for the president's State of the Union address on Jan. 28.
Although the government is already facing large deficits, the Republican leaders said they did not fear that the president's tax-cut proposal, amounting to $670 billion over 10 years, and new spending would add to fiscal strains. They said that once the economy began to grow, the red ink would disappear.
"I think the president's been very, very clear that in a time when you're in a recession and a time when you're at war, you have to focus on, No. 1, winning the war, and No. 2, trying to get this economy up and going," Mr. Santorum said. "And I think if you look at the history, that if the economy is strong, deficits go away. We saw that in the 1990's. Spending was historically very, very high, yet the deficits went away and we went into surplus."
Dr. Frist, a Tennessean in his second term, seemed reluctant to get into many specifics. He tried to have other senators provide answers but was repeatedly called to the microphone by reporters, who had not been able to question him since Senate Republicans elected him their leader two weeks ago.
He became more focused in discussing his plans to restructure Medicare and address problems in the private health care system as well. He said he wanted to find a way to bring health care to the uninsured, though he did not explain how he hoped to do so.
"Health care disparities, minority versus nonminority populations, is something I feel strongly about," he said. "So you'll see that elevated. So when we say Medicare, prescription drugs, which is what everybody thinks about, let's not forget that there are many health care challenges, which I would call crises, out there today."
While in the Senate, Dr. Frist has generally advocated a stronger role for private insurance companies in helping provide prescription drugs through Medicare, a position at odds with the Democratic plan to have the government pay for the drugs. He spoke today of his frustration at writing thousands of prescriptions over the years knowing that many would not be filled because they were not covered by Medicare.
"Medicare today, because it has been outdated -- it hasn't changed very much since 1965 -- needs to be strengthened, and it needs to be improved," he said. "And I'm committed to do that, and as a part of that, I very much, based on what I just said, think that a prescription drug benefit needs to be a part of Medicare as part of that strengthening process."
Health care and education spending are the top priorities of Senate Democrats, as outlined this week by their leader, Tom Daschle. But the parties differ sharply on both issues.
Democrats will in many cases be able to prevent the enactment of Republican priorities, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican whip, acknowledged today that his party, holding 51 of the Senate's 100 seats, would often have to depend on a few Democratic votes.
"We're realistic," Mr. McConnell said. "I mean, clearly, here the American political system is about as tight as it has been in our history, with the possible exception of the 1880's. We know what the numbers are, and we know that the only way we're going to be able to advance our own agenda and the president's agenda is with cooperation across the aisle."
Several Democrats signaled today that they would begin trying to rescind various pro-business provisions that were inserted by Republicans late last year in the bill that created a Department of Homeland Security.
A group of parents who say a vaccine preservative may have caused their children's autism held a protest rally on Capitol Hill today, urging that one such provision, giving vaccine manufacturers immunity from lawsuits related to the issue, now be removed from the Homeland Security law, as Republicans have promised.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Wall St. Journal Is Considering Putting Out Issue On Saturdays

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Executives of The Wall Street Journal and its parent, Dow Jones & Company, are exploring the addition of a Saturday paper to its weekday schedule, as they seek to become more competitive journalistically and to broaden an advertising base heavily dependent on business-related advertising. 
 Several Journal and Dow Jones executives who have been briefed on the undertaking said that there was no set timetable for the project and that the new issue might prove unworkable. 
 But they added that the moment might be right to put into effect an idea that has percolated for years around the corridors of the newspaper's office in the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan.
The advertising recession, which has hit The Journal harder than other newspapers because of its disproportionate dependence on the hardest-hit advertising categories like financial services and technology, has underscored the need for the newspaper to attract more advertising aimed at consumers. In terms of news coverage, The Journal's Monday-through-Friday publication schedule puts it at a competitive disadvantage with the business sections of seven-day-a-week newspapers. 
The newspaper's new publisher, Karen Elliott House, and the new chief operating officer, Richard F. Zannino, are both known for aggressively pursuing avenues that could expand the company's business and journalistic reach.
But starting a Saturday paper could be a complex and costly undertaking. It is unclear how much of an appetite a predominantly business-oriented readership would have for a weekend paper, or what editorial changes should be made to expand the audience. 
(The Financial Times, the leading business newspaper in Europe, publishes a Saturday issue that blends market news with extensive lifestyle and cultural coverage.)
Dow Jones and The Journal also face significant logistical hurdles. While Dow Jones owns printing plants around the country that could be put to work producing a Saturday Journal, getting those copies to readers would be more difficult. A substantial part of the newspaper's daily circulation of 1.8 million is delivered to offices, concentrated in the business districts of major cities; a Saturday paper would have to go to the homes of a more far-flung and suburban audience. 
The news of a possible Saturday paper was reported yesterday by Dow Jones Newswires, which is also owned by Dow Jones & Company.
Leland Westerfield, a publishing analyst with UBS Warburg, said yesterday that the move would be a logical next step for Dow Jones to expand the reach of its flagship paper. The Journal currently has five-day editions in North America, Asia and Europe and provides a preprinted Sunday business insert, The Wall Street Journal Sunday, to 74 newspapers, with a combined circulation of 10.8 million. 
Over the last five years, The Journal has expanded significantly. Weekend Journal has been published on Fridays since 1998, and last spring The Journal was redesigned, adding pastels to the newspaper's front page and a new section, Personal Journal, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
"It's about scale, as are most matters in media," Mr. Westerfield wrote in an e-mail message. "Media channels have proliferated, but you can argue that the ranks of differentiated journalism brands have been thinned in recent years. So publishers with quality journalism and established brand names, like the W.S.J., can do more to slake the thirst of loyal readers."
He added, "Why allow another financial journal or video programmer a seat at the table with your audience?"
To lead the editorial exploration of a Saturday paper, Dow Jones tapped Lawrence Ingrassia, the editor of The Journal's Money & Investing section, over the Christmas holidays, the executives briefed on the undertaking said. Asked about his assignment yesterday, Mr. Ingrassia said, "No comment."
Brigitte Trafford, the company's spokeswoman, also declined to comment. 
At a December meeting with analysts, the chief executive of Dow Jones, Peter R. Kann, avoided a direct response to a question about a Saturday publication. 
Dave Kansas, a senior editor at The Wall Street Journal Online, will temporarily take over Mr. Ingrassia's responsibilities on the Money & Investing section.

HEADLINE: A Family's Fortune, a Legacy of Blood and Tears 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW and LOWELL BERGMAN 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala. 

 BODY:
In their hometown, the McWanes are known for quiet generosity. The family pledged $10 million to the science museum, the McWane Center. They have given millions more to Alabama's major cultural institutions, including the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. College students compete for McWane scholarships. 
 The family's latest philanthropic project is this city's icon, a 56-foot statue of Vulcan, the god of fire and forge. Thanks to a $2 million leadership grant from the McWanes, the statue will soon be restored and returned to its pedestal atop Red Mountain, overlooking downtown as a symbol of the city's working men and women. 
 Yet if the good works are appreciated by Birmingham's civic leaders, the business empire that supports this philanthropy is barely known. The family is so private that not a single sign advertises the McWane corporate headquarters. In a 1997 profile of James Ransom McWane, then chairman of McWane Inc., The Birmingham News wrote that "even well-connected" business leaders had never met the man it described as "a riddle in his hometown." 
"Son," said N. Lee Cooper, past president of the American Bar Association and founding partner of the Birmingham law firm that has long represented the family's corporate interests, "the McWanes haven't talked in a hundred years, and they aren't about to start now."
The untold story of how a reclusive family ascended into the ranks of the nation's wealthiest industrial dynasties is an often-painful one, written in the blood and tears of the very blue-collar workers celebrated by the Vulcan statue. 
As reported yesterday in The New York Times, McWane Inc., one of the world's largest makers of cast-iron water and sewer pipes, is also one of the most dangerous businesses in America. The company has by far the worst safety record in an industry that, for three of the last four years, has had the highest injury rate in the nation. McWane has been cited for more than 400 safety violations since 1995, four times more than its six major competitors combined.
A nine-month examination by The Times, the PBS program "Frontline" and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program "The Fifth Estate" also found that McWane has an extensive record of environmental violations. McWane plants have been found in violation of pollution rules and emission limits at least 450 times since 1995, records show. Environmental regulators have said McWane plants are among the worst polluters in New Jersey, Alabama and Texas.
The examination is based on thousands of company and government records and hundreds of interviews with current and former McWane employees, including plant managers, safety directors and environmental engineers. These employees -- some speaking on the record, others on condition of anonymity -- opened a window into a closely held and expanding corporation that dominates an unglamorous yet essential industry. 
At McWane plants, they said, workers who protest dangerous work conditions are often "bull's-eyed" -- marked for termination. Supervisors routinely run roughshod over safety and environmental laws that interfere with production in the slightest. They dump polluted water under cover of night. They bully injured workers. They intimidate union leaders. 
And everyone, they said, operates under a system of financial and disciplinary incentives that results in lives being put at risk every day. 
"The people, they're nothing," said Robert S. Rester, a former McWane plant manager who spoke at length about his 24 years with the company. "They're just numbers. You move them in and out. I mean, if they don't do the job, you fire them. If they get hurt, complain about safety, you put a bull's-eye on them." 
C. Phillip McWane, the current chairman and chief executive, declined repeated requests for interviews over the last five months. But the company president, G. Ruffner Page, said in written exchanges that McWane was committed to protecting the environment and the welfare of its workers. While acknowledging that "our standards have not always been met," he emphasized that the company has taken action to improve its record. 
Many McWane employees said there had indeed been improvements, particularly in recent months as the company came under new federal scrutiny. Some plants, they added, are better than others. But they strongly disagree that the changes show a fundamental turnabout by a chagrined corporation. To many of them, McWane remains frozen in a long-ago time, a time when industrial barons made great fortunes off molten iron but left behind broken lives and a damaged environment.

The Deep Roots of Iron
Birmingham was built around its foundries, and for all its racial and social upheavals, for all its ambitious embrace of the new economy, this is still a place with an abiding attachment to iron and steel. 
Three major pipe foundries, including McWane, are still based in the city. On the edge of town, the rusting remains of the old Sloss Furnaces have been converted into a national landmark and museum. For more than 80 years, the McWanes have been woven into this legacy. The original family patriarch, J. R. McWane, helped finance and direct the casting of the Vulcan statue. 
"McWane was an old-fashioned Andrew Carnegie-like figure," said Henry McKiven, a historian at the University of Southern Alabama, referring to another reclusive Scotsman who combined generous philanthropy with ruthless foundry management.
Like Carnegie, J. R. McWane believed in strict conformance with a rigid manufacturing process. If that process called for 80 pipes an hour, he expected 80 pipes an hour, and not one pipe less. 
Through four generations, that demand has been the guiding principle of the family business. And it has proven enormously profitable, fueling the company's growth beyond its original foundry, the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company, just northeast of downtown Birmingham. Today, it has plants in 10 states and Canada.
As it expanded, McWane typically sought distressed foundries, often in fading manufacturing towns, then imposed cost cuts, layoffs and what Mr. Page referred to as "disciplined management practices." Not one of those new plants was given the McWane name, a tradition that has helped keep the family and its business practices out of the public eye. 
Yet McWane products are threaded deep into the infrastructure of American life. McWane pipes can be found in Las Vegas casinos, Indiana hospitals and at Ford Field, the new stadium of the Detroit Lions. 
The company's growth has been guided by some of the most prominent figures in Alabama's business establishment. 
John J. McMahon Jr., now chairman of the executive committee and company president from 1980 to 1998, is president pro tempore of the trustees of the University of Alabama. Another member of the McWane board, Fournier Gale III, was special counsel to Alabama's former governor, Donald Siegelman, and general counsel to the Business Council of Alabama, the state's most powerful business lobby. 
Today, McWane Inc. regularly makes Fortune magazine's list of the 500 largest private companies. According to one knowledgeable person, the company's annual revenues approach $2 billion, an estimate that does not include the family's banking and real estate interests. 
In defending McWane, Mr. Page said the company had worked to preserve manufacturing jobs in an industry threatened by what he characterized as unfair competition. Foreign manufacturers in China and Latin America, he said, "have little or no regard for the safety of their workers or concern about polluting the environment."
McWane itself, however, has been the subject of repeated investigations into bid rigging and other forms of anticompetitive behavior, government records show. In 1995 a McWane subsidiary pleaded guilty to conspiring to corner a major part of the Canadian pipe market and paid a then-record fine of $2.5 million (Canadian).
Canadian court documents, recently unsealed at the request of the The Times and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, allege that Mr. McMahon, then president of McWane, orchestrated the conspiracy in a series of clandestine meetings in Birmingham. In the meetings, held at a barbecue joint and in a supermarket parking lot, Mr. McMahon pressed executives from another Birmingham foundry, U.S. Pipe, to pull out of the Canadian market or face a price war, documents show.
Mr. McMahon declined to discuss the case, but said the court records "only tell one side of the story." 
The company has pleaded guilty to two other crimes, a state environmental felony in 1997 in New York and a federal misdemeanor in 2002 for violating safety laws in Texas. 
But in Birmingham, few people know of this record. If the McWanes are known at all, it is chiefly for their philanthropy and their intense privacy. "They don't like the limelight, and they don't particularly want credit for what they've done," Tony Zodrow, president and chief executive of the McWane Center, said.
Not long ago, Birmingham's civic elite turned out for a reception celebrating the restoration of the Vulcan statue. Some guests could not identify a photograph of C. Phillip McWane, but that did not dampen their praise of the McWanes. 
"They have done wonderful things for the city," one guest, Mrs. C. H. H. Emory, said. "They are a family which has returned a thousandfold everything they've ever gained."

The Discipline of Production
Everything about Robert Rester -- his neck, his chest, his forearms -- is linebacker thick. He is 6 foot 1 and 246 pounds. His face is red and beefy, with a goatee the color of rust. His eyes are blue and direct. On his left shoulder is a tattoo of a bald eagle against an American flag and the words, "Don't expletive with this."
Mr. Rester was part of the small fraternity of hard-nosed men who run McWane foundries. He was plant manager at two of them, most recently the flagship foundry in Birmingham. 
Mr. Rester, who is 44, grew up expecting life to be one long slog, and he took quiet satisfaction from being able to do a hard job in a hard place. "I was raised in McWane pipe shops," he said. When his first mentor died in an explosion, he didn't flinch. Over 24 years, he kept climbing through the ranks, McWane style, starting as a welder, working 16-hour days, skipping vacations, shrugging off injury and illness, making up to $125,000 a year by being the toughest, meanest McWane manager he could be. 
Gradually, he said, he became numb to the constant body count -- crushed hands and feet, disfiguring lacerations, burns from molten iron, amputations. His sole focus, he said, was finding a fresh body to keep production rolling. Who got hurt? Why did the injury happen? Could it have been prevented? Those questions hardly crossed his mind. "I was like a robot," he said. What mattered -- all that mattered -- was getting the machines moving again, he said. 
Mr. Rester and other managers linked this mindset to an updated version of the patriarch's dictum: time equals pipe, and pipe equals money. 
For a McWane manager, they said, taking time for a safety or environmental problem holds few attractions. It means slowing production to fix equipment. It means more safety training, less time to make pipe. Indeed, police records show that at one McWane plant in Alabama, supervisors refused to wait a few hours for federal safety inspectors to arrive before restarting a conveyor belt that had crushed a man to death. 
The formula is reinforced at every level of production. Line workers who fail to make daily quotas get "D.A.'s" -- disciplinary actions. Those with several D.A.'s are said to be on "death row." For plant managers like Mr. Rester -- essentially the chief operating officer -- annual bonuses depend on how their production compares with production at other McWane plants. And for general managers, the pursuit of more tons per hour can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit sharing. 
Mr. Rester was one of dozens of McWane supervisors who described a system of unstinting discipline used not just to squeeze out productivity gains, but to suppress union unrest and discourage injury claims.
Supervisors were urged to discipline injured workers, company documents and interviews show. The company says the purpose is to teach safety. But Mr. Rester said the true intent was to punish workers for reporting injuries while shifting blame from the company. 
"If he steps in a hole, you know, it's because he wasn't watching where he was going, not because there was a hole there that should've had a cover on it," Mr. Rester said. 
Internal McWane records show that top executives tracked the number of injured workers who received disciplinary actions at each plant. Workers who resisted, who cited government regulations or sought independent medical advice, became targets for termination, Mr. Rester said. "We'd say or do whatever we had to," he said. This included putting up safety signs after the fact to make it appear as if the worker had ignored posted policies, he said. It included altering safety records and doctoring machinery to cover up a hazard. 
"After a while," he said, "you realize what you have to do to save your job." It became automatic, he said, like a reflex.

The Custodians of Safety
Union Foundry, one of two McWane plants in Anniston, Ala., was a dangerous place to work. In 1995, it had about 350 employees and recorded more than 250 injuries, internal company records show.
That year, McWane sent in a new safety director, Clyde E. Dorn. He was hardly an ideal candidate for the job. He had never worked in a foundry, let alone as a safety director. He had just obtained a bachelor of science degree in occupational safety and health. By his own admission, he was a 44-year-old alcoholic with an arrest record and substantial debts from unpaid child support. He held the job until 2001, when he was fired after being caught trying to buy Oxycontin in a police sting operation; he recently began a prison sentence. 
Even apart from his lack of experience, Mr. Dorn said, it was virtually impossible to be effective. He had no budget, no assistants and little authority. He lacked even the authority to shut down a production line if he spotted a safety hazard, he said. 
There was one exception, he said: "If someone was caught in the machine."
Mr. Dorn said he managed to make simple and inexpensive safety fixes, as long as they did not affect production. But requests for more safety equipment and an assistant were ignored, he said. Larger safety issues -- like too few workers working too many hours -- were off limits, he said.
Federal safety rules, for example, limit the weight workers may lift. At Union Foundry, workers were routinely ordered to lift fittings that exceeded these limits, Mr. Dorn said, and many suffered strains and back injuries as a result. "There was nothing that I could do," he said. "I mean management knew about it. You'd go to them and you'd talk to them and they would say, 'We'll look at it.' " Asked why he didn't demand action, he replied, "They made it perfectly clear that I wasn't guaranteed a job if I ticked them off." 
Indeed, when the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated a worker's death at Union Foundry in 2000, inspectors were told that company policy "was not to correct anything until OSHA found it," agency records state.
In interviews, other current and former safety directors complained of having little authority or help. And internal company documents show that McWane executives recognized that safety directors were overburdened. But in recent months, some safety directors said executives had given them more influence. 
Mr. Dorn was one of 38 full-time "safety and environmental professionals" whom McWane says it employs in its plants. Some of them came with significant credentials. But several, like Mr. Dorn, possessed few qualifications and seemed to have only a vague understanding of their duties. 
At the plant in Elmira, N.Y., an accountant whose job was being cut was made safety director. The McWane plant in Birmingham hired a safety director from a temporary employment service that specialized in environmental testing. A few years before, he had been placed on probation for drunken driving. Asked in a sworn deposition to describe his duties, he replied, "There is nothing written as to what my duties are."
In another deposition, a safety manager at the Tyler plant was asked: "So, you're the safety director, but you don't know if the superintendents are supposed to report safety violations to you. Is that correct?"
"Yes," he replied. 
Most McWane safety directors spend only part of their time dealing with safety. The rest is devoted to activities designed to reduce workers compensation costs. Managers have told OSHA investigators that McWane expects them "to do whatever it takes to bring and keep these costs down."
This included conducting time-consuming investigations to catch fraudulent injury claims -- which is what Mr. Dorn asserts he was doing when he was arrested for trying to buy Oxycontin from an employee out on workers compensation. It also included placing injured workers under surveillance and challenging doctors on expensive treatment plans. Mr. Dorn, a man with no medical background, said he was under constant pressure to manipulate treatment decisions.
Although McWane's internal safety rankings gave Union Foundry high marks under Mr. Dorn, two Union Foundry workers were killed and hundreds were injured during his tenure, and OSHA repeatedly found perilously unsafe working conditions.
A year after he was hired, for example, OSHA inspectors spent six days at the plant and chronicled a list of serious safety violations: exposed wiring, leaking gas lines, inadequate respirators, nonexistent safety training, missing records, explosion hazards, burn hazards, unguarded conveyor belts, and employees exposed to lead, cadmium, arsenic and beryllium without any protective equipment. 
During the inspection, records show, Mr. Dorn was asked if employees ever worked underneath or near a certain industrial elevator. He assured the inspector that no one did, OSHA records state. Seven months later, a worker, Johnny Flint Brewster Jr. was crushed to death under the same elevator. He had been cleaning sand from the shaft and did not see it descend. OSHA inspectors said the shaft was inadequately guarded, records show. 
In his written response, Mr. Page did not address Mr. Dorn's work at Union Foundry. But he noted that Mr. Dorn has been replaced by a man with foundry experience and a master's degree in health and safety who oversees a staff of three.

The Environmental Issues
At many McWane plants, government records and interviews with employees describe persistent defiance of laws protecting workers and surrounding communities from toxic pollution. In a corporate culture where production is paramount, McWane plants have been sanctioned repeatedly for failing to stop production to repair broken or ineffective pollution controls. Several environmental managers described production equipment being tampered with so it would not shut down automatically when pollution controls failed. They told of senior company executives ordering them to ignore requirements for pollution permits. 
"I was asked to do things I didn't want to do," said one manager responsible for environmental safeguards at a plant in Canada. Some former managers said they quit because they feared they were being forced to break the law. "It wasn't a normal work environment," one said. 
McWane has 10 major United States foundries. A few have relatively minor records of environmental problems, officials said. The Ohio plant, for example, has earned praise from state regulators. 
But five plants -- in Alabama, Utah, Texas and New Jersey -- have been designated "high priority" violators by the Environmental Protection Agency. A sixth, in New York, has been convicted of a felony, illegal possessing hazardous waste. 
Mr. Page said that McWane plants "have overwhelmingly abided" by pollution laws. He also cited some $31 million in recent pollution control projects as evidence of the company's commitment to a clean environment. "On occasion, all companies of any size receive citations," he wrote. 
Union Foundry, which has received some of the highest environmental fines ever levied by Alabama, has been cited for more than 50 violations, records show. 
"They have discharged air pollution -- lead and arsenic and copper and thallium off into the air," said Byron Bart Slawson, a lawyer for the Alabama Environmental Council, who filed suit against the plant. "They've been spreading it across this community for years." 
At Union Foundry, OSHA testers found that at least seven workers had been exposed to exceptionally high levels of silica in 1996. Exposure to silica can cause silicosis, a lung disease that can lead to a slow death. OSHA inspectors said plant managers, including Mr. Dorn, had failed to ensure that respirators were used, even though conditions "were obviously bad." 
Inside McWane plants, workers have repeatedly complained of blurred vision, severe headaches, respiratory problems and other ailments after being exposed, often without training or protection, to chemicals and agents used to make pipes, government records and other documents show. 
In 1998, Shane Shaw, a 19-year-old employee at a McWane plant in Provo, Utah, was admitted to an emergency room. His urine was black as coffee. His kidneys were failing. Other organs were beginning to shut down. He was close to death, medical records show. 
In time, his doctors diagnosed severe arsenic poisoning -- the result, they concluded, of chipping arsenic-laced residue from casting machinery without a respirator. In an interview, Mr. Shaw said that he was not required to wear a respirator, nor was he warned of the dangers of arsenic. He has recovered and left McWane, but his doctors say he faces an increased risk of cancer. 
Six months before Mr. Shaw became ill, a state OSHA inspector visited the plant. "The respirator program was totally ineffective," the official wrote. 
At Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe, the McWane plant in Phillipsburg, N.J., residents have complained about pollution for decades. Local newspapers reported that crossing guards near the plant once had to wear gas masks. Since 1995, the plant has been found in violation of state and local environmental rules and emission limits more than 150 times. It has paid or faces more than $3 million in fines. Even so, regulators still consider it one of the state's worst polluters. 
"One looks in vain for any evidence of corporate stewardship with respect to environmental issues," Bradley M. Campbell, the state's environmental commissioner, said. McWane's conduct, he said, amounts to a pattern of "resistance, recalcitrance and denial, if not outright lawlessness." 
On a Sunday morning in December 1999, Brian and Kathy Fleming awoke in their home on the banks of the Delaware River and noticed oil on the water. Authorities traced the 8.5-mile-long slick to a storm water pipe near Atlantic States. At the plant a sump pump was draining a pit filled with the same kind of oily substance into storm drains. 
State and federal investigators raided the plant but learned little about who had authorized the pumping. The case was dropped after McWane contributed $50,000 to an environmental group. But two former plant employees say the investigators failed to detect a string of illegal discharges that dwarfed the December spill. 
The men, Robert Bobinis, a maintenance supervisor, and Brad Schultz, a member of his crew, said in separate interviews that each week, during the midnight shift, they were ordered to pump thousands of gallons of water fouled with industrial contaminants into drains feeding the Delaware. 
The water filled huge basement vaults that had to be pumped dry so production could continue, both men said. "They didn't want to shut down," said Mr. Bobinis, who filed a whistleblower lawsuit against Atlantic States; it was settled, he said, for a sum he declined to disclose. 
Mr. Page called the men's accusations unsubstantiated. 
The same thing, however, happened at McWane Cast Iron Pipe in Birmingham, according to several employees and state environmental records. Workers waited for night or heavy rainstorms before flushing thousands of gallons of polluted water through storm drains and into local rivers and creeks. Mr. Rester, the former plant manager, said the illegal dumping was "standard procedure," done with the full knowledge of senior McWane executives, including an executive vice president. 
"All he would ever say is, 'Whatever we had to do to run 'em we had to do it,' " Mr. Rester recalled. "You know, 'Get rid of the water. We got to run.' "

The Safety Statistics
At Union Foundry, there is a new sign at the front gate: "Safety Starts With Attitude." In the last year, McWane has embarked on a high-profile safety campaign. 
In his written responses, Mr. Page, the company president, said spending on safety-related capital projects had "increased significantly over the past five years." 
The commitment, he said, has paid off. Injury rates at McWane's United States plants, he said, have steadily declined since 1995 and compare favorably with the rest of the cast-iron foundry industry. 
"It would be foolish not to protect our most valuable and essential assets -- our people," Mr. Page wrote. 
There is no independent way to confirm the company's assertions about injury rates; OSHA refused to release its own calculations, saying they are not public. 
But internal McWane documents obtained by The Times -- reports from plants to corporate headquarters -- show that while some foundries have reported declines in injuries, others have reported sharp increases. 
At one major McWane subsidiary, Ransom Industries, which includes eight foundries in the United States and Canada, injuries have surged by virtually every internal McWane measure. 
From 1999 to 2001, for example, the number of lost workdays caused by injuries more than tripled. Indeed, in 2000, the last year for which direct comparisons are available, Ransom's rate of injuries that resulted in lost workdays was nearly triple the industry average. 
McWane's fatality rate since 1995 -- though lower than for industries like timber and fishing -- is about six times the rate for primary metal manufacturers, the category that includes cast-iron foundries. 
At the same time, OSHA records show that at several McWane plants, inspectors have found the company's injury reports to be suspect. 
For example, at the plant in New York in 1997, many workers told inspectors about injuries not listed in the plant's reports to OSHA. The inspectors determined that the omissions were deliberate; in 108 instances, they said, the plant had failed to report an injury or underreported the number of workdays an employee missed. 
When OSHA factored in the missing injuries, the rate of serious injuries more than doubled, placing the plant well above the industry average. 
Mr. Page blamed the problem on "a simple breakdown in communication." 
Several current and former managers at other plants, though, said they had techniques to manipulate injury totals. 
"Once you have numbers, you have fines, you have attention and you have inspections," a former senior safety manager said. 
He described a simple way of disguising the severity of injuries from OSHA: "I'd go to the hospital and get guys out of bed or a wheelchair to avoid a lost-time incident." Even if the worker sat in an office all day, he explained, McWane could still claim that his injury had not required him to miss work. 
The Times asked J. Paul Leigh, a health economics expert at the University of California at Davis and an author of "Costs of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses," to examine the internal injury reports as well as Mr. Page's analysis of injury rates. 
Professor Leigh said he was "suspicious" that some plants reported so few minor injuries -- a possible indication, he said, that employees are reluctant to report less severe injuries for fear of disciplinary action. 
Indeed, in interviews at several plants, workers said that fear of punishment, and sometimes firing, had taught them to keep injuries -- even deeply painful ones -- secret whenever they could. 
Mr. Page said that "accident incident rates are not the best way to measure the safety environment in a company." 
He also disputed the significance of McWane's 404 OSHA violations since 1995. McWane paid fines to settle many of those citations, but without acknowledging any fault. 
"The vast bulk of what you present constitutes claims and assertions that have never been upheld or proven to be true," he wrote. 

The Cast of Another Die
"I just knew for a long time that sooner or later, somebody's going to have to stop it, somebody's going to have to say something, and I was always hoping it would be somebody besides me."
Finally, though, Robert Rester decided that he needed to speak out about McWane. 
Part of it was bitterness. When first contacted in June, he had just taken sick leave for a heart problem. At first reluctant to speak, he said he had begun to suspect that "what I've watched them do for 25 years to other people" was being done to him. In September, while still on leave, the company fired him, saying he had failed to get treatment for "alcohol abuse." He denies any alcohol problem; since then, records show, McWane tried to hire him back. 
But Mr. Rester says he is also motivated by guilt, by a sense that he gave himself to the wrong cause. "I've done so much that's not right for that company," he said. 
The misgivings began, he said, when he was sent to manage a new plant in Hamilton, Ontario. "We were going to go up there and show them how to make pipe" McWane-style, he recalled. But the Canadians bluntly told him they would shut the place down if he treated them the way McWane treated its workers in the United States. 
"I had to find a way to get people to work without being, well, a big white bwana," Mr. Rester said. He learned that he could get more from his workers if they "don't mind coming through the gate."
Years later, back in Birmingham as plant manager at McWane Cast Iron Pipe, he said he tried to import some Canadian lessons. He set about spending money to clean the plant up and change the tone. The makeover died with the arrival of a new general manager, he said. Mr. Rester protested and was demoted, shipped off to Union Foundry as a maintenance supervisor. 
Telling his story recently, Mr. Rester began musing about another foundry in Birmingham. It is the American Cast Iron Pipe Company, known as Acipco, and he knows it is not in his future. "The only time you can get a job at Acipco," he said, "is if somebody retires or dies." 
Acipco, as workers and managers there describe it, is a place where safety and a clean environment are not captive to the demands of production. Workers take yoga classes in a modern health club with the latest in weight-training equipment and a spring-loaded floor for aerobics. They get cash bonuses if they keep their cholesterol down. The company has even spent millions of dollars to install special air-conditioned booths in the hottest parts of the plant. 
"We had people say, 'You're crazy, that won't work. Why are you doing that?' " the company's president and chief executive, Van L. Richey, said. But they did it, he said, and productivity increased. 
Just this week, Acipco was ranked sixth in Fortune magazine's list of the 100 best employers in America. Acipco, in short, sounds almost like a caricature of blue-collar paradise. But it also strongly suggests that the McWane way is not the only way to survive, and succeed, in the dangerous and increasingly competitive business of making cast-iron pipe. 
Mr. Richey takes pains to point out that the company is not a utopia. Acipco has paid millions of dollars to settle racial discrimination complaints and, with the rest of the industry oligopoly, has faced periodic bid-rigging investigations, although it has never been charged with any crime. 
Still, several statistical measures show how different Acipco is from McWane. 
At some McWane plants, turnover rates approach 100 percent a year. Acipco -- with a work force of about 3,000, three-fifths the size of McWane -- has annual turnover of less than half a percent; 10,000 people recently applied for 100 openings. McWane has also been cited for 40 times more federal safety violations since 1995, OSHA records show. 
Acipco was founded in 1905 by John J. Eagan, a devoutly Christian industrialist from Atlanta who had resolved to demonstrate that a factory could be run on the basis of the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. 
Mr. Eagan believed that if workers felt they had a genuine stake they would work harder and smarter and produce more. To carry out his plan, he decided to institute profit sharing for all employees. Upon his death, he declared, Acipco's workers would inherit the company. 
Many of his fellow industrialists ridiculed the plans as do-gooder nonsense, doomed to failure. Historians say the doubters included Acipco's own president, J. R. McWane. 
Mr. McWane had spent much of his early career at Acipco. But days before the profit-sharing plan was made public, he severed all financial ties with Acipco and set up his own pipe shop across town, the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company. 
The two companies -- and their dueling visions of capitalism -- have been in competition ever since.

HEADLINE: Rowland Opens His Third Term Focusing on Cutbacks 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Rather than deliver the traditional summary outlook for the state in the year ahead, Gov. John G. Rowland opened Connecticut's new legislative session today with a short, pointed speech that focused almost solely on asking state employees and legislators to make sacrifices.
 In his State of the State address, Mr. Rowland recounted the state's current fiscal troubles and offered a preview of even tougher times to come, telling legislators he would propose a "leaner, more focused government" in his budget message in February. 
 "The government has outgrown the taxpayers' ability to pay for it, and I will take the necessary action to cut it down to size," he said.
As Mr. Rowland enters his third term, Connecticut faces a $650 million deficit this year and a shortfall estimated at $2 billion the next fiscal year, its worst financial situation in a decade. The governor noted that when he took office eight years ago, the state was enjoying a "remarkable time of prosperity, but in the last two the impact of the terrorist attacks and the downturn in the economy and the prospect of war have markedly changed the state and the nation."
More than half Mr. Rowland's speech was devoted to an appeal for concessions from unions. He said 52,000 state employees' wages and benefits account for a third of the state's $13.2 billion budget. About 2,000 state workers face layoffs on Jan. 17; roughly 800 more have already lost their jobs, and Mr. Rowland has threatened more layoffs if the unions offer no concessions.
The governor announced the layoffs last month after negotiators for the state employees' unions refused to agree to $450 million in givebacks. Talks have been stalled, but the governor has said he will rescind the layoffs if he gets his way.
Earlier today, before the governor delivered a separate inaugural address in the Legislative Office Building, about 2,000 people rallied outside the Capitol. They included mayors protesting proposed cuts in funds to cities and towns, and state employees concerned about job losses.
In his State of the State address, Mr. Rowland said state employees had been misled by union negotiators who had misconstrued his request for concessions. The proposal, he said, asks state employees to take a smaller raise this year than their contract provides and a wage freeze next year. Mr. Rowland said he was also seeking "a reasonable increase in health care premium payments and an increase in their prescription drug co-payments."
"I ask union leaders for only one thing: stop misleading your members and allow them to vote on my proposal," he said.
Ten times during a speech that lasted a mere 15 minutes, Mr. Rowland was interrupted by applause, but only from his fellow Republicans, a gesture that spoke volumes about how his plans are viewed by the Democrats, who control both chambers of the General Assembly.
Although they applauded when the governor entered the Hall of the House and when he ended his speech, the Democrats were muted in their assessment. "If he needed to give a speech to state employees, he didn't need to come to the legislature to do it," said Kevin J. Sullivan, the president pro tempore of the Senate, adding that Mr. Rowland's attacks on union negotiators were "mean spirited."
The Democratic leadership is drafting a budget proposal that is expected before Jan. 17, when most of the layoffs take effect. A group of 37 Democrats announced a plan earlier this week to reduce the budget shortfall by taxing residents with annual incomes of $200,000 or more. An earlier plan suggested by Democratic leaders, and reluctantly accepted by the governor, called for a tax on those who make more than $1 million a year. Mr. Rowland said he would veto any plan to increase taxes on incomes over $200,000.
The Democratic leadership has not ruled out such an increase, though. Moira K. Lyons, who began a third term today as speaker of the House, said such an increase "has always been under consideration."

HEADLINE: Calling North Korea 

 BODY:
The Bush administration belatedly but smartly reversed direction on North Korea this week by offering to begin direct talks with Pyongyang about its nuclear weapons programs. A quick and verifiable end to the North's nuclear ambitions should be the core aim of any discussions. 
It was never realistic to treat this objective of American diplomacy as a condition for beginning talks. 
 If the North proves cooperative on the nuclear question, Washington can agree to broadened talks on issues like food and fuel aid, a framework for peaceful relations and eventual diplomatic recognition. North Korea remains an abhorrent police state. Offering greater engagement in return for verifiable arms control holds the best hope for nudging it toward a less totalitarian future and reducing the threat it poses to other countries. 
 Washington's revised approach was crafted in consultation with two vital allies, South Korea and Japan, and shows an encouraging willingness to work with other nations. Realistically, America has little choice but to explore every diplomatic option. Military confrontation with Pyongyang would involve terrible risks to South Korea and Japan and the 100,000 American troops in East Asia. 
The United States' wise preference for a diplomatic dialogue should not weaken its insistence on a complete and verifiable abandonment of all North Korean nuclear weapons projects. Unless this is achieved, Pyongyang could have a half-dozen nuclear bombs by summer and a steadily increasing arsenal thereafter, enough to sell one or two for cash to would-be nuclear powers like Iraq. 
North Korea wants a nonaggression pact with Washington and aid to prop up its collapsing economy. Americans should be willing to help the North's impoverished people, provided that aid doesn't free resources for weapons development.

HEADLINE: Bush and the Economy: The Debate Heats Up 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Bush Unveils Plan to Cut Tax Rates and Spur Economy" (front page, Jan. 8): 
 If the intent of abolishing taxes on dividends is to improve the economy by "putting more money into the hands of the taxpayers," then it will certainly do the latter but perhaps not the former. 
As one of those elderly dividend taxpayers, I know that abolishing the dividend tax will lower my taxes, but not nearly as much as wealthier taxpayers'.
But neither my husband nor I will be spending more money. We do not need any more "stuff"; we have no intention of going out and spending money for the sake of spending money. Neither will the "generosity" of the Republican-dominated Congress cause us to vote Republican. 
White House spinmeisters can spin this any way they want, but this tax break is for the wealthier American taxpayers. It will not create jobs for the working class.

HEADLINE: PATAKI OPPOSING INCREASE IN TAXES TO CLOSE DEFICITS 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Saying the state must continue to foster economic growth and look past the current fiscal crisis, Gov. George E. Pataki said today that he opposed raising taxes or postponing planned tax cuts. He also suggested that deep reductions in core state services would be needed to close an enormous state budget gap.
 Even as he acknowledged a deficit of $2 billion this year and "several times larger" in the fiscal year that begins on April 1, Mr. Pataki said the state must not settle for politically expedient solutions but aim for the larger goals of a growing state economy and a relentless push to create jobs, particularly in technology. 
 "We face a fiscal crisis today of a magnitude that we have not faced in our lifetime," Mr. Pataki, a Republican, said in his annual address to the State Legislature. "How we meet this challenge will be crucial in shaping the legacy we leave our children and grandchildren. It will require tough decisions, but we have made them before and they have worked." 
Aides and allies to the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, immediately replied that the governor's speech, which lasted 55 minutes, was remarkable not only for what it said, but for what it left out. Notable among the omissions, they said, were what Mr. Pataki intends to cut in the state budget and how he stands on other issues pending before the Legislature, including the renewal of rent control laws and aid to New York City.
Certain omissions, like the governor's intentions for state spending on education, also gnawed at Republicans who control the State Senate, though the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, endorsed the speech.
Many saw the address as a tacking back to mainstream Republicanism for the three-term governor, who co-opted some Democratic principles to win a landslide election last year.
As in any year in the state capital, Mr. Pataki's political priorities will come alive in the lines of his proposed state budget, projected to be $89.6 billion. It will be closely scrutinized, many politicians and budget analysts said, when Mr. Pataki issues it at month's end, setting the stage for what promises to be a particularly acrimonious round of political fighting and posturing that could last to summer or beyond.
In addressing the shortfall, Mr. Pataki said the coming budget would amount to less than the current one. "With the exception of public security," he said, "no segment of the budget will be exempt."
That one sentence seemed to open the door to deep spending cuts, even in areas like education and health care. The governor had promoted programs in those areas during his campaign just two months ago.
Still, Mr. Pataki did his best in his speech to portray the sunniest parts of his time in office. As he did last year, he basked in the patriotic spirit in New York that lingers from Sept. 11, 2001. He highlighted the achievements of his past eight years, saying they provided a road map for success. He invoked a need to leave the state financially pristine for "our children and grandchildren."
Those children, he said, should pay lower taxes than residents do today, and he vowed to help their parents and grandparents by continuing scheduled tax cuts and maintaining tax-subsidy programs like the STAR program, which pays local school district taxes for older homeowners.
"While other states raise taxes, let us out-compete any state and create new jobs by maintaining New York's eight-year record as the tax-cutting capital of America," he said to a round of applause in the packed Assembly chamber where his wife, Libby, and his mother, Margaret, sat near Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and others.
The governor urged lawmakers to rise above partisanship to get the job done and, to make his point, singled out former Gov. Hugh L. Carey, and Mr. Carey's friend turned opponent, former Lt. Gov. Mary Anne Krupsak, for praise.
Then he made a joke, saying, "Now, if only Betsy were here," a reference to Betsy McCaughey Ross, his former lieutenant governor, with whom he had a falling out. Laughter filled the chamber.
But the cheer soon subsided. During many moments in the governor's address, the Democrats in the chamber sat silently, with arms folded in laps, as Republicans clapped, hooted, or occasionally stood.
Just five minutes after the speech ended, the party lines were drawn, and the Capitol hallways had a carnival flavor as various constituencies promoted their positions. Many Democrats said the governor seemed to assign his fewest words to the present and his most to the past and future. It was mostly platitudes, they contended, and not substance.
"In these times of hardship, inspirational words are nice, but action is eloquence," Mr. Silver said. Then he laced into the governor's style, saying, "We need real leadership now."
Many opponents bristled when Mr. Pataki seemed to place full blame for the budget mess on the Sept. 11 terrorist attack , not mentioning that he and the Legislature had allowed state spending to grow at three times the rate of inflation in the four previous budgets. Alan G. Hevesi, the new state comptroller, a Democrat, called the governor's analysis simplistic.
Mr. Pataki also sprinkled several announcements into the address. He announced that Advanced Micro Devices, one of the largest chip manufacturing companies in the world, was starting a venture with I.B.M. in the Hudson Valley.
He announced the appointment of Jim Natoli, a former director of state operations, as director of disaster preparedness and response. He said the state was beginning an alliance with Quebec to try to entice a future Winter Olympics to the New York-Canadian border.
He also spoke of many efforts to benefit the upstate region, including a new state park that would turn Gallagher Beach into a "great new recreational facility" for Buffalo and western New York.
He outlined some well-established goals, too, that would help secure Mr. Pataki's legacy if the Legislature adopts them. On the environment, Mr. Pataki called for adopting the carbon dioxide emission standards for motor vehicles that were recently proposed by California, and said that within 10 years at least a quarter of all the electricity bought in New York would come from renewable energy resources like solar or wind power. He called again for reducing the state's mandatory sentences for drug crimes, and pledged support for campaign finance reform.
On the budget front, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Pataki can impose his fiscally conservative agenda on the Legislature. The Assembly speaker has already declared that cuts to education and health care spending are out of the question.
As for the Republican house, Mr. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, endorsed the governor's strong stand against taxes, and said he might even advocate more tax cuts.
Other Republicans said attempts to cut education aid to localities and health care would be unpalatable.
Mr. Pataki made a glancing reference to Medicaid, which pays for health care for the poor, saying he would continue to try to reduce the cost of the program. Medicaid is the largest part of the state budget, accounting for more than $30 billion. 
The governor also said that he would aim to privatize certain state assets, and that he would borrow $4 billion backed by the annual payment the state receives from the tobacco companies as part of a court settlement. He said he would try to avoid layoffs, but would work with labor unions to further reduce the size of the state work force.
Along with being silent on renewal of the city's rent laws, which ground the legislative process to a halt in 1997, when they were last revamped, he said nothing about tuition increases at city and state universities, though the board of trustees is scheduled to consider such increases on Friday. He did not mention a tax on commuters to New York City.
Mayor Bloomberg left Albany empty-handed. Nonetheless, he praised the speech. "I don't think the governor has any objection to reforming the tax structure," he said, referring to the commuter tax, and he expressed confidence that Mr. Pataki would come through for the fiscally troubled city in the final budget.
Mr. Hevesi, the comptroller, was more critical. "He left us, if he sticks to this, with huge cuts in programs and/or borrowing," he said. "What this speech doesn't do is deal with the main issue, and that is the $11 billion deficit."

HEADLINE: Europe Scolds 3 Nations About Budgets 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER with PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
The European Union issued a terse report card to three of its biggest members today, telling Germany, France, and Italy to do a better job of reining in their swelling budget deficits.
 It reserved its toughest words for Germany, which in 2002 breached the ceiling on deficits set by the treaty that created the euro currency. Germany is in danger of doing so again this year as its economy teeters on the edge of another recession. 
 "Sound public finances are part of the solution to low growth in Europe, not part of the problem," Pedro Solbes, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said at a news conference in Brussels. 
Mr. Solbes said that the European Commission, the union's executive body, would recommend that Germany be given four months to come up with steps to bring its 2003 deficit below 3 percent of its gross domestic product, the limit set in the treaty. Otherwise it would face sanctions, including heavy fines.
Europe's fiscal austerity stands in sharp contrast to the United States, where the Bush administration has put forward a $674 billion economic plan built on sweeping tax cuts that are likely to produce widening budget deficits.
Mr. Solbes spoke at some length about the differences between Europe and the United States -- and why President Bush's prescription for economic revival would not necessarily work here. 
"They have a surplus, we don't," he summarized.
Mr. Solbes estimated that the White House's proposal would swing the United States budget from a surplus of 1.5 percent of gross domestic product to a deficit of 3 percent to 3.5 percent. Similar actions taken in Europe, he said, would swell the deficits of the big member states, up to 5 percent.
Arithmetic aside, Mr. Solbes said, Mr. Bush has more flexibility because he does not have to take account of the views of 11 other countries, as those who share the euro currency must. 
"He doesn't have to respect the stability pact," Mr. Solbes said, referring to the treaty that caps the size of deficits and requires member nations to balance their budgets by 2006 -- provisions originally written largely at Germany's behest.
The German government reiterated today that it was on track to cut its deficit and to balance the budget. It predicted that its economy would show growth of 1.5 percent this year, after eking out 0.2 percent growth in 2002.
Even that modest projection is being met with skepticism by economists, who are competing with each other to cut their forecasts for Germany, Europe's biggest and most troubled economy.
"We have a substantial drain from increased taxes and social security payments," said Martin W. Hufner, the chief economist at Hypovereinsbank in Munich. "You can't expect a recovery in that environment.'
Slow growth complicates Germany's task because it translates into lower corporate and individual tax revenues. The German government has also pledged to cut spending, but it has little scope to do so without touching the country's generous, deeply rooted and politically sacrosanct welfare and unemployment benefits.
Nor has Germany been helped by the euro nations' uniform monetary policy. Last month, the European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, to 2.75 percent. But the rate, which is intended to benefit the interest of the 12 euro nations as a whole, is arguably still too high for Germany.
Some economists pointed out that stimulus policies have their limits. Germany swung from a small budget surplus in 2000 to a deficit of 3.8 percent last year, through tax cuts and increased public spending, but its economy remained stuck in the mud. The latest retail sales figures showed the biggest monthly decline of the year in November, as Germans steered clear of cars, clothing, and household goods.
"We've seen that in Japan -- you can stimulate the economy for 10 years without improving the situation," said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels.
Germany is not alone under a harsh microscope. Mr. Solbes said that France also risked breaching the deficit ceiling this year, in part because it plans to make deep tax cuts. Italy's deficit is also edging into the danger zone, according to the commission.
Mr. Solbes said he was skeptical about the Italian government's growth projections, and asked for further information by March. "We don't know how they arrived at those figures," he said.
The European stability agreement has come under fire in recent months from economists and politicians, who say that it puts countries into a fiscal straitjacket. The president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, even derided it as "stupid." Today, though, officials in Germany, France, and Italy responded meekly to the lecture from Brussels, promising to put their houses in order.

HEADLINE: Jobless, and Stunned 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Left behind by the great Republican raid on the national Treasury are folks like Karelia Escobar and Joe Bergmann, middle-aged New Yorkers who have worked most of their lives but now find themselves traveling the anxious paths of the long-term unemployed.
 With bills mounting and each day bringing a heightened sense of dread, they could use a little help. But the jobless are at the bottom of the economic heap, and the Bush administration's help seems always to go to the top. 
 Ms. Escobar is 43 and single, and lives in a small apartment in Queens. She has worked for a number of airlines over the past several years, most recently as a ticket agent for T.W.A. That job vanished with the World Trade Center. 
"We were laid off Oct. 14, 2001," she said. "I haven't been able to find work since then. I've applied everywhere. I've gone back to school to improve my computer skills. I've learned another language. I feel very bad because I want to work so I can pay my bills. I've always worked. But now I can't find a job."
That plaintive comment is echoing from coast to coast. Unemployment is rising. And as the millions of jobless Americans (including many in the middle class) exhaust their benefits and run through their savings, they are finding themselves face to face with the horror of destitution.
In his speech in Chicago on Tuesday President Bush said, "I worry about people who are out of work. They need our help." But the hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of "help" that he proposed, mostly in the form of tax cuts, would go overwhelmingly to the princes of the new American plutocracy, not to the likes of Karelia Escobar.
Or Joe Bergmann. Mr. Bergmann, who lives in Midtown Manhattan, was a creative director for a firm that did interactive advertising. He was laid off Oct. 2, 2001, and, to his amazement, has been out of work ever since. When I asked if he ever imagined it would be so hard to find a job, he said, "Not at all. There's no way." 
Mr. Bergmann, 54, is married and has two daughters. His wife works, but her employment outlook, even in the short term, is uncertain. The family has had the benefit of some savings and a bonus Mr. Bergmann earned at a previous job. But he does not know what will happen if he doesn't get another job soon.
Mr. Bergmann believes that many of the big corporate layoffs could have been avoided. He said, "Companies have been living from quarter to quarter for so long they've lost their long-distance planning -- their vision of what the company is going to be like in five years. When there's a downturn, they just get rid of people. 
"I don't know if we can change the heart of C.E.O.'s into thinking, 'Well, you know, I'm getting $30 million, but I can save some jobs if I give back $15 million and live on just $15 million this year.' They never think like that. And until they begin to think like that, we'll be at their mercy."
Unemployment benefits for Ms. Escobar and Mr. Bergmann ran out last July. The extension signed by President Bush yesterday does not apply to them.
Ms. Escobar's situation is extremely precarious. Her savings are gone. She received help from a local charity when her electric service was about to be discontinued.
"I cannot even pay my car insurance," she said. "I have an old car but they've canceled the insurance."
"So you can't drive," I said.
"I can't drive. I'm afraid I'll hit somebody and then I'll end up with no money, no job, and in jail. I don't want that."
Her biggest concern is February's rent. "I don't have it," she said.
The centerpiece of the economic plan proposed by Mr. Bush on Tuesday is the elimination of taxes on stock dividends, an unconscionable giveaway to the rich at a time when so many working Americans are struggling merely to survive.
The plan contained no job creation program, no investment in the nation's critical infrastructure needs, and no assistance for the many states sinking in the quicksand of mammoth budget deficits.
Ms. Escobar has taken the president's policies somewhat personally. "I'm a Republican and I'm not ashamed to say it," she said. "But I'm very upset that they have done nothing for us."
I asked if she had voted for Mr. Bush. "I sure did," she said, then added, "I feel very betrayed."

The President Confronts the Majority Congress He Boosted to Power

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The power of President Bush to trump Congress is something to behold as the political dynamic of majority Republican control runs the length of Pennsylvania Avenue once more. After theatrically brilliant days of leaks and teases, Mr. Bush formally unveiled his economic stimulus plan precisely in time to suck all the oxygen out of both Capitol chambers as the 108th Congress opened for business.
 House Republican leaders might have appreciated the cover, since their initial business included a quiet easing of the no-gift rules. A provision allowing lobbyists to pay for some Congressional junket travels was defended as merely a cosmetic clarification, needed so that members might show support for charity groups by traveling to their events on the nonprofits' dime. The House also graciously allowed the lobbyists to pay for snacks in Congressional offices, thus upholding what aides to Speaker Dennis Hastert called the right to "eat pizza ethically." 
 In contrast, the initial business of the Senate was to revisit the Republicans' embarrassment over the nation's unemployed and rush through long-delayed legislation extending benefits. Democrats immediately termed it a half-a-loaf measure, since long-term unemployed were not included. The highlight of this opening debate was the sight of the new majority leader, Senator Bill Frist, losing his valedictorian's gleam and becoming plainly miffed at the Democrats' ingratitude for being handed the half-loaf.
But for all their speechifying about historic progress and visionary vows, the arriving legislators were relegated to back-page also-rans, potential spear carriers for the newest Bush agenda, bristling with a mixture of the bold and the brazen, which stunned the Democrats both for its audacity and its price tag.
The only thing the Democrats were bristling with was presidential candidates. For now, those in the demoralized Democratic minority seem to take comfort in their individual ambitions. Representative Richard Gephardt has given up the fight for the speakership and taken a back-bench seat, the better to map his run for the presidency. Various Democratic senators with similar ambitions are a study in grinning optimism as they back-slap and joke with returning colleagues, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they no longer control the majority.
But the good spirits extended to the now-minority leader, Tom Daschle, who appears positively relieved since he stepped back from the presidential primary abyss at the last minute and announced he would keep fighting for the party agenda from the well of the Senate. On opening day Mr. Daschle was that rare Democrat who showed a sense of aggressiveness worthy of Mr. Bush, promising passion as the country faces "a series of defining debates about the future."
The session's opening offers no hint of how intense the legislative struggles will be. Will anyone fight for the deficit-ridden states whose hopes for direct emergency aid have been left unmet by the Bush plan? 
There was a time when governors were the stars of both political parties. Now that most states are sloshing in debt, the legislators have retaken center stage, and it will be interesting to see how hard they work to help the former boy and girl wonders back in the state capitols. What issue will the Democrats use to regain their traction? Most significantly, how much might individual Republicans in the tight majorities resist the president's intent to lead them in what Democrats are terming open class warfare? In the Senate, a Democrat without a bill to co-sponsor with John McCain seemed as lonely as a high schooler without a date for the prom.
The one House Democrat who seems most upbeat about two more years of minority impotence is Mr. Gephardt's successor, Nancy Pelosi. As the designated minority leader she was ceremonially nominated by the Democrats for speaker of the House. She reveled in being the first woman in history to get that honor, even though she inevitably finished second to Mr. Hastert in the ultimate vote and had to formally present him with the gavel. Ms. Pelosi wished aloud that he make history next and have to hand the gavel back to her two years from now.
Watching the gentlewoman from California in her vow to turn the tables was the gentleman from Texas, Tom DeLay, the House's new Republican majority leader, who remains the formidable power behind the Hastert speakership. During chamber speeches about the need for bipartisanship, Mr. DeLay never seemed further from his image as "The Hammer" -- the spirited partisan arm-twister -- as he silently devoted himself to the mutual joys of coddling his grandson in his lap. He beamed and gently patted the infant's back as the battlements of the new Congress came into view.

HEADLINE: Rift on Capital Controls Snags Singapore Trade Pact 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Nearly two months after agreeing on the outlines of a free trade agreement, Singapore and the United States remain at loggerheads over how it should treat a policy option that neither side wants to use: capital controls.
 Each side regards restrictions on the movement of investment capital into and out of a country as undesirable. They also agree that there may be exceptional circumstances when a country has little choice but to impose them anyway. They differ over whether their trade agreement should specifically say so. 
 Singapore wants a clause written in to permit capital controls in extreme situations. The United States is adamantly against such a clause. "This is something the U.S. believes fairly strongly in," an American official said.
The dispute is a significant stumbling block to a trade agreement more than two years in the making -- one that analysts said should have been easy to complete. Singapore is a well-developed and largely open economy with almost no exports in politically sensitive areas like agriculture, automobiles, textiles and steel, the sources of most American friction with trading partners.
The White House had hoped to have an agreement ready for Congressional approval by the end of 2002. Negotiators wrapped up the parts of the agreement dealing directly with the flow of goods in the fall. But since then, the Treasury Department and the Singapore monetary authority have been locked in talks over the financial provisions, largely by telephone and teleconference. 
Officials of the two counmtries have agreed not to comment publicly on their disagreement. But people close to the talks ascribe an ideological tone to the debate. 
At the heart of the disagreement are two very different styles of government, executives who are following the dispute say: A Bush administration imperative to interfere with free enterprise as little as possible is colliding with the Singaporean approach of state intervention in many aspects of human activity.
In practical terms, the issue seems largely academic. Singapore has not had any capital controls since the early 1970's, has no provision for them under current law, and resisted the temptation to impose them in the Asian financial meltdown of 1997-98, the worst crisis in recent memory, even though the Singapore dollar tumbled in value along with other currencies in the region.
By contrast, Malaysia imposed strict controls, hoping to stem a flood of assets out of the country. The policy was condemned by the International Monetary Fund, but today, even the fund acknowledges that the controls were important to Malaysia's recovery. 
Capital controls remain anathema to international investors, though, and some still avoid Malaysia long after the restrictions on capital outflows have been lifted. 
Singapore has said it would not resort to controls unless a crisis much worse than the one in 1997-98 were to lead to an acute balance-of-payments squeeze. "We need the flexibility in extreme cases like that to impose some restrictions on capital," a government official said.
Singapore argues that being so much smaller than the United States, and more dependent on trade, makes it more vulnerable to such crises than Washington. The enormity of the American economy, with a gross domestic product in the $10 trillion range, insulates it to some extent from international financial troubles. The economy of Singapore, even as the United States' 10th-largest export market, is about one-hundredth that size. 
Even so, Singapore has substantial foreign exchange reserves -- some $80 billion now -- to help it ward off crises, and the United States argues that Singapore has no real need for treaty language allowing capital controls. Writing it in, American officials argue, would work against the spirit of the trade pact and set a bad precedent.
President Bush has said that he wants a deal with Singapore to serve as a model for trade negotiations with other Southeast Asian nations. Exploratory talks are under way with Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, countries with track records of less financial discipline than Singapore has shown.
Omitting the clause Singapore is seeking would not stop the Singaporeans from resorting to capital controls; rather, they would be faced with having to defend them afterward from investors' complaints of an unfair trade practice. 
The United States has proposed a compromise akin to one it offered Chile: Capital controls could be imposed for a limited time before investors could file complaints; by then, the administration hopes, the controls would have been lifted, making the complaints moot. Singapore is considering the offer, but has said the Chilean version does not suit its situation and would require revisions.
If the two sides can complete a full agreement, it would eliminate tariffs on roughly $33 billion in trade and give United States banks greater freedom to market their services to Singapore's savers.

HEADLINE: Foreign Minister in Mexico Will Quit, Frustrated by the U.S. 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Mexico's foreign minister, Jorge G. Castaneda, will leave the government next week, frustrated over the stalemate in his country's relations with the United States since the attacks of Sept. 11 and the antiterrorism campaign born of them. 
 Mr. Castaneda has told close associates that he will return to the academic life he left when he joined the government of President Vicente Fox. His successor, officials said, will most likely be Luis Ernesto Derbez, Mexico's low-key finance minister and a former World Bank official, who has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement's failure to benefit Mexico's poor. 
 Mr. Castaneda did not comment publicly on the resignation today. 
Mr. Castaneda and Mr. Fox formed one of Mexico's unlikelier political unions. Mr. Castaneda is an intellectual who came out of the left wing, a political scientist by trade. Mr. Fox was a conservative provincial politician, a former Coca-Cola executive, when Mr. Castaneda joined his political crusade to topple 70 years of one-party rule in Mexico. 
After his election in 2000, Mr. Fox and Mr. Castaneda sought "to create a new perception of Mexico in the world," said Jeffrey Davidow, the United States ambassador here from 1998 to 2002. 
They said they wanted to make Mexico a more open society, less insular and inward. In particular, they tried to transform Mexico's relations with the United States, seeking new accords on immigration, trade and energy. 
They thought they had a willing partner in President Bush, who made Mexico his first stop abroad as president and made Mr. Fox the guest at his first state dinner. 
But those efforts all but halted after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington in September 2001. Mr. Castaneda tried repeatedly to convince the Bush administration that a new arrangement on immigration, including legal status and documentation for millions of Mexicans in the United States, would enhance American national security. He got nowhere. 
"We have to make the U.S.-Mexico relationship, the Fox-Bush relationship, a demonstrable success story," Mr. Castaneda said in an interview last year. "We need substance. And in order to have substance, given what both presidents and both governments have said from the beginning, we need a deal on immigration."
When it became apparent last fall that such a deal was not in the works, Mr. Castaneda began thinking about his departure. 
"Castaneda gave Mexico its first high-profile and ambitious foreign policy," said Rolando Cordera, a political analyst in Mexico City. "But after Sept. 11, because the United States decided that the world had to change, Mexico faced a hostile situation." 
The son of a former foreign minister of Mexico, educated at Princeton University, Mr. Castaneda, 49, has taught at New York University and written a small shelf of books. Last year, he worked to win a seat for Mexico on the United Nations Security Council, where it played a major role in forging a unanimous resolution on weapons inspections in Iraq. 
His resignation, which will be the first from Mr. Fox's cabinet, has been long sought by his many political opponents. In fact, few in Mexican politics have more enemies.
"He is an anomaly in Mexican politics," said the historian Carlos Monsivais. "He comes from the left. He speaks directly. And he does not worry about the personal consequences of his acts."

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: THE PRESIDENT; 
Amid Criticism, Bush Promises To Produce Education Gains

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush today vowed to follow through on his plans for improving education but was immediately challenged by Democrats who said he had failed to provide schools with enough money to meet the goals of the bipartisan education bill he signed a year ago.
 Speaking to teachers, principals and administrators gathered at the White House to celebrate the first anniversary of the law, the No Child Left Behind Act, the president said it had laid the groundwork for improvement by measuring the performance of schools in teaching reading and math and by requiring that failing ones shape up. 
 Mr. Bush said federal spending on elementary and secondary education had increased by 49 percent over the last two years, and he noted that he had already proposed further increases for next year in some programs, including Title I, which provides money for the neediest schools. Mr. Bush announced last week that he would call for a $1 billion increase, to $12.35 billion. 
"It is not enough to spend more on schools, however," Mr. Bush said. "This issue is not just about money. We must spend money more wisely. We must spend money on what works."
But many Democrats said at news conferences today and in written statements that Mr. Bush was undermining the law -- which he has cast as one of his most important accomplishments and an illustration of how the two parties can cooperate to get things done in Washington -- by financing it at far lower levels than the legislation authorized.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who worked closely with Mr. Bush to pass the law, said the administration was trying to improve education on a "tin cup budget" while pushing for $670 billion in tax cuts over the next decade.
"The president's budget may provide the resources to test our children, but not enough to teach them," Mr. Kennedy said. "The president's first order of business should be education and children, not tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals and corporations in this country."
The programs covered by the education law had a budget of $22.2 billion last year. The law authorized an increase to $29.2 billion. But in his budget proposal for the current fiscal year, Mr. Bush sought $22.1 billion, and Congress, which has still not passed spending bills for this year and is under intense pressure from the White House to hold down domestic spending, is likely to appropriate $23 billion or $24 billion.
The biggest single program covered by the law, that for children from low-income homes, received $10.35 billion last year, and an increase to $18.5 billion was authorized. Mr. Bush proposed $11.35 billion for the current fiscal year, the level likely to be approved by Congressional appropriators, and the president is calling for $12.35 billion next year -- still $6 billion less than the law authorized. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 16, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article last Thursday about the debate between President Bush and Democrats in Congress over education policy referred incorrectly to spending provisions in legislation signed by Mr. Bush last year. While it called for specific increases for a number of educational programs, it did not authorize an overall increase this year to $29.2 billion from $22.2 billion.

HEADLINE: GOLF; 
Opportunity Awaits With Woods Hurt for Opener

BYLINE:  By CLIFTON BROWN 

DATELINE: KAPALUA, Hawaii, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Even before the first tee shot, it is clear that 2003 will not be a typical year for the PGA Tour.
 The season-opening Mercedes Championships will begin Thursday at the Plantation Course without Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, the top two players in the world ranking. Woods is recovering from knee surgery in December, and he is not expected back until mid-February. Mickelson is skipping the Mercedes for the second consecutive year, electing to stay home after a heavy schedule in November and December. 
 The most talked-about issue in golf these days is not the competition, but the controversy surrounding the Masters, to be held April 10-13 at Augusta National Golf Club. The Augusta National chairman, William Johnson, who is known as Hootie, has stated that the club will not add a woman to its membership before the tournament. Martha Burk, the chairwoman of the National Council of Women's Organizations, who has led the campaign for admittance of a woman, has promised not to ease the pressure.
As Augusta braces for protests and demonstrations during tournament week, players cannot escape the topic, which will be debated, discussed and dissected from now until mid-April.
As a native of Augusta, Ga., Charles Howell III, one of the Tour's rising stars, could sense a different atmosphere in his hometown when he visited during Christmas. 
"A lot of business and people around Augusta are becoming hurt by it," Howell said, referring to the membership controversy. "I know one of the housing bureaus has had 40-some houses canceled already. My youngest brother's girlfriend works for the largest caterer in Augusta, and they've had a whole lot of orders canceled and a lot of parties canceled. The impact goes far beyond golf. It's hurting the city, the economy. A lot of people depend on the income from the Masters.
"What's right or wrong? I have an opinion, but everyone does. I keep my opinion to myself. Augusta National is a private club, but then again, it's 2003 and you'd like to see a woman member out there."
Opinions vary depending on whom you ask.
"With all that's going on in the world, we're worried about membership at a golf club?" said Rocco Mediate, a five-time winner on Tour. "It's their club and their right to invite who they want."
Nick Price, a three-time major champion, sees the issue differently. "They're 10 years behind the times," he said. "They should have had a lady member in there 10 years ago." 
While the Augusta issue will linger, the players who were fortunate to make this week's field have soaked up the sunshine, the surf and the 80-degree temperature as they start a new campaign with new goals and fresh attitudes.
The winner of the Mercedes will take home $1 million, plus a new Mercedes-Benz SL500. Not a bad way to start the year. And with Woods sidelined, players sense an opportunity to get a quick start, hoping to end Woods's four-year reign as the Tour's top money-winner and player of the year.
This week's favorites include the reigning British Open champion, Ernie Els; the defending Mercedes champion, Sergio Garcia; the winner of last year's P.G.A. Championship, Rich Beem; Vijay Singh; Justin Leonard; Retief Goosen; Jeff Sluman; and Price.
Mediate sees both opportunity and disappointment in not having Woods on Tour early.
"The money race is more wide open, but we need to have Tiger healthy," Mediate said. "He makes our Tour better. He brings more people, he brings more coverage. I'm one of those guys who would rather have Tiger in the field. A, it raises the level of play. And B, if you happen to win, it's a much better feeling when he's around."
Only last year's Tour winners qualify for the Mercedes, and this year's field features 18 first-time winners. Call yourself a serious golf fan if you recognize Jonathan Byrd, John Rollins, Gene Sauers, Craig Perks and Ian Leggett without a program. Those players all won tournaments last year, while world-class players like David Toms, Davis Love III, David Duval, Mike Weir, Scott Verplank and Hal Sutton did not.
Has there been a changing of the guard, or was last year a fluke? It will be interesting to see how many first-time winners can capture another tournament and how many veterans will bounce back.
"I think you'll see a lot of young players play well, but I don't think you'll see 18 first-time winners," Howell said. "That was a bit of a shock."
Dan Forsman, who had not won since 1992, proved something to himself by winning last year's SEI Pennsylvania Classic at age 44. For Forsman, an invitation to the Mercedes is never taken for granted.
"I'm just glad they remembered my address," he said.
Then Forsman looked out toward a gorgeous view of the Pacific Ocean and considered the benefits of beginning a Tour season at the Mercedes. Somebody will end the weekend $1 million richer and the last-place finisher will earn at least $53,000. "You know, it's really hard to have a bad week out here," Forsman said. "I guess you could. But you'd have to try hard."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASIAN ARENA; 
Defectors Want to Pry Open North Korea

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is now willing to talk to North Korea about its nuclear bomb program. Next week, South Korea will send the North 11,800 tons of rice.
 But in interviews, three recent defectors from North Korea drew on their experiences to give their own proposals for how to deal with the unpredictable government of their impoverished homeland. 
 The proposals included closing China's five border bridges and imposing an economic quarantine; undermining the leadership cult by smuggling in radios tuned to South Korean stations; and, in the words of one woman, by "bombing the North with ladies' handbags." 
"My eyes were opened when, through a trader friend, I got hold of some South Korean clothing," recounted the woman, Lee Ji Young, 31. "I was surprised that they were very good clothes. I had to scissor off the labels, of course."
"Before, I had believed what they told us about the food donations from South Korea and the United States: 'Because we are so strong militarily and strong ideologically, they send us all this tribute,' " Ms. Lee said, smiling at the memory. 
Six months after escaping from North Korea, she sat in the office of a human rights group here, happily wearing a gray wool jacket, with a stylized American flag patch on the left arm and, on the back in large black script: New York Yankees.
The Kim family's Communist dynasty -- founded by Kim Il Sung and continued by his son, Kim Jong Il -- has ruled North Korea for the last half century by maintaining what may be the world's tightest monopoly on information about the outside world. That grip will loosen, defectors say, when North Koreans learn such basic facts as their rank as Northeast Asia's poorest nation. Per capita income in South Korea is 13 times the level in North Korea.
Military pressure, the defectors warned, will have little effect on one of the most militarized societies in the world. In the mid-1990's, during a famine, Ms. Lee recalled, "they had this slogan: 'Without the candy bowls, you can still live; but without the bullets, you cannot survive.' "
But behind the fire-breathing rhetoric, "the North Korean Army is in shambles," she added. 
"The North Korean military elites are skimming from their budgets, cutting down the average ration for soldiers," said Ms. Lee, whose husband served in the military. "The soldiers have become very undisciplined. They steal piglets." 
Economic sanctions, if applied by China, North Korea's largest trading partner, might force Kim Jong Il to mothball his nuclear bomb projects, said the defectors, who all escaped through China. But according to a report released last week by South Korea's National Statistical Office, only 14 percent of North Korea's limping economy depended on foreign trade in 2000, compared with 69 percent in South Korea. 
"When China and Russia stop giving aid, North Korea is bound to halt its nuclear weapons program," said Ma Young Ae, 39, a former counterintelligence agent who now runs a restaurant here with her new South Korean husband.
"Most of the food in Pyongyang is from China," she said, referring to North Korea's capital. "The best way to stop the nuclear program is to stop the aid."
But Ms. Ma, who said she did undercover work in China before she defected in 1999, said that merely persuading China to close the five river bridges would not seal off North Korea. "A lot of private boats cross the river," she said. "Unless they put up an electrified barbed wire fence, they will keep doing it."
An economic quarantine was also recommended by Park Soon Duck, a former Korean Workers' Party secretary at an iron mine.
"North Korea has to be sanctioned economically -- that is the right way to bring down the regime," argued the energetic Ms. Park, who works as a janitor and writes for a defectors' journal in her spare time. "They can't survive on their own. The fundamentals of self-reliance are in shambles."
The end of the Communist government would be the only guarantee that the nuclear weapons production would stop, she said.
Ms. Park said she had no patience with young South Koreans who muse that a North Korean nuclear bomb is really a "Korean bomb."
"That's a 3-year-old kid talking, someone who doesn't know about politics," retorted Ms. Park, whose two sons -- a seminarian and a street vendor -- are in Seoul.
All three women agreed that the slower, but more effective way to undermine North Korea's system would be to break the information monopoly that the government holds over the nation's 22 million people.
"Churches in South Korea say it has to be the Bible, others say the culture has to go in," Ms. Ma said . "In my case, as a Christian, I believe the Bible will enlighten the people very quickly."
But she conceded, "If you are caught with a Bible, you can be executed or sent to political prison camp."
In South Korea, when winds are blowing north, Christian groups sometimes tie Korean-language Bibles to balloons and send them over the border. The South Korean government has largely ended such activities, believing that it undermines its policy of peaceful coexistence with North Korea.
Ms. Ma urged the Bush administration to flood North Korea with radios equipped with long-lasting batteries that would allow North Koreans to listen to South Korean stations and to Radio Free Asia, which is supported by the United States. 
"Radios, tape cassettes, magazines -- that's what I mean by cultural penetration," she said. 
In North Korea, "all the tape recorders and radio have to be registered," said Ms. Lee, who was a housewife until she left 18 months ago. "At registration, they cut off and solder the tuning dial to make sure you don't have a 'free' radio. If you have a cassette player, sometimes the police come to your apartment to check your cassette library."
To fight ideological contamination, North Korea's government for years taught citizens that goods from South Korea were laced with cyanide.
"North Koreans are brainwashed to believe that everything from the South has poison on it," Ms. Lee continued, admitting that this legend might prevent people from picking up radios or handbags left scattered over the countryside. But that taboo is wearing down with the influx of foreign aid and goods from China.
As North Korea became an international charity case in the late 1990's, she said, foreign goods became increasingly common: medicines at her local hospital, children's clothes handed out at kindergartens, winter boots and blankets distributed at an old people's home.
"We were able to see at the public distribution center bags of rice with the U.S.A. logo on it, that said in Korean, 'Gift from the United States,' " she continued.
But Ms. Lee, who is now studying at a cooking school in Seoul, said: "They warned us: 'Just because you are getting their food, don't have any fantasies about the U.S.A. This aid will not last. They may turn into a wolf at anytime and bite us.' "
"I believed all that until I got to South Korea," she said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN; 
Senator Miller, Democratic Maverick, Will Retire

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Senator Zell Miller, the wild-card Georgia Democrat who has contributed to some of the Bush administration's biggest legislative victories, announced today that he would not seek re-election in 2004.
 Mr. Miller, who is 70, did not give a reason for his decision, but he has not been raising money in Georgia and has frequently muttered that he is weary of Washington's partisanship and slow-moving legislative machinery. 
 Given the recent Republican victories in the state, his decision increases the possibility that the seat will go to the Republicans.
"I wanted to make my plans known early so that those who want to run can begin their preparation," he said in a statement. "I realize some will call me a lame duck. But those who know me know I will be the same duck, continuing to serve no single party but all the people of Georgia."
Mr. Miller was an early supporter of President Bush's 2001 tax cut and is considered a likely ally of the administration's economic plans this year. For months last year, he was the only Senate Democrat to support Mr. Bush's plan to reduce Civil Service and union protections for workers in the new Department of Homeland Security, often bitterly denouncing his party for supporting the interests of unions rather than security and efficiency.
His conservatism often led to speculation that he might consider changing parties, but he scoffed at the notion and last year campaigned hard for the re-election of Senator Max Cleland, a fellow Georgia Democrat. Mr. Cleland was defeated. 
Mr. Miller's two terms as governor left him popular in Georgia, in large part for creating the HOPE scholarship, which gives lottery proceeds to college students. He left retirement in 2000 when he was appointed by Gov. Roy E. Barnes to the seat left vacant by the death of Senator Paul Coverdell, a Republican, and hed won election to the remainder of Mr. Coverdell's term later that year.
In his statement, he said he would not endorse any candidate to succeed him. The field is likely to be large. Mr. Barnes, who was defeated in November, took himself out of the running today, but Democrats said Mr. Cleland might seek the nomination. Several Republican members of Congress are considering a run, trying to take advantage of what may be a new Republican surge in the state, and a spokesman for former Representative Bob Barr said Mr. Barr was strongly considering a race.
Senator George F. Allen of Virginia, chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the open seat would be an "excellent opportunity" for Republicans in 2004, noting that Mr. Bush carried the state overwhelmingly in 2000.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said that he was disappointed by Mr. Miller's decision, but that the party hoped to recruit a strong candidate in the next few weeks.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: THE ENVIRONMENT; 
McCain and Lieberman Offer Bill to Require Cuts in Gases

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
At a packed committee hearing, Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, joined forces today to challenge the Bush administration on global warming.
 The two former -- and possibly future -- political rivals to President Bush and each other offered their bill to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases, saying the administration was stuck in neutral on that crucial environmental matter. 
 "The United States is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions," Mr. McCain, chairman of the Science, Commerce and Transportation Committee, said as he opened the hearing. "It is time for the United States government to do its part to address this global problem, and a discussion of mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required." 
That assertion was a direct challenge to Mr. Bush, whose approach relies on voluntary reductions, and it guaranteed that the McCain-Lieberman bill would face stiff opposition, particularly after next week, when Mr. Lieberman is to announce that he is seeking the Democratic nomination for president next year.
The bill, forged with advice from industry and environmental groups, would require that by 2010 industries cut emissions of carbon dioxide to 2000 levels and by 2016 to 1990 levels.
It would create a "cap and trade" system under which companies that failed to meet the goals could buy "credits" from companies that exceeded them, an approach used to reduce acid rain. The program would apply to electric utilities, industrial plants, transportation and large commercial enterprises, which were responsible for 85 percent of emissions in 2000 in the United States.
The administration declined to join the Kyoto treaty on climate change, even though last year Mr. Bush accepted findings by a panel of American experts that human activity had caused most of the global warming in recent decades.
Mr. Bush set a policy that until 2012 would rely on voluntary measures by industries to slow growth in emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. He said more research was needed to clarify the potential environmental risks of warming before taking stronger measures, although White House officials said recently that they might speed their timetable in seeking compliance.
Today, the White House was unenthusiastic about the McCain-Lieberman approach.
A spokesman, Scott McClellan, said: "We're already making great progress on the president's common-sense plan to significantly reduce the growth in greenhouse-gas emissions and working with Congress to pass the most significant reduction in power-plant emissions ever."
Senator James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said the causes of global warming were still open to question. He indicated that he had a fundamental difference with the McCain-Lieberman approach by noting that the Congressional Budget Office had found that cap-and-trade programs amounted to "an energy tax on consumers."
Many people at the hearing rejected the idea that the White House was doing something serious about global warming and criticized the administration for saying it needed to do more research.
Mr. Lieberman, the first witness, said the administration's approach would "allow greenhouse-gas emissions to keep increasing indefinitely, presenting this country and the world with a bigger and bigger environmental crisis to tackle down the road," hurting the economy and America's stature in the world.
Of his bill, he said, "we do less than is explicitly called for under the Kyoto agreement, but we sure do a lot more than nothing."
Speaking for the administration at the hearing was James R. Mahoney, assistant commerce secretary and deputy administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Dr. Mahoney said, "We do have evidence of global change," but he added, "There are substantial uncertainties about causes, and because of that uncertainty about causes, there's also substantial uncertainty about mitigation methods that might be effective."
He said the administration was spending $1.7 billion on research. Dr. Mahoney also announced that the White House would be the host of an international Earth Observation Summit this summer to discuss climate change.
And he warned that the McCain-Lieberman approach of mandatory reductions in gases would lead to "years of litigation."
Mr. McCain said a voluntary approach did not "meet the urgency" of the threat from global warming.
Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was more dismissive.
"I don't think these workshops are going to cut it," Mr. Wyden told Dr. Mahoney, asking him what event, "short of flooding the National Mall," would persuade the administration that global warming was a serious problem.
Dr. Mahoney said that was above his pay grade, but offered that the administration had to worry about the "economic dislocation" caused by any mandatory program.
The hearing was the first by this committee in the new Congress, a sign that Mr. McCain wanted to make a statement. That statement, his opponents said, was that he and Mr. Lieberman were posturing.
"This was a political statement," said Frank Maisano, representing the Business Coalition on Global Warming, who predicted widespread opposition to the bill. "It's so broad, and it covers so many people and it would be so complex and complicated. It's too burdensome for anyone to fathom."
Representatives of environmental groups were thrilled with the McCain-Lieberman approach. 
"It's a very big event that McCain and Lieberman would open up with this," David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: THE NATIONAL MOOD; 
Deep Divisions on Who Will Benefit From Bush Tax Plan

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
On a mother-daughter day out, Barbara Bowers and Laura Folsom strolled Maiden Lane today, a gated pedestrian district of boutiques and beauty salons that cater to the well-to-do.
 Ms. Bowers carried a shopping bag from Neiman Marcus. Her daughter, Ms. Folsom, was dressed elegantly in a black sweater and scarf over slacks. Politically, they have much in common: They are Republicans and stand to benefit from the tax cuts and economic plan proposed on Tuesday by President Bush. 
 But like many other Americans, Ms. Bowers and Ms. Folsom are deeply divided on the president's prescriptions for the stalled economy. The women agreed that something major needed to happen. They praised Mr. Bush for turning the nation's attention to something other than attacking Saddam Hussein. 
But the consensus ended there.
"I think it's a farce," Ms. Bowers, 65, of Palo Alto, Calif., said of the president's plan. "I don't think it will help the average working person one bit."
Ms. Folsom bit her lip as her mother spoke, then countered in rapid fire. "The people who have money and invest it are creating jobs," said Ms. Folsom, 39, of Alamo, Calif., whose husband, a pilot for United Airlines, recently took a 40 percent cut in pay and benefits. "It is all connected. By helping the people who can invest, you are also helping the overall population."
The debate continued as the women walked toward Union Square, with Ms. Bowers saying she would never vote for Mr. Bush because of the perceived tilt toward the rich and Ms. Folsom promising to back the president all the way.
In varying forms, the scene here was played out across the country today, as families dissected the economic proposals over kitchen tables, co-workers argued the merits during breaks at the office and financial analysts tried to figure out the bottom line for their clients, many of whom expressed confusion about where they stood.
"The focus on the economy is great, but as far as I can tell, the separation between the rich and poor continues to increase," said Amir Nashat, 29, a venture capitalist from Cambridge, Mass., who described himself as a political independent. "Democrat or Republican, when they focus on the economy, they do things that are meant to please their voters, not make long-term changes for the better."
In Louisiana, a mother of three young children said she was heartened by the bigger child tax credit proposed by the president but wondered why the plan seemed to give even more to the wealthy. In Seattle, the owner of a sausage restaurant welcomed the proposed end to taxation on corporate dividends and said everyone, including his elderly parents living on investment income, stood to benefit. In Atlanta, a museum consultant questioned the wisdom of tax cuts of any sort, suggesting the government could better use the money elsewhere.
A telecommunications company manager in Denver, echoing sentiments from many others, wondered if any of it would become law anyway because Iraq remained at the top of the president's priorities.
"We'll see if it happens," said the manager, Chris Lombardi, 42. "President Bush is trying to ensure he has unified support if we engage in war with Iraq. It's a timing thing."
Indeed, questions about a possible war served as a heavy backdrop to the president's announcement, raising doubts among some supporters and detractors about any economic plan put forth in a political environment that could turn the economy topsy-turvy in weeks or months.
"I promise you that whether or not we go to war with Iraq will have a much bigger effect on the economy than any of this," said Bryan Roberts, 35, a venture capitalist with Venrock Associates of New York, who was attending a health-care conference here with Mr. Nashat.
As the president's tax cuts and economic proposals were pulled apart across the nation today, the main point of contention followed the same political debate framed on Capitol Hill: rich vs. poor.
Many of the better-off people likely to benefit from the changes argued that it was unfair to cast the proposals in simple terms of winners and losers. John Siddall, 58, the chief executive at an advertising agency in Richmond, Va., said he fell within the top federal tax bracket and stood to save about 2 percent in taxes. But he said the emphasis on his wallet missed the point.
"As a small-business owner," Mr. Siddall said, "it's more important for me for the economy to do well. This business supports the lives of 50 other families. For us to do well, the economy has to do well."
Alan King, a sales manager for a plastics manufacturer in Atlanta with a household income of nearly $200,000, said the Bush strategy was a straightforward matter of "pump priming" the economy.
"Rich people create jobs; poor people take jobs," Mr. King, 43, said. "Rich people make money. Poor people spend money. It will stimulate the economy, unless rich people just stick the money in their pocket."
The sausage restaurant owner in Seattle, Don Schultze, 49, said his business sustained the families of 15 employees. Dominated by a wooden bar, short stools and the aroma of grilling onions and sausages, Mr. Schultze's restaurant, Shultzy's Sausage, has turned a profit in just two of its 14 years. But Mr. Schultze, who described the president's plan as "brilliant in its simplicity," said he saw things getting better, particularly because of changes in the tax policy on dividends.
"Our economy is based on growth," he said. "To start growth, the plan is going to benefit everybody and benefit everybody immediately." 
Another person in Seattle's University District, John Watkins, was far more pessimistic. Mr. Watkins, 52, was waiting for his morning caffe latte at Sureshot coffee shop, as loud music filled the dark space and a jackhammer tore up the payment outside. Mr. Watkins owns the used-book store adjacent to the coffee shop. He has two employees and has been in business for 11 years. 
Mr. Watkins does not play the stock market and so cares little about the taxation of dividends. He wondered why Mr. Bush had not focused more on assisting small businesses directly by trimming payroll taxes, which would help keep down his labor costs and perhaps allow him to hire more people.
"I don't see a big help for me," Mr. Watkins said.
In East Setauket, N.Y., Elaine Dawson, 46, said the plan needed to be reworked to provide more benefits for "working people." Ms. Dawson, the mother of four whose husband owns a surveying business, estimated her family would save about $1,000 under the plan. But she said that would not be nearly enough to kick-start the economy.
"I think his intention is to give large tax breaks to corporate investors while throwing a small bone to the average Joe in hopes that we're all going to believe that it will benefit us all in the long run," Ms. Dawson, a Republican, said.
In Addis, La., the mother of three, Jennifer Lejeune, 34, pored over the books of the small dance studio she runs. Her husband is a teacher. In a quick look at the Bush plan, Ms. Lejeune discovered that her family would save $1,200 in the child tax credits, about the same amount of money they recently spent on medical bills for their 4-year-old son, Josh, who has a detached retina.
Though grateful, Ms. Lejeune wondered if Mr. Bush or any of the other people who determine economic policy understood families for whom every penny counts.
"I feel like lawmakers are trying to find a solution to this problem," Ms. Lejeune said, "but they're not even in the same tax bracket as me. We're in two different worlds, and mine is based in reality."

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN; 
Near-Term Benefits of Fiscal Plan Are Debated

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
A White House estimate shows that administration officials are expecting President Bush's tax plan to generate only 190,000 jobs in 2003, a small number when compared to the 1.5 million jobs that have disappeared over the past two years.
 The document, prepared by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, makes it clear that the main purpose of the president's 10-year, $670 billion tax-cut proposal is not to fix the economy's current weakness but rather to advance a longer-term agenda of reducing taxes and increasing future growth. 
 When President Bush announced his program on Tuesday, administration officials predicted it would create 2.1 million jobs and said the tax cuts had been "front-loaded" to have as much effect in the first year as possible. 
But the White House's estimate says the real economic stimulus would not begin until 2004, by which time many economists predict that growth will already have increased. 
The document, released today, gave ammunition to Democratic critics of the president's plan who argue that the tax plan is too expensive and would do little to relieve the pain of the current slowdown.
Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, said the estimates validate Democratic criticisms that Mr. Bush is not primarily interested in economic stimulus.
"This isn't a jobs program, it isn't stimulus," he said today. "It is what it is, a restructuring of the tax system with a high proportion of the advantage going to people who are already doing well."
Senator Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader, was pressing the same point, even without seeing the White House calculations.
"The president really ought to be embarrassed in putting a plan like this forward in the name of economic stimulus," Mr. Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, told reporters today. "Regardless of what you think about fairness, regardless of what you think about size, 85 percent of this plan doesn't even take effect this year."
But the estimate is consistent with what Mr. Bush and his economic advisers have quietly been saying: that they have little interest in quick fixes and are primarily interested in long-term economic growth.
The estimate also includes an extremely optimistic projection of the plan's total cost. Using a supply-side analysis, which assumes that tax cuts will partly pay for themselves by promoting faster growth, White House officials predicted the actual revenue loss to the federal Treasury would be less than half the size of the tax cut between now and 2007.
In public, the White House has said the economic plan would cost the Treasury about $674 billion over 10 years. But under a supply-side scenario, the cost through 2007 would drop from $359 billion to $166 billion. The discussion of costs is significant because some lawmakers are concerned about how much the tax cuts will add to the federal deficit. 
No matter what the costs, the White House estimates confirm the opinion of most outside economists that Mr. Bush's tax plan would do little to help the economy this year.
The unemployment rate reached 6 percent in November, and about 95,000 people a week are exhausting their state-financed unemployment benefits.
The White House document predicts that the tax plan will increase economic growth by about four-tenths of one percent and foster an additional 190,000 jobs in 2003. The Council of Economic Advisers estimated that the tax plan's impact in 2004 would be much higher, fostering 900,000 additional jobs on top of those that would have been created without any additional stimulus.
Though Mr. Bush did use the word "stimulus" when talking about his goals last week, he and his top advisers have played down their interest in short-term jolts.
R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has tried to expunge the very word "stimulus" from policy discussions because he says it sounds too much like Democratic-style pump-priming.
After the president's speech on Tuesday, administration officials said the tax cut plan would generate 2.1 million new jobs over three years. But they were reluctant to spell out their assumptions about growth.
"The president's plan to create jobs and spur growth in the economy is crafted to make a difference in both the short term and the long term," said Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman. 
Though acknowledging that many of the effects of the tax cut plan would not begin until 2004, Ms. Buchan said the plan would nevertheless pump $58 billion into the economy in 2003 through income tax rate reductions, rebates for child tax credits and additional unemployment benefits.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lobbies Oil Exporters to Produce More 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, alarmed by a 38-day strike that has crippled Venezuela's petroleum industry and caused sharp increases in prices, has begun pressing countries that export oil to increase production, administration officials said today.
 Those efforts, which are being led by senior officials in the State and Energy Departments, also seem intended to prepare for the potential disruption in the international oil market that would come from an invasion of Iraq, industry analysts said. 
 The globe-spanning lobbying campaign could bear fruit this weekend, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to meet in Vienna to discuss increasing production as much as two million barrels a day, or 8.7 percent. 
"We've seen a number of statements from members of OPEC about possibly increasing production, and that would be a positive development," said Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman. "Obviously, they're going to have to get together and decide, but we're also in touch with various countries involved." 
Venezuela has been the fourth-largest source of oil for the United States, behind Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Canada, providing 14 percent of the nation's crude oil imports.
By some estimates, Venezuelan production has fallen 75 percent or more since a general strike, organized by opponents of President Hugo Chavez, began last month. 
"We were consuming 1.5 million barrels of Venezuelan oil each day that we're not getting now, which means we have to get it from someplace else," a senior State Department official said. "We've had a historic strategic energy relationship with Venezuela that is obviously being affected in a dramatic way at this point."
The expectation of an increase in production from OPEC was followed by an Energy Department report showing an unexpected increase in United States stockpiles, which caused oil prices to drop today for the third consecutive session. In New York, crude oil for February delivery fell 52 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $30.56 a barrel. Prices have dropped about 8 percent from a two-year high on Friday, the biggest three-day drop since mid-April.
Oil stocks held by refiners and storage companies rose 400,000 barrels, to 278.7 million barrels, in the week ended Friday, according to the Energy Department report.
In a separate report, the American Petroleum Institute, which can evaluate data differently, said supplies fell two million barrels, to 276 million barrels. (The institute has changed the release of its weekly report from late Tuesday to coincide with the government report.) Analysts had forecast a decline of up to five million barrels.
Some analysts asserted that the administration had underestimated the effect of the civil unrest in Venezuela and should have begun pressing for an OPEC production increase weeks ago.
Given that it will take 30 to 45 days for Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia to increase production and deliver additional crude oil to the United States, the Bush administration's lobbying campaign to increase production appears intended to prevent huge market disruptions if the United States attacks Iraq, analysts said.
The United States military will have positioned enough troops and equipment in the Persian Gulf to begin an invasion of Iraq by early to mid-February, Pentagon officials have said.
"This is really about Iraq," said Roger Diwan, a managing director for PFC Energy, a consulting firm. 
But administration officials denied that, saying their main goal has been to offset sharply reduced production in Venezuela, where no letup in the strike is in sight. They said that OPEC members, particularly Saudi Arabia, typically grow uncomfortable when oil prices rise above $28 a barrel, raising concerns of worldwide recession, which could drastically reduce oil consumption.
OPEC's president, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah of Qatar, told Bloomberg News today that he wanted the price of crude to fall to $25 a barrel.
Some analysts and lawmakers have also urged the Bush administration to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, a stockpile of nearly 600 million barrels that the United States holds in case of severe supply disruptions.
But a spokeswoman for the Energy Department said today that the Venezuelan crisis had not yet met that standard. 
"We've been monitoring the situation very closely," said Jeanne Lopatto, the spokeswoman. "At this point, we do not feel that release of oil from the reserve is necessary."

HEADLINE: U.S. Begins Talks for Trade Pact With Central Americans 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
The Bush administration officially opened negotiations today to create a free trade agreement with five Central American countries within a year, a big leap in its ambitious plans for a Nafta-like zone throughout the Western Hemisphere.
 The announcement cemented the role of trade as the administration's primary policy focus with Latin America. It gives the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, chief responsibility for promoting improved American relations in the region at a time much of the administration is focused on Iraq and terrorism. 
 Indeed, Richard E. Feinberg, former special assistant for inter-American affairs to President Bill Clinton and an early advocate of the regional free trade concept, said, "I believe these free trade agreements will be seen as the 21st-century version of strategic alliances." 
Some critics in Latin America are annoyed at what they say is the administration's strategy of dealing first with small countries that have fewer trade disagreements with the United States rather than including bigger trading rivals like Brazil.
And the initiative intensifies competition between Washington and the European Union for access to the Latin American market, where Europe is the second-largest trading partner after the United States. European officials in Brussels have taken note of Mr. Zoellick's Latin American push since Congress granted trade promotion authority -- once called fast track -- to President Bush in August. And now the Europeans are working to complete negotiations for a similar free trade agreement with Mercosur, the world's third-largest trade group, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay as well as Bolivia and Chile as associate members.
"It is obvious we are in stiff competition right now," a European representative in Washington said. "Our agreement with Mexico came after Nafta, and we don't want to lose out again, especially not with Mercosur.
Flanked by representatives of several countries that just decades ago knew the United States mostly as a purveyor of weapons in their civil wars, Mr. Zoellick said American interests in the region were now centered on liberalized trade, economic development and democracy.
"This is more than a trade negotiation," he said. It is "a plan to strengthen democracy and promote development in a region that has known too little of both."
However, these five countries -- Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua -- offer relatively few of the problems that will appear in the hemispherewide talks for a Free Trade Area of the Americas, or F.T.A.A., since their trade largely meshes with the United States.
Critics, particularly in Brazil, say they fear that this regional agreement is an attempt by the United States to divide and rule, forcing the bigger Latin nations to accept Washington's dictates in the wider negotiations.
"I think this is tactical," said Mario Mugnaini, vice president for international affairs at the Federation of Industries in Sao Paulo. "If there are too many bilateral accords made around the region, then Brazil would ultimately favor closing the F.T.A.A. negotiations, but I don't think that's what the United States wants."
Still, United States trade with these five Central American countries is significant. They import a total of $9 billion worth of products from the United States every year, the rough equivalent of American exports to Russia, India and Indonesia combined. And the United States imports $11 billion worth of goods from the five countries, with nearly three-fourths of the products entering duty free under special-preference programs.
The European Commission's chief trade negotiator, Pascal Lamy, seeking to regain a European foothold in the region and to capitalize on its Old World ties to Spain and Portugal, will travel to Brazil in three weeks -- seeking to fortify relations on a continent that in just a few months has moved swiftly toward a greater opening toward the United States.
The United States and nearly every country in the Western Hemisphere agreed on a blueprint for a Free Trade Area of the Americas in November with the goal of essentially expanding the North American Free Trade Agreement all the way to Argentina by January 2005. Brazil, the largest Latin American economy and the nation most skeptical of a free trade area, is now co-chairman of those talks with the United States.
Last month, Washington concluded a free trade pact with Chile -- a model, Mr. Zoellick hopes, for the talks with the Central American nations, particularly in the areas of protection for laborers and the environment. 
Bernard W. Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs under President Bush's father, who first proposed a hemispherewide free trade zone, said that while Mr. Zoellick might be making rapid strides now, they were perhaps 10 years too late.
"I think that the U.S. and Latin America have paid an enormous price for failing to spread free trade throughout the hemisphere after Nafta," Mr. Aronson said. "If we had, the hemisphere would look very different, and much of the economic and political disintegration wouldn't have occurred."
But some of the praise for Mr. Zoellick's efforts today was laced with criticism of the administration for relying on trade to solve a myriad of crises in Latin America. "Zoellick is doing a wonderful job, but it's extremely unfortunate that he is carrying the water for the whole administration," said Julia Sweig, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. The region, she said, "deserves more senior attention."
At the beginning of the month, Brazilian officials were insulted when Mr. Zoellick led the American delegation to the inauguration of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, leader of the leftist Workers Party. Not only was he considered too junior, but he has been held in some disdain for warning Brazil that it would be reduced to exporting to Antarctica if it failed to join in the Americas trade pact.
Brazil, indeed, has lobbied for the hemispherewide negotiations to be concluded as a single undertaking, meaning all loose ends of an accord must be tied up before all countries involved can sign.
Now, a senior trade official said, Mr. Zoellick is trying to push Brazil "into not just joining the pact, but leading the way."
The major sticking points in all the negotiations will be farm products, especially sugar and citrus fruit.
But the trade and economic ministers of the five Central American countries said today that they were willing to compromise to win permanent access to the United States economy and lure greater investment to their region.
"We're also talking about something more fundamental than trade," said Alberto Trejos, Costa Rica's foreign trade minister. "We'll derive many, many more permanent benefits and a vision of development that will mean more jobs and increased prosperity."
While concern over the strike-induced oil crisis in Venezuela and the civil strife in Colombia may occupy higher-ranking members of the administration, trade officials say they are well suited to be the most prominent representatives of President Bush in the region.
"Economics is the most compelling aspect of U.S.-Latin relations," said Peter Allgeier, a deputy United States trade representative. "Getting access to us gives the message to investors that their countries are a safe place to put their money."

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: PROSPECTS IN CONGRESS; 
Democrats Ease Their Support For a Tax Cut

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
A number of moderate Senate Democrats who were instrumental in helping President Bush pass a tax cut in 2001 said today that they opposed eliminating the federal tax on dividend payments, clouding the Congressional prospects for the central feature of the new Bush economic plan.
 In 2001, President Bush was able to garner enough bipartisan support in the thinly divided Senate to pass his $1.35 trillion tax cut package. This time, however, even the president's Republican supporters predict a tougher road. 
 "There are a number of Democrats who voted with him on the last tax cut, and also a number of Republicans, who are not willing to just accept this one as a fait accompli and take it as it is," Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said in an interview, adding that the dividend tax cut would have to be "replaced and/or dramatically scaled down." 
The support of Mr. Breaux is considered crucial to passage of any economic stimulus legislation by the Senate, where Republicans have the barest majority. In 2001 he helped the White House win 12 Democratic votes for tax cuts. 
The centerpiece of the $674 billion plan is its proposal to eliminate taxes on corporate dividends, which many Democrats regard as an unjustified boon for the wealthy. Though the plan contains provisions that Democrats might support, including a $400-a-child rebate to many families and elimination of the so-called marriage tax penalty, the dividend tax cut is quickly becoming a lightning rod in the Senate.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who voted for the 2001 tax cut, described the president's plan as "a nonstarter."
"Right now," Mrs. Feinstein said, "I don't know of any Democrat who's going to vote for it."
Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Mr. Bush's plan was not likely to pass intact. Mr. Grassley, who helped push through the 2001 tax cuts, said he believed he would be able to negotiate a bipartisan bill that would win the support of a majority of senators.
"We will pass a large -- albeit not as large as the president requests, but a very large -- effective stimulus package, and we will do it by early spring," Mr. Grassley said.
Of the plan's dividend provision, he said: "It might be modified, I would agree. But it would not be eliminated."
At this stage, lawmakers are staking out negotiating positions and could change their stances as the proposal gets closer scrutiny. And while the dividend tax cut may face tough going in the Senate, it has been getting a generally warm reception in the House, where Republicans have a firmer hold on the legislative process. 
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, said he expected a quick vote on the bill "and I would suspect it will look very much like what the president asked for."
A potential problem the White House may face in the House is the desire of some Republican leaders to enact more expansive tax cuts than the White House proposed. Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican leader, said today that he would like to pass an even bigger proposal.
"I look at the Bush plan as a floor," Mr. DeLay said, "not a ceiling." 
With the Senate nearly evenly divided -- 51 Republicans, 48 Democrats and one independent -- the White House must count every vote. To avoid a Democratic filibuster, Senate Republicans are leaning toward attaching the stimulus plan to a budget bill, a parliamentary procedure that would allow legislation to pass with a simple majority of 51 votes. 
But Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said Republicans had not yet determined how to move a tax package through the Senate, or how big it should be. Asked whether he agreed with Mr. DeLay that the president's call for a $670 billion tax cut over the next decade should be a floor rather than a ceiling, Dr. Frist said it was "premature for me to say whether that's a floor."
The political and economic climate in Washington has changed enormously since the 2001 tax cut. Despite the Republicans' control of Congress, those changes do not work entirely in Mr. Bush's favor.
The war on terrorism has helped run up the federal deficit, which is driving Democratic criticism of the economic stimulus plan. A handful of Senate Republicans, like Senators Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, who voted against the first Bush tax cuts, and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, apparently share that concern. 
On Thursday, Mr. Chafee plans to join with Mrs. Feinstein to introduce legislation that would freeze the current top income tax rate until budget surpluses return, thus blocking a provision of the 2001 tax cuts from taking effect. 
Ms. Snowe said in a statement that she would like to "carefully review" the dividend proposal, as well as the overall cost of the Bush plan.
"At a time of growing federal deficits," she said, "it is especially important that this plan be right-sized, without putting our future at risk."
At the same time, Mr. Bush has lost some good will among Democrats in the Senate by campaigning for their opponents last November. Among them is Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, who voted for the 2001 tax cuts but said today that she would not support the plan Mr. Bush announced on Tuesday in Chicago.
"There is not enough stimulus in the stimulus package," Ms. Landrieu said.
Democrats in general favor a much narrower initiative. In the House, for example, Democrats have proposed a $136 billion stimulus package that would cost taxpayers $100 billion when spread out over 10 years. In the Senate, Max Baucus of Montana has proposed a $160 billion stimulus plan similar to the one proposed by Democrats in the House.
The administration says eliminating dividend taxes, which would put $364 billion in the hands of investors, would increase economic growth by increasing the stock value of companies, encouraging investment. But today, leading Democrats stepped up their criticism of the plan.
"If anything, it's a stimulus plan for the rich," said Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader. 
Later, Mr. Daschle went to the White House, along with Congressional leaders of both parties, to meet with Mr. Bush to discuss the agenda for the coming year. Though the economic package was high on the list, there was no effort to bridge the partisan divide on tax cuts.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, described it as a "feel-good meeting" that emphasized the willingness of both parties to work together, without yielding any particular evidence that they would do so.

HEADLINE: Happy Talk in Albany 

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki offered a feel-good assessment of the state of the state yesterday when there was little to feel good about. Mr. Pataki painted New York's budget crisis as something that had no relation to his own policies, and suggested that it could be resolved without undue pain to the taxpayers. The governor, a Republican, even had the chutzpah to lecture the Legislature about the need for being "frank, honest and clear about the scope of the crisis." It was a challenge he certainly did not meet with yesterday's speech. 
 Sounding more conservative than he did during his re-election campaign, Mr. Pataki made his main pitch for no new taxes. That felt less like a promise than an attempt to make the Legislature find the revenue to bridge a $2 billion deficit in this year's budget and a gap of maybe $10 billion in next year's. The governor's plan is to cut his way out of budget troubles, and to use irresponsible gimmicks like borrowing against anticipated proceeds from the tobacco company settlements. Until this week he was also undoubtedly expecting help from Washington. But President Bush failed to come to the rescue on Tuesday in his speech about the economy. 
 Mr. Pataki notably failed to mention any help for localities that are drowning in costs imposed by the state. Unless they get aid, any taxes he avoids in Albany will show up in the overstressed cities and counties.
When it came to new initiatives, the governor revived many of his moss-covered favorites, good ideas that are always tucked into the end of this speech and never seem to go anywhere, like campaign finance reform and revamping the Rockefeller drug laws. With the state government broken, his only proposed fix was to promise voters the right to put their own ideas on the ballot through petitioning. This is an attractive-sounding concept that works out to be terrible in reality, as most states saddled with the initiatives have found out. 
To be fair, it would be hard for the governor to come up with many new programs at a time of such financial peril. A promise to push for more renewable energy over the next 10 years was one suggestion that sounded promising. But over all, Mr. Pataki's big thought for the new year seems to be that if he says everything will be fine, that will make it so.

HEADLINE: Back to the Right 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
After winning re-election by running as a liberal Republican, Gov. George E. Pataki moved back to the right today, firmly positioning himself in the dominant wing of his party with a promise to cut spending and oppose higher taxes.
 The governor's annual address to the Legislature was a mix of standard conservative themes that dovetailed nicely with the tax-cutting and tough-on-terrorism philosophies emanating from President Bush's White House. 
 The speech appeared to put Mr. Pataki in a better position to bid for national office if the opportunity arises. Political advisers to the governor say he would like to keep himself in the national mix, as a possible replacement for Vice President Dick Cheney should he decide not to run for re-election in 2004, or as a candidate for a cabinet post in the Bush administration that might open up. 
Mr. Pataki spent much of his 55-minute speech talking about the need to be vigilant against terrorism and to pass new laws to make it easier to ferret out terrorists. He applauded American soldiers abroad and allowed himself a moment of patriotic gloating over a piece of marble, reputed to be from a palace where Osama bin Laden once lived, that New York reservists brought back from Afghanistan.
He also praised his administration's success in attracting high-tech industries to upstate New York with tax breaks and subsidies. And he made it clear he felt cutting taxes to spur the economy was more important than preserving spending.
The governor promised to shrink the government's size and to hold no program sacred except public security. He urged lawmakers not to pass "job-killing taxes" but to maintain "New York State as the tax-cutting capital of America."
"We simply must spend less money," he said.
The governor's stance against more spending was a sharp departure from his strategy during the election, when he said little about shrinking government. Instead he stressed his support for expensive social programs, like insurance for the poor and drug subsidies for the elderly, as part of an effort to woo Latinos, union members and moderate Democrats.
Mr. Pataki even quoted President Ronald Reagan, who holds a special place in the hearts of conservative Republicans. The governor challenged lawmakers to act now to make the difficult decisions necessary to balance the budget and keep taxes down, rather than take what he called "the path of political expediency." It was the only quote he used.
Conservatives and Republicans were delighted with the speech; labor leaders and Democrats, some of whom supported his re-election bid, were dismayed.
"He's coming home to his roots," said Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party. "He made it clear no part of the budget is left untouched except security. One thing is sure. We are not going to raise taxes."
Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a veteran Manhattan liberal, echoed the views of many Democrats when he said Mr. Pataki's prescription for the state's budget troubles would prove too painful for most voters to accept.
"I'm not sure slashing services to the degree necessary to meet this deficit he is just beginning to acknowledge is palatable to most New Yorkers," he said. "I don't see how it's realistic."
Not only did the governor vow to go ahead with $200 million in tax cuts already enacted and slated to take effect this year, but he said he would also call for new tax incentives to attract investment to the state.
He presented the options before lawmakers, as the state struggles to close a $2 billion gap in this year's budget and at least an $8 billion gap in the next, as a stark choice between creating jobs or raising taxes to save themselves from unpopular choices. "We must choose jobs," he said.
Mr. Pataki also distinguished himself from former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the liberal icon whom he defeated in 1994. He asserted Mr. Cuomo had prolonged the recession in New York by raising taxes during the economic downturn in 1989.
Then Mr. Pataki argued that his administration had taken the wise path when he took over in 1995, by cutting taxes and spending simultaneously in the face of a $5 billion deficit. He claimed a turnaround resulted, even though many economists say the national economy was already entering the biggest boom in history when he cut taxes.
The subtext of Mr. Pataki's speech was clear: any fuzziness about the governor's leanings that emerged during the campaign was erased.
What the governor left out also signaled a shift to the right. He made no pledge to protect state aid to local schools, and promised to "lower the cost of Medicaid." He said nothing about bailing out New York City.
The governor also distanced himself from the state's fiscal crisis, portraying it as unavoidable and unforeseeable fallout from the terrorist attack in September 2001, rather than a result of the deal last year between himself and legislative leaders to spend the state's reserves and other one-time revenues in order to avert budget cuts before the election.
"He took the usual liberties in explaining how all this came about," said Edmund J. McMahon, an analyst with the conservative Manhattan Institute. "He portrayed the state as a completely innocent bystander, which it is not."

Re "The Charles Schwab Tax Cut" (editorial, Jan. 7): 
 You call President Bush's move to end the dividend tax "cynical." 
 But the right tax cuts, paired with a reduction in spending, will result in a jump in corporate profits by encouraging investment, which causes the creation of more jobs and increases the government's financial intake through taxes.
The broker Charles Schwab, the president and millions of Americans realize that supply-side economics and this tax cut work.

HEADLINE: Bush and the Economy: The Debate Heats Up 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 While President Bush's economic plan offers the promise of billions in tax giveaways to America's wealthiest (front page, Jan. 8), it offers no help at all to cash-strapped local governments, like our own. 
 The president's plan is more a shell game than a policy. He promises tax cuts for the few while forcing local governments to raise taxes on the many.
What New York City and the country need is a responsible plan that includes a federal revenue-sharing program to help cities and counties balance their budgets and hold the line on property taxes. The program could be financed by deferring part of the tax cut directed at the top 5 percent. 
A recent City Council study estimates that an $80 billion federal revenue-sharing plan would mean that the average city homeowner could see his or her property taxes fall by $207, while the average co-op owner could see a reduction of $307. 
It would also mean that the City Council and the mayor could spare vital services like police, fire, sanitation and education.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY: JOBLESS COMPENSATION; 
Bush Signs Bill to Extend Unemployment Benefits

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush signed into law today an extension of unemployment benefits for about 2.5 million Americans just hours after the bill cleared the House, making the politically popular legislation the first enacted by the new Republican-controlled Congress.
 Moving to dispose quickly of a measure that languished in the last Congress, Mr. Bush and Republican Congressional leaders said the measure guaranteed that benefits would continue to about 800,000 people in danger of being cut off. The Labor Department estimated that 1.6 million more would qualify for federal aid under the new program, which would run through May. 
 With Congressional leaders at the White House, Mr. Bush said the legislation "should bring some comfort to those of our fellow citizens who need extra help during the time in which they try to find a job." 
Democrats said the $7.2 billion Republican-endorsed approach fell short of what was needed in an uncertain economy and accused the majority Republicans of preventing them from offering alternatives on the jobless and spending.
"A few people in Republican leadership circles are deciding ahead of time what the outcome of legislation should be, and then they are rigging the process so that there's no chance whatsoever of ever modifying it," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.
The House was beginning to "much more closely resemble a Soviet-style Congress," Mr. Obey said.
The majority leader, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, dismissed the complaints.
"What the Democrats' problem is, nothing is good enough for them," Mr. DeLay said. "In fact, I would venture to guess that they would have unlimited unemployment compensation so somebody could stay out of work for the rest of their lives and get unemployment compensation if they had their way."
In the end, House Democrats supported the jobless bill, which was passed unanimously by the Senate on Tuesday, but they objected to the refusal of the House leadership to consider enlarging the package. They wanted to offer new benefits to one million or more Americans who have already gone through their state and federal jobless aid. They said it would be a more direct benefit to the economy than Mr. Bush's proposed $674 billion economic plan, which has as its centerpiece eliminating the tax on stock dividends.
"We have a million people out there," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. "They don't have dividends." 
Under the measure, adopted on a vote of 416 to 4, about 800,000 people who had not received all 13 weeks of their added federal benefits under a program that expired Dec. 28 will get the remainder. In addition, people who exhaust their state benefits in the coming weeks will also be able to claim up to 13 additional weeks of federal assistance. The Labor Department estimates the average weekly benefit at $250.
The most recent national jobless rate was an eight-year high of 6 percent for November, with figures for December expected on Friday.
Republicans argued that Democrats had supported a similar, though less expansive version of the measure that died as Congress adjourned last November and that the one million people who have lost coverage had received substantial help.
"Let's not get mixed up in the rhetoric of partisanship here," said Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington.
House Democrats contrasted the need for extended benefits with Mr. Bush's new economic plan, saying the unemployed should come first.
"If we want to stimulate the economy, what we do is put some money in the pockets of those individuals so they can go to the grocery store and buy a loaf of bread," said Representative Danny K. Davis, Democrat of Illinois, who said his Chicago area district had lost thousands of jobs.
The unemployment fight was a remnant of the last Congress, when the House and Senate failed to reach agreement on an extension of benefits. At the time, House Republican officials were willing to accept only a narrow extension, saying they wanted to consider the problem more fully this year.
In the Senate, a bipartisan group of lawmakers including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, and Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, worked out a three-month expansion.
Despite Democratic prodding, Mr. Bush did not intervene in the fight, but on the Congressional break he endorsed the idea of extending the benefits. House and Senate Republicans agreed to go along, though they were opposed to covering those whose money had run out. 
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert called the new coverage generous but indicated he preferred to help the jobless with a new economic program. "When I talk to my constituents who are having trouble finding a job, they are not satisfied drawing on unemployment insurance," Mr. Hastert said. "They want to go to work."
Mrs. Clinton welcomed the adoption of the law. "Uncertainty and concern have been replaced with five additional months of benefits for millions of Americans, and this victory is theirs," she said, adding that she would continue to press to cover people whose benefits had run out.
Labor Department officials said that because of the way unemployment claims were processed, no one would miss a check even though the program expired on Dec. 28.
After finishing the unemployment issue, the House moved to keep the federal government open while it tried to complete work on 11 spending bills that were also left from 2002. A temporary funding resolution approved last year expires Saturday, and the House adopted on voice vote tonight a measure that would keep agencies running through the end of the month. The Senate is expected to take it up on Thursday.
House and Senate leaders hope to pass by the end of January a huge package wrapping up most of remaining spending measures. Senate Republican leaders said today that they had pared $9.2 billion from bills drafted last year to reach a $750 billion level acceptable to the House and the White House, raising the prospect of a fight over cuts.
Mr. Hastert also said tonight that Representative Christopher Cox, a senior member from California, would chair a new select committee on domestic security.
House members also ratified a leadership decisions to make Richard W. Pombo of California the chairman of the Resources Committee. Tom Davis of Virginia, who directed the Republican Party's House campaign organization, will be the new chairman of the Government Reform Committee. Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia will take over the Agriculture Committee, and Duncan Hunter of California the Armed Services Committee.

UP CLOSE
What the Unemployment Law Does

These are the highlights of $7.2 billion unemployment package signed into law yesterday by President Bush:

Maintains benefits for about 800,000 people entitled to up to 13 weeks of federal aid in a program that expired on Dec. 28.

Provides up to 13 weeks of emergency federal benefits to an estimated 1.6 million people who could exhaust their 26 weeks of state aid before the end of May.

Continues aid beyond June 1 for those who qualify under a phase-out provision that was not part of the program that expired on Dec. 28.

Provides no coverage for an estimated 1 million workers who remain unemployed and have exhausted their state benefits and emergency federal aid.

Does not affect a new proposal by President Bush to set up accounts of up to $3,000 to help the unemployed find work and pay expenses in their job search. Congress will consider that idea as part of the presidents economic plan.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing E-Commerce: Congress To Consider Extending Internet Tax Moratorium 

BYLINE:  NYT 

 BODY:
 Legislation was introduced in both chambers of Congress to extend indefinitely a moratorium on Internet taxes. The current ban on federal and state taxes on online services is set to expire in November. 
Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California, submitted identical bills on Tuesday. "Putting new, unfair Internet taxes on the backs of consumers is not the way to fix state and local budget troubles," Mr. Wyden said. "It could seriously weaken the growing Internet economy and take jobs away from folks working for small Web companies." Congress passed the original ban on Internet taxes in 1998 to prevent states and local governments from imposing taxes that some thought could stunt the growth of the Web. Governors and state officials have argued that millions of dollars are lost in taxes every year when people shop on the Internet. But online retailers and technology companies, among others, say taxing online transactions could impair commerce, particularly during a recession.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "A Bad Bet" (editorial, Jan. 3): Communities that turned to casino gambling in the 1990's to address fiscal problems have been enormously successful. 
 A 1999 report by the National Academy of Sciences also concluded that "gambling appears to have net economic benefits for economically depressed communities."
As to the negative effects you allege, research conducted in 1999 for the National Gambling Impact Study Commission found that the presence of casinos does not correspond to increases in crime or bankruptcy; a separate Treasury Department study also found no bankruptcy link. 
Additionally, commission research estimated that the pathological gambling prevalence rate was 0.6 percent in 1999, whereas in 1976 it was 0.7 percent. Despite a significant increase in gambling opportunities, the rate has remained relatively static.

HEADLINE: DESIGN REVIEW; 
Carpets That Transcend The Arts-Crafts Border

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
If Islamic knotted-pile carpets rank among the world's great visual furnaces for burning intensity of color, pattern, iconography and texture -- and they do -- then the Textile Museum here should expect a visit from the local fire marshal. Housed in the former mansion of its founder, George Hewitt Myers, this small institution is ablaze with a ravishing and important exhibition of 52 carpets produced over the course of four centuries in Anatolia, the Asian portion of Turkey.
 "The Classical Tradition in Anatolian Carpets" was organized by Walter B. Denny, an art historian at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, with the help of Sumru Belger Krody, associate curator of the Textile Museum's Eastern Hemisphere collections. It brings to life a subject that Mr. Denny has studied for nearly three decades: the enduring motifs of 15th- and 16th-century Anatolian carpets and the persistence and permutation of these designs in their 17th-, 18th- and 19th-century successors. 
 The exhibition makes most hierarchical distinctions between art and craft or ornamentation and abstraction wither on the spot. It stresses carpet weaving as a vital medium-bending force, one that has long absorbed aspects of painting, architecture and calligraphy into its transforming structure. Prominent in this show are several masterpieces from the core collection that Myers formed in the decade after World War I. By 1925, he had added a wing to his mansion, established a board of trustees and opened his collection to the public, doing for textiles what the great collector Duncan Phillips was doing for modern painting a few blocks away in his own mansion.
Fittingly, the exhibition repeatedly suggests that the point-by-point articulation of surface that modern and contemporary painters often struggle to achieve comes naturally to the cumulative process of weaving, the geometry of warp and weft and the visual density of knotted pile. 
Anatolian carpets have enjoyed a high international profile for centuries and are prized the world over as prayer rugs, domestic furnishings and symbols of social status and political might. Almost as soon as they began to turn up in the West, in the wake of the Crusades, they were incorporated into European painting, which benefited significantly from their palette of fiery reds, mustards and inky blues as well as from their profuse patterns. Turkish carpets are visible, for example, in a Holbein portrait of a wealthy merchant and beneath the throne of a Ghirlandaio Madonna. 
In fact, certain classical carpet patterns and motifs are still known by the names of the 15th- and 16th-century artists who first included them in paintings. The exhibition treats these "painter carpets," as they are collectively known, in some detail, delineating the differences between the large-pattern Holbein, with three to seven prominent octagonal medallions, and the small-pattern Holbein, with its field of repeating medallions called guls, formal staples of Anatolian carpet design.
(Be prepared as well to encounter such arcana as the split-leaf rumi motif, which grew into the ogival lattice with Ottoman tending, and knot ratios: when the horizontal-vertical density strays from a one-to-one proportion, the design patterns either elongate or compress into Halloweenish-sounding "squashed guls.") 
Despite the carpets' longtime allure, collecting and studying them as art began only a little more than 100 years ago, so a lot of unexplored territory remains. Because there are no Anatolian carpets that can be reliably dated from before the late-13th century, the art form's origins are murky, fomenting a debate that Mr. Denny characterizes as "place versus race." Some scholars argue that the region's rich weaving tradition started with indigenous, non-Muslim Byzantine, Greek and Armenian people; others credit Turkic nomads who invaded from Central Asia in the late 11th century, seemingly with swords in one hand and looms in the other. Mr. Denny wisely declines to take sides, although he sees the nomadic and Islamic influence as an essential component in a complex cultural mix repeatedly roiled by alternating periods of unification and fragmentation. 
Throughout these political shifts, weaving was one of the great continuities. No matter how omnipotent the court workshops or commercial textile centers became, the village looms were never still; this maintained a healthy friction between imposed styles and local inclinations. After the Seljuk Turkish empire flowered and crumbled in the 13th century, village weavers spawned a fledging capitalist economy, spurred by the European demand for carpets and by Italian seamen looking for goods to transport. When the region was reunified under the Ottomans, local weavers absorbed and transformed court styles to their liking. 
This mix of the fruits of the imperial workshops, village looms and centers of large-scale commercial manufacture gives the show an exciting volatility: you never quite know what you are going to see next. On one extreme is a refined Ottoman court carpet influenced by the graceful patterns of Chinese silk, and on the other a pillow cover woven by a village weaver that has a meandering geometric motif, pile as thick as animal fur and a sense that coloristic caution has been thrown to the winds.
Some of the best moments here are historical anomalies that leave Mr. Denny stumped and the viewer enthralled -- like a narrow village carpet in vivid reds, pinks and blues that flattens the floral motifs of the Ottoman court style toward the no-frills geometry of its nomadic precedents.
As this example suggests, the exhibition is dominated by the flow and tension between the geometric and the organic, between the built-in grid of weaving and the vines and blossoms of nature, whose curving forms became easier to depict as thread became thinner and the knot count rose.
The two forces come together in near perfection in the folding strap-work designs and angular Kufic script that Anatolian weavers borrowed from the tiled interiors of 13th-century Seljuk architecture. These glazed motifs were essential to the delicately locked, strap-worked patterns of the Holbein carpets' rectangular medallions and guls; the filigree-bordered diamond medallions of the Ghirlandaios, which look like elaborately framed paintings; and the lobed medallions and stars of the Ushak rugs, as well as the clunkier village derivatives. (From the late 16th century, the city of Ushak was among the largest producers of commercial carpets.)
In contrast, the flat diamond of the Memling gul, with its concentric colors and stepped and hooked edges, remained true to its nomadic origins. It echoes motifs a world away -- in Navajo and Peruvian textiles, for example. 
Other forces, within and outside the textile arts, shaped the development of Anatolian carpets: Ottoman bookbinding and illumination, white-ground Iznik tile and, in the late 16th century, the carpet styles initiated by the Ottoman court, known for its use of complex arabesques and a repertory of Turkish garden flowers like roses, hyacinths, carnations and tulips. One can see the spiky oval lattices become supple under the influence of court artists, inspired by Chinese silk or, in the case of a village pillow cover with soft flowers and a light background, perhaps by embroidered cotton. 
The show ends with an unusual display of Islamic prayer rugs, whose paired columns, often Corinthian, frame a pointed arched doorway that symbolizes the entrance to paradise. With a marvelous exercise of art historical analysis that centers on a prayer rug lent by the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- and is fully explicated in the catalog -- Mr. Denny suggests that this architectural motif can be traced to the coupled columns of the Alhambra in Spain. It reached Anatolia by way of Torah covers belonging to Sephardic Jews fleeing the Inquisition. The highlighting of nearly identical Jewish Torah covers and Islamic prayer rugs speaks of a cultural reciprocity and coexistence that has become too scarce. 
Mr. Denny lets the village weavers have the final say, in prayer rugs where the pointed arches shrink, leaving more room at the top for an expanding field of floral motifs that in one case seems to descend into the composition like a theater curtain. Whenever the villagers get their hands on an idea, things really get interesting. Artistic growth, portrayed so vitally in this exhibition, proceeds in the mutually beneficial exchanges between tradition and originality, perfection and error; between relentlessly trained and monitored court artisans and illiterate village women who learned the rudiments of weaving at the sides of their female relatives. Once they attained weaving's technical threshold, Mr. Denny notes, the artistic path was wide open.

HEADLINE: Rise in Euro Raises Fears Of a Brake On Recovery 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The euro, which last week had its first anniversary in the pockets and billfolds of Europeans, has risen smartly against the United States dollar in the last two months, pleasing the currency's guardians but fueling worries that this increase in value may hamper an economic recovery.
 The currency, which circulates in 12 European countries, briefly touched a rate of $1.05 in trading this morning before receding slightly and then settling in New York late yesterday afternoon at $1.0487. It has gained 21 percent in value against the dollar since January 2002, and 6.5 percent in the last three months. 
 The climb of the euro has cheered the European Central Bank, which still remembers its introduction as a "virtual currency" in 1999 -- three years before notes and coins were issued, and used in the interim only for financial transactions. The bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, said today that the stronger euro would help curb inflation in Europe by reducing the price of imports. 
"I welcome the recent appreciation of the euro," Mr. Duisenberg said at a news conference after the central bank's monthly meeting. He said he did not know whether it was now appropriately valued.
He does know that the reversal in fortune has less to do with the power of the euro than with the weakness of the dollar, which has been hurt by fears of the economic drain from an American-led war on Iraq.
Some economists worry that as the stronger euro makes European products more expensive overseas, sales of exports like German cars, Italian clothing and French wine will suffer. A decline in exports would rob Europe of one of the few beacons on its otherwise dreary economic landscape.
"From Germany's standpoint, a strong euro has a negative effect on the economy," said Michael Schubert, a senior economist who specializes in the currency at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
Some leading German exporters are already feeling the pinch. The sports car maker Porsche said its sales in the United States and Canada tumbled 22 percent in December. It attributed the decline to "uncertain economic prospects in the U.S. and lower consumer confidence."
Exports are the only sector of some significance that is still growing in Germany's sputtering economy. They rose by 2.4 percent in October, the latest month for which figures are available, compared with an overall growth rate of less than 0.5 percent.
The president of the German central bank, Ernst Welteke, spoke of the vulnerability of the country's exports in a television interview here. "In the long run," he said, "the strong euro may weigh on international competitiveness."
Mr. Welteke said he did not see any evidence yet that the euro was harming German products. He noted that Germany had record exports in recent years, despite the ups and downs of currency values.
The stronger euro, economists say, also largely erases the effects of a loosening in monetary policy. The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point in December, responding -- belatedly, in the view of some critics -- to evidence that the recovery was faltering on the Continent.
Today, the bank left the rate unchanged, at 2.75 percent. But if the euro were to keep climbing, analysts said the bank might feel pressure to reduce rates again -- if not next month, then by March.
"You have to acknowledge there is a fundamental trend," said Cesar Molinas, the chief European bond strategist at Merrill Lynch in London. "If the euro continues to appreciate, it puts a lot of pressure on banks." 
Mr. Duisenberg described the exchange rate as "one of our important indicators, which we take into account when taking the overall decision." But he did not signal that the strong euro was yet an issue in the bank's view.
Like many others, the bank is pessimistic about Europe's economic prospects. It foresees a sluggish recovery this year, overshadowed by concerns on Iraq and related geopolitical tensions.
Germany offered fresh evidence of its troubles today. The federal labor office reported that the number of people without jobs increased by 200,000 in December, to 4.2 million. Economists estimate that unemployment will reach a peak of 4.5 million next month, as winter chills the job market.
With such weakness in Germany, Europe's largest economy, analysts are reluctant to predict a long-term rally in the euro. Most expect a temporary additional rise, ranging from 2 percent to 6 percent, in the next couple of months, as the preparations for military action against Iraq gather pace.
If a war were to be fought successfully and to end quickly, Mr. Schubert said, the dollar could stage a powerful "relief rally."
"Our assumption is that there will be a benign war, with no big consequences for growth or global markets," he said. "You can question that, of course. But we have to make an assumption."

HEADLINE: Fearing Liability, Law Firms Change Partnership Status 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Two of New York's most prominent law firms have quietly converted to a type of partnership that shields members from personal liability if the firms collapse under devastating lawsuits by clients or investors. Several other large firms are weighing similar steps.
 The moves by Sullivan & Cromwell and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, reported yesterday in The New York Law Journal, come in the wake of widespread corporate fraud at several public companies last year and a rising number of shareholder lawsuits, some aimed at law firms that had advised the companies. 
 Becoming a limited liability partnership, or L.L.P., is simply a smart business move, lawyers said, pointing out that partners at the accounting firm Arthur Andersen -- which was such a partnership -- would have been far worse off if their homes and cars had been vulnerable to Enron investors seeking to recover billions. 
"It seems like a prudent thing to consider in light of all the litigation against professionals that has been going on in the last several years," said Robert D. Joffe, managing partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, which is a general partnership. He said his firm's partners were considering conversion, too.
Partners at Shearman & Sterling, another large New York firm, are also considering it, said Kenneth J. Laverriere, a Shearman partner. "I expect that we will decide to convert," he said.
Lawyers at large firms said they did not anticipate a wave of successful shareholder lawsuits and noted that in most cases such suits were settled. The size of settlements might even fall, some lawyers said, because plaintiffs would realize there was less money available. Plaintiffs would be limited to the firm's assets -- operating capital, leases, furniture, computers and other office supplies. 
"We were obviously aware of the current business climate, but we have considered doing this for many years," said Alfred D. Youngwood, a partner at Paul, Weiss. The firm's partners decided to convert now, he said, after determining that the move would not adversely affect the firm's image, its client relationships or its internal workings and culture.
Each state has its own laws on limited liability partnerships; before 1994, when New York adopted its law, it was not possible for law firms to use the structure. Lawyers -- like accountants, doctors and some consultants -- usually belonged to general partnerships. 
Each partner's personal assets are at risk if a general partnership fails, said Jennifer H. Arlen, a law professor at New York University. If one partner commits fraud, for example, and resulting litigation bankrupts the firm, claimants can pursue the personal wealth of all partners, she said.
"The benefit of the L.L.P. is that if a law firm gets hit with sufficient liability to bankrupt it, then the partners of an L.L.P. are probably not personally liable for the debts of the partnership," she said. Of course, she added, partners who commit fraud may still be personally liable.
How much protection L.L.P. status provides has not been extensively tested, and lawyers are anxiously monitoring the progress of shareholder suits against Vinson & Elkins, an L.L.P. that is a defendant in Enron shareholder litigation. But L.L.P.'s do not afford as much protection as do publicly held companies, Professor Arlen said. (Law firms cannot be publicly held; if they were, lawyers would face potential conflicts of interest in serving both shareholders and clients.)
Despite the apparent advantages of L.L.P. status, the weight of tradition at law firms rests on the general partnership structure. There is a perception, several lawyers said, that firms' advice means more because all the partners ultimately put their own wealth behind it. 
But as more and more firms have converted to L.L.P.'s and clients have not abandoned them, that concern has eased, lawyers said.
"Clients don't seem to care," one senior partner said.
The percentage of law firms using limited liability partnerships has increased steadily over the last five years, to 25 percent from 20 percent, according to a survey of law firm economics by Altman Weil, a consulting company that advises law firms. The study, which drew on responses from a group of fewer than 500 firms, is not comprehensive.
Two trends are causing lawyers to worry more about liability, said William G. Johnston, a director at Hildebrandt International, a consulting firm. First, as share prices have increased, the size of potential damage awards in shareholder lawsuits has grown to the point that a firm could potentially be destroyed.
Second, as firms have grown, chances have increased that a partner may not know how reliable or ethical other partners are, and so will not want to risk being liable for their actions, he said. 
But lawyers at several large firms said they worried that becoming an L.L.P. could hamper their business in intangible ways. Lawyers who in a general partnership might have helped colleagues serving other clients might not do so in an L.L.P. to avoid taking on potential liability for the work, said one lawyer who insisted on anonymity.
At Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which converted to an L.L.P. several years ago, the partners decided to indemnify one another in such a situation, said Richard J. Davis, a partner at the firm. That way, he said, a partner who was not primarily involved in a transaction would still be willing to provide advice.
"We have had no problems, either with clients or internally," he said. "There was no reason not to do it."

HEADLINE: Deaths on the Job, Slaps on the Wrist 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW and LOWELL BERGMAN 

DATELINE: ELMIRA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
After all the search warrants, witness interviews and forensic tests, a team of veteran prosecutors and investigators came to an overwhelming conclusion about the death of Frank Wagner. The industrial explosion that killed him, they agreed, was the result of reckless criminal conduct by his employer, McWane Inc., the Alabama conglomerate that owns a cast-iron foundry here in upstate New York. 
 "The evidence compels us to act," the prosecution team wrote in a confidential memorandum to the state attorney general, Dennis C. Vacco, in 1996. The team urged him to ask a grand jury to indict McWane and its managers on manslaughter and other charges. A grand jury inquiry, senior investigators believed, could have taken them up the corporate ladder. 
 But Mr. Vacco never sought an indictment against McWane for any crime. Only after an unusual intervention by the United States attorney in Buffalo, who threatened federal charges, did McWane agree to plead guilty to a state felony and pay $500,000. But as the company and Mr. Wagner's widow are quick to note, that charge, a hazardous-waste violation, specifically did not hold McWane accountable for Mr. Wagner's death. 
Looking back in bitterness, many of the investigators view the devolution of the Wagner case as the result of a hardball campaign of political interference orchestrated by McWane, one of the world's largest makers of cast-iron sewer and water pipes.
"It was a reckless act on the part of certain individuals in that company that caused the death of that person. I'll believe that till the day I die," said Donald Snell, who supervised the state environmental agency's investigation. "The ends of justice were not met." 
Still, what is most remarkable about the two-and-a-half-year investigation of Mr. Wagner's death is that it happened at all. 
McWane is one of the most enduring violators of worker-safety and environmental laws, according to government records and regulators. In interviews, exasperated regulators who have tangled with the company use words like "lawless" and "renegade" to describe McWane. 
The responsibility for that record, though, is hardly McWane's alone. McWane has persisted largely unchecked by taking full advantage of a regulatory system that has often proven itself incapable of thwarting flagrant and continual safety and environmental violations by major corporations, according to a nine-month examination by The New York Times, the PBS television program "Frontline" and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program "The Fifth Estate."
In plant after plant, year after year, McWane workers have been maimed, burned, sickened and killed by the same safety and health failures. Flammable materials are mishandled; respirators are not provided; machines are missing safety guards; employees are not trained. The evidence spills forth from hundreds of regulatory files scattered in government offices around the country -- more than 400 safety violations and 450 environmental violations since 1995 alone. 
Yet regulators and law enforcement officials have never joined forces to piece this record together, never taken a coordinated approach to end patterns of transgression. Their responses, piecemeal and disjointed, bring into sharp relief weaknesses in government's ability to take on corporations with operations spread far and wide. 
"The current law is inadequate to deal with serious violators, repetitive violators, situations where people are put at risk day after day," said Charles N. Jeffress, who headed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the late 1990's. 
Nine workers have been killed in McWane plants since 1995. OSHA investigators concluded that three of those deaths resulted directly from McWane's deliberate violations of federal safety standards, records show. Safety lapses at least contributed to five other deaths, investigators found. 
Yet those deaths rarely received more than cursory attention from state and local law enforcement authorities. The police often did little more than photograph the body and call the coroner. Local district attorneys, if they were informed, generally deferred to OSHA. 
For its part, OSHA referred only one of the deaths to the Justice Department for possible federal prosecution. That case ended with a single misdemeanor plea; no executive was charged. 
Referrals are "considered a waste of time," said Patrick Tyson, an OSHA director in the Reagan administration. 
Indeed, under federal law, causing the death of a worker by willfully violating safety rules -- a misdemeanor with a six-month maximum prison term -- is a less serious crime than harassing a wild burro on federal lands, which is punishable by a year in prison.
A close look at McWane's recent history, and especially at the Wagner case and deaths in McWane plants in New Jersey, Texas and Alabama, illustrates how the company has been able to evade, beat back and often outlast government scrutiny. The examination was based on thousands of government and company documents and hundreds of interviews with current and former McWane employees, including senior managers, safety and environmental supervisors, personnel directors and production superintendents. 
McWane, current and former managers said, viewed the burden of regulatory fines as far less onerous than the cost of fully complying with safety and environmental rules. At the time of Mr. Wagner's death, company budget documents show, McWane calculated down to the penny per ton the cost of OSHA and environmental fines, along with raw materials. Since Mr. Wagner's death at the Kennedy Valve plant here, 85 miles southeast of Rochester, the company has paid less than $10 million in fines and penalties for its safety and environmental violations and three criminal convictions -- less than 1 percent of its annual revenues. 
In a written statement, the company's president, G. Ruffner Page, said it was company policy to obey the law. 
"In organizations made up of human beings we must deal with human errors that sometimes have tragic consequences," Mr. Page wrote. "In those situations where we have not been successful in preventing violations of our policies, we have taken concrete steps to prevent future occurrences, including management changes, increased focus on safety and the institution of more rigorous compliance programs." 
Mr. Page asserted that McWane "recently reached an agreement" with OSHA "to begin a cooperative effort to further improve safety." No such agreement exists. On Jan. 3, OSHA notified McWane that it did not qualify as an "OSHA partner" because the company had not yet shown sufficient commitment to workplace safety.
"Clearly they have a serious record with us, and we need to do something different," said the current OSHA administrator, John L. Henshaw. 
After Frank Wagner's death, the desperation of fellow workers found expression in a bumper sticker that began showing up on pickups in the parking lot of the plant on the edge of town: "Pray for me. I work at Kennedy Valve."

Foiling OSHA: The Forklift Case
Resistance starts the moment an inspector shows up at the gate, say managers and workers at McWane plants across the country and in Canada. Several senior managers said their plants followed a set procedure. 
Step 1, they said, was to stall the inspectors outside as alarms went out to supervisors to fix or cover up violations. Machines operating without required pollution controls would be shut down. Machines with obvious and irreparable safety defects would be hidden behind stacks of pallets. Chemical spills would be mopped up. Safety guards, often left off for weeks at a time, would be reattached. 
Clyde E. Dorn, former safety director at a plant in Anniston, Ala., said he simply lied. Once, he recalled, he withheld test results that showed workers were severely overexposed to silica, which can cause the lung disease silicosis. Robert S. Rester, a former plant manager in Birmingham, said his workers fooled environmental regulators by submitting samples from the city water supply. It was just that simple, he said. 
Mr. Page wrote, "To my knowledge, the company has never deliberately submitted false test results to any agency." 
In violation of OSHA rules, McWane managers have also altered workplace death scenes before investigators arrived, police and OSHA records show. 
One such case occurred at the Atlantic States foundry in Phillipsburg, N.J. Not only was a possible criminal investigation undermined, but the case also yielded a picture of persistent safety problems disregarded there and at other McWane plants. 
At 6 a.m. on March 24, 2000, an Atlantic States worker named Alfred E. Coxe was run over by a forklift. Patrol officers arrived within minutes, and as Mr. Coxe was being airlifted to a hospital, they set about preserving the scene. Using chalk, they marked the position of the forklift and tire marks, their reports show. Meanwhile, detectives from the county prosecutor's office and the Police Department were summoned, along with officials from the medical examiner's office and OSHA. The detectives arrived first, within two hours. 
The forklift was gone.
In their reports, the detectives said plant officials were evasive about its whereabouts. What is more, they wrote, plant workers had repeatedly run a street sweeper over the area, wiping away chalk marks and tire marks. Workers told a local newspaper reporter that supervisors had rushed to "clean up" before OSHA arrived. 
The detectives interviewed the driver, Juan F. De Los Santos Sr., who told them that the forklift brakes had failed when he tried to keep from hitting Mr. Coxe, according to police reports.
There was one more thing: the driver told detectives that "supervisors were aware of this problem and continued to allow him and other employees to use this forklift," records show. Only after finishing his statement was Mr. De Los Santos told that Mr. Coxe, a 47-year-old Vietnam veteran with a wife and son, had died of grievous internal wounds. Mr. De Los Santos put his head in his hands and began to cry. 
OSHA inspectors arrived four and a half hours after Mr. Coxe was struck. They asked plant managers to produce the forklift. It was brought from the maintenance area. Plant officials were asked if it had been tampered with. They said no, and a manager conducted a series of skid tests. "At full speed the front wheels, which are the only wheels with brakes, leave 12 1/2 feet of skid marks," the medical examiner, who witnessed the tests, noted in his report.
The tests seemed to put to rest any questions about the brakes. Later that day, an OSHA official told the local newspaper that the forklift appeared to be fine.
The county prosecutor, John Laky, decided not to pursue charges. "It troubled me that that forklift was removed before it could be inspected," he recalled in an interview. Still, he said, it was not clear that Mr. De Los Santos could have avoided Mr. Coxe even if the brakes had worked perfectly. 
But Mr. Laky acknowledges making his decision without knowing several things about the forklift, its driver and McWane. 
Contrary to the skid tests witnessed by OSHA, photographs and notes taken by the first officers at the scene neither showed nor described any skid marks from the front tires, the only ones with brakes. According to those records, the only tire marks at all were behind the rear tires, a discrepancy that remains unexplained. 
Mr. Laky said he had assumed that the marks were skids caused by applying brakes on the rear tires. He was shocked when told that the forklift's only brakes were on the front.
Mr. Laky was also unaware of persistent forklift problems at Atlantic States, a pattern that OSHA inspectors began to discover in the weeks after Mr. Coxe's death. 
The first clue came from another driver assigned to the forklift that struck Mr. Coxe. That driver told OSHA inspectors that it had been having brake problems for more than a month, that he had reported those problems and that nothing had been done. 
With a little more digging, OSHA inspectors found that defects reported by drivers were routinely ignored, in part because there was only one mechanic for 14 forklifts in 24-hour use. They also discovered that neither the mechanic nor the drivers were authorized to take forklifts out of service for safety defects. Only senior supervisors could do that, they found. 
There were problems with the drivers, too. Mr. De Los Santos was not certified to operate a forklift; the year before, he had struck his supervisor with a forklift, breaking the man's foot. What is more, managers had assigned at least six other uncertified workers to drive forklifts. 
McWane's corporate safety policies required that forklift drivers be trained and certified, and that forklifts with safety problems be pulled from service and repaired. But the same forklift problems that OSHA found at Atlantic States have also been discovered at other McWane plants. 
One forklift very nearly ran over an OSHA inspector at Union Foundry in Alabama, records show. During another visit there, inspectors found that brakes and horns "on most forklifts" were not working.
Union Foundry "cut back on their servicemen for the vehicles, and consequently there is not enough help to get all the repairs completed as needed," OSHA wrote. Employees had to keep running them "even when vehicles are reported with defects."
This particular inspection, which resulted in a $2,000 fine for the defective forklifts, was conducted one year before Mr. Coxe was killed at Atlantic States. 
Several weeks after Mr. Coxe's death, OSHA officials returned to inspect the foundry's forklifts. They examined forklift inspection sheets filled out each day by the drivers. The sheets indicated safety defects on all 14 machines -- including No. 24, the one that had killed Mr. Coxe. 
Its brakes were not working properly.
Mr. Page blamed "driver inattention" for Mr. Coxe's death and denied any effort to alter the scene "for the purpose of deceiving OSHA." He said the police had given plant workers permission to move the forklift. Several police officers involved in the case rejected this assertion, saying that even rookie officers know to preserve fatality scenes until detectives arrive. 
Without admitting any fault, McWane paid $10,500 to settle OSHA violations for operating unsafe forklifts at Atlantic States and failing to train drivers. 
In a prepared statement, Mr. Henshaw, the OSHA administrator, said his investigators "acted to the fullest extent possible" based on the available evidence. Because of a six-month statute of limitations on OSHA violations, he said, the agency cannot act now, he said.
But, he added, "if other law enforcement officials have reason to pursue questions about the case at this time, we would defer to their authority and cooperate fully."

Politics and an Exploding Oven
Jane Wagner saw the priest waiting at the hospital and understood at that precise moment that her husband was dead. "All our plans that we had, you know, hopes and dreams that we had, were just all gone," she said. "Just blew up. Literally blew up." 
Frank J. Wagner, 40, was operating an industrial oven at Kennedy Valve when it exploded just before 2 p.m. on Jan. 13, 1995. The oven's heavy steel door was blasted open, crushing Mr. Wagner against a pillar. 
Local authorities, the first on the scene, performed the barest of investigations. The police conducted no witness interviews, reports show. James T. Hayden, then the Chemung County district attorney, says he quickly determined there was no basis for homicide charges. "There was no way to know he would be at the wrong place at the wrong time," Mr. Hayden said. 
The case might have ended there, but OSHA investigators called criminal investigators at the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, who also brought in the state attorney general's office. They soon turned up a wealth of evidence never considered by Mr. Hayden. 
The oven exploded, they concluded, because it was being used to incinerate hundreds of gallons of old industrial paint. The paint was exceptionally volatile. The paint label said: "Warning! Flammable. Keep away from heat, sparks and flame." The oven's instruction manual warned that the oven should not be used for "anything that is easily ignitable." A plant engineer told investigators he had warned bosses "that burning flammable liquids in the oven was an absolute no-no." 
Yet senior plant managers had ordered workers, including Mr. Wagner, to do just that, instead of paying for proper disposal. "Burn in the incinerator," the plant manager wrote in a memorandum seized by investigators. As for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Mr. Wagner was under specific instructions to monitor a control panel by the oven door. 
Nor was this an isolated error. OSHA's civil inquiry found 85 safety violations, mostly serious or repeat offenses, including exposing workers to fire hazards. 
By late 1995, prosecutors had prepared draft indictments that proposed charging McWane and several executives with a string of felonies, including second-degree manslaughter, endangering public health and unlawful possession of hazardous waste, records show. "Even a child knows that you shouldn't put a bucket of gasoline in a fire," prosecutors wrote in one memorandum, summarizing the theory of their case. 
All they needed was for Mr. Vacco, New York's new Republican attorney general, to let them present the case to a grand jury. But as a newly obtained McWane legal document shows, McWane made it clear that Mr. Vacco would pay a steep political price for pursuing any indictment. 
In a memorandum to Mr. Vacco, the company's lawyers asserted that an indictment would send a message that contradicted his "business-friendly policy." They also warned that an indictment would bring Mr. Vacco "adverse press" and would mean the "possible closure" of Kennedy Valve, which provided 320 jobs in an "economically depressed area" that was part of Mr. Vacco's upstate political base. 
To help deliver the message, McWane enlisted John O'Mara, one of the state's most powerful Republicans and a man extraordinarily well positioned for the job. 
Mr. O'Mara, a former Chemung County district attorney, was an adviser not just to the Republican governor, George E. Pataki, but also to Mr. Vacco's political patron, Alfonse M. D'Amato, then a United States senator. Mr. O'Mara was chairman of Mr. D'Amato's judicial-screening panel and had been on the selection committee that recommended Mr. Vacco for his previous job, as the federal prosecutor in Buffalo. 
Records also show that, as attorney general, Mr. Vacco had hired Mr. O'Mara's daughter-in-law as a supervising assistant attorney general in Binghamton. 
While the career prosecutors dealt with one set of McWane lawyers, Mr. O'Mara opened secret discussions with Mr. Vacco's chief political aide, William M. Flynn, the first deputy attorney general, several officials involved in the case said. 
"You were walking into a buzz saw," said Ed Saslow, who supervised all criminal prosecutions in Mr. Vacco's office. "You had the D.A. and O'Mara saying, 'No case.' It was the wrong foot from the get-go."
Months went by without a decision from Mr. Vacco. "The more time that elapsed, the more we realized it was drying up and dying on the vine," said Mr. Snell, now retired. 
Mr. Flynn and Mr. O'Mara did not return telephone messages seeking comment. 
In a recent interview, Mr. Vacco acknowledged contacts between Mr. O'Mara and his office but denied having been improperly influenced. He said he had taken a personal interest in the case "to make sure that we did everything by the book." Any lack of action, he added, was not because of political interference but because of "foot dragging" by indecisive career prosecutors. "What happened here is that my assistants couldn't make a decision," he said. 
Prosecution records suggest otherwise. In a 1996 confidential memorandum summarizing their legal case and analyzing potential defenses, the prosecution team, supported by senior supervisors, strongly urged Mr. Vacco to seek an immediate indictment. 
An indictment for manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, they said, was "legally and practically justified." The company's economic threats, they said, were a "naked attempt at extortion." 
Still, Mr. Vacco demurred. 
Today, he acknowledges that he could have obtained an indictment for criminally negligent homicide. But he says he was not persuaded by what he called a "tenuous" prosecution theory. 
"Would there have been a conviction? I don't know," he said. "It would have been a titanic battle." 
As for McWane's economic threats, he said, "I don't think that a prosecutor should put his or her head in the sand when making these judgments." 
But investigators, prosecutors and Mrs. Wagner's lawyer were so upset that they quietly approached the United States attorney in Buffalo, Patrick Nemoyer, a Clinton appointee. Peter J. Ahearn, the Federal Bureau of Investigation chief in Buffalo, said his agents were struck by the strength of the evidence. "I mean it was right there on a silver platter to be done," he said. 
In January 1997, two years after Mr. Wagner's death, federal prosecutors convened the Kennedy Valve Task Force and issued their first grand-jury subpoenas. At the same time, OSHA inspectors were discovering evidence that Kennedy Valve was still dangerous. They found that the plant was running machinery against manufacturers' instructions, resulting in two explosions that burned several employees. 
Mr. Vacco was livid at the federal intrusion. In a contentious discussion, his aide, Mr. Flynn, persuaded the federal prosecutors to halt their investigation. McWane and the attorney general's office quickly began negotiating a plea bargain. 
"The corporation and their advocates didn't want to face federal charges," Mr. Snell said. "They had absolutely no control of the federal government. They apparently had a lot of confidence in facing the state and the attorney general's office."
McWane admitted no responsibility for Mr. Wagner's death. Instead, the company pleaded guilty to illegally possessing hazardous waste -- the obsolete paint -- and agreed to a $25,000 fine and $475,000 in contributions to various environmental programs and local organizations. The plant manager pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was ordered to pay $90 in court costs. 
"The death was not the result of any criminal misconduct on the part of anyone at Kennedy, but rather a terrible industrial accident," Mr. Page, McWane's president, said in a written response. 
Mr. Vacco announced the plea deal on the courthouse steps. "Not only does this plea agreement hold Kennedy Valve accountable for the wrongful death of its employee, but it also honors Frank Wagner's memory in a lasting and positive way," he said. 
Two weeks later, OSHA reported 35 more safety violations at Kennedy Valve. Mr. Vacco's chief environmental prosecutor, Andrew D. Goldsmith, resigned to join the Justice Department -- in part, colleagues said, because he was demoralized over his boss's handling of the Wagner case. 
After her long battle to have McWane held accountable for her husband's death, Jane Wagner says she felt worn down and defeated. "After a while," she said, "everybody gets tired of hearing about it, you know. It's like, 'Oh, isn't this over yet?' you know, and, 'Jane, you need to move on.' "

Looking to Punish
On June 29, 2000, a maintenance mechanic named Rolan Hoskin was crushed in a conveyor belt at Tyler Pipe in Tyler, Tex. His death was the result of several serious and preventable safety failures. 
There was no safety guard on the conveyor, though McWane had been cited many times for similar violations. Mr. Hoskin had also been trained to adjust the belt while it was moving, another violation for which McWane had been repeatedly fined. 
The history of the Tyler plant was a case study of a persistent violator, of fines assessed and paid without any discernable impact. Only nine months before Mr. Hoskin's death, OSHA had announced $169,500 in fines against Tyler Pipe for, among other things, putting employees' lives at risk by allowing them to work on and around unguarded and moving conveyor belts. OSHA officials had been particularly appalled by the case of Ira Cofer, a maintenance mechanic whose arm was torn apart in an unguarded conveyor belt.
Now, with Rolan Hoskin's death, federal officials resolved to punish McWane. 
As with Mr. Wagner in Elmira, local authorities in Tyler had no such interest. The police did not even notify the district attorney's office about Mr. Hoskin's death. 
One official in Texas was intensely interested, though -- Kathryn Delaney, the OSHA area director responsible for Tyler. She had long experience with Tyler Pipe. Union leaders admired her doggedness. Once, they recalled, she had threatened to open a field office across the street. Tyler Pipe's executives viewed her with utter contempt, several supervisors said. 
Although OSHA had already proposed civil fines of $1,015,000 in response to Mr. Hoskin's death, Ms. Delaney and other top agency officials took the rare step of referring the case to the Justice Department. 
Of some 200,000 workplace deaths since OSHA's creation in 1972, OSHA has referred just 151 cases to the Justice Department, records show. Federal prosecutors declined to act on more than half of those referrals; 11 people have been sentenced to prison. 
The Hoskin case made its way to William P. Sellers IV, virtually the only department lawyer dedicated to prosecuting workplace deaths. More than any prosecutor in the country, he has seen the formidable obstacles to winning even a misdemeanor conviction for causing an employee's death. 
To convict a company, prosecutors must prove that a death was caused by willful disregard of safety rules. As for prosecuting individual officials, appellate decisions have made it especially difficult. It is not enough to show that supervisors or middle managers knowingly put lives at risk. Prosecutors must prove that senior executives knew of a specific safety problem, understood the risk of death and ignored it. 
The essence of McWane's defense -- set forth in response to a civil suit brought by Mr. Hoskin's family -- was that senior executives were blameless, that Mr. Hoskin and perhaps low-level supervisors had failed to abide by corporate safety procedures.
Nonetheless, Mr. Sellers pressed on, with help from Ms. Delaney and federal prosecutors from Dallas. Their hope was to use other federal criminal laws with felony penalties, like lying to a federal officer, to prosecute McWane executives, a person involved in the investigation said. By last spring, the investigation appeared to be gathering momentum. Several years of medical records had been subpoenaed. Federal investigators began requesting interviews with supervisors. 
At a meeting last spring with the human resources manager and company lawyers, several supervisors were advised not to cooperate with investigators, one supervisor said in an interview. "He explained a lot to us about the Fifth Amendment," the supervisor said of the manager. By summer, a grand jury was hearing evidence against Tyler Pipe, according to Layne C. Lathram, a spokeswoman for OSHA. 
Then the case came to an abrupt end.
It happened in an unusual court hearing last July 19. In a brief session, a charge was filed, a plea was entered and a McWane subsidiary was sentenced for a single misdemeanor -- causing Mr. Hoskin's death by willfully violating federal safety rules. The company paid $250,000, half the maximum, and was placed on probation for a year. It will be subject to four random OSHA inspections. No executive was charged, nor was the name McWane uttered in open court. 
The sudden plea left a lot of people disappointed and confused. Some Tyler Pipe workers had seen in the federal investigation a ray of hope. Senior OSHA officials said they had been given no heads-up about the deal, even though Ms. Delaney and other OSHA compliance officers were deeply involved in the investigation. Nor was Mr. Hoskin's family consulted. 
The Justice Department refused to let Mr. Sellers speak to a reporter about the plea. 
But if the outcome suggests the system's limitations, it pays to consider what happened at another McWane plant less than two months after Mr. Hoskin's death.
On Aug. 22, 2000, at Union Foundry in Alabama, Reginald Elston, 27, an ex-Navy man with an infant daughter, was crushed to death while clearing debris from a conveyor belt. As in the Hoskin case, the safety guard had been removed. It was being used as a table for Cokes. The police closed the case in six days. 
When OSHA investigators arrived, they did not know about Mr. Hoskin's death, and Mr. Dorn, the safety director, was careful not to volunteer the information. "You don't tell OSHA, you know, more than they need to know," he said in an interview. 
OSHA's failure to quickly connect the two deaths -- it took at least several weeks, records show -- was understandable. There is no centralized rap sheet for corporations as complex as McWane, with its web of subsidiaries under different names. 
But even if they had a central file, OSHA inspectors have no authority to undertake a comprehensive investigation of a corporation with similar violations in several states, agency officials said. As a result, they said, patterns of misconduct often go undetected. Cooperation between OSHA and other regulatory agencies is all but nonexistent, because of incompatible computer systems and age-old bureaucratic resentments. 
As at Tyler Pipe, at Union Foundry a critical question was whether senior managers were aware that the safety guard had been removed. The company did not make it easy to answer that question. 
Shortly before Mr. Elston's death, Mr. Dorn said in the interview, a maintenance worker had identified the missing guard as a potential hazard in a handwritten note to his supervisors. Mr. Dorn said he discovered the note just as OSHA was concluding its investigation of Mr. Elston's death. Recognizing that the note could trigger a criminal prosecution, he said, he briefly considered handing it over to OSHA. Then he thought better of it. "I couldn't afford to be fired," Mr. Dorn explained. 
Mr. Page denied any company cover-up. "If Mr. Dorn concealed anything from investigators, he likewise concealed it from the company," he wrote. 
OSHA did not refer Mr. Elston's case to the Justice Department, though the agency investigators concluded that his death, like Mr. Hoskin's, was the result of deliberate indifference to safety rules. OSHA officials would not discuss their handling of the case. 
OSHA did, however, propose $181,200 in civil fines, later reduced to $147,700.

A Toothless Watchdog
Since OSHA's establishment by President Richard M. Nixon, workplace deaths have been cut in half, the agency says. How large a role OSHA has played in achieving this reduction, though, is the subject of considerable debate. 
The agency's charter is prevention, not punishment. But its critics -- and many inspectors -- have long complained that OSHA lacks the tools to change the conduct of major employers with egregious records. 
The agency does not do regular inspections of all workplaces; indeed, the rules sharply limit its access. Moreover, critics say the agency's fines are far too low, particularly given the lengthy appeals process. In its 32-year history, the fines have been increased just once, in 1990, when the maximum sanction for a single safety violation was increased to $70,000 from $10,000. 
OSHA can seek higher fines by citing multiple violations. But over three decades it has proposed civil fines exceeding $1 million against just 15 employers, OSHA officials said. 
"The real solution is they need to change the law," said Mr. Tyson, who ran the agency in the Reagan administration. "They need to make 'killing a worker' a felony."
Senior Justice Department officials have testified before Congress about the urgent need for increased criminal penalties for repeat violators. 
But the current OSHA chief, Mr. Henshaw, says he sees no such need. Existing laws, he said in an interview, are "fairly strong," and the rules governing fines give him flexibility to punish the worst violations. He declined to say if causing a worker's death by willfully ignoring safety rules should be upgraded to a felony. 
"My role is on the civil side," he said. 
The Bush administration has proposed a 1.7 percent cut in OSHA's budget for 2003. But Mr. Henshaw said he had adequate resources "to carry our strong, fair and effective enforcement." OSHA, he said, has increased inspections by cutting paperwork. Fines are up slightly, too, the agency said. 
Still, Mr. Henshaw acknowledged that despite more than 100 inspections, his agency had failed to protect McWane's employees. His plan, he said, is five more unannounced inspections in the next year. 
"They've got to change, and they indicate the willingness to work," he said. "But the proof's in the pudding. We will not put any more people in jeopardy."

Adding to a Grim Toll
Several weeks after that interview, on Oct. 29, a machine operator at Tyler Pipe was crushed between a truck and a metal bin. The worker, Guadalupe Garcia, 43, was nearly cut in half, his family said, and doctors had to squeeze bags of blood into him, more than 200 units. Both legs were amputated, and he is recovering.
On the day he was crushed, OSHA was in the midst of an inspection at Tyler Pipe. Ms. Delaney, the OSHA area director, declined to comment on the results but said, "Mr. Garcia's incident caused us to shift and expand the focus of what we are looking at." 
Mr. Garcia's injuries, though, touched off a new wave of despair among Tyler Pipe's employees. Employees once afraid to speak with reporters eagerly sought them out. "What more will it take?" one manager asked as Mr. Garcia lay in critical condition.
Indeed, several Tyler Pipe employees, who asked not to be identified for fear of being fired, said safety shortcomings had played a role in the accident. They said Mr. Garcia had been struck by an inexperienced driver backing up in a poorly lighted area. 
Mr. Page said that the lighting was adequate. "We do not know why Mr. Garcia was behind that truck," he wrote. "He had no work responsibilities in the area."
But Mr. Garcia's relatives say senior plant managers told them he was crushed as he hurried to hook the metal bin -- known as an on-off bed -- to the truck. "They thought what had happened was that he was trying to rush, trying to hook up the bed back to the truck and he was trying to rush back to his work station and didn't make it," his daughter said. 
Mr. Garcia, the relatives said, had repeatedly complained of production pressures; he was being asked to handle more tasks, take more risks, they said.
"What does a life mean to them?" asked Eloise Soriano, a family friend. "How can the management or the owners go to sleep at night knowing that a family's dad is in a hospital fighting for his life? That's all the family has. How can they sleep at night?"

HEADLINE: Inventories Rose in November 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Stocks on the shelves of wholesalers rose as expected in November, the Commerce Department reported today. 
 The agency said that wholesale inventories rose 0.2 percent in November after falling 0.5 percent in October. 
The increase was in line with expectations, but inventories were down 1.7 percent from November a year ago. 
 Still, the inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures how long it would take to deplete stocks at the current sales pace, declined to 1.21 months' worth from 1.22.
Sales at wholesalers increased 1.2 percent in November after being flat a month earlier. It was the biggest increase since April of last year.
Inventories of durable goods, items intended to last at least three years, increased 0.3 percent in November after declining 0.1 percent in October. But inventories were still down 3.4 percent from November a year ago.
In another report released today, the Labor Department said that first-time claims for state unemployment insurance benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 389,000 in the week ended Jan. 4, from a revised 408,000 the previous week. 
The decline was bigger than expected.
Analysts had forecast, on average, claims would inch down to 397,000. 
The decrease in claims brought down the four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, to 406,000 from 419,750 in the previous week, breaking a four-week pattern of gentle rises that began in early December. 
The number of people who continued to draw a week of benefits rose to 3.45 million in the week ended Dec. 28, the latest week for which data are available.

HEADLINE: Finally, Help for the Jobless 

 BODY:
It seemed to take forever, but this week Congress finally approved an extension of unemployment benefits that could help more than 2.5 million people weather the economic downturn -- while providing a direct and powerful stimulus to the economy as a whole. The measure was the first passed by the new Congress, as it should be, and helps redeem the sour finish of the last. 
 The 107th Congress, it will be recalled, failed to approve an extension of jobless benefits before adjourning in December, leaving high and dry an estimated 800,000 Americans who stopped receiving aid on Dec. 28 even though they had yet to exhaust their full benefits. The new bill, which President Bush has signed, would restore payments to those people (retroactive to Dec. 28) and also provide 13 weeks of benefits for an estimated 1.6 million people who are likely to join the ranks of the unemployed between now and the end of May. 
 The estimated cost of the measure is $7.2 billion, which is a pittance compared with the cost of the various economic packages now floating around Capitol Hill. For an extra $4.5 billion, Congress could also provide badly needed help to about a million "exhaustees" -- people who have already used up their federal benefits but are still without a job. That would be a worthy addition to any stimulus package.

Accounting Board Meets And Members Set Their Pay
Six months after it was created by Congress, the new board overseeing the accounting profession -- the centerpiece of reform legislation after a year of corporate scandal -- held its first formal meeting without a permanent chairman, a senior staff or a final budget.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
Skipping Ads? TV Gets Ready To Fight Back

BYLINE:  By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
A leading television producer and two major advertisers have joined forces to present a live variety show with no commercial interruptions. Instead, the advertising messages will be incorporated into the show.
 The advertisers, which so far include Pepsi and Nokia phones, are buying six hours of air time to create what the program's producer, Michael Davies, called "a contemporary, hip Ed Sullivan show" for the youth-oriented WB Network, part of AOL Time Warner. The hourlong program, to be broadcast for six weeks this summer, will try to highlight the companies' products in various ways, like putting singers on a set dominated by a logo or building comedy routines around a product. 
 The experiment reflects growing anxiety among many advertisers and network executives about the rise of personal video recorders, like TiVo's, which make it easy for viewers to skip commercials. Although the network commercial is far from extinct -- advertising spending increased for television in the last year -- many executives are concerned that a decline in the effectiveness of the 30-second commercial could rock the economic foundation of broadcast television, which depends on advertising as its main source of revenue. 
The show is already drawing wide attention in the television industry. The idea has been given credibility because Mr. Davies, a native of Britain, produced ABC's landmark "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," the program that started the reality television craze in the United States and changed the face of prime time.
The working title has been "Live From Tomorrow," but that is expected to change, perhaps to "Live From Right Now."
While the move is billed as a forward-looking response to a technological threat to the business, it actually harks back to television's earliest days, when a single sponsor bought a time period and presented a show, like the "Kraft Television Theater" or "The Philco Television Playhouse," and featured only its own products in its commercials. The roots go even deeper, all the way back to the beginning of soap operas, a genre that owes its name to the laundry detergents that began sponsoring them on radio. Early soap operas incorporated scenes that had characters do the washing while praising the product.
Networks eventually became troubled by the arrangement, partly because they wanted more control over the programming and partly because they expected to make more money by using 60-second commercials with multiple advertisers.
The quiz show scandals of the 1950's, which came about because sponsors manipulated the outcome of the games, reflected badly on the single-sponsor model and gave the networks the opportunity to seize back their time periods. Eventually, the standard commercial length became 30 seconds because networks could make more money that way.
In another throwback to an earlier television era, Mr. Davies said he intended to stage the show in New York and present it live. "I think in a way we're finding ourselves going back full circle to the 1950's," Mr. Davies said.
Final details have not been completed.
For example, deals must be struck with the local television network affiliates, which are allowed to sell a small percentage of a program's commercial time. WB executives say they believe that they can persuade the stations to place their commercials immediately before and after the show so it can be viewed without any interruptions.
The new show is likely to look like a combination of an HBO program -- running without interruptions -- with a series of fast-paced, entertainment-driven infomercials. Mr. Davies said the connections to the sponsors, never subtle or sneaky, would be clear through on-camera logos and frequent mentions of the companies and their products.
Mr. Davies said the program would be broadcast in June and July. 
The sponsors and Mr. Davies want to write a template of sorts for how future television shows can deal with the problem of viewers' using digital recorders by TiVo and its competitors to eliminate commercials.
The penetration of the digital recorders is slight thus far, at only about one million homes. But as satellite and cable companies and television-set manufacturers increasingly build such recorders directly into their equipment, the amount of viewing done through the devices is certain to grow.
Even now, with the penetration so small, many advertisers are looking for ways to go beyond the commercial. So far that has largely meant "product placement," inserting companies' products into the action of prime-time shows -- but often in clumsy ways. Some shows have made the incorporation of sponsors more overt, as on "The Best Damn Sports Show Period" on the Fox Sports Net cable channel. That show signed up Labatt to provide the beer on the show's bar set.
"Viewers hate it when they think you are trying to be deceptive with them, sneaking advertising into scenes," Mr. Davies said. "We're going to be completely open about it on our show and hopefully completely creative."
Among the possibilities he cited was a permanent Pepsi display behind every music performance on the show. He said the producers had also come up with suggestions like having some rap artists, like Method Man and Redman, go to the Nokia headquarters in Finland to take part in their internship program. "We could make a little three-minute funny film out of that," Mr. Davies said.
The show will have two main sponsors, Pepsi and Nokia, and four secondary sponsors, Mr. Davies said. Visa is likely to be one of these.
Mr. Davies added that the show could charge a movie company, for example, for an appearance by one of the stars of a new film. It could also charge for guest hosts. He explained, "The question will then become: Will we be bold enough to tell a movie company that we're advertising your movie on our show so you have to pay for it?" 
The show is a partnership between Mr. Davies's company, Diplomatic Productions, and the two main sponsors. They will have to buy the six hours of time from WB at a cost of $600,000 to $1 million an hour, and they will pay all production costs.
"We're not going to make a great deal of money this summer," Mr. Davies said. "But if we hit, we could really build into something in the future." As with all television shows, this one's success will be determined by the ratings it draws and, almost as important in this case, the amount of attention it generates for its groundbreaking format.
James Twitchell, a professor of English and advertising at the University of Florida and the author of several books on the history of advertising, said of the move, "It's about time." He said advertisers had to respond to the ways technology had changed viewing habits, beginning with the remote control. "That was the cross against the vampire of advertising," he said.
But he noted that advertisers were also responding by trying to make their commercials more entertaining. "Advertising is becoming art," he said. "You don't need it, but it's fun to look at."
A leading advertising executive, Donny Deutsch, the chairman of Deutsch Advertising, said: "The 30-second commercial is not doomed, certainly not in our lifetimes. Somebody is going to pay for TV. But advertisers have to be more and more creative, whether with product placement or something like they're doing with this show."

HEADLINE: Shortened Workweek Shortens French Tempers 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Ahhh, to be French!
 Marielle Saulnier, a 34-year-old radiotherapy nurse, took 10 days off to ski in the French Alps over Easter, and three weeks to vacation in Corsica during August. She took another week off in October to visit museums and parks with her children during their mid-autumn school break, and 18 more days, sprinkled throughout last year, just to relax. 
 She still has 35 free days saved up from past years and will take 8 of them this month before starting again the annual cycle of vacations -- 58 days, in all, not including weekends.
But is she happy? 
"Not entirely," she said with a sigh, "because I'm tired."
Like many workers in what some European neighbors consider a mollycoddled land, Ms. Saulnier complains that the country's 35-hour workweek, adopted in January 2000, is making her work too hard.
The law, conceived at a time when the national unemployment rate was nearing 13 percent and French pessimism was at a peak, was supposed to usher in a utopian era of greater leisure and more jobs. But many workers complain that it has not led to enough hiring and has instead squeezed the same amount of work into fewer hours.
"If you cut the hours without increasing the work force, everybody has to work harder," said Jean-Paul Rouillac, a postal worker and union official, sipping a coffee beneath a poster of Che Guevara at a local union office across town.
To some extent, the logic behind the 35-hour week has been vindicated. Unemployment has dropped to 9 percent since the law went into effect, and the government, which has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to subsidize new jobs, claims some of that reduction is because of the shortened workweek.
The greater flexibility has also helped streamline French industry and might be one factor for France's better economic performance compared with that of many of its neighbors in recent years.
But Laure Maillard, an economist with CDC IXIS, a financial firm, argues that the short-term employment and productivity gains will be overtaken by a longer-term drag on corporate profits and government revenues.
"I think it could hurt French competitiveness," she said.
It is already causing problems. Lawyers, for example, say that some of their some of their high-salaried associates are demanding enforcement of the 35-hour rule, and application of the law has been frozen for hotel and restaurant workers because those businesses cannot afford to keep bankers' hours or hire more people.
It is doubtful the 35-hour week will be repealed any time soon, however, and the reason has more to do with sociology than with economics. The French already work less than people in most other developed countries -- on average, nearly 300 fewer hours a year than Americans, according to one study -- and they like it that way.
"I'd rather have a better quality of life than touch a little more money," said Jean-Marie Gastou, 39, a Federal Express deliveryman.
France, the richest country in Europe during the 18th century, was slow to industrialize, and so it preserved a provincial pace while many of its neighbors, notably Germany and Britain, beavered ahead. In the 19th century, Marxist influences helped define work as a means to achieve leisure rather than an end, as it was to many Americans.
Some French were even taught that ambition could make them ill, said Theodore Zeldin, a British sociologist and keen observer of French society. Karl Marx's French son-in-law, Paul Lafargue, wrote a political tract entitled "The Right to Idleness," which argued for a three-hour workday.
"It fits in with a French idea of what life is about -- the enjoyment of one's senses and the company of others, sitting in the cafe watching people go by," said Mr. Zeldin, who nevertheless cautions against facile characterizations that ignore the country's many entrepreneurial personalities.
A sense of immobility in the traditionally class-conscious society also saps many people here of the get-ahead ambition that drives their counterparts in the United States. The country's exam-heavy education system sets career paths early and there is little flexibility for changes later on.
"We've never believed in the American Dream," said the nurse, Ms. Saulnier, relaxing in a lounge of the sprawling 19th-century hospital where she works. She says it's obvious that there aren't enough jobs or resources to allow everyone to move up, "and the French understand that."
Instead, the French prefer to keep work in perspective, giving them what many people see as a healthier balance to their lives.
Ms. Saulnier says she's content with her 860-square-foot, rent-subsidized Paris apartment, for which she and her common-law husband pay about $600 a month. She considers her $20,000 annual salary adequate and even better than that of many of her peers.
"My life doesn't turn around money," she said. "I'm more interested in having more time to do what I want."
Part of the reason for the relaxed attitude is that the government gives citizens free health care and education, inexpensive and reliable child care when they are working and hefty unemployment payments when they are not. There are subsidies for all sorts of things, including housing and schoolbooks. Parents get a monthly stipend of about $60 per child simply for being parents.
Some other European countries rival France in its leisure ethic, its taxes and the generous social benefits, but none have yet enshrined such an abbreviated working time into law.
Valerie Arnaud, a marketing executive at a financial services firm, says that most people in positions of responsibility realize it is not possible to adhere to a 35-hour week. Still, thanks to the law, she gets 22 extra days of vacation each year -- the maximum allowable.
The added vacation days permit many people to start their weekends on Thursday or end them on Tuesday. Working mothers now often take off Wednesdays when many French children are not in school.
Ms. Saulnier, who now goes home a little more than an hour earlier every day, receives 20 more vacation days a year than she did before.
But falling profits and budget cuts have prevented hiring at many companies and institutions, such as her hospital. The result is a rising murmur of complaints that the shortened work year has made life more stressful for many people.
Ms. Saulnier says she has to work harder to finish her job before quitting time -- theoretically 2:36 p.m. under the new rules -- and complains that if she runs late, her work eats into her personal time.
"From outside, it looks great, but because we're short of staff it isn't great," she said, adding that during the afternoon, her ward should have seven nurses but there are rarely more than four.
Workers complain that the tighter schedule has made people stingier with their time. Some stores, for example, now close half an hour early so that workers can leave promptly at the official closing time.
"Back in the old days, things were friendlier and we didn't watch the clock so much," said Serge de Matos, 34, a crew-cut night orderly, stuffing union flyers into envelopes at the hospital's union office.
Mr. de Matos, says he spends the extra free time sleeping because he's busier at work now.
"I'm more tired than I was before," he says.

HEADLINE: Homeless Out-of-Towners Welcome; 
Families Rely on City's Vast Shelter System for a Place to Live

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Ramon Almestica came from Puerto Rico seeking a better standard of living. Rosland Jackson fled an abusive boyfriend in North Carolina who had tried to abduct her youngest child. Jacqueline Garcia and her family were evicted from their apartment in Miami while vacationing in New York and have been here ever since.
 All three are or have been residents of the city's homeless shelters. 
 New York has always been a Mecca to out-of-towners dreaming of bettering their lot. Some scrub dishes in restaurants, others audition at theaters or fill its schools. And as it turns out, there is a sizable number who seek to improve their lives through the city's vast and fast-expanding shelter system. 
In October, the most recent month for which data were available, 10 percent of those seeking assistance at the Emergency Assistance Unit, the city's primary intake office for homeless families, reported that they spent the previous night outside the five boroughs; historically, the monthly average, which fluctuates, has been closer to 5 to 6 percent, city data show.
Of the 16,628 families that applied for shelter in the first 10 months of 2002, 2,681, or 16.1 percent, resided outside the city a month earlier, according to an average of city figures. (The city does not ask homeless individuals to report where they were last housed.)
Behind the statistics lies a debate that has long caused rifts in other cities, like San Francisco and Santa Monica, Calif., that have generous policies toward the homeless: are the families truly in need, or are they using an already overburdened system as a taxpayer-financed relocation service?
The Department of Homeless Services investigates each family to evaluate whether it is truly homeless or whether there might be relatives who can offer shelter. Some homeless families readily admit that they sought help from the city, through the Emergency Assistance Unit office in the Bronx, after friends and relatives said they had found decent apartments with the help of the unit's caseworkers.
But advocates for the homeless say that for the most part, families are not exploiting the city's homeless policy, but they come to live with relatives or for economic opportunities and end up in the shelters when things do not turn out as expected.
"They come for the same reason immigrants have always come: they think the streets are paved with gold," says Beverly Cheuvront, a spokeswoman for the Partnership for the Homeless, a nonprofit advocacy group. "And they are completely unprepared to deal with the realities of our housing market and our current economic situation."
New York is the only city under court order to provide shelter immediately to any people who can prove they need it, regardless of their origin or immigration status. As a result, it has perhaps the most tolerant admissions policies and greatest array of services and housing to offer its homeless clients. While that has raised some concern that the city could become a magnet for the poor, city officials remain sanguine.
"We are a city of immigrants, and the fact that the homeless system reflects that diversity is not surprising," said Linda I. Gibbs, the commissioner of the Department of Homeless Services. "Our focus is to ensure that people who have lost their homes here have access to housing but to make it clear that the E.A.U. is not to provide relocation services."
Certainly, New York is not the only city to shoulder the burden of the destitute from outside its borders. More than half of the people in the shelter systems in Spokane, Wash., and Minneapolis come from out of town, most frequently from surrounding rural counties where there are no equivalent services for the homeless, according to Dennis Culhane, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who does research on shelter systems nationwide.
Other cities, like Philadelphia, demand that shelter seekers prove they have been city residents for at least six months. Mr. Culhane and other academic researchers who have studied New York's shelter system say their own research from previous years shows that an average of about 4 percent of the families seeking shelter say they have spent the previous night out of the city, a figure considerably lower than the 10 percent reported by the city this month. Mr. Culhane said he was not surprised by the rise but could not explain it without further study.
Others were more skeptical. Marybeth Shinn, a professor of psychology at New York University who studies homeless families, said focusing on where the city's homeless came from was a red herring that distracted from real problems, most important a lack of affordable housing.
"Politicians have frequently put out a Greyhound theory that problems have been dumped on us," Professor Shinn said. "All around the country, homeless populations are for the most part homegrown." 
Ramon Almestica, his dark eyes peering out of his black down hood, says simply that he came here "to make a better life." Mr. Almestica grew up in New York, but left at age 12 to live in Puerto Rico with relatives. He said he returned because he was not making much of a living as a carpenter. 
Mr. Almestica, his wife and their 6-year-old daughter had been living with his mother-in-law, but he said he decided to seek help through the shelter system because his mother lives in a "nice place" in Brooklyn that she got through the Emergency Assistance Unit. He went to the unit, he said at its Bronx office, because she encouraged him to do the same.
Rosland Jackson came to the shelter system after moving out of the North Carolina home she and her three children shared with the father of her third child. He had become verbally and physically abusive, she said, and it got so bad one night when he was drunk that he threatened to kidnap the children. She responded by threatening him with a gun, she said.
Ms. Jackson, 36, said she tried to seek refuge at a shelter in North Carolina, but her batterer soon tracked her down and she decided to flee to New York. Ms. Jackson was raised here, but she had not lived in the city for 10 years. A friend who knew of her situation encouraged her to come here, and she went directly to the Emergency Assistance Unit after she arrived at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in February 2001.
Now she is housed in a two-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, and she says she is feeling much more secure. "The city is large," she said, "and it is easy to get lost."
While many homeless families come to New York knowing of the Emergency Assistance Unit, a larger percentage seem to hear about it after they get here. Jacqueline Garcia said she, her husband and their three children were visiting relatives in New York in February 2001 when her mother called from Miami to say that an eviction notice had been placed on the door of their two-bedroom apartment.
Her husband had recently been laid off from his job as a shipping and receiving clerk and they were having trouble making their $575-a-month rent, but even when he was working and earning $200 a week they were stretched, she said. "We had nothing to return to, so we decided to stay here," Ms. Garcia said. The family of five was living with relatives when she heard about the E.A.U. from her welfare caseworker.
Now settled in a federally subsidized three-bedroom apartment in the Bronx and with her husband working as an assistant manager at a Foot Locker shoe store, Ms. Garcia is glad she made the move. "I could never qualify for public housing in Miami," she said, saying her husband's salary disqualified her. "I love New York."

HEADLINE: YACHT RACING; 
New Zealand Cries Betrayal As Skipper Races for Swiss

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE with WARREN ST. JOHN 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand 

 BODY:
In the choppy green waters of Auckland Harbor, the Kodak moment from the 2000 America's Cup is of Russell Coutts holding aloft the Auld Mug trophy, smiling through sea-chapped lips. Thousands of his countrymen lined the docks of the Viaduct Basin that day, roaring for their skipper and his triumphant crew.
 But within weeks, the pixie-dust tale of the home-grown sailor who kept the Cup in New Zealand had turned sour. Coutts left his syndicate to accept a $5 million offer to become skipper of the Swiss boat Alinghi. In the process, he took half of Team New Zealand's crew with him -- and turned a nation against him. 
 Just ask Charles Stone, the Web site editor for BlackHeart, an alliance of zealous New Zealanders formed solely because of Coutts's defection. 
"I wouldn't even talk to the bloody traitor, unless he were asking for a ride to the airport," Stone said.
"We always had Dennis Conner to dislike for a long time, but Russell Coutts has taken that position over," said Simon Jolly, who helms a commercial yacht in Auckland harbor. "To be in New Zealand when that happened, many people feel he committed treason."
As Coutts readies his sleek and well-equipped yacht for the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger final on Jan. 11, he may be the most disliked Kiwi alive.
He needs five victories against the last remaining American boat, Oracle, to advance to the Cup finals in February against New Zealand -- a matchup that would be the equivalent of Walter O'Malley's bringing a team filled with former Brooklyn Dodgers back to New York to compete for a championship.
And if Alinghi wins the Cup, New Zealanders lose. They lose the world's oldest sporting trophy, an estimated $650 million in Cup-generated revenue, and, above all, a good measure of their sailing pride. 
Law-enforcement officials are now worried that if Coutts tries to raise the trophy in Auckland Harbor, the reaction could be vehement and the indelible image embarrassing to New Zealand.
Coutts defends his switch to Alinghi by saying he had achieved all his goals as a sailor for New Zealand, and was ready for a new challenge. He also contends he achieved a great accomplishment for his home country by defending the Cup three years ago, and had earned the right to move on.
Some Kiwis agree. But many, especially in the yachting community, retain a deep enmity represented by a billboard near the harbor sponsored by BlackHeart that regularly changes its anti-Alinghi message. A sampling: "Coutts and Co. -- Swiss bankers since 2000," and "High on a hill lived a lonely boatman -- yodelei, yodelei, yodelei-e-hoo."
 The anti-Coutts crusade took an ugly turn in early January when the Alinghi syndicate said it had received anonymous letters threatening the children and family of team members. The Auckland police are investigating the letters.
 "I am horrified by the tone in these letters, as I am sure most New Zealanders will be," said Michel Bonnefous, Alinghi's executive director. "As a team we are committed to winning on the water, and we look forward to the next round of sailing, but we will be cooperating fully with police to track down and bring the perpetrators to justice. We came here, in New Zealand, to sail, not to have our children threatened."
 Coutts wrote a letter to The Daily Telegraph, saying, "We will go racing mindful of the menacing letters that some Alinghi team members received threatening violence to our families' property and base." 
The venom belies a country known for its live-and-let-live demeanor. Kiwis offer their homes to backpacking strangers for the night, and hitchhiking along sheep-strewn roads is still one of the safest modes of transportation.
But to understand the venom, one needs to understand the passion for sailing in New Zealand and the unique geography of a two-island nation where the coastline is longer than the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of the United States combined. One in 10 Kiwis owns a sailboat.

The National Pastime
After Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to scale Mount Everest, New Zealand's greatest hero was Sir Peter Blake, the yachtsman who led the successful challenge in 1995 against Conner in San Diego and organized the defense in 2000.
Children begin sailing at age 6 and younger. At its core in New Zealand, sailing has none of the elitist qualities that come with the American perception of the sport. Regardless of a family's income, a rusted boat for a few hundred dollars can be salvaged and repainted for competition. Coutts was a product of that system, and Kiwis take great pride in the fact that they pay for their Cup challenges through merchandising and donations, not tycoons.
When billionaire backers of other syndicates -- Ernesto Bertarelli of Alinghi, Larry Ellison of San Francisco-based Oracle and Craig McCaw and Paul Allen of Seattle's OneWorld -- began to recruit New Zealanders for their crews, many Kiwis felt the lifeblood of the nation's sport was siphoned away.
"New Zealand had big plans for what the America's Cup could become if it got rid of all of its negative connotations and became a great celebration of sailing," Stone said. "And we did that. But all it took was one major defection to start the ball rolling."
BlackHeart was founded by an Auckland advertising executive named Dave Walden. It is essentially an alliance of 3,000 sailing fanatics. It began as a way for New Zealanders to gather to express their anger. They have described themselves as like-minded, as staunch and as true New Zealand patriots. But they also add, "The time for action is upon us." 
"We've got to take a lesson from the Aussies and get a bit of the mongrel in us," Walden said in a recent interview with an Australian newspaper. "New Zealanders have a lovely nature, but at times we are a bit too bloody soft."
The scorn over being dumped for another team or another city is a universal fan reaction. Yet the anger directed toward Coutts is not the same as for the former Knicks coach Pat Riley when he returns to Madison Square Garden after having left for the Miami Heat's millions. Irate fans eventually got over the hurt and were happy simply to root against him.
In New Zealand, the anger and feeling of betrayal have lingered and intensified, and people meet to organize protests, raising anti-Alinghi billboards and excoriating Coutts and his crew on the Internet. 
Coutts's rival skipper in the challenger finals, Chris Dickson of Oracle, is also a native Kiwi. But he was not part of Team New Zealand for the past two America's Cups, and did not lure away the best of New Zealand's sailors, as Coutts did. As such, he and other Kiwis who are competing for other countries have managed to stay clear of the vitriol reserved for Coutts and Brad Butterworth, the Alinghi tactician who was the first person Coutts lured away. 
In December, as Coutts stepped off a small dinghy onto the docks of Takapuna Wharf after a race, he was heckled for 15 minutes. In the earlier rounds, dozens of black-shirted Kiwis emblazoned with only the national emblem, a silver fern, and the word Loyal cheered wildly for the boats belonging to Coutts's rivals. In contrast, when Alinghi left the Viaduct Basin, they looked on in stone silence.
Bertarelli is so concerned for Coutts's safety if Alinghi captures the Cup that he has intimated to at least two team officials, who requested anonymity, that he wants to quickly shepherd Coutts and Butterworth from the yacht straight to the airport, possibly via helicopter.
"I find the whole thing quite surprising," he said. "People tend to forget what Russell has done for the country."
After Coutts and Butterworth helped win the Cup for New Zealand in 1995 and successfully defended it in 2000, they pledged their loyalty toward making another defense.
But Bertarelli's $5 million offer, along with a promise of more control, persuaded Coutts to leave. When he took Butterworth and others with him, it prompted a Kiwi sailing exodus. Twenty-one of the 64 sailors on the water in the Louis Vuitton semifinals were New Zealanders.
Beyond BlackHeart, radio hosts and news media commentators have fed the enmity within the general populace. When Coutts tossed a few nonchalant barbs his former team's way, the front page of The New Zealand Herald blared, "Coutts Savages Team New Zealand."
But some Aucklanders have a more balanced view of Coutts's decision. "I'd like to see one of the BlackHearts stand on the dock and say no to a $1 million check," Brad McCracken, a local bartender, said. "I don't think they would."

Reasons for Leaving
Coutts, who many yachting observers believe has become the most gifted and cunning skipper in sailing, said he is unaffected. His crewneck cotton shirts, bushy eyebrows, high cheekbones and thick brown hair make him look like an Eco-challenge competitor, fresh from his last adventure. 
At a local business association breakfast he was invited to in December, against the wishes of several members -- Coutts explained his reasoning. He said he had run his course in New Zealand sailing after having been a youth champion, an Olympic gold medalist and a skipper who had successfully challenged for and defended the Cup. He also did not avoid the money issue.
"Clearly, that was a consideration," he said. "But there was also an opportunity to have a great deal of control and vision of the team, including putting it together."
Coutts contends he has not noticed the snubs and the jeers. "I've never once had anyone say anything to me directly," he said in an interview in November. "Well, once, when I was flying back right after signing with Alinghi, a New Zealand guy came up to me on the plane and said, 'You've got cheek coming back.'
"I said: 'What's the matter? Haven't I done enough?' And that's pretty much how I feel now." 
Conner, the American sailing legend, is fond of saying the Cup is not worth money. But tell that to Kiwi tourism officials and they will point to the $650 million Team New Zealand's first defense brought to a stagnant economy looking for a boost. They expect an even bigger haul this time. If Coutts wins the final and the Cup goes to Europe for the first time in its 151-year history, so does the money the event generates.
Some New Zealanders extrapolate and conclude that Coutts's defection is putting people out of work. Others contend that Coutts and others -- including the OneWorld designer Laurie Davidson, Team New Zealand's former designer -- took intellectual property with them, Kiwi sailing secrets that will cause the demise of a cash cow.
"We're not going so far as to say the city dies if we lost the Cup," Stone said. "But it means more to this city than any other city in the world. My God, they'll auction off a part of the harbor, a huge piece of Auckland."
Bertarelli countered: "We are here for a sporting event and no one should forget that. We're not here to grow the Kiwi economy. If we were here to do that, then I'd be doing biotechnology here, not sailing. If you compete in a sporting event, you have to accept the possibility of losing."
 In early January, Stone dismissed the notion that BlackHeart helped create an environment that led to the threats. "We have been at pains to point out all along that our organization was formed to focus the anger in a lighthearted and humorous way, in order to prevent exactly an ill-disciplined or criminal scenario such as this," Stone wrote in an e-mail message. 
In the City of Sails, meanwhile, people line the docks daily, pounding their fists against their chests and cheering against the crew led by the man who wants to take the Auld Mug out of his homeland and bring it to Switzerland.
"Come on, Russell, we know the story," a recent BlackHeart newsletter said. "And it reads like Macbeth."

 CORRECTION:
A report in the F.Y.I. column of this section on Dec. 15, 2002, about the America's Cup, credited it erroneously with a precedent. It is the world's oldest sailing trophy, first awarded in 1851, but not ''the oldest trophy in sport.'' The Scorton Silver Arrow is considered the oldest, awarded annually in an English archery tournament since 1673. (The error also occurred in sports articles on Jan. 10, 2003; Dec. 22, 2002; May 10, 1992; Dec. 25, 1983; Sept. 27, 1983; Sept. 25, 1983; June 12, 1983; and Jan. 16, 1983; as well as editorials on May 19, 1992, and Jan. 21, 1987; also a Travel article on Sept. 4, 1983, and the Saturday News Quiz on June 18, 1983.)

HEADLINE: Analysts Predict Harsh Cuts Despite Pataki's Optimism 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
A day after Gov. George E. Pataki gave a speech to the State Legislature expressing optimism in the face of a bleak fiscal landscape, many here and elsewhere today asked not whether his budget would hurt ordinary taxpayers, but how much.
 By any interpretation, the governor's speech on Wednesday laid the groundwork for spending reductions that will affect people in all corners of the state. 
 Fiscal conservatives welcomed some of them, saying they are necessary to rein in excessive and even luxurious spending built up in the economic boom of the past six years. But Democrats and Republicans agree the cuts will not come without pain. 
Mr. Pataki only spoke in broad strokes about his plan for grappling with a multibillion-dollar budget gap. The precise line-by-line details will not come to light until he presents his executive spending plan on Jan. 29, so most of the prognosticating today was an analysis of his 55-minute address.
The parameters the governor laid out suggest two main themes: cuts in core state services and a reluctance to raise taxes. That translates into austere times the likes of which state residents have not seen in at least eight years, budget analysts and others said.
Health and hospital professionals could see cuts, and their patients will likely feel some. Educators and students could, too. Those who run social programs, and those who benefit from them, are probably not exempt. Unions may be asked to help. City residents, rural residents and suburbanites, too, may feel a sting.
"Everything will be hit," said E. J. McMahon, an analyst with the conservative Manhattan Institute. "I don't think there is any question of that."
The pain will linger even if the economy recovers, especially if Mr. Pataki gets legislative approval to borrow $4 billion against payments from tobacco companies to help fill the current hole, incurring more long-term debt, some said.
"It's a one-shot; it is the mother of all one-shots," former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat who Mr. Pataki defeated in 1994, said today of the borrowing idea.
But many noted that Mr. Pataki, the three-term Republican governor who made so many promises to spend on expensive social programs during his re-election campaign last fall, cannot possibly satisfy them all. State revenues are running $2 billion behind expectation this fiscal year, and next year a gap of at least $8 billion is projected.
"This is going to be slash and burn," a senior Republican legislative aide predicted.
Mr. Pataki made repeated references in his speech to opposing new taxes and, in fact, he vowed to go ahead with $200 million in tax cuts scheduled to take effect this year. He also said he would call for new tax incentives to attract high-tech industry to the state.
Mr. Pataki's Republican allies cheered the notion. Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, said Mr. Pataki deserved time to draw up his budget documents and defended him if anyone perceived a dearth of details.
His Democratic opponents, led by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, said they were puzzled by the governor's lack of specifics. Meanwhile, they said, they are advocating their own plan, a mix of spending reductions, some borrowing and new revenues to spread the pain.
The state's Public Employees Federation, which represents 55,000 white-collar state employees, wants the state to avoid deep cuts in services and jobs by increasing revenues through a two-year surcharge of under 1 percent on the portion of a resident's income that exceeds $100,000. It also wants the governor to rethink any opposition to tax increases.
"Deep job cuts in the state work force will hurt both the public employees who are already understaffed and will hurt the citizens who are dependent on those services," said Denyce Duncan Lacy, a spokeswoman for the union.
Robert A. Kurtter, a senior vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service, a Wall Street bond rating agency, said the cuts would likely fall in areas that account for the bulk of state spending: education, health care and corrections.
Beyond that, he said: "There are one-shots and gimmicks and the deficit bond that the governor has already proposed. And we haven't seen the budget proposal, so we don't know what combination it will be and how it will all work out. It will be painful and require legislators to make some very difficult decisions."

HEADLINE: Bush Offers a Break if Companies Pay Taxes 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
ONCE upon a time, the corporate income tax produced nearly a quarter of the federal government's revenue. Over the years it was whittled away. Rates came down and companies found a host of ways, some authorized by Congress and some involving clever ways around the law, to avoid the tax.
 By the boom of the late 1990's, corporate income tax receipts, whether measured as a percentage of government revenue or as a portion of the national economy, had declined by roughly half from their level in the 1960's boom. 
 But now, President Bush has proposed a plan that might lead to a revival of the corporate income tax. That may not have been his intent, but it could be one result of a move to help shareholders.
The Bush plan gives tax breaks to owners of companies that pay taxes. The easiest way to measure that break is to calculate that shareholders will be allowed to receive $1.86 in tax-exempt income -- either dividends or capital gains -- for every dollar of corporate income taxes actually paid. (In fact, the benefits would be less, for many shares are owned by tax-exempt charities or tax-deferred pension plans that would not be able to use the benefits.)
The Bush plan was advertised as ending the double taxation of corporate dividends. The plan accomplishes that by exempting from taxation only dividends that come from profits on which corporate taxes were actually paid. Other dividends would still be taxed, so owners of companies that pay no taxes get no break. Owners of companies that pay taxes but not dividends would be able to report lower capital gains, and save taxes that way.
If the Bush plan were enacted, it would suddenly be easy to see just how much companies are paying in federal income taxes, since shareholders would receive benefits based on the payments. (Figuring that out from corporate annual reports is now all but impossible, and few make the effort.) Companies that did manage to avoid paying taxes would not be able to hand out the new benefits to their shareholders, who would presumably resent that and perhaps wonder what good the tax savings had done them.
Conceivably, that might make companies less eager to pay Wall Street for clever strategies to duck taxes, since cutting corporate taxes would have a cost for shareholders. And in some future Congress, when lawmakers sought ways to raise revenue, it would be easier to see which companies were not paying their fair share of taxes.
For this to work, it needs to be loophole-free. The 1992 Treasury Department study on which Mr. Bush's plan is modeled allowed no exceptions: A company's shareholders could benefit only to the extent that the company paid federal income taxes. The new proposal also allows credit for foreign income taxes, which may be reasonable but should not become a precedent for more exceptions when Congress gets down to details.
One can easily envision the line of corporate supplicants. They will say that surely the low-income housing credit, or the credit for qualified electric vehicles, or something else, is so important that shareholders of companies that use that credit should not suffer. Companies that reduce their federal tax burden through generous granting of stock options will not want to have that fact reflected, and will lobby for changes. It will be interesting to see whether corporate America lines up behind this plan, which offers a lot more benefits for shareholders than it does for corporate managers.
One can argue whether or not the government can afford the cost, or how much economic stimulus will come from this plan. But enactment of the Bush proposal to end double taxation of corporate profits could have the surprising benefit of making it more likely that such profits would be taxed the first time.

HEADLINE: Bush Names Veteran Anti-Communist to Latin America Post 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The White House announced today that President Bush will nominate Roger F. Noriega, the United States representative to the Organization of American States, to be assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, the most senior diplomat for Latin America.
 Mr. Noriega will replace Otto J. Reich, whose own nomination to be assistant secretary was blocked by Senate Democrats in 2001 and who served in the position under a temporary "recess appointment" that expired in November. 
 Though Mr. Reich's supporters had thought Mr. Bush would renominate him after the Republicans captured the Senate in November, their hopes were dashed when senior Republicans, including Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined Democrats in opposing him.
His opponents argued that Mr. Reich, a staunchly anti-Communist Cuban exile, botched relations with Venezuela and had taken too hard a line on Cuba. Mr. Reich, these critics said, also did not have the support of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. 
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, acknowledged the bipartisan opposition to Mr. Reich today in explaining why Mr. Bush had decided to pull him into the National Security Council, a position that does not require Senate approval. 
"The principal reason was because the president wanted his expertise here," Mr. Fleischer told reporters. "I never ruled out that there could have been other factors as well, and it's always important to gauge the inclinations of the Senate."
Mr. Noriega's nomination comes at a time when South America is in turmoil and the Bush administration is under fire for paying too little attention to the region.
Venezuela is in the 39th day of a general strike against President Hugo Chavez that has halted oil production, driving up gas prices in the United States; Argentina's economy has been shrinking, weakening much of its middle class; and Colombia is racked by a bloody civil war that shows few signs of abating.
Against that backdrop, some analysts said they hoped that if Mr. Noriega could gain quick Senate approval, the Bush administration could mount a more aggressive initiative to stabilize the region.
But it was unclear whether Mr. Noriega could win quick approval. Aides to Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who led the opposition to Mr. Reich, called his nomination "disappointing."
Like Mr. Reich, Mr. Noriega served in the State Department during the Reagan administration, helping forge fiercely anti-Communist policies toward Latin America.
"There are a number of individuals with a great deal more stature and strong bipartisan support who could do this very important job," Mr. Dodd's spokesman said.

HEADLINE: The Right Tax Plan for Today and Tomorrow 

BYLINE:  By Lawrence B. Lindsey; Lawrence B. Lindsey was chief economic adviser to President Bush from 2001 to 2002.

DATELINE: CLIFTON, Va. 

 BODY:
President Bush has proposed a set of tax reforms that will give a quick lift to the economy and make for long-term improvements in our tax system. Critics argue that the plan is merely an effort by the president to exhibit concern about the economy (and to avoid the fate of his father). Such charges are baseless. The president's bold plan reflects the ideas that have long been central to his tax policy.
 In December 1999, Mr. Bush, then a candidate, called both for sharp reductions in tax rates and for taking 6 million working families off the tax rolls by doubling the per-child tax credit and cutting the bottom rate of income taxation by one-third. He made clear his reasoning, saying that the economy might well need an insurance policy in the near future. At the time, conventional wisdom held that we were entering an era of unparalleled growth and perpetually rising stock prices. Six weeks later the Dow Jones industrial average began its decline; the Nasdaq followed suit in March and fell by nearly 60 percent in a year. Manufacturing employment began a steep plunge. 
 After the election, Mr. Bush held a meeting in Austin, Tex., with business leaders, which reinforced his conviction that steps had to be taken immediately to help revive the economy. The critics said he was talking the economy down and that his proposals were overly stimulative. Yet he passed the plan in record time, and it has been crucial in pulling us out of a recession. 
Now the critics are repeating many of the arguments they made before: the new package is too large, it makes the wrong changes and it disproportionately benefits the wealthy. All are off the mark.
Consider the size of the proposal. It would inject about 1 percent of the gross domestic product -- around $100 billion -- into the economy this year and next. After that, it would be roughly one-third of 1 percent of the domestic product over the rest of the next decade. 
This is prudent. The latest forecasts from leading economists show an unusually large spread in growth projections -- they range from between 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent for 2003. Thus the president's insurance policy analogy again seems apt. If the pessimists turn out to be right, the plan's injection of 1 percent of gross domestic product will help ensure that overall economic growth will not slow much below the current 3 percent rate and that unemployment will not rise further. If the optimists turn out to be right, the additional 1 percent growth will not prove to be too much -- there is enough unemployment and spare production capacity that even 4.5 percent growth wouldn't overheat things.
The form, as well as the size, of the package reflects the needs of an economy working to repair the financial wreckage of the 90's, when an irrationally exuberant stock market resulted in lower private savings and higher corporate debt. Repairing that damage will require sufficient growth in household incomes to allow families to continue their current spending habits and yet restore their bank balances. It will also require reforms to lay a more solid financial footing for long-term economic growth. The Bush proposal does all these things.
The tax cuts in lower brackets, the reduction of the marriage penalty, the changes in the alternative minimum tax and the $400 increase in the per-child tax credit comprise two-thirds of the package over the next two years. When combined with the aid to be given to small businesses and the unemployed, and the benefits to middle- and upper-middle-class Americans from changes in the way stock dividends are taxed, an additional $80 billion is likely to go to consumers in each of the next two years.
Second, ending the double taxation of dividends is crucial to long-term economic expansion. When one combines the current 35 percent corporate rate with the top personal rate of 38.6 percent on stock dividends, the government can take 60 cents out of each dollar that a company earns and pays in dividends.
When taxes are excessive, people avoid them. Companies rely more on taking out loans and issuing bonds than on selling stock. This creates a more volatile base for our economy because companies' debt in relation to equity gets skewed. Firms also choose to reward shareholders by driving up share prices rather than by paying dividends. This puts increased emphasis on reported earnings and less on cash payouts -- and we know what sort of accounting tricks this can lead to. Some of us may remember the old saying, "Cash is a fact, earnings are an opinion." Sadly, the bursting of the bubble of the 90's taught that lesson to a new generation of shareholders.
The final criticism of the president's plan is that it disproportionately favors the wealthiest Americans. Wrong. The tax cut is almost exactly proportional to taxes paid. Under current law, families making more than $200,000, who pay 45 percent of the income tax under current law, will get 40 percent of the tax cut. Families making less than $100,000 will pay 28 percent of the income tax this year and will get 34 percent of the tax cut. Not only that, Mr. Bush's plan would provide bigger tax cuts for middle-income families than the Democrats' alternative would.
President Bush is proposing the right amount of support for economic growth in the near term and the right kind of reform to promote long-term expansion. He is doing it in a way that cuts taxes proportionately for all income groups. Once again, the president is proposing a plan that is right on target.

HEADLINE: New Police Crackdown Takes Aim at 61 City Neighborhoods 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
The Police Department will flood crime-ridden neighborhoods, subway stops and housing projects with 1,400 police officers fresh from the Police Academy later this month, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced yesterday. 
 The new program, called Operation Impact, aims to keep violent crime at the lowest rate in a generation and fight persistent problems in some neighborhoods, Mr. Bloomberg said. 
 "Operation Impact will strategically monitor and combat crime in areas that have not equally shared in New York City's decline in crime," Mr. Bloomberg said, speaking at the 77th Precinct in Crown Heights, one of the neighborhoods that will receive additional patrols.
The program is the second major crime initiative Mr. Bloomberg has proposed; last year he put in place Operation Clean Sweep to crack down on crimes like panhandling and prostitution. 
Though he noted that crime rates in New York City remained low -- bucking a trend of growing violent crime in large cities -- Mr. Bloomberg's comments were an acknowledgment of the difficulties the city may face with a struggling economy and as the police force shrinks because of budget constraints. 
While crime in the city is down over all -- there were fewer than 600 murders last year, the fewest since 1963 -- problems persist.
In the 77th Precinct, one example that Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly cited, homicides were down 22 percent over the last two years, but shootings were up 41 percent. "The goal is to drive down crime by saturating the target areas with officers and suppressing violent crime," he said. 
The first phase of the program began last Friday, when 800 officers on overtime shifts were sent to 61 places across the city. Later this month, when the current Police Academy class of about 2,100 graduates, 1,400 of them will be sent to patrol such areas. 
The new officers will be highly visible: most will be on old-fashioned foot patrols, the police said, and will work with more experienced officers and detectives in the narcotics, vice, warrants and other specialized units. 
The 61 areas were chosen based on police crime statistics and consultations with community leaders. And those areas paint a more nuanced picture of crime in the city than the one usually drawn by city officials. Between West 30th Street and West 52nd Street and Seventh and Eighth Avenues in Midtown, for example, street robberies and burglaries are a problem, even though crime over all is down, Mr. Kelly said. 
In several housing projects in Brooklyn and the Bronx, shootings and robberies are on the rise, Mr. Kelly said, even as homicide rates have decreased. 
Tracy L. Boyland, a City Council member who represents Brownsville, Brooklyn, said she would be glad to see more officers in her neighborhood. 
"I think the presence of police officers is always a deterrent to crime," she said. "I am glad Commissioner Kelly is addressing this early on."

HEADLINE: The Iraq Dossier 

 BODY:
International arms inspectors told the Security Council yesterday that they had not yet found any "smoking gun" proving Saddam Hussein's continued manufacture of unconventional weapons. That increases pressure on the Bush administration to share more of what it knows about the state of Iraq's biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs. Less than three weeks remain until Jan. 27, when the inspectors are to provide a more comprehensive report. If Washington hopes to persuade the world and the American people that Baghdad has forfeited its chance for a peaceful solution, it will need compelling evidence to support its case. 
 It is probably unrealistic to expect revealing photographs of weapons production lines. In an era of satellite surveillance, countries with something to hide long ago learned how to conceal their secrets from aerial cameras. Using other forms of intelligence, however, the United States claims to have assembled a persuasive case. Also in recent days, America has been providing more intelligence help to the weapons inspectors, a process that should accelerate now that the U.N. has the resources on the ground to put those tips to immediate use before Baghdad can spirit away incriminating evidence. 
 Successive U.N. resolutions place the burden of proof on Iraq, not Washington or the arms inspectors, to demonstrate that all unconventional weapons programs have been terminated and that known or unaccounted-for stocks of biological and chemical warfare ingredients have been verifiably destroyed. The 12,000-page declaration Iraq submitted last month conspicuously failed this test. It offered no adequate explanation of what happened to more than 500 artillery shells containing nerve gas and 400 bombs suitable for delivering germs and toxins. It didn't credibly account for more than two tons of material used to produce biological weapons. It failed to mention new efforts to acquire uranium and raised more questions than it answered about preparatory work on unmanned drones and longer-range missiles. Since handing over that report, Iraq has not provided satisfactory answers for these omissions, implausibly contending that relevant records and materials are simply missing.
These evasions have not satisfied Hans Blix, the U.N.'s chief weapons inspector, who has complained that while Iraq has not directly interfered with his inspectors, it has failed to provide the active cooperation required to complete their mission. In a country as large and tightly controlled as Iraq, the inspectors will never be able to assure themselves without active help from the government that deadly illegal weapons ingredients aren't hidden somewhere.
Yet for all the Iraqi maneuvering, America cannot simply declare Baghdad to be in violation of U.N. requirements and then go immediately to war. The political, economic and military implications of combat -- not to mention the potential loss of American and Iraqi lives -- demand every effort by the United States to resolve this confrontation short of war. That may involve extending the period for inspections, and certainly requires Washington to return to the Security Council for further deliberation before turning to the use of force. The presence of tens of thousands of American troops in the region and the return of uncomfortably hot weather in the spring are not reasons to start fighting before every diplomatic option has been exhausted. 
There can be no wavering from the goal of disarming Iraq, but all chances of doing so peacefully should be explored before the world is asked to decide on war. Before that point is reached, Washington should share its evidence with the public.

HEADLINE: U.S. Threatens to Act Against Europeans Over Modified Foods 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's top trade official announced today that he was weighing whether to approach the World Trade Organization with a case against the European Union for its ban on genetically modified food, asserting that the "Luddite" and "immoral" European position was leading to starvation in the developing world.
 The official, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said that when famine-threatened African nations refused American genetically modified food last year, they were acting under the influence of the European position. 
 "The European antiscientific policies are spreading to other corners of the world," Mr. Zoellick told reporters, adding that African leaders seeking to avoid "the food that you and I eat" were letting their people starve. 
"I think that is a rather serious development," Mr. Zoellick said, in the strongest statement yet made on the subject by an administration official. "I find it immoral that people are not being able to be supplied food to live in Africa because people have invented dangers about biotechnology. That puts it rather high on my scale to deal with."
European officials rejected Mr. Zoellick's assertions, saying they had never encouraged African nations to reject aid.
Moreover, Pascal Lamy, the European Commission's chief trade negotiator, said today that if Mr. Zoellick did approach the trade organization with such a case, it would only complicate Europe's plan for lifting its ban against the foods, which is expected to occur in the spring.
When that happens, products tested and deemed safe will be allowed into European markets -- with labels identifying them as genetically modified. The United States does not require such labeling.
Tony Van der haegen, the expert for food safety at the European Union delegation in Washington, noted that "in a democracy you have to take into account fears of the people, and the people in many European countries are concerned about genetically modified food."
European consumers have for years questioned the safety of genetically modified foods. Many object to what they consider aggressive American promotion of those foods, which is seen as influenced by American agribusiness.
British newspapers have coined the term "Frankenfoods," reflecting the deep suspicion of crops like corn and soybeans, when genetically modified to increase productivity and improve resistance to disease. Such modifications, many fear, may have unintended consequences for human health.
American consumers, though already exposed to modified foods, have expressed uncertainties about them; several state legislatures have discussed bans of their own.
If all goes as planned with the lifting of the European ban, the effect on world trade will be measured in the billions of dollars as American biotechnology is exported to new markets.
Last August, the argument over biotechnology caused an aid crisis in Zambia, which rejected genetically modified corn from the United States despite widespread hunger. What had been a trade and consumer issue became a matter of life or death.
Mr. Van der haegen asserted that Mr. Zoellick's statement today was made for the benefit of African leaders whom he will meet next week at a trade conference.
"Ambassador Zoellick was a bit unfair to whip Europeans when we did not block the food aid," he said.
The administration is expected to decide whether to bring a case before the World Trade Organization by the end of the month.
"We're reviewing our options to determine how to best resolve this issue," said Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Temporary Financing Measure for Agencies 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The Senate approved a measure today to keep federal agencies operating through the end of the month, allowing the new Congress time to work through a spending impasse that could present an early test for the narrow Republican majority in the Senate.
 After the House passed the stop-gap bill on Wednesday and left town until later this month, senators by a voice vote adopted an identical temporary financing resolution. It will be a substitute for 11 spending measures Congress failed to approve last session. Republicans intend to combine those measures into one bill for a vote in the coming days. 
 Senate Democrats said they were willing to let the interim bill pass without debate but promised a fight over more than $9 billion in spending reductions that Senate Republican leaders have accepted in talks with the House and White House.
"We will voice as strongly as we can our opposition to these cuts and our determination to find a way to address them," said Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader.
Other lawmakers and top Senate Democratic aides promised to contest elements of what will be a huge bill to finance federal agencies that include the Agriculture Department, the F.B.I. and the National Institutes of Health.
"Once people start looking at this bill and see what policies will flow from it, there will be strong objections," predicted Scott Lilly, Democratic staff director of the House Appropriations Committee. 
He cited as examples provisions that would reverse budget increases for education programs and cut into $1.2 billion that Amtrak officials have said they need to maintain operations. 
Republicans would like to get the final spending measure -- totaling $385 billion -- approved in time for President Bush's State of the Union address on Jan. 28. But their push is being slowed by the failure of the Senate leadership to reach an agreement on committee membership and financing. 
Without that deal, Senate Democrats still run the panels. For instance, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said today that he would lead a confirmation hearing next week on the nomination of Tom Ridge as the secretary of homeland security.
The fact that Democrats still control the panels is preventing the Republicans from taking up the spending measure at the committee level. A meeting of the Appropriations Committee planned for Friday was postponed today when it became clear the organizing negotiations would not be concluded.
Senate Republicans say they want to move quickly on the spending because it includes billions of dollars that could aid the economy and help the unemployed. "As one that has just come back from my home in Alaska, we have the highest unemployment I've seen," said Senator Ted Stevens, who is in line to become chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He called the spending bills "vital to really start this engine again, our economic engine."
Mr. Stevens said he was open to working with Democrats to try to resolve problems with the spending bill. But Republican aides said they anticipated Democratic "mischief" with the spending measure. In addition, some Republicans will want to add money for farmers hurt by drought after a relief plan died last year, as well as wildfire protection.
The spending stalemate arose last fall because of differences among the Senate, the House and the White House about total spending levels. President Bush insisted on a ceiling of about $750 billion while the Senate, then controlled by the Democrats, sought roughly $10 billion more. The House Republican leadership sided with the president, but stopped bringing bills to the floor, partly due to a fight between conservative and moderate Republicans concerning how much to devote to health and education programs. Just two spending measures covering military appropriations were enacted.
Since the election, Republicans have agreed to Mr. Bush's numbers. Mr. Stevens said this week that more than $9 billion had been pared from the Senate version of the bills. Aides said the areas facing the largest reductions were labor and health, which would be cut by almost $3 billion, and the bill financing the Commerce, State and Justice Departments, which would drop by about $2 billion.
Democrats say they have not seen the details of the new spending plans, but are already arguing that domestic security efforts are being shortchanged. "We expect there are going to be cuts in homeland security across the board," said a spokesman for Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. He cited a reduction of $670 million for the Immigration and Naturalization Service and said the proposed bill provided no money for an election overhaul measure passed last year.
In the House, rules give the Republican leadership much more leverage to push through the spending plan. Democrats complained this week that they were being denied the chance to propose changes, but Republicans dismissed the objections.
"I understand the minority is upset," said Representative C. W. Bill Young of Florida, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. "They are upset because they are the minority, and I know about that. I served under in this House for 24 years under their rule."

HEADLINE: New Chief for Budget Office 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
House Republican leaders decided today to recommend Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, a senior economic adviser to President Bush, as the next director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
 The decision drew praise from supply-side economists but criticism from Democratic lawmakers, because both groups believe that Mr. Holtz-Eakin would support a disputed method of evaluating the cost of tax proposals. 
 In the method, known as "dynamic scoring," analysts try to estimate the cost of a tax change by predicting its impact on economic growth, rather than just calculating how much revenue would be lost or gained. Republicans have long lobbied Congressional analysts to use the method, contending it more accurately measures the budgetary impact of tax cuts. The method also offers the political benefit of reducing the size of projected deficits. 
The budget office plays an important role in estimating the government's long-range fiscal health, and, in that capacity, its top officials have adamantly opposed the use of dynamic scoring. 
Mr. Holtz-Eakin, a professor of public finance on leave from Syracuse University, is chief economist to the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, which used the method to help make the case for President Bush's $674 billion tax-cut proposal.
The council estimated that the plan would cost the treasury $359 billion in the first five years using conventional analysis. Under dynamic scoring, the council forecast that added growth would cut the real cost to $166 billion.
William Beach, a champion of dynamic scoring at the Heritage Foundation, a research group here, said Mr. Holtz-Eakin had not spoken publicly about the method but predicted he would support its use. He called the nomination "a profound choice" and said Mr. Holtz-Eakin had done a lot of work on the macro-economic effects of tax changes."
Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, expressed dismay. "Dynamic scoring could lead Congress down a fiscally irresponsible path where the true cost of tax cuts and spending legislation are significantly underestimated," he said.
The job became open last week, when Dan L. Crippen's term expired and Republican leaders expressed no interest in reappointing him. Mr. Crippen, a Republican, resisted dynamic scoring.

HEADLINE: Bush Says His Tax Proposal Will Be Fair for All Incomes 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
President Bush promoted his tax cut proposal today as fair to all Americans and accused opponents of the package of engaging in class warfare. 
 Seeking to counter criticism from Democrats that the $674 billion, 10- year economic plan is unfairly skewed to the wealthy, Mr. Bush traveled to a small flag company in Virginia to argue that his plan would slash the federal income tax bill for many middle-class families, and to suggest that his political opponents were trying to split the country along economic lines. 
 "You hear a lot of talk in Washington, of course, that this benefits so-and-so or this benefits this, the kind of the class warfare of politics," Mr. Bush said. "Let me just give you the facts, that under this plan a family of four with an income of $40,000 will receive a 96 percent reduction in federal income taxes." 
But Democrats said Mr. Bush was only attacking them because he could not get around the reality that the overwhelming majority of the tax benefits would go to the richest people in the country. They said that if anyone was waging class warfare, it was Mr. Bush, against low- and middle-income people.
"It's an old and tired complaint, and it completely disregards the fact that the Democratic Party has always wanted all Americans to move forward together," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who has said he will be a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. "I also believe the president's economic policies are class warfare against all classes."
With even some Republicans saying that Mr. Bush would have to compromise to get a plan through Congress, Democrats broadened their critique today, saying that the president's proposal does not offer any substantial financial assistance to cash-strapped states and could force states to raise taxes, cut services or both.
Because state income taxes are typically tied to federal income taxes, states will almost certainly lose revenue under the White House plan, lawmakers said. The plan could also make it more expensive for states and municipalities to issue their own bonds. The White House considered including assistance to states, reportedly as much as $10 billion, but the provision was cut.
"If you look at this economic stimulus plan, it's actually a tax hike," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. He added, "It's robbing Peter to pay Paul."
Not long after Mr. Schumer spoke, at a news conference with other Democrats, another string of Democrats took to the Senate floor to criticize Mr. Bush's plan. 
Saying her state could lose up to $1.1 billion under the Bush plan, Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, said, "It's taking a nightmare problem that we already have with our states and making it even worse, more chilling."
Republicans rallied around the President even as they acknowledged the plan is likely to be altered.
"Will it pass the Senate intact?" asked Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas. "Probably not. Nothing ever does." But, she added, "I certainly think what the president is proposing is exactly right."
Although the White House expressed confidence that Mr. Bush's plan would win Congressional approval, there were indications that the Senate Republican leadership would have difficulty finding the votes it needed from within party ranks. Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, one of only two Republicans who voted against Mr. Bush's 2001 tax cut, came out in opposition to the new plan today.
Mr. Chafee joined with Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, to call for a freeze on the planned tax cuts for Americans in the top income bracket, which under Mr. Bush's plan would drop this year to 35 percent from 38.6 percent. The proposal would save $88 billion, the senators said. 
But White House officials said the president would work hard to sell the proposal to voters and lawmakers. "All people who pay taxes should get tax relief," Mr. Bush said. "This is a fair plan. It's an important plan. And it's a plan that will help people find work, because it will help keep this economy growing."
In labeling criticism of his plan as class warfare, Mr. Bush struck an aggressive posture that Democrats said was intended to intimidate them. 
"It is class warfare, and they've declared it," Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in an interview. "Here the president kicks the hell out of the poor and tells us we're guilty of class warfare."
In a memorandum he circulated to House Democrats this week, Mr. Rangel noted that class warfare was a phrase that "seems vaguely un-American," and he compared its use in the tax debate to the way people in the civil rights movement had once been called communist sympathizers. He urged Democrats "not to be intimidated." 
An analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a moderate-to-liberal research organization run by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, found that Mr. Bush's plan would direct 28.3 percent of its benefits this year to the top 1 percent of earners, with incomes starting at $317,000, and 22 percent of its benefits to the bottom 80 percent of earners, those making less than about $68,000.
But Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said it was wrong for Democrats to suggest that wealthy people should not get a tax cut simply because they were successful. "It's class warfare to say that there are wrong people in America and these wrong people are not deserving of tax relief," Mr. Fleischer said.
He also said the administration's plan would remove more lower income people from the federal income tax rolls entirely.
In his stop at the National Capital Flag Company in Alexandria, Va., Mr. Bush emphasized that his plan would create jobs and focused on the benefits to middle-income workers. Using the example of a married couple with two children and income of $40,000, he said his plan would reduce their federal income tax bill to $45 from $1,178, a savings of $1,133.
"Now that may not seem like a lot of money to some of the big shots," Mr. Bush said. "That's real significant money for this family."
At a discussion with employees of the flag company and other workers, Mr. Bush heard mostly strong support for his tax plan. But the president also heard a polite but blunt denunciation of the biggest element of his plan, the proposal to end the taxation of stock dividends, from Donald Lucas, a retired accountant who the White House said receives $3,000 to $4,000 a year in taxable dividend income.
"It's a good idea, but I've got to be honest with you, I don't think it's fair," Mr. Lucas said. "I think corporations should pay taxes on their profits and I should pay taxes on the dividends that come to me as income."
Mr. Bush replied, "That's the debate."

HEADLINE: Alternative Tax Looms Large Despite Plans For Other Cuts 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
In outlining President Bush's big new tax cut plan this week, the White House promised that it would not make anyone worse off because of another tax that reduces or denies tax cuts to millions of middle- and upper-middle-income Americans. 
 But tax experts digging into the details of the plan said yesterday that the administration's plan actually provided for only minor and temporary relief from the tax, known as the alternative minimum tax. And those benefits will mainly go to those least affected by this separate tax originally intended to make sure that the rich cannot live tax free. 
 A major publisher of tax books for lawyers and accountants advised clients yesterday that the White House "proposal does not address the underlying problems that will continue to subject an increasingly larger number of taxpayers to the A.M.T." CCH, the publisher, also noted that even that minor relief from the alternative tax would last only through next year. 
Under the minimum tax system -- which operates in parallel to the normal tax code and applies to those who owe more under its provisions -- many deductions are denied, including those for children, the taxpayers themselves and for state and local taxes. At that point, taxes are calculated at rates of 26 to 35 percent.
Philip Schwindt, a CCH analyst, calculated yesterday that the alternative tax could start to hit one-child families with incomes as low as $71,000 by 2006 and that couples with similar incomes and two or more children would soon see their tax credits for child care and college education expenses either reduced or wiped out.
The Treasury Department's senior tax policy official, Pam Olson, said that the administration planed to propose a solution to the problem, but probably not until after Mr. Bush's first term had ended. The target date is the end of 2005, she said. "We are working on it," Ms. Olson said. "It is a hard issue."
Ms. Olson also said any concerns that the government might not be able to afford to relieve the middle class and upper middle class of the alternative tax was misplaced. "It is not an issue of whether we can afford a solution," she said, "but it is tied up in some fundamental fixes to the tax system, including the A.M.T."
If Mr. Bush's plan becomes law this year, the number of people paying the alternative minimum tax will rise by 9 percent, to 3.3 million, and the amount of tax paid will swell by 28 percent, to $18.5 billion, according to the Tax Policy Center in Washington, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, two centrist-to-liberal research organizations. Other groups estimated different figures, depending on how various complexities are interpreted, but they all agreed the burden of the minimum tax would continue to rise unless the law is changed.
Indeed, in a study done last fall, the policy center found that the revenue from the alternative tax is scheduled to rise so fast that it could cost as much as $951 billion over the next decade to return to the original intent of the law.
By 2010 a quarter of taxpayers -- about 36 million -- will be subject to the alternative minimum tax, several studies have found. It will cost taxpayers -- through 2010 -- $566 billion, one study showed.
In states where incomes and tax deductions tend to be higher, like New York, California and Illinois, Treasury figures show, nearly four of five taxpayers making $75,000 to $300,000 annually will be subject to the alternative tax by 2010 under current law. By moving up the tax rate cuts and making other changes, the president's new proposal would throw more middle-class taxpayers into the alternative tax sooner.
The House Joint Economic Committee warned in a May 2001 report that "if nothing is done to reform the A.M.T. it eventually will become the dominant type of income tax."
Rather than overhauling the alternative tax, President Bush this week focused on providing tax relief to investors and accelerating the schedule of tax cuts approved in 2001.
As for the alternative tax, the White House proposed only to increase the thresholds on deductions and exemptions that make the tax applicable. The plan calls for allowing married couples to take up to $57,000 in tax breaks before the alternative tax applies, up from $49,000 under current law. For single people, the threshold would rise by $4,000, to $39,750. The exemptions would fall back in 2005 to $45,000 for couples and $33,750 for singles.
The administration has consistently acknowledged that the alternative tax was never meant to apply to the middle class or upper middle class and that a solution is needed. 
Mark Weinberger, who was the administration's first chief tax policy official, said two years ago that "President Bush was elected on a promise to cut taxes, not to reform the alternative minimum tax." But he vowed that once the 2001 tax cuts were enacted, the administration would turn its attention to the middle- and upper-middle-class taxpayers affected by the alternative tax.
Paradoxically, the alternative minimum tax rarely applies today to those making more than $627,000. But because it has not been adjusted to reflect inflation or other economic changes it now applies to some single parents making as little as $32,000. It is the fastest-growing tax affecting those making $50,000 to $500,000 and the revenues it raised were critical to the financing of the 2001 tax cuts, which primarily benefited the top 1 percent of taxpayers, who on average make more than $1 million each.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR STANDOFF; 
NORTH KOREA SAYS IT IS WITHDRAWING FROM ARMS TREATY

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Friday, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Stepping up pressure following an American offer to open talks, North Korea said today it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The announcement means that, in 90 days, North Korea will no longer be bound by the treaty.
 The statement, carried by its official news agency and monitored here, said North Korea had no intention of producing nuclear weapons and was acting in self-defense because it was "most seriously threatened" by the United States. 
 "Though we pull out of the N.P.T., we have no intention to produce nuclear weapons and our nuclear activities at this stage will be confined only to peaceful purposes such as the production of electricity," it said. 
There was no immediate response from the United States.
Even as the reports began to percolate of North Korea's declaration, two representatives of the country's permanent mission to the United Nations were meeting with an American official to discuss the confrontation with Washington over the North's nuclear program.
Han Song Ryol and Mun Jong Chol met in Santa Fe, N.M., on Thursday night local time with the New Mexico governor, Bill Richardson, a former American ambassador to the United Nations who has experience working with the North Koreans on sticky issues. Page A11. 
The Bush administration made clear that the meetings were unofficial. Mr. Richardson was only empowered to deliver the same message that the administration had said in public: that there would be no negotiations until North Korea halted its two nuclear projects.
North Korea has not responded to an offer made on Tuesday by Washington to hold discussions with the participation of South Korea and Japan. 
Instead of responding, North Korea's official radio station repeated the country's demand that Washington sign a nonaggression treaty as the price of an easing of tensions.
North Korea has repeatedly accused the United States of threatening to invade it and has said it reserves the right to develop nuclear arms in self-defense. It continues to insist it has no nuclear weapons at this stage.
It made a similar announcement of withdrawal from the treaty in 1993 when challenged about its suspected nuclear weapons program. That crisis was defused in 1994 when it agreed to halt its nuclear program in exchange for help in building a nuclear reactor for peaceful purposes, an agreement it has now repudiated.
Tensions have risen here since October, when the United States said North Korea admitted to pursuing a nuclear arms program in violation of the 1994 agreement. It then threatened to reactivate the nuclear facilities at Yongbyon that had been closed and monitored under the agreement.
Today's statement denounced the International Atomic Energy Agency, whose monitors North Korea expelled last week, as a tool of the United States. The agency has threatened to report North Korea's noncooperation to the United Nations Security Council.
"The I.A.E.A. is used as a tool for executing the United States hostile policy," it said, and therefore North Korea can no longer remain bound to the nonproliferation treaty, which it signed in 1985 and which it said caused "the dignity of our nation to be infringed upon."
The announcement of North Korea's break with the international treaty came the morning after North Korea agreed to hold cabinet-level talks with South Korea, the highest-level dialogue between the two since North Korea admitted last October that it was maintaining a secret nuclear weapons program.
North Korea proposed holding the talks on Jan. 21-24, the week after a high-ranking American envoy visits here. In the past, North Korea often balked at invitations for high-level talks, but the nation's new policy, as spelled out in a New Year's Day editorial, is to make joint action with South Korea a priority in an effort to drive a wedge between the South and the United States.
In Seoul, several moves were under way to repair ties with the United States. The relationship has been strained by widespread demonstrations calling for a more equal relationship with the United States.
The withdrawal of the 37,000 American troops here "could send foreign investors flooding out of the country in fear of instability, throw the economy into turmoil and give North Korea a chance for provocation," South Korea's Defense Ministry warned in a monthly newsletter, Defense News, which circulated here on Thursday. "North Korea tries to weaken the South Korea-U.S. alliance's capability of deterring war."
Public opinion polls here indicate that about 55 percent of South Koreans, a group that consists largely of older people, want the troops to stay. In an indication that South Korea's silent majority may be starting to stir, about 400 South Korean military veterans and housewives staged a pro-American rally on Wednesday, burning an image of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, clinging to a missile.
Separately, the office of President Kim Dae Jung issued a statement on Thursday implicitly asking South Koreans to tone down the weekly vigils outside the American Embassy here. The statement said, "We need to calm excessive worries of the international community about the anti-U.S. atmosphere."
Conservatives criticize the government for addressing symptoms of anti-Americanism without addressing an underlying cause: a deep erosion among young people in the belief that American troops are needed in South Korea.
"Now is the time to sincerely consider whether or not to continue the weekend candlelit protests and risk our national security and healthy relations with the U.S. at this crucial time," The Korea Times newspaper, said on Thursday.

HEADLINE: 2 Airline Executives Say Industry Needs More U.S. Aid 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Two of the nation's biggest airlines told Congress today that they were searching their operations for cost cuts but still needed government help to pay for new security measures and to tackle their single largest expense: labor.
 The largest airlines lost about $9 billion last year, according to the Department of Transportation, as they struggled to adjust to fewer passengers and greater security challenges. Congress gave the industry $5 billion immediately after the terrorist attacks. 
 But executives from two large airlines testified today before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee that the industry might need an additional $4 billion to help it through its financial crisis.
"We have the responsibility to right our own ship," said Richard H. Anderson, chief executive of Northwest Airlines, but "the reality is that there are significant security burdens," including the costs of installing stronger cockpit doors, as well as other costs that the airlines have incurred since the terrorist attacks. Stringent cuts and layoffs allowed Northwest to return to profitability in the third quarter, he said. 
Today's hearing was the first of several examining the problems of the industry and whether the federal government should extend additional financial assistance.
Some lawmakers, including Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is the new committee chairman, were reluctant to pledge any new money, even though they stressed that they wanted services to smaller cities to be maintained. 
Mr. McCain agreed with airline executives at the hearing that the industry's troubles were deeper than those of previous downturns and that structural changes were needed in an industry that is effectively two-tiered, including the bigger carriers and the smaller discount carriers. 
Mr. McCain is considering whether to reintroduce legislation that would set up an arbitration panel to quickly and definitively resolve airline labor disputes. His proposal would speed up the current process, which allows for lengthy mediation and the possibility of strikes.
Mr. McCain's proposal would allow arbitrators to consider a carrier's financial condition, including a "reasonable profit," before making a decision after 30 days.
The largest airlines want to see the legislation revived because they say the current process has led to an unsustainable level of wages and benefits. They have formed an organization to help shape a grass-roots campaign to win support for rewriting the airlines' labor rules. 
Mr. McCain's bill was not passed last year, but, if it was reintroduced, it could receive a more favorable response now that the Republicans control Congress. 
Donald J. Carty, chief executive of American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, said that revising the airline labor law "would not help us through the current crisis." But he called it a long-term tool to assist the airlines "once we get healthy, to keep healthy."
Duane Woerth, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents 66,000 pilots, told the committee that binding arbitration was unnecessary because there had been few strikes in the airline industry.
Compulsory arbitration "would remove all collective bargaining rights," he maintained. 
"The current system produces contracts about 99 percent of the time, so we only have a strike every 10 years," Mr. Woerth said. Airlines favoring such arbitration maintain that the true figure is much higher: about 160 strikes in the last 50 years.
Mr. Carty also said his airline would begin to re-examine its labor contracts, a process he hoped to start within 60 days.
"It won't be easy because it involves changes, and changes our employees won't necessarily embrace," he said.

Wanted: Right Buyer for a Japanese Bank

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Few areas of Japan's notoriously opaque business world are murkier than banking. Tangled webs of corporate partnerships, heavy government influence and sheer resistance to change make it one of the country's most impenetrable industries, especially for foreigners.
 Witness the increasingly rancorous struggle over Aozora Bank, the successor to Nippon Credit Bank. Nippon Credit was nationalized in 1998 and then sold to a consortium of investors led by the Softbank Corporation. With the bursting of the technology bubble, Softbank now finds itself struggling with heavy debt, and it wants to raise cash by unloading its 49 percent stake in Aozora before the fiscal year ends on March 31. 
 Three foreign buyers -- including the Cerberus Group, an American investment fund, and GE Capital -- want to buy the stake, making the sale one of the clearest tests yet of Japan's willingness to let foreigners play a substantial role in the country's most cloistered, and politically influential, industry.
But it has also turned into something of a "High Noon" showdown. On one side is Softbank's president, Masayoshi Son, who insists on the right to sell his stake to the highest bidder, regardless of nationality. On the other side are policy makers who want to manipulate the sale to yield a politically palatable outcome, even if that means ignoring or driving away a better offer.
Nearly all of Japan's banks are drowning in bad loans, and most are hard pressed to report any profits. Many analysts say foreign investment and foreign management of some banks could give the whole industry a badly needed lift. 
But policy makers are unhappy with the way Ripplewood, an American investment group, has been running Shinsei Bank, formerly the Long-Term Credit Bank, another institution that the state had to take over on the verge of collapse and then resell. To the government's great annoyance, Shinsei has taken an American approach to risk management, and refused to make new loans to shaky companies solely for the sake of keeping them in business and their workers employed, a practice most domestic banks are willing to follow. These shaky companies tend to be concentrated in industries that contribute heavily to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Determined to keep bank credit flowing to these weak companies, financial regulators have taken a variety of steps to try to ensure that a Japanese bidder wins the Softbank stake in Aozora. In the process, they have so far thwarted the first and most eager bidder for Softbank's shares -- Cerberus, which already owns 11.5 percent of Aozora.
"After the sale of the Long-Term Credit Bank to Ripplewood, it became very clear that the authorities wanted to see Japanese assets in Japanese hands," said Brian Waterhouse, a veteran bank analyst at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. "There are a lot of interested parties that do not want Cerberus to take a larger stake."
The showdown over the Aozora stake took a bizarre turn on Thursday when the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial newspaper, published a report that Aozora had allowed Cerberus to see confidential information about the bank's customers. Aozora said it had done nothing wrong, and had simply allowed Cerberus to do the kind of due-diligence research into its finances that any serious bidder would require.
Cerberus, which is represented on Aozora's board by former Vice President Dan Quayle, said it had been at great pains to follow the letter of Japanese law, and that no one in Japan need worry about its motives. "We are willing to make a big bet on Japan," said Bill Richter, the president of Cerberus Asia. "All we expect and hope for is a level playing field."
Though Japan's economy remains deeply troubled, Cerberus, like many foreign investors, says there are opportunities for profit in Japanese banking by applying credit issuance and management methods common at Western banks. 
The government denies that anyone is plotting to exclude foreign investors. "We don't care what nationality the investor is," said Hirofumi Gomi, the chief of the inspection bureau at the Financial Services Agency. "If we judge that a bidder is adequate, we will approve them."
Soothing official comments, though, have done little to change the impression left on many analysts by the government's actions. 
After Cerberus bought its stake in Aozora -- Japanese for blue skies -- regulators changed laws to require that anyone wanting to buy more than 20 percent of a bank needs government approval, a measure seen as intended specifically to scare off foreign bidders. Months then went by without a Japanese buyer making an offer for Softbank's Aozora stake, prompting Mr. Son, Softbank's president, to say that he did not mind if the buyer was a foreigner; he was hauled before a parliamentary committee to explain his remark.
At last, the government got what it wanted in December when the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group weighed in with a bid. Unable to conceal his glee, the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, effusively welcomed Sumitomo Mitsui's interest, saying that "a Japanese bank has shown its energy."
Sumitomo Mitsui will not say why it considered a bid for Aozora. Analysts say such a purchase would make little economic sense, given Aozora's small size compared with Sumitomo Mitsui and the somewhat outdated line of business Aozora emphasizes: selling debentures. Sumitomo Mitsui may want Aozora's assets to improve its capital ratio, or it may simply want to curry favor with regulators.
As with many showdowns, one side, Softbank, is in a hurry to decide the issue by selling its Aozora stake, while the other, the government, may be able to achieve its ends simply by stalling. Eventually, it knows, frustrated foreigners give up and go home.

HEADLINE: Madison Square Mayhem 

BYLINE:  By Mike Wallace; Mike Wallace is co-author of "Gotham" and author of "A New Deal for New York."

 BODY:
It's sort of good news that the Republican Convention is coming to New York in 2004. It's nice to see support from the Red country for the Blue city. It's a pity, though, that we will have to fork over some $50 million to defray G.O.P. expenses. I hope predictions based on Philadelphia's experience in 2000 will prove true and the event will bring in three times that amount, helping revive our battered tourist trade.
 But if Philadelphia is to be our model, we shouldn't count on a riveting event. That was a tightly scripted affair about "compassion," featuring people of color performing for a snowy white audience of delegates. Maybe next year the theme will be updated from race to class, with a stageful of the unemployed and uninsured singing the virtues of tax cuts. 
 Or perhaps there's another way to bring production values up to Big Apple standards. Let's recall the first such event to be broadcast on mass media (in that case, radio): the 1924 Democratic National Convention, held at Stanford White's old Madison Square Garden on 26th Street.
It was the first held in New York since 1868. Most Western and Southern Democrats had resisted returning, feeling the city was, in the words of a popular prohibitionist poem, "heartless, Godless, Hell's delight / rude by day and lewd by night." Herbert Bayard Swope, the executive editor of The World, had spent a year selling them on the city. Liquor would be banned from the convention hall. The police would round up pickpockets (although William Jennings Bryan's pocket watch eventually got lifted inside the arena). Swope got a thousand restaurants and hotels to pledge not to increase prices. 
As the convention neared, the city was plastered with signs for its favorite son, Gov. Al Smith. One likely reason the California politician William Gibbs McAdoo -- Smith's chief rival for the nomination -- acquiesced in giving New York the convention was a desire to run against the metropolis. The minute he arrived by train he called it "sinister, unscrupulous, mercenary and sordid." (A bit much, perhaps, from a man who had spent 30 years as a Wall Street lawyer.)
Thus provoked, New Yorkers turned waspish. Locals mocked McAdoo's followers as "apple knockers" and mimicked their drawls. Each delegation had a city block dedicated to it. This sounded hospitable enough to the (largely anti-Catholic) Texans, until they discovered their block contained St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
Smith was nominated on June 26. Franklin D. Roosevelt made a witty speech offering "the Happy Warrior" to the convention. The moment he finished, a wave of sound slammed through the hall, generated by mechanical noisemakers, fire sirens, cowbells and a half-dozen bands. Outside, taxi drivers and chauffeurs honked horns; shredded paper showered through the Garden's open skylights. The cacophony continued for an hour while furious McAdoo delegates formed squares around their women. 
After this, matters degenerated rapidly. When a McAdoo-controlled committee rejected a proposal to censure the Ku Klux Klan, Smith's forces took the issue to the floor. For hours, delegates brawled, the galleries howled -- and every curse crackled over the airwaves into homes across the country. Censure failed, but McAdoo's victory destroyed his candidacy (the galleries took to chanting "Ku Ku McAdoo"). Smith's selection, however, was equally out of the question: country delegates were standing fast against the candidate of "bootleggers and Romanists." 
A glacial stalemate gripped the Garden and held it, despite the 100-degree heat, for 10 days. Tammanyites hoped the outlanders would succumb to fatigue and mounting hotel bills; but in the end, on the 103rd ballot, they acquiesced in the nomination of a New York corporate lawyer, John W. Davis. The prize proved worthless. Progressives deserted to Bob La Follette, the insurgent from Wisconsin. The Republican, Calvin Coolidge, won the presidency handily.
We're not likely to see mayhem next year. But wouldn't it be interesting if more modest differences came to the fore? Perhaps moderate G.O.P. governors, now being forced to slash budgets while Washington hands tax breaks to the rich, might challenge prevailing pieties and priorities. If so, it would be healthy for the country. And for New Yorkers, it would certainly make having a ringside seat worth the hefty price of admission.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Illness and Hard Floors Challenge Family's Grit

BYLINE:  By ARTHUR BOVINO 

 BODY:
After a breakfast of Indian pancakes, Bhavna Gupta, 2, giggled as she jumped up and down on two single beds pushed together in the corner of a studio apartment in Flushing, Queens. She lives there with her older sister, Sonia, 7, and their father and mother, Vinod and Saroj. And those beds, they are an exciting new luxury for a family that has been far more accustomed to hardships.
 Hardships, and hard floors. Before the beds, the Guptas got their rest by getting down on the floor with cockroaches, bold bugs that don't always wait for the dead of night to skitter to the kitchen. 
 "They're everywhere with buildings like this," Vinod Gupta said. "Old buildings."
A floor for a bed. A roach for a bedfellow. It wasn't supposed to be like this. When Mr. Gupta, now 42, came to New York in 1987 from Punjab, India, he brought a strong work ethic and a desire to make enough money to start a family.
He also came with high hopes that in America, he could get the kind of surgery he needed to correct a severe childhood injury.
When he was 11, Mr. Gupta fell out of a second-story window, breaking his jaw and crushing his chin. An operation enabled him to open his mouth wide enough to fit a spoon inside. Soups and soft foods became his staples.
"Go to a big country, they can do the surgery," he recalled being told by doctors when he asked if they could widen his mouth and restore his chin. So Mr. Gupta, who made a living selling tea at colleges in India, came to the United States in 1987, following his sister, Beena Singla, who had done well since moving to New York in 1975.
And in 1990, after working in Indian restaurants and at a packaging company to save money for his operation, Mr. Gupta finally had surgery at Queens Hospital Center. He was even able to eat bread without difficulty.
Back then, with things finally looking up, Mr. Gupta might have hoped that this would be his last brush with doctors and hospitals. 
But bad health has continued to afflict Mr. Gupta. And the bad news often seems to follow the good, a pattern since that childhood fall.
In late 1991, for example, he started experiencing chest pains, and found out he had a dysfunctional aortic valve. He had successful surgery. But then, bad news after good, he contracted pneumonia and was hospitalized for a month.
Sometimes, though, the pattern of Mr. Gupta's life can look a little different: good news following bad.
After recovering from pneumonia, he took a good job as a clerk in a doctor's office in Brooklyn. His sister told him about a very nice woman from Punjab that he should meet. He saved money, became an American citizen and returned to India to meet Saroj, now 36; they married in 1993. He returned to New York to save money, she joined him in 1994, and a year later, Sonia was born. They were overjoyed.
Today, that joy remains. But so does the uncertainty over Mr. Gupta's health. 
In 1995, Mr. Gupta had a seizure as a result of what his doctors discovered was a brain tumor. The next year, while driving with his brother-in-law, he had a heart attack.
At Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, he was given a pacemaker and told that his heart condition was too serious for him to work.
That left the family in dire straits. They needed help to pay their $618-a-month rent in addition to phone and utility bills. Public assistance provides the family with $683, and they get $343 in food stamps every month.
In September 2000, Bhavna was born. But there wasn't much time to celebrate. Soon afterward, Mr. Gupta started having problems with his heart again and now there was another child to feed. A year later he had another seizure. The doctors suggested an operation, but after so many, Mr. Gupta was afraid to have another one, especially one so serious. "Let's try the medicine first," he said. 
The family, needing a less expensive apartment, applied for emergency public housing. They are waiting to qualify.
In September 2002, Mrs. Gupta was able to get a job raking leaves and shoveling snow six hours a day. She makes about $900 a month, which helps but was not enough to buy new beds for the family when the old ones became too dangerous to sleep on.
That brought them to the floor, and to the roaches. But it also brought them to Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
There, the Guptas met Francine Melamed, their caseworker, who secured $370 from the fund to buy a futon and two single beds.
But the New Year brings new problems for the Guptas. Mrs. Gupta's job is seasonal and will end soon. With the slow economy it will be hard for her to find a job; she plans to apply for public assistance until she can find another job.
And Mr. Gupta's public assistance will end on Feb. 1. "I have to wait 16 months to reapply," he said.
Even finding a cheaper apartment will cause new problems.
"How can I pick up the children from school if we're far away?" Mrs. Gupta asked. "We need to be near the hospital, too."

HEADLINE: A Worldwide Economic Stimulus Plan 

BYLINE:  By Jeffrey E. Garten; Jeffrey E. Garten is dean of the Yale School of Management and author of "The Politics of Fortune: A New Agenda for Business Leaders." He held economic and foreign policy positions in the Nixon, Ford, Carter and Clinton administrations.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is leaving no doubt that it intends to use the United States' enormous military power to make the world a safer place. But to succeed, Washington must develop a more robust global economic policy as well. Unless our military confrontations lead to something much better for the millions of people who will be hurt, we will have won the wars and lost the peace. 
 It's true that the administration is aggressively promoting trade liberalization by pushing for new commercial deals with Latin America, as it has recently done with Chile and is now doing in Central America. It is also pressing for more tariff and quota reductions around the world in an omnibus negotiation that it hopes to conclude within two years under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. These efforts are an excellent start. But there are at least four broader challenges the United States must now confront, and with an urgency that the Bush administration has yet to demonstrate. 
 The first is reinvigorating global economic growth. The world economy is in trouble: corporate investment and trade are slowing, factories are producing more than they can sell, and deflation is threatening many regions. The two potential economic engines besides the United States -- Germany and Japan -- are stagnating. Big emerging markets, from Indonesia to Brazil, are in deep trouble. 
America's economy is the world's most powerful by far, accounting for almost a third of global demand these days, but even if we grow at a healthy rate this year, the United States by itself cannot create a sustainable international economic recovery. Our own revival depends on the health of our companies, and that in turn depends in part on expanding foreign markets. Overseas sales of our goods and services made up at least 25 percent of our economic growth in the 1990's. Moreover, because many of our top companies -- Intel, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, for example -- rely on Europe, Japan and developing countries for more than 30 percent of their revenues, stronger foreign economies are important to the health of our stock markets, the principal financing vehicle for corporate America's expansion. 
Washington must bring together its economic partners -- the Group of 7 nations made up of Canada and Japan and those in the European Union -- to get the global economy moving again. The United States, which is already running huge budget deficits and has lowered interest rates to levels not seen in generations, has little room to maneuver. But it can encourage the European Central Bank, Europe's equivalent of the Federal Reserve, to lower its relatively high interest rates, since inflation on the continent is not nearly the threat that stagflation is. The European Union must also let up on its growth-constricting demands that Germany, Italy and France restrict spending and, in some instances, raise taxes. The United States and Europe can push Japan to restructure its growth-strangling bank debts. 
Second, there will soon be an acute need to rebuild countries that are either defeated or disintegrating. The estimates for reconstructing Iraq, for example, range from $120 billion over 10 years, in the case of a very short war, to $1.2 trillion after a prolonged conflict, according to extensive work by the economist William Nordhaus. This amount does not include the costs of the administration's vision of spreading democratic and free market institutions in the gulf region. 
The job of economic relief and reconstruction will most likely need to be handled by the United Nations, but substantial American financial support will be essential. Given budget deficits at home, this will be no easy task. Will this money come from domestic programs or from foreign aid already promised to others? At the least, the administration needs to work with Congress to incorporate the requirements in planning -- something which Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the Office of Management and Budget, has been reluctant to do.
One problem is that there is no single agency in Washington capable of overseeing the extensive United Nations efforts that must be mounted. One needs to be created, just as the Economic Cooperation Administration was established in 1948 to oversee the Marshall Plan. Like it or not, we are entering a decade of political and military tension, and nation-building is going to be a major part of America's response.
Third, we need to prepare for all-too-possible international economic crises. A major run-up in oil prices in reaction to turmoil in Venezuela and Iraq has already begun and could send the global economy into a deep recession. The United States should be working with the European Union and Japan to release emergency oil reserves if oil prices spiral out of control. It should be encouraging Russia to expand production, too, by promising we will buy Moscow's supplies well into the future.
Another crisis could involve the dollar, which was down 15 percent against the euro in 2002. If our trade deficit continues to soar and foreigners get nervous, they could dump their dollars. It would help if Washington could persuade the European Central Bank to lower its interest rates -- which it should do anyway to stimulate economic growth on the continent -- and make the euro less attractive as an alternative to the dollar. Beyond that, Washington, Brussels and Tokyo will have to be prepared to coordinate purchases of the dollar if it goes into free fall. 
Latin America could also provide the spark for a global financial debacle. After all, Argentina and Venezuela are in deep trouble, and Brazil's economy is fragile at best. In 1997, a currency collapse in Thailand set off a global financial meltdown. The lesson is that Washington and its economic partners had better focus more on what's happening south of the Rio Grande.
Finally, the United States will have to give much more attention to helping developing countries, the very nations in which so much of today's turmoil exists, get a fairer deal from globalization, which has so far disproportionally benefited rich countries. This means not only negotiating trade agreements but also improving the World Trade Organization's ability to settle trade disputes and to give technical assistance to struggling countries overwhelmed by the blizzard of new trade laws in the last decade. It also means helping the World Bank and its regional counterparts deal with poverty more effectively, rather than just criticizing their performance, which is what Washington so often does.
Admittedly, the Bush administration has never shown much interest in multilateral diplomacy except when other countries press it to the wall, as they have with Iraq. But in the economic realm, there is no choice but to seek partners. 
In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the United States pushed for the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and coordinated the Marshall Plan with European nations. Washington realized then that economic stability and prosperity were essential to a country's security. It's true today, too.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Despite Jobs Report, Tech Shares Move Slightly Higher

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Technology shares inched ahead yesterday on hopes for a brighter 2003, while other stocks wobbled after an unexpected drop in jobs unnerved investors worried about corporate profits and the economy's health.
 A government report showing that the economy shed 101,000 jobs in December surprised economists who had expected companies to increase hirings. 
 Stock indexes fell after the market opened, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index erased losses and moved higher as investors were unwilling to read too much gloom into the data.
"Over all, my feelings are pretty constructive," said Brian Pears, head of equity trading at Victory Capital Management. 
"The fact that we haven't given back any of the gains is good," he added, referring to the New Year's rally. 
Technology issues continued a strong rally started on Thursday by a handful of positive earnings outlooks. The Nasdaq gained about 4.4 percent for the week, and is up 8.4 percent in January, as investors hope companies will renew their capital spending.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.26 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1,447.72.
Cisco Systems gained 27 cents, to $15.22, and was the most active stock on the Nasdaq. Intel rose 36 cents, to $17.42.
The Dow Jones industrial average increased 8.71 points, or 0.1 percent, to 8,784.89, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was flat, closing at 927.57, the same close as Thursday.
The Dow and S.& P. 500 were ahead 2.1 percent each for the week.
The New Year's rally, which has pushed the Dow 5.3 percent higher so far in January, has been fueled in part by the reallocation of assets by investors. With money markets paying so little, and little upside seen in bonds, some fund managers have taken on greater risk in the hopes of increasing their return.
The move up in stocks after the jobs report "seemed to be fueled by some moves out of bonds," said Brett Gallagher, deputy chief investment officer at Julius Baer. "We've been hearing anecdotally that pension funds have come to the conclusion to make 9 percent on their money they're going to have to increase their exposure to equities." 
Any enthusiasm for stocks was tempered by North Korea's withdrawal from the global treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The move caused alarm around the world, but the United States said that, though a cause for concern, the action was not unexpected.
"If there wasn't any North Korea issue, this market would be up a lot more," said Anthony Iuliano, head equity trader for Glenmede Trust. 
FleetBoston Financial halved its earnings outlook for the fourth quarter as it set aside $800 million to cover loan losses. The latest loan-loss provision, partly a result of corporate bankruptcies in the weak economy, will be $450 million higher than the third quarter's, Fleet said.
Shares of Fleet fell 10 cents, to $27.40.
Schering-Plough sounded a sour note ahead of a rush of earnings reports next week. The drug maker fell 10 cents, to $22.96, after cutting its 2002 earnings target because of a rapid decline in sales of the allergy drug Claritin, which began selling without a prescription in the United States last month.
Decode Genetics surged 87 cents, to $2.97. J. P. Morgan raised its rating of the company to overweight from neutral, saying little value was currently being attributed to the biotech company's product pipeline.
U.S. Steel rallied $1, to $14.70. Prudential Securities raised its rating for the steel maker to buy from hold, lauding the company's announcement on Thursday that it would buy a smaller rival, National Steel.
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note rose 8/32 , to a price of 98 28/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.14 percent from 4.17 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 14/32 , to 104 30/32 . The bond's yield fell to 5.05 percent from 5.07 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Linen Service Reaches Deal With Union Over Firings 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A linen service in the South Bronx that was accused of firing two immigrant workers for backing a union agreed yesterday to rehire them; in exchange the union agreed to end its pressure campaign against the company.
 The union, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, known as Unite, was urging several prestigious restaurants, including Alain Ducasse, La Caravelle and the "21" Club, to stop using the company, Linens of Europe. Two restaurants, Picholine and Artisanal, had agreed to stop using it. 
 As part of the settlement, the company pledged to take steps that would make it easy for its 12 workers to unionize. The company promised not to fight a unionization drive by Unite and to recognize the union after more than half of its workers signed cards saying they wanted a union. 
Rocio Castelan, one of the fired workers, said, "I'm very happy because now I don't have to suffer the economic hardship that my children and I were going through." Ms. Castelan, who was dismissed in April shortly after telling a manager that she wanted a union, said she might return to work as early as Wednesday.
Ms. Castelan and the other fired worker, Andrea Cansino, had also accused Linens of Europe of paying them about $4 an hour, considerably less than the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage. Company officials denied violating wage laws.
Wilfredo Larancuent, manager of the union's laundry division in New York, said Linens of Europe had agreed to pay Ms. Castelan $5,500 in back wages, and Ms. Cansino $2,500.
With the union already circulating cards to workers at Linens of Europe, Mr. Larancuent voiced confidence that the company would soon grant recognition to the union, which is seeking to organize thousands of laundry workers across the nation.
Andrew Hoffmann, a lawyer for the company, said it had strongly opposed the union at first because it thought it was working with several rival laundries to put Linens of Europe out of business. 
After the company fired the two women, the union began noisy demonstrations in front of restaurants during dinnertime and sent delegations of clergy members, union leaders and lawmakers to meet with restaurant officials to urge them to drop Linens of Europe.
Mr. Hoffman said the company agreed to make it easier for Unite to gain recognition because it saw that Unite was not trying to put it out of business and was instead just trying to unionize the workers.

HEADLINE: More North Korean Brinkmanship 

 BODY:
North Korea's decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty represents a sharp turn for the worse in an already dangerous crisis. It may be a particularly reckless bargaining tactic meant to extort a nonaggression pact from America or, worse, part of a crash drive by Pyongyang to build a stockpile of nuclear weapons. Either way, the move complicates the search for a diplomatic solution and adds to North Korea's dangerous isolation. The North claims to have no quarrel with the international community, only with Washington. By targeting an important global treaty, it belies its own argument. 
 The nonproliferation treaty commits the North not to build nuclear weapons and provides for regular inspection of its nuclear facilities. North Korea threatened to withdraw a decade ago before changing its mind and negotiating a nuclear freeze with Washington that it subsequently ignored. The North is already violating the treaty, by expelling international inspectors and doing preparatory nuclear weapons work. But in renouncing the nonproliferation treaty it compounds the offense, undermining one of the world's most important restraints against the spread of nuclear weapons. No signatory has repudiated the treaty before, and if Pyongyang does not reverse course, its behavior should be taken up by the United Nations Security Council. 
 Washington has made clear its desire to resolve this matter peacefully and its willingness to address the North's security and economic concerns. Since Thursday, North Korean diplomats have been talking with Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democrat. Though he does not represent the Bush administration, Mr. Richardson, who is a former special envoy, ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary during the Clinton administration, has useful experience with North Korea. The White House is wise to leave all diplomatic doors open as it explores further responses with North Korea's neighbors, including Russia, China and Japan.

HEADLINE: Gold in Them Thar Tin Cans?; 
Recycler Sees Money to Be Made From City's Containers

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Recycling, as conceived in the flower-power 1970's, was never about making pots of money, and mostly it hasn't. In recent years, hopes began to fade in many cities around the nation that it could ever even pay its own way.
 New York City led the gloomy refrain last summer when it announced that recycling of glass and plastic containers would be halted to help ease the city's budget crisis. The program, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said, had simply become too expensive to sustain. And when the Department of Sanitation sought offers in November to resume part of the program, early returns were just as bleak: seven proposals came in for a combined metals and plastics contract and most would require the city to pay, and pay dearly, if recycling were to return. 
 All the bids, that is, but one. 
A family-owned scrap-metal company, the Hugo Neu Corporation, which has been shredding cars and appliances for sale on the global steel market for the last half century, quietly raised its hand and announced that despite all arguments to the contrary, recycling was profitable.
The company, through a joint partnership that it manages, Hugo Neu Schnitzer East, offered to pay the city $5.15 a ton for all the tuna fish cans and plastic water bottles New Yorkers could sort. It was the only bid to carry that shimmering, illusive word, written in black ink rather than red: pay. The next closest offer, from Waste Management, the giant disposal company, would require the city to pay $67 for every ton of metal and plastic taken away. Before the program was suspended, the city was collecting about 8,700 tons of plastic and metal for recycling every month. 
The surprise bid put recycling back on the table in New York, environmentalists and waste-industry experts said. First, it would generate, rather than cost money -- perhaps, for plastic and metal, for the first time (paper recycling is already profitable). Second, it came from outside the traditional waste-disposal industry, which has taken over more and more of the nation's recycling business in the last decade. 
"What this remarkable bid shows is that markets are not the problem -- there is real private interest," said Mark A. Izeman, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based conservation group. "I think this is one of the most significant solid-waste developments in New York in years."
But the bid from Hugo Neu, which processed much of the twisted steel from the World Trade Center for sale on the world scrap market, also presents risks for New York, other experts say, because it would mean stepping away from the familiar corporate umbrella offered by companies like Waste Management, which have established track records and national networks on which recycled materials can be sold. 
Waste Management was the second-place bidder for New York's full recycling program for metal, plastic and glass, which was opened for bidding last fall for a scheduled return in 2004. The price to beat? Once again, Hugo Neu's. In that part of the bidding, all the competitors offered bids requiring the city to pay rather than get paid -- mainly because glass is so costly and problematic to recycle and resell -- but Hugo Neu's was the cheapest, by $13 a ton. 
A spokeswoman for the Department of Sanitation said that the agency was still reviewing the bids, and so could not comment on the specifics of any offer. A decision is expected later this year.
Officials at Hugo Neu, which is led by the tightly knit Neu family (the chairman and chief executive, John L. Neu, is the son of the founder, Hugo Neu, a German immigrant who started the company in 1945), said they were led to make the bid by a complicated arc of changes in their industry and in the company's relationship with New York City.
Mr. Neu said that the tense, emotional months of rescue and cleanup at ground zero, as the scarred steel from the trade towers arrived here ton by ton, created a bond -- emotional and economic -- that wasn't there before. 
Last summer, the company began handling New York's residential metal recycling -- until a permanent contract could be awarded -- and that also changed the calculations; officials said they learned how valuable that portion of the recycling stream was, and what exactly was in it. Commodity prices can fluctuate widely, but since July, the company said, it has paid New York $22 to $30 a ton for the metals. 
The general manager of the Hugo Neu Schnitzer East partnership, Robert A. Kelman, who is Mr. Neu's brother-in-law, said that if the company was awarded the contract, the profits from metal recycling would subsidize the plastics portion, just enough to make both work financially. He said that about 40 new jobs would be added, mostly for the plastics operation, in addition to the 750 people the company already employs in the region and around the country. 
A spokesman for Waste Management said the company did not comment on bids that were still being considered, or on other company's bids. 
Hugo Neu's vice president in charge of environmental and public affairs, Wendy K. Neu (John Neu's wife and Mr. Kelman's sister), said she thought Mr. Bloomberg, however much he was criticized for suspending recycling, should also get credit for reframing the debate, because it was on that altered terrain of profit and loss that the company analyzed the process and realized that money could be made.
"At the time, I was horrified -- you worry that once you dismantle a program, it's very hard to bring it back," Mrs. Neu said. "But in hindsight, I think there have been problems, and perhaps this has encouraged a debate -- whether we're the ones to do it or someone else is, people are thinking differently." 
But the debate is about more than just money. In philosophy and practice and history, scrap dealers and waste companies are utterly different, industry experts say. In some ways, New York must choose between the yin and yang of the disposal world.
Most waste companies make their profits by disposing of trash in the most efficient way possible, and many have bought up landfills around the country to further smooth the garbage path from curbside to final entombment.
Scrap companies, on the other hand, make their money by squeezing out the last possible percentage of salvage from the cars and other items they process, and any excess that cannot be used and must be thrown out represents a failure and a loss.
At Hugo Neu's clattering shredder operation here on the Jersey City waterfront, a car fed in one end of the 6,000-horsepower behemoth comes out 50 seconds later, divided into streams of steel, aluminum, plastic, cloth and other materials. Even coins are recovered. Over time, car seats tend to collect coins that slip out from pockets or get bobbled at toll booths, and each year about $35,000 worth pile up here, shaken free by the shredder from their car-seat piggy banks.
Similarly, Mr. Kelman said, the company is learning more and more about plastic salvage, as the cars it processes render a more complex mix of materials -- a trend, he said, that will only continue. The average vehicle going through the shredder these days was built in the early 1990's, and the amount of plastic in cars has grown since then. As scrap becomes more complex, Mr. Kelman said, scrap dealers are being forced to become "true recyclers."
But none of that will make New York's choice easy, waste experts said. Environmentalists like Mr. Izeman at the Natural Resources Defense Council are already applying pressure to accept the Hugo Neu bid and bring back recycling immediately, saying the city would be "foolish" to reject an offer with immediate revenue benefits. 
Other experts said the city had to think about the long term, and that the national network of contacts and contracts that the big waste companies provide might simply be something that smaller scrap dealers are unable to offer.
"A small guy is just going to have a hard time competing with a Waste Management," said James Thompson Jr., the president of Chartwell Information Publishers, a San Diego company that tracks the waste industry. "Sure, they have solid relationships with manufacturers who want their metal," he added, referring to the scrap dealers. "Their shortcoming is that they just can't provide as sophisticated an aftermarket for all the stuff."

HEADLINE: Californians Hear Grim News on Budget 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis offered a grim $62.8 billion budget today that would bring pain to virtually every Californian through tax increases and cuts in almost every state program.
 Faced with a $35 billion budget gap, Mr. Davis is seeking $8.3 billion in tax increases and more than $20 billion in spending cuts for the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
 "All the choices before me were hard, but they had to be made," Mr. Davis, a Democrat, said at a news briefing. "We are facing the problem head on." 
The plan, which by law must pass the Legislature by a two-thirds margin, calls for a higher state sales tax, and increases in income and tobacco taxes. It seeks cuts in virtually every state program. It defers payments to state pension plans and eliminates the jobs of at least 1,500 state workers. Public school financing would be cut by more than $4 billion and tuition would rise at community colleges and public universities.
Republicans quickly vowed to resist the $8.3 billion in tax increases that are a central feature of Mr. Davis's budget. They said that the proposed one-cent increase in the sales tax and the tax increase on high-income families would throttle consumer spending and darken the already gloomy state economy.
"The governor is continuing down the same rigid ideological path that has nearly bankrupted California over the past three years," said James L. Brulte, the Senate Republican leader. "Raising taxes in a sluggish economy is like doctors 200 years ago putting leeches on a sick patient. It's not only unhealthy, it's counterproductive."
Under the governor's proposal, the state budget next year would fall to $62.8 billion from the current year's $75.5 billion, marking the third straight year of declining state spending. It is the first time since World War II that the budget has seen such a decline.
Much of the reduction is the result of shifting billions of dollars of costs now borne by the state to county and municipal governments. Programs covered by the shift include child welfare, adoption, mental health, substance abuse, day care, nursing homes and in-home care of the elderly and disabled. All the new tax revenue would be dedicated to these programs and sent directly to the local agencies that administer them.
Steven Szalay, executive director of the California State Association of Counties, welcomed the proposal to provide more money to counties to run these social service programs. "We're ready to talk about anything that gives us more authority and flexibility."
But he noted that some of the programs -- particularly long-term care for the elderly and disabled -- were among the fastest-growing health-care costs. He expressed concern that the reimbursements from the state would not keep pace with these costs as the number of older Californians grows.
Mr. Davis said this so-called realignment of spending was a cornerstone of his plan to restructure state finances so that California no longer experiences the feast-or-famine cycles it has suffered over the last 20 years. 
"I want to stress, we're not shortchanging the counties," he said. "We're sending them sufficient money to maintain the programs at their current levels.
In the late 1990's, California's treasury was awash in tax receipts from Internet millionaires until the high-technology bubble burst in 2000. Now the state is deep in debt.
California went through a similar cycle a decade ago when the end of the cold war brought a deep recession to the state's aerospace and military industries. Pete Wilson, the governor then, enacted a similar shift of spending to local government.
State laws and ballot initiatives complicated Mr. Davis's task and required more imaginative solutions than simply raising taxes and cutting programs. Proposition 13, passed in 1978, limited local property taxes, forcing the state to raise sales and income taxes to finance many programs. A decade later, voters approved Proposition 98, which requires the state to spend 40 percent of all tax revenues on education. To protect other programs, Mr. Davis had to return all the new tax revenues to the counties or else pour almost half of it into schools.
The one-cent increase in the state sales tax is projected to yield $4.6 billion a year, or roughly $250 per family. Sales taxes in the state are already high, ranging from 7.25 to 8.25 cents on the dollar. 
Mr. Davis also proposed new tax brackets for individuals earning more than $130,000 a year and couples making more than $260,000. Their tax would rise by 1 percent or 2 percent, producing revenue of $2.6 billion.
His plan also calls for a $1.10-a-pack increase in the state cigarette tax, which is now $1 on each pack. That is projected to raise $1.17 billion. State budget analysts said that would discourage smoking and produce a declining revenue stream as consumption continues to drop.
The governor's budget also calls for $1.5 billion in new fees assessed on Indian casinos, which now pay virtually no state taxes. The compacts under which tribes operate gambling halls are up for renegotiation this spring, and state officials are considering the $5 billion-a-year industry as a potential source of significant new revenue. 
The budget plan includes money to provide health-care coverage to 500,000 children, but cuts other parts of the state's Medi-Cal program. An estimated 200,000 people who were enrolled in the program during the boom years would be dropped, and reimbursements to doctors and hospitals would fall by 15 percent. Optometry, physical therapy, hearing aids and hospice care would no longer be covered.
Analysts gave Mr. Davis some credit for proposing tax increases that are certain to be unpopular in the Legislature and among the public. Democrats endorsed the new taxes on the well off, but said that adding to the state's already high sales tax would disproportionately hurt the poor. Republicans complained that the added tax burden would discourage companies from expanding or moving to California.
The battle is just beginning, and, to a large degree, Mr. Davis's legacy hangs in the balance. The outcome will mark either the beginning of his comeback or the final chapter of his 30-year career in electoral politics.
His reputation was tarnished by his handling of the energy crisis of 2000-2001 and by the relentless fund-raising that seemed at times to occupy more of his time than governing. He won re-election two months ago to his second and final term by a narrow margin over an inexperienced and underfinanced challenger, which many took as a sign that any national political ambitions were a fantasy.
"The last election was a real wake-up call for him," said Bruce Cain, director of the Institute for Governmental Studies of the University of California. "He was shocked to see how little affection there is for him in this state."
Mr. Cain said that how Mr. Davis attacks the budget crisis is as important as whether he is successful. He said that Mr. Davis's tendency to blame others and his unfriendly relations with leaders in the State Senate and Assembly will be a severe handicap in coming months.
Mr. Davis has already said he will not seek the presidency in 2004 and he is not considered a likely candidate for vice president. California should be a safely Democratic state and Mr. Davis, at this point, appears to be damaged goods.
And even if he manages to balance the state's budget through luck or adroit politics, Mr. Cain said, "It's possible the damage is irreparable."

HEADLINE: With Companies Still Gloomy, Payrolls Shrink by Thousands 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
The nation continued to bleed tens of thousands of jobs in December, the Labor Department reported yesterday, jolting forecasters who had expected a modest upturn in employment and suggesting that American business remains highly pessimistic about the economic future.
 Payrolls in nonfarm businesses, adjusted to account for normal seasonal variations, dropped by 101,000, and the unemployment rate stayed at 6 percent. The Labor Department also revised the number of jobs lost in November to 88,000 from 40,000. 
 Though cornerstones of economic growth -- like increasing productivity and financial stability -- remain intact, companies have been unwilling to expand production or commit themselves to investments in new equipment that would support job creation. Retail spending and corporate profits have edged upward slightly, but a rush of new jobs still seems a long way off. 
Elaine L. Chao, the secretary of labor, said that higher earnings would have to come first. "The profit picture is not that strong, so that is not an encouragement to business owners to engage in permanent hiring," she said. "Employers are relying on overtime and short-term help."
Analysts said the disappointing job figures were sure to turn up the heat under the debate in Congress about the best way to stimulate growth in the lagging economy.
In a speech delivered after the Labor Department released its report, Vice President Dick Cheney lashed out at critics of the administration's $674 billion tax cut plan, saying that the White House's "jobs and growth" package would not only revive the economy but ultimately cut the budget deficit. Page A12. 
Prominent Democrats, however, said the plan would do little to overcome the severe inertia in the labor market.
"Most economists agree that the Bush plan is not a stimulus plan at all and will not have any real immediate impact on the economy," Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said. "When is President Bush going to realize that job creation needs to be his top priority?"
The roots of the problem may be too ephemeral to attack directly, however. According to business leaders and analysts, deep feelings of uncertainty among corporate executives and consumers alike are holding back an economic resurgence.
"The cycle itself has been of such a different nature -- what C.E.O.'s would complain of as a lack of visibility -- that they don't have a clear mental model of how things might move forward," said Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS Global Asset Management.
Prospects for growth are also being hurt, said Christopher J. Wolfe, United States equity strategist for J. P. Morgan Private Bank, as companies that overextended themselves in the last boom sell assets to pay off debt. Despite low interest rates, Mr. Martin added, many companies worry that taking on more debt to finance investment could lead to worse credit ratings, or even bankruptcy.
The concerns would not be so great, except that businesses are hesitant to rely on further growth in consumers' willingness to spend. Bruised portfolios, terrorism and the risks associated with a war in Iraq are finally taking their toll, said John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, an association of top corporate executives.
"The issue has not been the cost of capital," he said. "The issue has been demand for the products and the services."
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reported that consumer credit had dropped for the first time in four years. The decline of $2.2 billion was the biggest since October 1991.
"We are starting to see more adjustment by the consumer," Mr. Martin said, citing rising savings rates as a threat to demand in the short term. The continuing hemorrhage of jobs could add to consumers' fears, he said.
Manufacturers of long-lasting goods made more heavy cuts last month, with 46,000 positions eliminated. Even if the economy returns to strong growth, those jobs may not return. "All the jobs that have been lost in the United States in manufacturing have essentially been recreated in China," Mr. Wolfe said.
Restaurants and bars cut 63,000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis, signifying a holiday season of muted celebrations -- at least in comparison with those of the recent past.
Unemployment among teenagers fell slightly, to 16.1 percent from 16.8 percent, but joblessness among black workers grew to 11.5 percent, from 11 percent, the highest rate since May 1994. For the average American worker, wages and hours of work per week changed little in December.
In the last two years, the government tried to help the economy mainly by propping up consumers through lower interest rates and cuts in income taxes. On Tuesday, the president proposed a further package of tax cuts worth $674 billion over 10 years, but it is unclear how much consumers' spending would respond to its biggest component, the abolition of the tax on dividends.
"It is exceedingly difficult to parse," Mr. Wolfe said. "We're struggling with the net effect on consumption." His team has estimated that spending may rise by at most $30 billion as a result of the change, he said, "and it's probably a lot less than that, at least in the short run."
Some economists gave the Democratic plan, announced on Monday, a better reception. It would inject $136 billion into the economy, mainly through aid to the states and through tax rebates that can affect spending quickly.
"I agree with the Democratic plan much more than the president's," said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs. "But I would make the Democratic plan a little bigger and extend it into 2004."
Other experts did see some potential for job creation from ending the taxation of dividends. Tracy G. Herrick, chief investment strategist at Jefferies & Company, an investment bank, said that some of the extra cash would flow to well-off small-business owners through their own portfolios. "Small businesses tend to be not investment-intensive," Mr. Herrick said. "They tend to be more people-intensive. The orders come from big companies, and jobs are created by the little companies."
So far, however, the job market has offered little relief to people like Terry Gilliam, who had worked in the hotel industry in Philadelphia and has been looking for a job since July 2001. She is not eligible for the latest extension of unemployment benefits, signed this week by President Bush, because her original benefits ran out in September. About one million Americans are in the same predicament, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington.
"I've been working over 20-something years and having that money taken out of my check," Ms. Gilliam said. "The unemployment fund has billions of dollars in it for this purpose. I don't understand it."
Ms. Gilliam, who said that she had heard about the re-employment accounts that President Bush proposed to reward people looking for new jobs, said that she was already doing everything she could to find work. The number of jobless who have been looking for work for more than six months rose for the fourth month in a row, to 1,856,000 -- the highest level since February 1993.
"I'm looking for anything that I can apply my skills and knowledge to," Ms. Gilliam said from her home in Philadelphia, having returned hours earlier from a job interview. "If I get $3,000, I'll be using it to eat and pay my gas, electric, phone and rent."
Experiences like Ms. Gilliam's notwithstanding, at least one forecaster saw the report on employment in a more positive light.
"Most of the weakness is where we would have expected it, and it's not broadly based," Mr. Herrick, the Jefferies & Company strategist, said. "Things are right on schedule for moderate growth of 3 percent or 3.5 percent for the year as a whole, which wouldn't be that bad at all."

HEADLINE: Number of Inmates on Death Row Declines as Challenges to Justice System Rise 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
For the first time in a generation, the number of inmates on death row has dropped. And the number of new death row inmates in 2001, the most recent year for which comprehensive data is available, was the lowest since 1973.
 Despite enduring and strong popular support for the death penalty, these numbers suggest that those directly involved in the justice system have serious concerns about the way capital punishment is carried out. 
 The nationwide drop in the number of death sentences is the product of several phenomena, including a lower murder rate. But legal experts across the political spectrum agreed that public discomfort with the administration of the system has played a significant role. Scores of exonerations based on DNA and other compelling evidence, recurring disclosures about sloppy or abusive police work and concerns about racial bias have damaged public confidence. 
What Justice Harry A. Blackmun once called the machinery of death, these experts say, is no longer considered terribly effective at delivering either justice or death by many of the people most directly involved in its operation.
Yesterday, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois pardoned four death row inmates who he said were wrongfully convicted. And today, Mr. Ryan is expected to commute the death sentences of many, and possibly all, of the state's death row inmates, about 150, after a review prompted by the exoneration of 13 people who had faced death sentences. Page A13. 
"We're in a period of national reconsideration," said Austin D. Sarat, a professor of political science and law at Amherst College and the author of "When the State Kills: Capital Punishment and the American Condition" (Princeton University Press, 2001). 
"People are asking if the death penalty is compatible with values which in the American mainstream are taken seriously: equal protection, due process, protection of the innocent," Professor Sarat said. "What was played out in Illinois will be played out across the nation."
The number of people on death row had increased consistently and seemingly inexorably for decades. In 2001, though, according to Justice Department statistics released last month, that number, now around 3,600, dropped for the first time since 1976.
Governor Ryan's actions alone make it all but certain that the number will drop further. Recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court will also drive down the number of people on death row, legal experts said.
In Illinois, more death row inmates were exonerated than executed in recent decades. And though the cost of capital trials and appeals can approach $2 million per conviction, only 749 of the 6,754 prisoners on death row nationwide since 1977, or about 11 percent, had been executed by the end of 2001. Many more left death row as a result of appeals court decisions, commutations and death from natural causes.
Even supporters of capital punishment say the declining number of people sentenced to death represents more careful application of the death penalty, though some attribute it to continuing refinements in the justice system rather than a direct reaction to the number of people who have been exonerated.
"It's the product of prosecutors and jurors being more discriminating," said Joshua Marquis, co-chairman of the National District Attorneys Association's Capital Litigation Committee. "Justice is a work in progress."
The trend has more to do with practical problems than bedrock beliefs, said Richard C. Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment.
"It's not a neat or clean picture of moral revolution," Mr. Dieter said. "The death penalty is a government program, and it doesn't work very well."
The number of people entering death row in 2001 was 155, the smallest since 1973, just after the Supreme Court held the death penalty unconstitutional. That was about half the average in the previous seven years. The court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
"The most astonishing fact I have seen in a number of years is the number of people going on death row," said James S. Liebman, a law professor and expert in the death penalty at Columbia. But those numbers, he continued, do not tell the whole story. 
"It's gone down relative to the population," Professor Liebman said. "It's also gone down relative to the homicide rate."
Thirty-eight states and the federal government have death penalty laws. But the majority of death sentences and executions are centered in just a few states. More than half of the people put on death row in 2001 were from four states: Texas, California, Florida and North Carolina. Oklahoma and Texas accounted for more than half of all executions that year.
Some supporters of the death penalty say most of the decline in death sentences is attributable to criminological trends.
"The fact that the murder rate is down accounts for some of the softening," said Kent Scheidegger, the legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. "To some extent it's paradoxical: the death penalty brings down the crime rate and that lessens the need to impose the death penalty."
In 2001, for the first time since 1976, more people left death row than entered it.
While the Justice Department has yet to issue figures for 2002, unofficial counts by groups that oppose the death penalty indicate that the trend continued last year.
Sixty-six people were executed, which is 19 fewer than the previous year and 32 fewer than the recent peak, in 1999, of 98. (In 2002, 71 prisoners were executed.)
Another 90 had their sentences overturned or commuted, and 19 died of natural causes or suicide.
Many more people, then, left death row thanks to the courts and the march of time than because of lethal injections, the only method of execution employed in 2001.
On average, prisoners executed in 2001 had been on death row for almost 12 years. The length of time between sentence and execution has been steadily increasing for decades.
That is largely a function of how careful the system is, Mr. Marquis said. "Death row inmates are drowned in due process," he said.
Even those long-delayed executions were unusual. Most death sentences are never carried out.
Of the 779 people sentenced to death in California in the past four decades, for instance, 10 have been executed.
Professor Liebman, the co-author of a study of appellate decisions in death penalty cases, said 68 percent of death sentences that were appealed in a 20-year period were reversed. By contrast, he said, fewer than 10 percent of first-degree murder convictions are overturned.
Studies from around the country suggest that the costs associated with death penalty cases can add many hundreds of thousands of dollars to the costs in other murder cases. Katherine Baicker, an economist at Dartmouth, found that the average capital conviction costs $1.5 million.
Those costs are not spread evenly around the nation or within some states. They are often borne largely or entirely by individual counties.
But 80 percent of American counties had no death penalty convictions from 1983 to 1997, and another 10 percent had only one, according to a study by Professor Baicker. Even in death penalty states, Professor Liebman said, a majority of counties never use it.
Those that do paid heavily, Professor Baicker said. She found that even a single capital trial caused counties to raise taxes, on average, by 1.6 percent and to decrease spending on things like highways and the police.
In part as a consequence of these costs, Professor Liebman said, "little by little, there are more counties that are tipping into the group that does not use the death penalty anymore."
Mr. Marquis said the scrutiny death sentences deserve is expensive but not a reason to abandon it.
"Justice is not a matter of going, 'Oh, well, it's not cost-efficient,' " Mr. Marquis said.
Forty-three percent of people on death row are black. About 1.5 percent are women. Two percent were 17 or younger when they committed the crimes that resulted in their death sentences. Everyone sentenced to death in 2001 was found guilty of murder.
A number of studies, including one issued this week in Maryland, have concluded that the race of the murder victim plays a large role in determining whether the victim's killer will be executed. The race of the defendant by itself is generally found to be largely irrelevant.
Public support for the death penalty is down from its peak of 80 percent in the middle of the last decade, but by most accounts it is still around of 70 percent.
"Most politicians would give an arm to have ratings that that high," Mr. Scheidegger said.
But Professor Sarat pointed to a second statistic.
"We are also showing 40 to 50 percent saying the death penalty is not administered fairly," he said.
The tension between general support and practical unease is at work, he said, in the national reconsideration of the death penalty.
The compromise position, according to many people, is to institute a moratorium on the death penalty until the system is made more reliable.
Mr. Marquis, of the district attorneys' association, said the moratorium movement's actions represent a tactic rather than a position. 
"It's an act of real moral cowardice," he said. "A moratorium is a moral dodge. If you don't like the death penalty, then abolish it."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE DEPENDENTS; 
With Stitches and Concerns, Base Town Prepares for War

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN 

DATELINE: HINESVILLE, Ga., Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The needles are flying, the sewing machines are chugging and the uniforms are piling up. In heaps.
 Abraham. Baca. Chambers. Courtland. 
 "I try to say a prayer every stitch," says Curley Bradley, pumping her pedal and attaching a name tag to the breast of a jacket.
Davis. Delvin. Finocchiaro.
"You do it with love," says Janice Mann, another seamstress, clipping a thread. "Even if you think war is stupid." 
May. McCall. McDaniel. McGee.
"Names, names, names," says Tina Peavey, manager of Ranger Joe's surplus shop. "We're so darn busy, you almost forget they're people."
It's 10:15 p.m. and there are still acres of creamy desert fatigues to go for the 12,500 soldiers pushing off for the Middle East. The three women, hunched in a back room of the surplus shop, have been labeling uniforms since sunup. One cuts, one measures, one sews.
Not far away, a young cashier cries behind the counter of the Flash Foods minimart. A little girl twirls in a pink princess shirt, asking for Daddy. Artillery rumbles.
This is the anxious deployment dance before the big, long hush. 
The Army's entire Third Infantry Division, based at Fort Stewart, is leaving, and few corners of the country are turned as inside out by the showdown with Iraq as Hinesville, Ga.
It is a little town with a big base, a place where the military creates the weather townsfolk live in.
"When Hinesville breathes in, Fort Stewart breathes out," said Allen Brown, a real estate broker whose apartment business has already been hurt because of the deployment. "That's how close we are."
In the span of just a few weeks, Fort Stewart will go from 19,700 active duty soldiers to 3,000. That includes the deployment of the three main brigades of the Third Division and several other units, like Ranger and military intelligence troops, who are stationed here.
After the Third Division was dispatched to Saudi Arabia for the Persian Gulf war, many businesses here went under. It was not just soldiers who marched off. Young wives skipped town. Kids dropped out of school. The streets looked like they had been cleared by a hurricane.
"It was so bad, Wal-Mart closed at 8," said Galaxy Morey, a barber. "The place was a ghost town."
This time, the Army is trying to break the cycle. Fort Stewart officials are pushing for families to stay, offering counseling, day care and take-your-mind-off-things events, including baked potato parties where you bring your own topping.
"The support is here," said Lucia Braxton, chief of Army community services.
Hinesville leaders are jumping in. The fight against terrorism means longer deployments, and many business owners -- grocer, banker, sandwich maker -- have banded together to offer discounts to military families who stay. McDonald's is giving away -- what else? -- apple pie.
"Will it work? I don't know," said Rodney Riley, owner of Elrod's bar and grill. "We're still going to have to cut back. All of us. To survive."
Deployment eventually comes full cycle. When thousands of soldiers returned from the gulf war, it sparked a building boom. More houses. More jobs. More attractions, like a seven-screen cinema and a Ruby Tuesday's restaurant. Since then, the city's population has grown by half, to 32,000 from 21,000.
The story is similar, though maybe not as extreme, at many other military installations across the country. Bases are often in rural areas nourished by the military presence. Places like Columbus, Ga., home to Fort Benning, and Fayetteville, N.C., home to Fort Bragg, are bracing for their own local recessions as troops get called up and barracks empty.
Mitchell. Moore. Morris. Nguyen. Ortez.
The bulk of soldiers at Fort Stewart, a flat, woodsy area about 30 miles west of Savannah, are just beginning to pull out. The Third Infantry Division, known as Rock of the Marne for a famous battle in World War I, is split into three main brigades. One has been in Kuwait since November. Another is flying out of Fort Benning this week. The final brigade is expected to deploy within two weeks. The tanks, bulldozers, helicopters and howitzers have already been shipped.
This week the base was crawling with activity. On Wednesday, a battalion of combat engineers sorted gear in front of television news crews. The brooms, axes, poles, tents and ammunition boxes seemed surprisingly low tech for the most modern military in the world. One soldier boxed up a set of giant metal hooks.
Platt. Prevo. Reeves. Rose. Ruschenberg.
In 1990, after the Third Division was dispatched on short notice, Hinesville's used-car lots and barbershops were the first to fold. Next came mom-and-pop restaurants. Banks tried to help and accepted a moratorium on loans. Still, 35 Hinesville businesses closed in 1990, compared with 23 the year before.
"In a lot of places, war is an abstraction," Mayor Tom Ratcliffe said. "Not Hinesville."
Part of the reason for the downturn was that many military families left the area. About 90 percent of the wives of junior enlisted men went home to their families, said Ms. Braxton, the community services chief.
"It was awful," she said. "But it was partly our fault. Base officers didn't give any knowledge. They just took the soldiers away and told the wives, 'We'll fill you in later.' "
This time, it is different. The e-mail lists and phone trees are complete. The spouse support clubs (mostly wives) are up and running. Over all, the efforts to persuade families to stay seem to be working, even though this mission seems to be less popular than 1990's.
"I'm hearing it a lot," said Ms. Braxton, who has been in the military 18 years. "We're putting more people in danger this time around, with less reason."
Many soldiers spoke of chemical weapons, which could be part of Saddam Hussein's arsenal should the United States invade Iraq. "Nerve agent," said Staff Sgt. John Tice, 32. "All you need is a drop."
Smith. Snowden. Soto. Stewart. Szepietowski.
Cindy Horne, mother of three, is getting ready to be a single parent. Her husband, a major in the engineer battalion, is leaving.
"He warned, 'Don't count on me for the year,' " Ms. Horne said.
It will be hard to sit down at the dinner table without him. Or climb into an empty bed. "Who will I share my thoughts with?" she asked.
Her 3-year-old daughter, Rheagan, bounced on the couch and asked if she could put on her T-shirt with the princesses on it.
"Daddy likes it," she said.
The loneliness is too much for some. Jessica Levesque, a 26-year-old kindergarten teacher and wife of an air defense specialist, is quitting her job and leaving Hinesville after her husband ships out.
"I don't want to be alone," Ms. Levesque said. "When it's 3 a.m. and my baby's screaming, who's going to help me?" She has decided to move in with her mother, in Connecticut.
Ms. Morey, the barber, estimated that 95 percent of her customers were being deployed.
She is headed to San Diego.
"Got a friend who lives near some base, and I'll start there," she said. "Unless those guys are leaving, too."
Teaseley. Thorton. Valentino. Zeldenrust.
At Ranger Joe's, special sewing machines blurt out one inch-high capital letters. The name tags keep coming. Thousands of soldiers are bringing uniforms to this little shop just outside base gates because regulations call for jackets, helmets and bulletproof vests to be labeled. Most soldiers have at least four sets of fatigues.
As daylight drains from the forests and evening comes, artillery training begins. People here are used to thunder on a crystal-clear night.
"Oh, don't mind that," Ms. Mann said, about the booms. "Our boys are just getting ready to go off and kill somebody."

HEADLINE: Supreme Court to Review Nike Case in Major Look at Free Speech Rights of Companies 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court, accepting its most important case in years on the free speech rights of companies, agreed today to review a California decision holding Nike potentially liable for damages for any false or misleading statements it makes in defense of its overseas business practices.
 The California Supreme Court's 4-to-3 decision last May reinstated a private citizen's suit against Nike under California's unfair trade practice and false advertising law. The decision alarmed companies throughout the country for its expansive definition of "commercial speech," which under the United States Supreme Court's precedents can be subject to government regulation of the sort that the First Amendment would ordinarily prohibit. 
 Because the case has not yet gone to trial in the California courts, the factual basis for the accusations against Nike made by the plaintiff, Marc Kasky, has not been established. Mr. Kasky has asserted that in news releases, various publications including op-ed articles, and on its own Web site, Nike has made false and misleading statements in describing the working conditions in its overseas factories where its athletic shoes are made. 
The law permits an individual to bring suit as a "private attorney general" on behalf of the public. Mr. Kasky, a 58-year-old San Franciscan, seeks a court order requiring Nike to disgorge its California profits attributable to these statements. Under the California law, truth is not a defense to a charge of business fraud if the challenged statements are misleading in context.
Ordinarily, the Supreme Court would not accept an appeal in a case in which there has been no trial or final resolution in the lower courts. So the grant of review at this point in the case, Nike Inc. v. Kasky, No. 02-575, signified that the justices viewed the legal issue as unusually important, regardless of the facts or posture of the case. The appeal will be argued in April.
Both sides agree that if Nike's statements were regarded as political rather than commercial speech, they would be "immune from state regulation" and there would be no case, as Mr. Kasky's lawyers conceded in the California court. So the case turns on the definition of commercial speech and how that definition should apply to corporate expression that while clearly self-interested, is not advertising in the traditional sense and that addresses issues of broad societal interest.
Nike has maintained throughout the case that it is speaking as a participant in a wide-ranging debate about the effects of globalization, and that it should no more face liability for what it says in that context than a politician, editorial writer or any other participant in the debate. The company told the court in its brief that the state court's decision was the equivalent of "viewpoint discrimination by government" because it gave Nike's critics free rein while disabling the company from fully participating in "a live and pressing public debate on a matter of international significance."
Mr. Kasky maintains in response that the statements he is challenging were made simply "for the commercial purpose of selling shoes," as he told the Supreme Court in his brief opposing Nike's appeal. He said Nike's purpose "was to maintain and increase its sales and profits by appealing to consumers opposed to inhumane manufacturing practices," and as such should have no higher constitutional standing than ordinary advertising.
Under the Supreme Court's precedents, advertising along with other speech deemed "commercial" occupies a lower rung of the First Amendment, permitting it to be regulated or even prohibited if necessary to prevent the public from being misled.
The California Supreme Court's majority agreed, concluding that application of the business fraud law to Nike's speech was no different from ordinary consumer protection policies that bar companies from making false and misleading statements about the origin and character of a product. The California court applied a three-part test for commercial speech: speech made by those "engaged in commerce"; aimed at an audience that included "actual and potential purchasers"; and that included "representations of fact of a commercial nature."
Nike's challenged statements, including assertions that its business practices were ethical and that its employment policies provided economic and political benefits in the third world, met all three parts of the test and could incur liability to the extent that they could be proven false or misleading, the California court said.
The United States Supreme Court's own definition of commercial speech has been in flux for some time, but appears to be a good deal narrower, at least in some recent formulations. A 2001 decision referred to commercial speech as speech "that does no more than propose a commercial transaction." There is a lively debate within the court over whether to elevate commercial speech to full First Amendment status. With Justice Clarence Thomas the leading exponent of this view, this is one First Amendment issue that does not follow ordinary liberal-conservative lines.
In a dissenting opinion in the California Supreme Court, a conservative justice, Janice Brown, urged the justices in Washington to reconsider their "dichotomous, all-or-nothing approach" to commercial versus noncommercial speech. "Due to the growing politicization of commercial matters and the increased sophistication of advertising campaigns, the intersection between commercial and noncommercial speech has become larger and larger," she wrote.
The New York Times Company was one of 32 publishing and broadcasting organizations filing a brief on behalf of Nike, which is represented by Prof. Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School and Walter Dellinger, a former acting solicitor general, among other lawyers.
The justices granted review in nine cases today. Among the others was an insurance industry challenge to California's Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief Act, which set up a registry of information on insurance policies issued to Holocaust victims. The 1999 law requires all insurance companies doing business in California to provide detailed information about policies that they or related companies sold in Europe between 1920 and 1945, including the policy holder, beneficiaries and to whom the proceeds were paid.
The issue in the case, American Insurance Association v. Low, No. 722, is whether the law exceeds the state's authority or impermissibly interferes with foreign policy. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, rejected the industry's challenge. The Bush administration urged that the law be declared unconstitutional.

HEADLINE: STATE BUDGET GAP PUT AT $10 BILLION 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
With December tax collections more dismal than anticipated and the state falling short in attempts to reduce its work force, New York now has a budget gap far larger than the Pataki administration had forecast, a high-ranking administration official said today.
 In releasing information about the December tax receipts, the administration official revealed for the first time that Gov. George E. Pataki must close a budget gap of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in the year ending on April 1 and at least $10 billion in the next fiscal year. The gap is still impossible to gauge precisely, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The gap is even larger that fiscal watchdogs had anticipated. 
 The official said the state was experiencing its deepest revenue shortfall in decades. The state's budget is $89.6 billion this year; Mr. Pataki has pledged to reduce spending next year.
The new state figures were disclosed as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg grappled with New York City's fiscal problems, saying that the city might have to lay off police officers for the first time in nearly 30 years to help balance its budget. Page B1. 
The steep decline in state revenue heightens the likelihood of profound cuts in services when Mr. Pataki presents his executive budget in three weeks. The weak revenues make it harder for Mr. Pataki to keep his pledge to avoid layoffs as well, unless more state workers take early retirement, the official said. 
The governor intends to balance the state's budget next year without raising broad-based taxes, like those on corporate profits and personal income, the official said, though Mr. Pataki has not ruled out raising fees, tuition or other surcharges.
The administration will encourage more state workers to retire early over the next two months, because the governor's plan to shrink the work force through a hiring freeze and buyouts has failed to reach its goals, the official said. About 2,500 jobs have been pared from the payroll since the hiring freeze in late 2001, a budget official said, or half what the governor had counted on. 
Mr. Pataki will also redouble his efforts to persuade legislative leaders to authorize about $4 billion in bonds backed by money from a court settlement with tobacco companies. That money would be used as a cushion to allow the state to shrink spending gradually over two years, the official said.
The $10 billion gap in next year's budget will be harder to close than the current year's deficit, which was originally $6.8 billion, because Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders have already used up most of the state's reserves. This year's budget spent at least $4 billion in savings and other one-time revenues. The state currently has only $710 million in reserve funds.
The latest tax collection figures confirm what Republican leaders in the Senate, prominent Democrats, bond raters and budget analysts had argued before the November election: that the budget rested on unrealistic revenue forecasts because the economic downturn had lasted longer than the budget passed last May had envisioned.
Critics on both the left and the right have charged in recent weeks that the governor purposely masked the severity of the state's fiscal crisis in the months leading up to the Nov. 5 election, which he won in a landslide. Among others, the Democratic candidate, H. Carl McCall, said the signs of the state's crumbling tax base were clear before Election Day. 
Mr. Pataki, however, has maintained that his revenue predictions were reasonable. He has argued that a year ago most economists were forecasting that the economy would rebound in the second half of 2002. He has also attributed the deepening crisis to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and its ripple effects in the national economy, rather than his policies. 
"This fallout has turned out to be much more severe and drawn out than virtually every economist had predicted just six months ago," the governor said in his annual message to the Legislature on Wednesday. 
As late as mid-October, the governor and his aides were expressing confidence that this year's spending plan would hold together, though they voiced some minor worries about the last four months of the fiscal year. That is when 40 percent of tax revenues usually come into state coffers.
Two weeks after Mr. Pataki won the election, however, his budget director ordered agencies to cut their spending by 5 percent and acknowledged that the state's finances were shaky. Then, in early December, the governor said for the first time that the state would face a shortfall in the current year of up to $2 billion. Now, the December tax revenues suggest the shortfall will exceed that.
In October, Mr. Pataki's budget officials braced themselves for a steep drop-off in income tax in December because the securities industry had projected Wall Street bonuses would be about a third less than in the previous year. But the bonuses turned out to even smaller than budget makers thought, dropping more than 40 percent.
Over all, tax collections in December were $1.3 billion less than the administration had predicted two months earlier. Income taxes came in at $950 million less than expected, corporate taxes were down $350 million and the sluggish Christmas season translated into $60 million less in sales taxes.
"We were expecting to take a hit," the senior official said, "but this was a hammer."
Offsetting the slump in revenues is about $380 million in savings the heads of state agencies have squeezed from their operations through the hiring freeze and other economies, the official said.

HEADLINE: On the Sidewalk: No Contraptions, Please 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thanks to San Francisco for banning the Segway scooter from its sidewalks ("Whose Sidewalk Is It, Anyway?," Week in Review, Jan. 5). 
 Since the dawn of civilization, streets have been the principal public space of every community. Sidewalks are a relatively recent modification of the urban streetscape intended to segregate walkers from motorized travelers, greatly privileging the latter while diminishing community life, public health, economic vitality and environmental quality. 
 Pedestrians are besieged enough in their already meager sidewalk ghetto, without the additional hazard of pricey high-speed scooters like the Segway. 
Revitalizing our cities begins with reclaiming public space to enhance social interaction. And this begins with defending our fundamental right to free movement -- to walk.

HEADLINE: ON HOCKEY; 
Senators and Sabres Feeling Economic Pinch

BYLINE:  By Joe Lapointe 

 BODY:
Like two wet skate boots, the financially troubled Ottawa Senators and the Buffalo Sabres keep clop-clopping across the National Hockey League's front hallway, leaving messy money puddles. Commissioner Gary Bettman wields the mop to keep things clean and dry. But the words bankruptcy and debt seep like cold air from a drafty door. The money woes worsen the wind-chill factor as this sport shivers in a difficult winter.
 This week, the Senators gained temporary bankruptcy protection in a Canadian court to avoid another payless payday as they seek new ownership. And on Friday, the prospective new owners of the Sabres received another one-week extension from the N.H.L. as the group tries for taxpayer backing from New York State. The league has operated the team since the previous owner, John J. Rigas, was led away in handcuffs. 
 Certainly hockey is not the only sport feeling economic recession. Empty seats, which were plentiful at many college football bowl games, have been seen at National Basketball Association games. But the N.H.L.'s situation demonstrates most vividly what can happen when a sport's reach exceeds its grasp.
With confidence and ambition, the N.H.L. grew to 30 teams in 2000 from 21 teams in 1991. It was similar to hockey's expansion era of 1967 to 1974, when the N.H.L. grew to 18 teams from 6 and the 14-team World Hockey Association emerged. With franchises stretching from the Florida tropics to the Alberta tundra, the current N.H.L. unleashed supply-and-demand forces. Despite a 15-week lockout in 1994-95, the average wage rose to $1.64 million from $733,000.
The average ticket price is $41.56 and attendance is down slightly this season. Winning teams in core cities like Chicago and Boston play before many empty rows. Although he now vows to save Canadian teams, Bettman eagerly orchestrated the move of the Quebec Nordiques to Denver and the Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix. The broader geographic footprint across the continent was supposed to excite a wider television market.
But nights of television exposure have been significantly reduced this season on ESPN and ESPN2. On the major network, ABC's limited exposure -- five games -- begins on Saturday, with the Rangers at Pittsburgh in the New York market. Now you see them, now you don't.
The television contract will end after next season and so will the collective bargaining agreement with the N.H.L. Players Association. Common wisdom holds that another lockout looms. Ottawa and Buffalo add gloom and doom to this backdrop and put Bettman in a delicate position. If he uses these problems as bargaining leverage, the negativity comes back to what has been portrayed as his success story.
On one hand, the N.H.L. says revenues have increased 600 percent during Bettman's 10-year administration, to almost $2 billion this season. On the other hand, the league said player salaries take up 73 percent of the revenue, and that is far too much. But Bettman did that deal and extended it. Until recently, franchise values were rising and the four most recent expansion teams each sold for $80 million.
But deeply discounted prices for Buffalo and Ottawa could lower everyone's property values. Would it be so bad for the league to lose two or more teams? Would it not enhance the competition and quality of play? And fewer jobs might lower the average wage and make another lockout unnecessary.
"No, not necessarily," said Bettman, who wants 30 teams and the cost certainty of a salary cap. "We have an inflationary system. If you had the right system in place, we wouldn't have these issues." He said revenues and TV ratings are up, but "teams are going to struggle to make it to 2004."
In that case, wouldn't a lockout endanger other underfinanced franchises like Buffalo and Ottawa, which are trying to service their debt? "No," Bettman said. Although the league said most teams were not as desperate as the Sabres and the Senators, Bettman nevertheless described the N.H.L. as "an industry that has profound problems that are attributable to the rapid rise in player salaries."
Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the union, said these arguments are the same sort of posturing heard in 1994, when Bettman and the owners unsuccessfully sought artificial restraints on wages. Goodenow said the problems of the Senators had nothing to do with Ottawa's payroll, which, at $29 million, is about $10 million below the league average. The Senators' record on the ice is among the best.
"The Ottawa thing has been a ticking time bomb for years," Goodenow said, referring to the debt load that began with the 1992 entry of the Senators as an expansion team. "It was strictly a house of cards. It was a matter of time. It finally caught up with them. They are successful on the ice and from a cash-flow point of view. The team generates tons of money. They just cannot support the crushing debt load."
As for the league's contention that its 30 teams pay 73 percent of their $2 billion of revenue in player salaries, Goodenow said: "The owners have decided to pay the players whatever the salaries happen to be. That's not spin. That's market reality."
In the meantime, the Senators remain a talented, successful team on the ice. They skate with zest and flair. Their home arena is modern and one of the best and so is their anthem singer. Even their uniforms look sharp. Assuming their paychecks clear, the Senators may soon play near you. Good tickets are probably available, if you can afford them.

 Canadian industry created 58,000 jobs in December and an unexpectedly large 559,600 jobs in all of 2002, driving domestic employment growth to a 15-year high, Statistics Canada said. The Canadian figures, in sharp contrast to the shrinking labor market in the United States, showed that the number of people working rose 3.7 percent, the highest rate since 1987. December's unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.5 percent, the agency said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Official to Discuss Trade; Africa Hopes to Discuss AIDS 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
When Ambassador Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, travels to southern Africa next week, new free trade agreements will take up most of his agenda.
 But he will be met by activists in street protests and officials in conference rooms who will be asking tough questions about American policies on AIDS and farm subsidies. 
 Specifically, African countries are concerned that the United States blocked a trade deal last month that would have allowed poor countries to import generic versions of patented medicines, and they question why American farmers continue to receive huge subsidies. 
African officials quietly say they are insulted that Mr. Zoellick, a junior member of the Bush cabinet, is representing the United States rather than the president, who was scheduled to attend the Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum in Mauritius. President Bush scrapped the trip last month as the administration appeared to step up preparations for a possible war in Iraq.
"We were very sad when we learned that President Bush wouldn't travel to Africa and witness the devastation wrought by AIDS-related illness," said Zackie Achmant, president of the Treatment Action Campaign of South Africa.
At his first stop, in Pretoria, South Africa, Mr. Zoellick will meet with trade ministers of Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland in advance of formal talks in February to create a free trade zone in southern Africa with the United States.
Mr. Zoellick said in a statement that a future free trade zone would "give new hope and economic opportunity to the people of southern Africa by increasing trade, creating new jobs, boosting economic growth and development."
Absent from Mr. Zoellick's list of goals for his trip was any mention of the H.I.V.-AIDS pandemic. "Free trade doesn't work for the dead," said Asia Russell, director of international policy of the nonprofit Health Global Access Project. "A modest expansion of trade will be of little comfort to millions of Africans who will die of treatable illnesses."
Ministers at the World Trade Organization failed to resolve the dispute over providing impoverished countries with access to life-saving medicine in talks last month when the United States insisted on limiting access to medicines that treat malaria, tuberculosis and H.I.V./AIDS and a restricted list of other infectious diseases. 
At issue is a draft agreement that would allow pharmaceutical companies in developing nations to export generic versions of patented drugs to countries too poor to make the medicine themselves. The corporations holding the patents would not be consulted. The European Union suggested on Thursday that the draft agreement would expand the list of diseases to at least 22 diseases.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Crisis Complicates Iraq Situation, Experts Say 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO and NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The crisis in Venezuela is creating major new complications for the Bush administration's campaign to oust President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, causing oil shortages that would probably make a Persian Gulf war more costly to the economy than once anticipated, American officials and industry experts said.
 The 40-day strike has virtually shut down Venezuela's oil industry, the fifth-largest in the world, and proven more difficult to resolve than the administration expected, the officials said. 
 Efforts to end the stalemate between President Hugo Chavez and his opponents have been hamstrung not only by the intransigence of both sides in Venezuela, but also mistrust toward American diplomats, the officials added.
Venezuela has for decades been one of the most dependable sources of petroleum for the United States, where industry analysts say the strike has already hurt some refineries and driven up the retail price of gasoline by at least a dime a gallon.
Those shortages will only worsen, and prices continue to rise, if the United States attacks Iraq, they predicted. That means that war in the Persian Gulf could prove more costly to the American economy than had been projected if the Venezuelan standoff is not ended soon. 
For that reason the Bush administration has been debating plans to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which contains nearly 600 million gallons of crude. For now, though, the White House has decided to defer those plans, mainly to keep oil available in case of war in Iraq, administration officials said.
"A few months ago everybody thought that if we went to war in Iraq oil wouldn't be a major problem, because there was enough spare capacity to make up for lost Iraqi oil," said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc., a research organization. "But no one then was contemplating lost Venezuelan oil."
"Now," he said, "we won't have enough spare capacity to take care of both those events."
The crisis could be compounded if President Chavez follows through on a proposal to split the government-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., into two parts and restructure its central offices.
American officials say Mr. Chavez's true goal is to install political loyalists in place of the union leaders and senior managers at the oil company, known as PDVSA, who have joined the strike.
The result could be a more pliable but less efficient company that produces less oil than the roughly three million barrels a day that Venezuela produced before the strike, officials and experts said. That could leave the United States even more dependent on Middle Eastern oil, the experts said.
"Petroleos is one of the few state-owned oil companies in the OPEC group that approximates a normal integrated major oil company," said Leonidas P. Drollas, chief economist with the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. Echoing other industry analysts, Mr. Drollas added, "To break it up into anything sounds obviously politically motivated."
The Bush administration, acknowledging the growing danger from the Venezuelan strike, has stepped up its efforts to calm the oil markets, lobbying major oil exporters to increase production. At a meeting in Vienna this weekend, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to vote to increase production by 8.7 percent, or nearly two million barrels a day, officials said.
The United States is also working with Mexico, Brazil and the Organization of American States to cobble together a coalition of South American governments to broker a truce. Diplomats working on the crisis are worried that the O.A.S., which has spearheaded negotiations, lacks the influence to persuade Mr. Chavez to consider concessions.
That will be a topic of discussion when foreign ministers and heads of states from Latin American countries gather in Quito next week for the inauguration of Ecuador's new president.
But senior Venezuelan officials have already expressed suspicions about the administration's intentions. 
"We trust that the United States will not take a stand that will divide this country into pro-Americans and anti-Americans," Venezuela's foreign minister, Roy Chaderton, said in an interview. "We want them to respect that this is a democratically elected government."
The Venezuelan Constitution allows for a recall vote halfway through a president's term, which in Mr. Chavez's case would be August. The opposition has said that is too late.
The Constitution could be amended by the national legislature to allow for earlier elections, but Mr. Chavez has rejected that idea. A third option would be a nonbinding referendum on Mr. Chavez's popularity in February. The opposition is proceeding with plans for one, but Mr. Chavez has challenged its constitutionality.
American officials say they do not care which electoral option is accepted, as long as an agreement is reached that ends the violent confrontations that have been occurring and allows renewed oil production.
"This is an incredibly important moment in Venezuelan history," a senior State Department official said. "Things are happening now that are going to affect Venezuela for decades: its energy relationship with the United States, the structure of PDVSA, the integrity and credibility of its democratic institutions -- all of these things are at stake."
But many Latin American experts say the administration's efforts have been too little, too late. They contend that the Bush administration, distracted by Iraq, allowed Venezuela's problems to fester.
Others say the administration committed two blunders last year that have hurt its credibility with Mr. Chavez and other Latin American leaders: in April, by appearing to endorse an attempted coup against the Chavez government, and in December by briefly joining the opposition's call for early elections.
In addition, the State Department's Latin America desk has been leaderless through much of the strike. The last assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, Otto J. Reich, was reassigned in November after his temporary appointment expired. The White House intends to nominate Roger F. Noriega, the representative to the Organization of American States, to replace him.
"There is no one at the wheel here," asserted Moises Naim, the Venezuelan who is the editor of Foreign Policy magazine.
Some oil analysts argue that the administration should have moved faster to stabilize the oil market. Those analysts, along with some members of Congress, have urged the administration to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Even a relatively modest "loan" of 20 million to 30 million barrels to American refineries would stabilize prices and ease short-term disruptions, giving the OPEC countries time to ramp up production. It typically takes 30 to 45 days for Persian Gulf oil to reach the United States.
The impact of the Venezuelan crisis has been widely underestimated by officials and consumers, oil experts said. Venezuela once exported 2.7 million barrels a day, 1.5 million barrels of that going to United States, or about 14 percent of America's crude oil imports.
Now, Venezuela says it is producing about 600,000 barrels a day, though outside experts estimate the volume at less than 400,000 barrels. 
That means that more than two million barrels a day of Venezuelan crude have been removed from the global market, making this the worst disruption in supply since the Persian Gulf war of 1991, experts said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 14, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the effect of the political crisis in Venezuela on the Bush administration's campaign to oust President Saddam Hussein of Iraq misstated the size of the United States' strategic petroleum reserve, which could be used to offset a loss of oil from Venezuela or the Middle East. It is about 600 million barrels (about 25 billion gallons), not 600 million gallons.

HEADLINE: Police Layoffs Are Possible, Mayor Says 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg acknowledged yesterday that for the first time in nearly 30 years the city might have to lay off police officers to help balance the budget.
 Mr. Bloomberg had told the department, which is already to lose 1,900 officers through attrition by July, to try to cut spending by an additional 3 percent, or about $94 million. 
 That would mean a reduction of 1,450 more officers unless the department, which spends 95 percent of its budget on personnel, can save money by adjusting scheduling, lowering overtime costs or other measures.
A reduction of 1,450 officers would shrink the force to about 36,000, a level unseen since the mid-1990's, city officials said. 
Mr. Bloomberg said on his weekly radio program that if the existing police staff could "do more with less, then we won't need layoffs."
"If we can't find ways, or everybody can't agree on ways to do that, it will probably come down to that," he said.
Mr. Bloomberg's words came two days after Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly made a similar warning about the possible effects of the latest round of mandated cuts. On Wednesday, Mr. Kelly said, "it would be very difficult" to achieve the 3 percent cuts without resorting to layoffs.
The Bloomberg administration has been trying to persuade the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the police officers' union, to accept various money-saving measures, including shorter shifts and more of them, but the union has resisted.
Patrick J. Lynch, the union's president, declined to comment yesterday, but early in the week he said that the Police Department must be exempt from any more cuts because without sufficient officers the city would not be viable for people or businesses.
But Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that he would continue to expect spending reductions from all agencies, including the Police Department. "There is nothing sacred," he said, adding, "We can have greater cuts in some areas rather than others even though we don't like it, but you do have priorities."
City Hall officials said yesterday that there was probably some wiggle room in the 3 percent goal for the Police Department, but not much.
Mr. Bloomberg has given continual assurances that the city will spend whatever it needs to keep the streets safe. But his comments have nonetheless raised concerns that the city's extraordinary gains in fighting crime could erode. The gains came as the force was significantly expanded in the 1990's.
Crime has continued to decline even though the size of the department has notched down since its peak of 40,710 in 2001, but the talk of possible layoffs comes as officials continue to stake the city's future on maintaining its status as the country's safest large city.
At a conference this week on how to lure businesses to the city to aid in its economic recovery, Mr. Bloomberg said that the low crime rate should be emphasized in the sales pitch. At the same time, that reputation stands to be tested as the city seeks to be host to more large events, like the 2004 Republican National Convention and the 2012 Summer Olympics.
It was not immediately clear yesterday whether Mr. Bloomberg's comments were a continuation of his message to labor unions that layoffs would be the price of insufficient productivity savings, a warning signal to New Yorkers and others about possible staff reductions to come, or a plea to Albany and Washington for financial aid.
"Obviously everyone wants to make it clear that we're in a fiscal crisis," said Michael Jacobson, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who was a deputy budget director for public safety issues during the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins. "So even raising the specter of police layoffs is a sign of the seriousness of the situation."
"You really have to scour every bit of your budget," he said. "All of the rhetoric aside, no one is going to lightly lay off police officers without looking at every penny and making sure that there's nothing else to cut."
Some experts who have closely studied the Police Department budget say it has already reached that point, although City Hall officials maintain that there are other areas ripe for reductions.
"At a time when the city faces a multibillion-dollar budget gap, all agencies should consider cost savings a top priority," said Chris Policano, chief spokesman for the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller. "For the police this means getting its overtime under control and staffing administrative positions with civilians. Those are the areas that the police should be looking at instead of talking about layoffs."
But if the mayor is issuing a cry for help, he is unlikely to see much from the state. Administration officials released figures yesterday showing that the December tax receipts were worse than budget officials had projected and that attempts to cut the work force was short by 1,000 workers, leaving the state with larger budget gaps this year and next than had been estimated.
The city, too, is in a bind. This week Mark Page, the city's budget director, asked most agencies to suggest ways to cut their budgets by an additional 6 percent for the 2004 fiscal year, which begins in July.
Bloomberg officials have said that this latest round of cuts, which could yield $500 million, is needed because the City Council approved an 18.5 percent tax increase rather than the 25 percent sought by the administration, and because of continued sluggishness in the economy. The Police Department, along with other uniformed services and the Department of Education, was asked to shave its budget by 3 percent.
Although salaries make up the bulk of departmental spending in other agencies, Mr. Bloomberg emphasized that it was especially true in the Police Department.
"The Police Department in particular is virtually all salaries," he said. "Ninety-five percent of the $3 billion we spend on the Police Department goes to pay its great employees.
"Some have a lot of equipment and that sort of thing, so it's less in other areas," Mr. Bloomberg continued, referring to other city agencies. "Police, other than police cars and some station houses and guns, you know, fundamentally it's an organization built around people only."
Mr. Bloomberg showed a willingness to spare the Police Department the brunt of earlier-round cuts; last October the uniformed departments were left out of a request for agencies to cut 2 percent of their budgets. That request, one official said, followed the Police and Fire Departments' struggles to meet the initial reduction target of 7.5 percent.
Peter F. Vallone Jr., chairman of the Council's Public Safety Committee, said "further cuts are completely unacceptable, especially if you're going to attempt to implement something like Operation Impact."
"You need officers to do that," he added, "and you don't have them."
Mr. Vallone was referring to a new program that will flood crime-ridden neighborhoods, subway stops and housing projects later this month with 1,400 police officers fresh from the Police Academy, almost the number of officers whose salaries would constitute the 3 percent target.
Mr. Vallone added that he had scheduled a meeting of his committee for Feb. 11 to look into staffing levels.

HEADLINE: Cheney Returns Fire In Battle On Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney struck back today at critics of President Bush's $674 billion economic plan, saying the proposal was not geared to the rich, would not hurt state budgets and would not increase the federal deficit over time.
 In his first public comments about the plan, which the administration is preparing to sell aggressively in coming weeks, the vice president also said that while eliminating the deficit was an important goal, Americans needed to put the government's red ink "in perspective." The deficit of $159 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was only 1.5 percent of the national economy, he noted. 
 Ultimately, he asserted, Mr. Bush's big new plan for tax cuts will generate economic growth that will reduce deficits over the next decade. 
"Clearly, acting now to promote growth and to prevent even larger deficits in the future is the economic sensible thing to do," Mr. Cheney said in a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce.
The vice president's remarks reflected the tax-cutting, supply-side beliefs of the president's conservative supporters and placed him in direct opposition to a central economic philosophy of the Clinton administration: to put deficit reduction first as a way of bringing down interest rates and so creating an economic boom.
Mr. Cheney spoke at the chamber's headquarters, on the edge of Lafayette Park. It is a short walk from the White House, where advisers were developing a major public relations strategy to convince Americans of the merits of the president's plan.
Players on Mr. Bush's economic team are soon to be dispatched around the country. Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans will push the plan at a factory in Paducah, Ky., on Monday, for example, and Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, will speak to the Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday.
But Mr. Cheney, who rarely speaks in a big Washington forum, is the most senior official aside from the president to push the plan, and his speech suggests the high priority the White House is placing on what it calls its "jobs and growth" package.
In that speech, Mr. Cheney disputed the criticism that the proposal's central provision, elimination of the tax that shareholders pay on dividends, was focused on benefiting the rich. 
"The fact is that 54 million Americans own stocks that pay dividends," Mr. Cheney said, his remarks delivered in even, measured tones that were not interrupted once for applause. "Moreover, 45 percent of all dividend recipients make under $50,000 a year."
Another criticism of the plan has been that eliminating the tax on dividends would cost the states revenue, because their income tax laws are generally tied to federal law. But the vice president estimated that increased economic growth created by the president's proposal would raise annual state revenue by some $6 billion, more than offsetting the amount lost to the dividend provision.
The president's program, Mr. Cheney said, will encourage consumer spending, lift confidence in the financial markets and help the unemployed.
Mr. Bush announced the plan in Chicago on Tuesday and immediately drew a firestorm of criticism from Democrats, who said he was rewarding his wealthiest supporters and engaging in class warfare. By Thursday, even Republicans were saying on Capitol Hill that he would have to compromise to get his plan through Congress.
Today Tom Daschle, the Senate Democratic leader, criticized Mr. Cheney's speech as an exploitation of America's economic problems to justify more tax breaks for the rich. 
"The administration's plan won't boost the economy," Mr. Daschle said in a statement issued by his office. "It won't make our homeland more secure. It won't make health care more available or more affordable. It won't expand educational opportunity for the young, or strengthen Social Security for the elderly. Instead, by putting us deeper into deficit and debt, it makes all of these things harder to achieve."
Mr. Cheney called on Congress to pass the president's plan and said that once it became law, the government would immediately adjust the amount of federal income tax withheld from paychecks, retroactive to Jan. 1.
"Our administration's pro-growth initiatives were the products of a very clear economic philosophy," Mr. Cheney said. "The president and I understand that the government does not create wealth and it does not create jobs, but government policies can and should create the environment in which firms and entrepreneurs will take risk, innovate, invest and hire more people."

Unexpected Appointment in Gov. Richardson's Datebook

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Little more than a week ago, Bill Richardson was being sworn in as New Mexico's new governor, his head filled with matters like teachers' pay and cutting taxes. He never expected that today he would be sitting in the governor's office serving green chili to Han Song Ryol, one of North Korea's United Nations envoys.
 Still, somehow, here was Mr. Richardson trying to defuse a nuclear confrontation involving North Korea. Not from Washington. Not from the United Nations. But from here in his home state, where the pastel adobe homes and turquoise jewelry boutiques interrupt the desert. And a horde of camera crews, at least five of them Japanese, were not lined up to cover the state's economic and social problems. 
 "I don't even know who the New Mexico guys are," Mr. Richardson said, gazing out at all the camera crews and journalists with a toothy grin, in a light moment before he and Mr. Han went into a second round of talks over North Korea's nuclear intentions.
Not that Mr. Richardson regretted the attention for an instant. Across a career as congressman, freelance international troubleshooter, United Nations envoy in the Clinton administration and later energy secretary, Mr. Richardson was never known to shrink from public view on thorny issues.
Today, when a television producer said the crews were willing to send in just one camera to record footage that they would share, Mr. Richardson's press secretary, Billy Sparks, issued a broad invitation, saying, "No, you can all come in."
No matter that New Mexico was the birthplace of the atomic bomb. Mr. Richardson did not seek out this particular moment in history. It sort of found him, when Mr. Han called early in the week and asked to talk.
The two have known each for years, and Mr. Richardson is one of those rare Americans who has actually visited North Korea -- three times -- once to negotiate the release of the pilot of an American Army helicopter that had been shot down after flying into North Korea air space in 1994.
It was not necessarily the best time for the new governor to plunge back into diplomacy. He was sworn into office just after midnight on New Year's Eve, vowing to attack the state's most pressing needs, like economic growth and finding money to give teachers a 6 percent raise. And this very weekend, as a prominent new governor, he was being showcased by the Democratic Party in its weekly radio address to talk about the economy. 
Yet the troubles came his way, setting off the unlikely trip of Mr. Han and a colleague, Mun Jong Chol, to the American Southwest. The two are normally forbidden by the United States government to step outside New York.
Of the green chili lunch, Mr. Richardson said proudly, "We want to give them a little bit of New Mexico feeling today."
Mr. Han, who speaks perfect English, did not say much during a photo opportunity in the governor's mansion. He sat still, barely blinking and smiling only when someone suggested that he and Mr. Richardson shake hands for the cameras.
"It's very pleasant," Mr. Han said softly when someone asked what he thought of New Mexico. 
In an effort to make clear -- both to the Bush administration and to New Mexicans -- that he knew his place, Mr. Richardson emphasized that he was not acting in any official capacity. He insisted he was just listening and passing along information now and again to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
"It's going well," Mr. Richardson said before the talks resumed. "I'm not an official negotiator, but they're going well."
Around town, the news that ranking officials from a nation President Bush has branded as part of the axis of evil left more than a few local residents scratching their heads. 
"I'm very surprised he's doing this," said Ted Solomon, a psychiatrist. "He was elected to work on some of the long-term pervasive problems in New Mexico, things where we rank No. 50 and should be No. 1 and things we're ranked No. 1 and should be No. 50, like drunk driving, spousal abuse, child abuse and the worst education system in the country."
Gifford Keen, a real estate investor, was just as baffled. "Given the problems of New Mexico, he might have better luck making progress with the North Koreans," he said. "But it does make you wonder what he's going to do here. Who's minding the store while he's making sure we're not getting nuked by the North Koreans?"
Mr. Richardson was quick to make clear he was not ignoring problems of the state. Between talks and lunch with the North Koreans, he took time out to interview several candidates for state judge.
"This is very temporary," Mr. Richardson told reporters before the talks began Thursday evening. "This is something with my experience, that might be helpful. If I can help the administration, I'm going to do it."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
White House Adds a Crisis

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
North Korea's abrupt decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty has taken an issue that the Bush administration had hoped to shift to the back burner and forced it to the top of the world's foreign policy agenda.
 Whether North Korea, an impoverished and isolated nation, has decided that its interests would be best protected by building a sizable nuclear arsenal or is merely engaged in a game of brinkmanship to win security guarantees and economic benefits from Washington is not yet known. 
 What is clear is that the Bush administration can no longer credibly claim that it does not have a crisis on its hands in northeast Asia. The question now is whether Pyongyang can still be dissuaded from building new nuclear bombs and what it might take to do so. 
"As North Korea keeps pressing ahead, they leave both paths available to them," said a former senior American official. "They will either get direct talks with the U.S. or they will expand their nuclear weapons capabilities. It is a hard-nosed, high-risk strategy. But it is one that has an internal logic."
North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, has often been depicted as an irrational despot. But there is a certain rationale to Pyongyang's moves. It was just a year ago that President Bush cast North Korea as a member of an "axis of evil," a collection of states with policies inimical to Washington and with ambitions to develop weapons of mass destruction that needed to be neutralized.
The North Koreans have watched as the Bush administration has made military plans to invade Iraq, another charter member of the "axis of evil." The North Koreans are also well aware of the deep divisions within the Bush administration over the merits of working out a deal that would win the North Koreans the aid and above all the assurances of good will and diplomatic respect that they apparently seek from the world's superpower.
North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons serves two possible ends, which are not mutually exclusive. According to North Korea's calculation, the development of a nuclear arsenal may ensure that Washington is never tempted to launch a pre-emptive attack, as America is apparently moving to do in Iraq.
The North Koreans have also gained a stronger negotiating hand, in part because they acted at a time when leaders in Washington wanted to concentrate on Iraq. North Korea's decision to evict inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and to remove key monitoring equipment has already prompted the Bush administration to agree to direct talks, something the administration vowed not to do unless North Korea first dismantled its program to enrich uranium and froze its plutonium production capability.
The White House has stressed that it is still not willing to negotiate over a diplomatic or economic package until North Korea begins to dismantle -- in some verifiable way -- its uranium-enrichment and plutonium processing programs.
But North Korea may be calculating that it can shock the Bush administration into beginning serious negotiations by withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
Similar tactics in 1993 and 1994 eventually yielded an agreement with the Clinton administration, South Korea, Japan and the Europeans to build light-water nuclear reactors, which are less suitable for arms programs, for North Korea if it agreed to freeze its nuclear weapons program.
"They are playing the same game they played in 1993, trying to force the U.S. to negotiate with them under the threat of proceeding with a nuclear weapons program," said Gary Samore, the former proliferation expert for President Bill Clinton's National Security Council.
Pyongyang's withdrawal from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty would not immediately alter the situation on the Korean peninsula, where 37,000 American troops are stationed. North Korea has been violating the treaty for years by engaging in a clandestine program to enrich uranium -- indeed, it was evidence of this, and North Korea's defiant claim to a visiting American envoy that it has the right to develop nuclear weapons -- that helped precipitate the current confrontation.
North Korea also already has enough plutonium for one or two nuclear bombs and the Central Intelligence Agency believes it has probably built them.
But American intelligence officials believe that if North Korea abandons all of the constraints in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it would be able to harvest five or six bombs' worth of plutonium within six months. North Korea could substantially expand its arsenal further by restarting its Yongbyon reactor, completing other reactors and proceeding with its uranium-enrichment program.
North Korea's withdrawal from the treaty would also be the first time a nation has pulled out of the agreement, a disturbing precedent for arms control.
Some former officials said North Korea's strategy could backfire. For two years, the Bush administration has been criticized for failing to engage Pyongyang. But now that Washington appears to be moving toward talking, North Korea has alarmed the world by ditching the nonproliferation treaty.
"This comes at a time when the Bush administration seems to be moving toward some form of engagement," said Robert J. Einhorn, a former senior State Department official. "Until now the Bush administration has been on the defensive. Now the criticism will shift to North Korea. If the North Koreans insist on moving toward this negative direction, they will increasingly isolate themselves."
Other experts agree that some indications of restraint must come from North Korea if there is to be a fruitful negotiation. Still, North Korea's moves have sharpened the debate over the Bush administration's diplomacy. In essence, the issue is whether Washington should stick to its position that it will not negotiate under pressure or move quickly to offer tangible incentives for North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions before it is too late.
"I don't see them as bluffing," said David Albright, the president of the Institute for Science and International Security and a former United Nations weapons inspector said of the North Koreans. "I think they can still be dissuaded, but I am increasingly of the view that they want a small nuclear arsenal. They are moving toward separating plutonium."

HEADLINE: At the Other End of the Axis: Some F.A.Q.'s 

BYLINE:  By BILL KELLER; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Everybody seems to be asking which is the bigger threat, North Korea or Iraq. What do you think?
 With apologies to Time, Newsweek, CNN and the other news outlets that have been treating this as the Super Bowl of Evil, that's a really silly question. It's like asking which is the bigger problem in your life, your foreclosure notice or your kidney stones. It suggests that we get to choose which one we deal with. 
 O.K., forget Iraq. How worried should we be about North Korea? 
North Korea is a hermit state ruled by a potbellied, five-foot-three paranoid Stalinist who likes to watch Daffy Duck cartoons. He and his father before him have run the country into such a state of abject misery that some people are surviving on boiled grass. And the little dictator is suspected of having manufactured a couple of nuclear weapons.
Creepy.
Actually, that's not the problem, or at least it's not our problem. Loose lip from the White House notwithstanding, there's probably little we can do to get rid of Kim Jong Il. And if he actually has a nuclear warhead or two (we don't really know, but let's assume he does), they have not been fully tested, and thus are just a kind of security blanket. James Lilly, a tough-minded Asianist who has worked in the region as a C.I.A. station chief and ambassador, calls it Mr. Kim's "force de frappe" -- de Gaulle's phrase for the tiny, independent nuclear arsenal France maintains to ward off aggressors. He says we probably have no choice but to live with it.
So a nuclear North Korea is O.K.?
Not exactly. But whatever Mr. Kim has in hand now is probably not a significant danger. The real worry is that North Korea is threatening to crank up a nuclear assembly line. It has enough plutonium in old fuel rods at the Yongbyon reactor to make five or six weapons in a matter of months. With all facilities running full tilt it could eventually turn out warheads at the rate of a couple of dozen a year -- enough to supply any rogue state or terrorist willing to pay. North Korea is so strapped it will sell just about anything to just about anyone. That is reason to be afraid. 
Why are we suddenly in this mess?
The Bush folks will tell you it's Bill Clinton's fault. The Clinton folks say it's George W. Bush's fault. Both administrations have plenty to answer for, but first and foremost it's the North Koreans' fault. Back in 1994, facing a similar threat of the North going nuclear, the Clinton administration cut a deal called the Agreed Framework. North Korea promised to put its nuclear program on hold and act nice, and the U.S. said it would reward this good behavior by supplying fuel oil and a pair of relatively safe light-water nuclear reactors, and by moving to normalize relations. The deal had some holes, but it averted a crisis that could have led to war. And it worked, up to a point. The North Koreans did lock up their precious plutonium at the Yongbyon reactor. But they also started a secret uranium enrichment program and tested a worrisome new long-range missile over Japan. The Clintonites -- afraid they would be accused of appeasing an awful regime, and half-convinced that that regime would collapse anyway -- dithered and dawdled on our end of the bargain. 
So the Bush administration inherited a mess.
And proceeded to turn it into a bigger mess. Mr. Bush came in with an attitude rather than a policy. The attitude was that Kim Jong Il was despicable, and that bargaining with him would be immoral. Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim a "pygmy," told a reporter he "loathed" him, inducted him into the axis of evil. The North Koreans have spewed enough hysterical invective of their own -- they once called us "cannibals," and this week they were bellowing about World War III -- to recognize bluster when it's aimed at them, but they seem to have taken our bellicose talk fairly seriously. Especially when we abruptly cut off discussions, adopted military "pre-emption" as our doctrine for dealing with nuclear wannabes, and cited North Korea as a justification for building a missile defense system in Alaska. When Donald Rumsfeld pointed out that our military is designed to fight two wars at the same time, guess what he meant. 
Yikes! Two wars? Is that likely to happen?
No, but it's not impossible. Robert Galucci, who negotiated the 1994 Agreed Framework, says he has no doubt President Clinton would have ordered a pre-emptive air strike if the Koreans had moved to extract plutonium for nuclear weapons. Mr. Bush has the same option, and, faced with the prospect of North Korea opening a nuclear bazaar, he would have to think very seriously about it. If we hit a reprocessing plant in North Korea with cruise missiles, North Korea would then have to decide whether to begin a second Korean War by raining artillery shells on South Korea, where 37,000 U.S. troops are based. Most experts are pretty sure it will not come to this. The North Koreans have made a show of expelling international inspectors and withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but they have not repudiated their deal with us, the Agreed Framework. Mitchell Reiss, the Korea specialist who is dean of international relations at the College of William and Mary, believes they have slyly closed off everything but this bilateral avenue, so the U.S. will talk to them directly. Of course, experts have been wrong a time or two about North Korea.
Plan A sounds pretty horrible. Does the president have a Plan B?
He has zigzagged his way through a whole alphabet of plans. One faction within the administration has pushed for a policy of tightening economic sanctions until North Korea cries uncle or collapses. (A Bush official dubbed this form of strangulation "tailored containment." Mr. Reiss calls it "assisted suicide.")
Whatever you call it, I don't follow the logic. You say North Korea is an isolated totalitarian state that has never learned how to conduct itself in polite society. So the way to teach it better manners is to cut it off? 
Look, sanctions are everybody's cheap solution for countries behaving badly. Liberals love them when the target is South Africa or Myanmar. Conservatives love them when the target is Cuba or Iraq. Sanctions often accomplish exactly the opposite of what you want, and even at their best they have deleterious side effects. One longtime sanctions skeptic, Richard Haass, has written that in the case of North Korea, economic pressure should be only a last resort if engagement fails, not a substitute for dialogue. Mr. Haass, by the way, is now the director of policy planning at the Bush State Department.
Which raises the question, who's in charge there?
At the outset the Bush policy was dominated by people whose expertise is not Asia but weapons proliferation. Now the lead role has reverted to Colin Powell and the diplomats. They have renounced "tailored containment" and forsworn military options so vociferously that Mr. Bush now sounds like Jimmy Carter. True, his motives for this show of restraint may be questionable -- he doesn't want to distract attention from Job One in Iraq -- but it's a welcome change from the gunslinger talk. We've also started paying more attention to North Korea's neighbors, whose cooperation is essential. Japan, Russia, China and especially South Korea, whose new president floated to power on a wave of anti-American sentiment, all believe Mr. Kim can be induced to sober up and maybe even join the world. Most important, we've agreed to "talk" to the North. (But not "negotiate." It's basically the difference between foreplay and sex.) Whether the Bush folks have come entirely to their senses is hard to tell, but Mr. Galucci describes them as "lurching in the right direction." 
Does anybody have a plan that makes sense?
Actually, yes. Back in 1999 the National Defense University assembled a team of Asia experts to draft a strategy for dealing with North Korea. It came to be known as "more for more": we would expect more from the North Koreans, including rigorous inspections, a full accounting of their nuclear history, and an end to missile exports. We would offer more in return -- financial aid (including speeding construction of the two promised light-water reactors, which are stalled), guarantees that North Korea will not be attacked if it keeps its promises, and eventually normal diplomatic relations. The plan contained a dash of testosterone -- intercepting missile exports, even a cautious mention of "pre-emption" if all else fails -- but mostly it depended on lots and lots of, pardon the expression, negotiations and quid pro quo. The proposal was comprehensive, hard-nosed, multilateral and level-headed. 
Maybe President Bush should hire the guy in charge of that report.
He already has. It's Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage. Maybe what Mr. Bush should do now is listen to him.

HEADLINE: Backtracking on Mexico 

 BODY:
Presidents Vicente Fox and George W. Bush both took office two years ago promising to forge a new partnership bridging the Rio Grande, one marked by a once-unimaginable level of cooperation on a number of fronts. It hasn't happened, and as a result Mexico's enlightened foreign minister, Jorge Castaneda, has resigned.
 The centerpiece of the new relationship was to have been a new accord on immigration. That encountered early resistance on Capitol Hill, and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, rearranged the White House's priorities. Washington has since failed to recognize that an immigration deal that serves American economic needs and diminishes the population living illegally in this country can be compatible with heightened security. 
 The White House's neglect has proved to be politically damaging to Mr. Fox's administration. The Mexican government had to overcome widespread public skepticism, and concerns about surrendering national sovereignty, to sell the idea of a new understanding with the neighboring superpower. Mr. Castaneda was the most outspoken advocate of closer ties with the United States. His frustration over the stalemate in the relationship contributed to his decision to resign. 
Mr. Castaneda worked tirelessly to promote an immigration deal and closer cooperation in fighting drug trafficking and on other law enforcement matters. He ended Mexico's tradition of warm ties with Cuba in order to back American denunciations of Fidel Castro's human rights record. 
Beyond its failure to deliver on immigration, the Bush administration largely missed an opportunity to collaborate with Mexico and Latin democracies in dealing with a number of thorny hemispheric matters, most notably the crisis in Venezuela. 
Angry calls by Mexican farmers in recent weeks for their government to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement in response to the ill-advised agricultural subsidies passed by Congress last summer would serve no one's interest, as Mr. Castaneda has pointed out. But they are indicative of a broader disenchantment with the United States that cuts across Mexican society. The Bush administration should take note of Mr. Castaneda's frustration, and seek to improve ties with our neighbor to the south.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Weapon in Health Wars: Frist's Role as a Doctor

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Critics of the Republican health care agenda say they are getting a little tired of hearing about the heroic-healer image of the new Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, a former transplant surgeon. They say that he may be a wonderful heart surgeon but that he is peddling the same old Republican free-market ideology on Medicare. 
 Seven years ago the leading defender of Republican proposals to overhaul Medicare, the vast government health insurance program for the elderly, was the speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, who was not known for his bedside manner. This year the Bush administration and the Republican Party have a smooth, empathetic, Harvard-trained physician to make the case. 
 Critics fear that Dr. Frist, as he has asked to be called, will be able to use his trustworthy doctor's persona to sell a far-reaching and contentious proposal to open up Medicare to more private health plans. With Dr. Frist supporting it, "how could it be wrong?" Representative Jim McDermott, a liberal Seattle Democrat, said with more than a little sarcasm. The majority leader's M.D. is the Bush administration's "finesse card on health care," said Mr. McDermott, himself a psychiatrist.
It may, in fact, be the Republicans' not-so-secret weapon on an issue that has bedeviled them in the past, when they were often accused of simply trying to save money rather than "reform" a popular program. Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster who worked for Dr. Frist's senatorial re-election campaign, says that "without question" the Tennessee Republican "has a certain gravitas and expertise on the issue that few other politicians can bring to the table."
Doctors still rank among the most honest and ethical professionals in the voters' minds, according to a Gallup poll in November (although nurses rank even higher). And Dr. Frist's image has been burnished by his medical missions overseas and his occasional reviving of ailing visitors to the Capitol. Just last week he drew heavy news coverage for helping tend to accident victims on a Florida highway.
"It sure doesn't hurt when you're stopping along the highway to help people," said one health industry lobbyist.
A less amused Democratic strategist in the Senate, grumbling about the "bizarre media fascination" with Dr. Frist's surgical side, said: "It's a wonderful profession. He's done wonderful things for people. But he's changed professions now."
Still, inside the relatively small world of health policy, Dr. Frist gets high marks for understanding the issues and speaking the language. The Princeton health economist Uwe Reinhardt, who taught him when he was an undergraduate and stayed in touch with him over the years, recalls being invited along one night when he was still practicing heart surgery, to watch him harvest a heart and later transplant it.
Throughout the night, Dr. Frist gave a running narrative of what he was doing and how much it cost, Professor Reinhardt recalled. 
"We have this strange notion in the United States that spending on health care is a bad thing, a burden," the economist said. "When you stand there, in the operating room, and watch him literally revive a dead man and enable him to live a pretty good life, you have to ask, Is this just another burden on the economy?"
These appealing images leave critics of the administration's health proposals in a quandary. For all the strengths Dr. Frist brings to the table because of his background, they say, he and the administration have embraced an approach to Medicare that many Democrats and others say simply will not work. But separating a popular messenger from what they consider a deeply flawed message is not easy.
"I've been really impressed by his doctoring ability, his compassion and his charitable actions," said Gail Shearer, director of health policy analysis at Consumers Union. "But in the past he's aligned himself with market-oriented solutions. His perspective is one of trust in the marketplace, and in this particular place we don't think the market works too well." 
In fact, the divisions over health care -- specifically, how much to trust the private market, how much to rely on government -- are among the most profound in politics today. Republicans and their allies say turning Medicare into more of a private health care marketplace, in which numerous health plans compete for the elderly's business, will give the program's beneficiaries more choices and modernize its bureaucratic structure before the baby boom generation hits.
Democrats and their allies say Medicare was created because the private health insurance market failed to meet the needs of the elderly. They charge that what some Republicans are ultimately aiming for is replacing the guaranteed benefits of Medicare with a voucher.
Dr. Frist will stand on the fault line of this debate in more ways than one, some strategists and health analysts say: he has very direct experience with the private health care marketplace. His father and brother helped found what became the largest hospital company in the country, the Hospital Corporation of America, later renamed HCA. That chain became the focus of a long-running government inquiry into accusations of health care fraud, which HCA ultimately settled for a cumulative $1.7 billion in fines and penalties.
Dr. Frist has played no role in managing HCA. But he invested in it when it was founded, and it proved lucrative. He is now one of the wealthiest members of Congress, with most of his holdings in blind trusts.
"While Republicans obviously have an interest in promoting him as a doctor, I think Democrats will have a similar interest in reminding voters that he is the senator from the Hospital Corporation of America," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster.
Even the "M.D." may have its flaws among some voters: Gallup found that older women, an important block on health issues, were less trusting of doctors than were other groups.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: REACTION; 
North Korea Is Target Of Protests From World

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Saturday, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
North Korea stirred a storm of protest with its announcement Friday that it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, with many analysts viewing the move as hard bargaining rather than a declaration that it would begin building nuclear weapons.
 Condemnation came from around the world, from France, Japan, Russia and Australia as well as from South Korea, where President Kim Dae Jung said the announcement had "brought the situation on the Korean peninsula from bad to worse by one step." 
 Concerns were heightened after a North Korean representative to the United Nations said on Friday in New York that any United Nations sanctions would be considered an act of war.
Mr. Kim was scheduled to meet today with Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin of France, who called for "more urgent international action" in response to North Korea's withdrawal. France holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council. 
The statement issued on Friday asserted that North Korea had no intention of producing nuclear weapons and was acting in self-defense because it was "most seriously threatened" by the United States. North Korea said it would use its nuclear program only for peaceful purposes "at this stage."
Soon after the announcement, the official North Korean news agency published an aggressive statement that called the United States warmongers and said: "A new Korean War will finally lead to the Third World War. Let us see who will win and who will be defeated in a fire-to-fire standoff."
While condemning the North Korean action, several countries urged a cautious and low-key response.
In South Korea, which has taken a softer line than its allies in Washington, Mr. Kim said: "Thanks to our efforts, the United States is now moving toward dialogue with North Korea. We have to make the Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons. For this purpose, we have to be patient and persistent in achieving a peaceful solution."
His successor, President-elect Roh Moo Hyun, also expressed "deep regret" at the North's action.
The United States offered on Tuesday to talk with North Korea together with South Korea and Japan. It had earlier said it would not talk until North Korea halted its nuclear programs.
The governments of South and North Korea will have an opportunity to discuss the situation at a cabinet-level meeting scheduled for Jan. 21-24 in Seoul. But North Korea says it wants to talk directly with the United States.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan, leaders of two nations closely involved with North Korea, met on Friday in Moscow and issued a joint statement expressing "regret and concern."
Russia's Foreign Ministry criticized North Korea's decision, saying it would "only exacerbate the already tense situation around the Korean Peninsula."
But at the same time, in an acknowledgment of North Korea's security concerns, the statement called for "an equal and mutually beneficial dialogue" with all the parties involved.
The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea and President Bush has called North Korea part of an "axis of evil," which includes Iran and Iraq, against which the United States is preparing for a possible military attack.
In their joint statement, the two leaders emphasized the need for a "peaceful resolution of all questions linked to North Korea's nuclear program." Russian officials have repeatedly called for "quiet diplomacy" to resolve the crisis over North Korea's nuclear program, opposing suggestions by some to immediately take North Korea's decisions to the United Nations Security Council.
Mr. de Villepin said on Friday that North Korea's declaration was "a serious decision, heavy with consequences, that has to be dealt with by the United Nations Security Council." 
"This major development underscores the necessity and urgency of international mobilization," he said.
Michael Breen, a longtime commentator on Korean affairs, based in Seoul, said Pyongyang's goal was to engage the United States in serious talks in the hope of securing a nonaggression treaty and gaining further economic aid.
"They are brilliant at this sort of brinkmanship," he said.
He warned that miscalculations by Pyongyang's insular leadership could be disastrous.
He and other analysts suggested that North Korea might be seeking to take advantage of Washington's preoccupation with Iraq to squeeze the United States for concessions.
"The North's decision is an attempt to increase pressure on the United States while Washington is grappling with a possible war in Iraq," said Koh Yu Hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE WHITE HOUSE; 
U.S. ASSAILS MOVE BY NORTH KOREANS TO REJECT TREATY

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER with JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The United States today condemned North Korea's decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but privately -- through diplomacy in New Mexico and a phone call by President Bush to the Chinese leader, Jiang Zemin -- sought ways of defusing the confrontation.
 While North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations warned that any Security Council effort to impose economic sanctions would amount to "a declaration of war," two North Korean officials pursued more conciliatory private talks in Santa Fe, N.M., with Gov. Bill Richardson, their chosen intermediary, who was in close consultation with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. 
 The White House defended its actions as a "steady, steely diplomacy" to force North Korea to dismantle a nuclear effort that administration officials fear could produce five or six weapons by summer.
Behind the scenes, however, there was enormous debate over how to proceed -- debate in the White House, between the White House and Republicans in Congress and between the United States and its Asian allies. Even some of Mr. Bush's closest supporters among foreign policy experts were privately describing the administration's approach as inconsistent and poorly articulated. 
"You step out of a meeting on this," a senior foreign policy official said, "and you realize that you've heard 12 ideas and no consensus."
In a day of public denunciations and private efforts to ease the confrontation, the White House sought to orchestrate an international warning that North Korea risked even greater isolation from the world. Mr. Bush urged Mr. Jiang to apply greater pressure on a country that was once China's client state, though privately administration officials questioned whether Mr. Jiang had much influence over the reclusive North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il.
After meeting with the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, whose inspectors were thrown out of North Korea on Dec. 31, Mr. Powell asserted that North Korea had "thumbed its nose at the international community."
But in general the administration's reaction was carefully muted, with Vice President Dick Cheney declaring that North Korea's exit from the treaty was "not unexpected." 
Tonight, Mr. Cheney, appearing on MSNBC, said the North might be "taking advantage of the circumstances, the fact that the U.N. and the U.S. are right now focused very much on the Middle East and on the situation in Iraq." But he said he did not see a "direct connection" between the North's efforts and those of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader. 
Both Mr. Powell and Mr. Cheney deliberately avoided talk today of the consequences North Korea could face -- a surprise in the case of Mr. Cheney, who is a vocal hawk on the issue. Aides to both men said they did not want to cast the confrontation as a conflict between Washington and Pyongyang.
But uncertainties about the right course of action were evident even in the public debate -- from those who criticized Mr. Bush today for being too hesitant to talk to the North Koreans, and those who said he had failed to draw a line in the sand, making it clear that he would not let North Korea convert its fissile material into weapons.
Dr. ElBaradei, the atomic agency chief, urged the administration to "engage in a dialogue" with the North, and seemed reluctant to take the issue to the United Nations Security Council, where sanctions would be threatened. "We need to articulate what would be the next step if North Korea were to show good behavior," he said. "They need to get some assurance as to what to expect in return for good behavior." 
Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is the new head of the Foreign Relations committee, was also pushing the administration to talk to Pyongyang, saying the North needed to see 'the light at the end of the tunnel."
But the White House sounded unmoved. "The ball is in the North Koreans' court," said Ari Fleischer, the president's spokesman.
At the other end of the debate were Republican senators like John McCain and Jon Kyl, both of Arizona, who said they would introduce legislation seeking penalties against North Korea. Exactly what kind was something of a mystery, since the United States has virtually no trade with the country.
But in an article to be published in The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine here, Mr. McCain was blistering in his critique of the administration's approach. He assessed its policy as Clintonian -- an epithet in the world of the Bush White House -- and wrote that Mr. Bush had failed to issue the kind of clear warnings to Mr. Kim that he routinely sends to Mr. Hussein.
"After first responding appropriately to North Korean violations of the agreement and refusing even to discuss with North Korea its extortion demands," Mr. McCain wrote, "the administration now appears to have embraced, and in some respects exceeded, the style and substance of Clinton's diplomacy." 
Mr. Bush's aides say such public declarations would only inflame the situation and give Mr. Kim what he seeks: a public confrontation with the United States. So Mr. Bush's strategy has been to use the confrontation to sew together the Asian allies -- a process that so far has yielded a number of statements of condemnation, but no joint action.
Nor has it appeared to move the North Koreans, who are well practiced in the art of brinkmanship from a similar crisis in 1994, when they warned, as the United Nations envoy did today, that sanctions would lead to war. President Clinton responded by beefing up the American presence on the Korean Peninsula; there is no evidence that Mr. Bush is taking a similar precaution.
Both the Security Council and the atomic energy agency in Vienna, which monitors compliance with the nuclear treaty, received letters today from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as the country is formally known, officially announcing its withdrawal from the treaty.
Intensive consultations were under way on whether to call a meeting of the Board of Governors of the energy agency, whose members include the nuclear powers. If the board meets and determines that a threat exists, it must refer the matter to the Security Council. 
The administration has offered to meet with North Korean officials to talk about how they could return to compliance with their international nuclear obligations, but has said that only when the nuclear programs are beginning to be dismantled can any further discussions about improved relations take place. 
At a rare news conference at the United Nations today, Ambassador Pak Gil Yon, the North Korean representative, described the American offer as "not a sincere attitude."
Mr. Pak declared that North Korea would not return to the international treaty but would seek to set up a "separate verification" with the United States of its claims that it is not producing a nuclear weapon.
The envoy said North Korea regarded its withdrawal from the treaty as effective "from tomorrow, immediately," indicating that it would not respect the three-month period stipulated before an announced withdrawal becomes effective.
He said North Korea had been "compelled to withdraw" because the atomic energy agency became a "servant and a spokesman" of the United States when it adopted a resolution on Jan. 6 deploring North Korea's expulsion of its inspectors. He said that the North was acting, in a "legitimate self-defensive measure," to protect itself from American nuclear attack. 
American officials who reviewed notes from Mr. Bush's conversation with the Chinese leader this morning said the president had noted that China had significant leverage over the North, a reference to the fact that it is the country's biggest trading partner. But he did not ask China to impose any economic penalties. 
"It's unclear to us how far Jiang can go, or even is willing to go," a senior administration official said.
The other question is how far Mr. Kim might go. Administration officials have clearly been surprised at his speed in breaking out of the pact.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a news analysis article on Saturday about talks between Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico and two North Korean diplomats misidentified the North Korean nuclear weapons program that was disclosed last fall. It was a uranium enrichment program, not the production of plutonium at the Yongbyon nuclear complex.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DIPLOMACY; 
Washington's Disunity Complicates Dialogue

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., Jan. 10 

 BODY:
As the confrontation between the United States and North Korea deepened today, two North Korean diplomats spent the day here trying -- through an old intermediary, Gov. Bill Richardson -- to explain what their country seeks from Washington in return for de-escalating its nuclear ambitions.
 Mr. Richardson said he had had "extensive discussions" throughout the day with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, as a divided administration sought some opening of dialogue with a government it has barely talked to in the past two years. 
 This evening Mr. Richardson presented himself as a listener and interlocutor, not an envoy, but it seemed possible, perhaps even likely, that the North Koreans were viewing him as a kind of back channel to do business with the administration.
Mr. Richardson said that his seven hours of talks on Thursday evening and today had been "positive, frank and candid too." Another round of meetings are to take place on Saturday morning.
"My hope is that at the end of the meetings there will be positive results, but I don't want to speculate," he said. "I believe that to resolve problems you have to talk."
Mr. Richardson is an odd go-between, a Democrat who served in the Clinton cabinet and is known and trusted by the North Koreans because of past contacts with him while he was a member of Congress. 
That alone would make his task an awkward one. But his difficulties are made worse by the administration's inner divisions on the question of whether to enter serious talks with North Korea before it dismantles its two nuclear programs. Some officials have pressed for a greater openness to diplomatic talks; others have argued for an even harder line toward the North Koreans.
While Mr. Richardson was meeting at his official residence with the North Korean delegation, the North Korean ambassador at the United Nations issued a vehement denunciation of American intentions in New York.
The urgency of the situation deepened late on Thursday as North Korea appeared to formally reject the American offer of talks and declared instead that the government of President Kim Jong Il would move immediately to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
But that comment seemed partly belied by the talks here.
Administration officials say that even from the inside, the situation is very fluid and unclear, in part because since its agreement earlier this week to talk, but not negotiate, the United States has been encouraging other countries to reach out to North Korea to probe its intentions. These countries -- notably Japan and South Korea -- have yet to report on the results of their efforts.
In Washington, Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said several governments were conveying to North Korea, both publicly and privately, that it must dismantle its nuclear programs.
"We look to other governments to make clear to North Korea that they need to meet their obligations, that it's important to the entire international community," he said. "That's been made clear by individual governments, the Chinese and Russian governments included."
Since the revelation last fall of North Korea's plutonium production at Yongbyon, which violates an accord reached with the United States in 1994, specialists and officials around Mr. Bush have been heatedly debating the North's possible motives.
Some in the administration say the impoverished North is looking for a face-saving deal in which it might return to respecting international restraints, in return for economic benefits.
Others say North Korea is determined to possess nuclear weapons at any cost, because it fears American aggression once the Iraq situation is resolved. 
These opposing views have led to mixed signals, with some hard-line officials at the Pentagon and White House, for instance, suggesting that penalties or at least a tighter economic isolation will be imposed down the road, and Mr. Powell insisting that no one is contemplating such action.
One problem with sanctions is that the United States does not have any leverage left; its economic ties with the North are virtually nonexistent. The countries that do have those ties -- Japan, China, South Korea and Russia -- are adamantly opposed to sanctions.
North Korea's readiness to meet Mr. Richardson took the administration by surprise, officials say, though there had been talk for some weeks that an intermediary might emerge to help determine the North's intentions.
In the early 1990's, former President Jimmy Carter played that role for President Bill Clinton, who was said to have resented his predecessor's involvement even though he ended up grateful for the resulting agreement.
A Bush administration official recently held up his fingers and crossed them when it was suggested jokingly that Mr. Carter might be available again. Paradoxically, the administration is now depending on a Clinton-era politician as a promising source of information on North Korean's intentions.
Asian and European diplomats said today that it was uncertain which represented North Korea's true intentions: the denunciations made by Pak Gil Yon, the North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, or the more conciliatory talks going on here.
It is possible -- even likely, some say -- that North Korea is itself divided, not least because the United States has lurched back and forth from conciliation to confrontation over the past two years. 
A positive sign came at lunchtime, when Mr. Richardson's spokesman said that instead of ending talks for the day, he and the two North Korean envoys, Han Song Ryol and Mun Jong Chol, had decided to reconvene in the late afternoon.
Mr. Han knew Mr. Richardson when the governor served as President Clinton's ambassador to the United Nations in the 1990's.
Later tonight, the governor went off to have what he said would be a working dinner over New Mexico trout, a specialty requested by the North Koreans.
One more test of North Korea's intentions could come next week when it holds cabinet-level talks with South Korea -- the highest-level contacts since October, when the North admitted that it was maintaining a nuclear fuel-enrichment program in violation of the 1994 accord.
On Monday and Tuesday of this week, when envoys of Japan, South Korea and the United States hammered out a new statement of principles, the focus was the Bush administration's new willingness to talk to North Korea without conditions, as long as the subject of the talks was the eventual dismantling of North Korea's nuclear programs.

HEADLINE: Greece Enters Europe's Spotlight Under Skeptical Eyes 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: ATHENS, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
In 1983, when Greece first held the presidency of what was then simply the European Community, it riled other member nations by blocking the group from condemning the Soviet Union for shooting down a South Korean airliner.
 In 1994, when Greece last held the presidency of what had become the European Union, its approach to the volatile states of the former Yugoslavia, particularly its support for Serbia, was so unpopular and unrepresentative of West European opinion that its economic embargo against Macedonia was brought before the European Court. 
 Greece's track record in the union's presidency, which rotates every six months, has been a troubled one. So this month, as it begins its fourth turn in the job, experts on European affairs -- and even some Greek officials -- say Greece has plenty to prove, despite the much-improved image of its leaders in the rest of Europe. 
"They start under a sort of question mark, for a lot of people: are they up to it?" said Steven Everts, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform, an independent group based in London.
That concern looms a bit larger than it otherwise might because Greece's stewardship comes at a time of accelerated change within the union and acute tensions over the prospect of an American-led military strike against Iraq.
Although there is growing talk of giving the European Union a more unified voice in foreign policy, the 15 member nations have yet to forge a common position on Iraq.
At a news conference today in Athens that marked Greece's assumption of the presidency, both Romano Prodi, the European Commission president, and Costas Simitis, the Greek prime minister, identified that kind of consensus as a crucial goal.
Greek officials insist that they are more than up to the responsibilities they are assuming, and they clearly see this period, along with the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, as opportunities to showcase a more modern, moderate and mature country.
"Greece is one of Europe's successes," Foreign Minister George Papandreou said in an interview here this week.
Mr. Papandreou referred to a rate of economic growth last year that was more than twice the European Union average, and friendlier relations with Greece's Balkan neighbors and Turkey.
"We may have begun as a Balkan country in Europe," he said. "Now we're a European country in the Balkans."
"We're talking about a different region," he added. "We're talking about a different Greece."
The European Union presidency, which was previously held by Denmark, comes without any enormous decision-making power. Rather it has the responsibility of setting agendas and keeping them moving along without major rifts within the bloc.
Greece will be the host, on April 16, for the ceremony at which 10 new members of the European Union are to sign their accession treaties. The hard work of deciding which countries to invite, and setting the terms of membership, has already been done. Greece will also be in the president's seat when the initial results of a convention charged with drafting a European Union constitution are presented. 
Several European affairs experts said that Greece is not really in a position to mold that document. But they said that the European impression of Greece's performance as president could have an impact on efforts, reflected in the convention's work, to adjust the balance between the larger members and its smaller ones, like Greece, which has a population of about 11 million -- less than one-seventh that of Germany.
Some larger members advocate an abolition of the rotating presidency in favor of a more permanent one. One reason sometimes cited is that a country like Greece might hold the position during critical foreign policy junctures. The situation in Iraq is one such juncture -- and Mr. Papandreou caused heads to turn when it was announced this week that he would lead a European Union mission to various Arab countries to try to avoid a war in Iraq.
Greece has its own problems in regard to Iraq, in that the diplomatic demands of the union presidency will force Greek leaders to speak with greater sensitivity and nuance than many Greeks would like. 
But some Greek observers thought that oratorical restraint during this period would benefit the country's international image.
"Thank God we're in the presidency," said Theodore A. Couloumbis, a professor of international relations at the University of Athens. "It will, to some extent, make life easier for the Greek government not to react in a unilateral fashion."
Greek leaders said that if events in Iraq did not dominate the next six months, Greece wanted to leave a stamp on the union in several ways: to tilt talk about immigration away from border control to regulated migration and to promote the idea of an expanded union that would eventually include more of the Balkans. They also said that Greece was pushing for, and eager to see, a permanent peace agreement for Cyprus, which is divided into Greek and Turkish halves, adopted under its watch.
Mr. Papandreou pledged that Greece was "on a new track, and it's very much a European track."

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The Chicago Board of Trade said today that it had selected LIFFE Connect as its electronic trading platform, starting in 2004, a move that could put the Board of Trade in competition with its current provider, Eurex. 
 The board's chief executive, Bernard Dan, said LIFFE Connect had better capability to execute complicated trading strategies. 
The LIFFE system also has more ability to align the board's open outcry trading pits with the fast-growing screen-based trading, he said. 
 The LIFFE platform was developed by the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, a unit of the pan-European exchange Euronext. In dropping Eurex's trading platform, the exchange effectively puts itself in head-to-head competition with Eurex, the world's largest futures exchange. 
The potential for competition heated up considerably today when Eurex, owned by the German stock exchange group Deutsche Borse and the SWX Swiss Exchange, said it planned to start an exchange in the United States in 2004 that would include derivatives on interest rates. The Board of Trade's debt futures are the exchange's most actively traded products.

 FAT LAND
How Americans Became
the Fattest People in the World.
By Greg Critser.
232 pp. Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Company. $24.
 Add another to the string of superlatives wreathing the world's greatest power: Americans are now the fattest people on earth. (Actually a handful of South Sea Islanders still outweigh us, but we're gaining.) Six out of every 10 of us -- and fully a quarter of our children -- are now overweight. Just since 1970 the proportion of American children who are overweight has doubled, a rate of increase that suggests the fattening of America has a specific history as well as a biology. "Fat Land," a skinny book about this big subject, is the journalist Greg Critser's highly readable attempt to reconstruct that history.
At least from a business perspective, the fattening of America may well have been a necessity. Food companies grow by selling us more of their products. The challenge they face is that the American population is growing much more slowly than the American food supply -- a prescription for falling rates of profit. Agribusiness now produces 3,800 calories of food a day for every American, 500 calories more than it produced 30 years ago. (And by the government's lights, at least a thousand more calories than most people need.) So what's a food company to do? The answer couldn't be simpler or more imperative: get each of us to eat more. A lot more.
Critser doesn't put it quite this way, but his subject is the nutritional contradictions of capitalism. There's only so much food one person can consume (unlike shoes or CD's), or so you would think. But Big Food has been nothing short of ingenious in devising ways to transform its overproduction into our overconsumption -- and body fat. The best parts of this book show how, in the space of two decades, Americans learned to eat, on average, an additional 200 calories a day. In the words of James O. Hill, a physiologist Critser interviewed, getting fat today is less an aberration than "a normal response to the American environment."
Some of the credit for creating this new environment belongs to an unheralded businessman by the name of David Wallerstein, the man Critser says introduced "supersizing" to America. Today Wallerstein is an executive with McDonald's, but back in the 1960's he worked for a chain of movie theaters, where he labored to expand sales of soda and popcorn -- the high-markup items that theaters depend on for their profitability. Wallerstein tried everything he could think of to goose sales -- two-for-one deals, matinee specials -- but found he couldn't induce customers to buy more than one soda and one bag of popcorn. Why? Because going for seconds makes people feel like pigs. 
But Wallerstein discovered that people would spring for more popcorn and soda -- a lot more -- as long as it came in a single gigantic serving. Thus was born the Big Gulp and, in time, the Big Mac and jumbo fries. Though Ray Kroc himself took some convincing: the McDonald's founder had naively assumed that if people wanted more fries they'd buy another bag. He didn't appreciate how social taboos against gluttony (one of the seven deadly sins, after all) were holding us back. Wallerstein's dubious achievement was to devise the dietary equivalent of a papal dispensation: Supersize it!
Now, you might think people would stop eating and drinking these gargantuan portions as soon as they felt full, but it turns out hunger doesn't work that way. Citing studies in the "growing field of satiety" -- the science of human satisfaction -- Critser writes that people presented with larger portions will eat up to 30 percent more than they otherwise would. Human hunger is apparently quite elastic, which makes excellent evolutionary sense: it behooved our hunter-gatherer ancestors to feast whenever the opportunity presented itself, thereby storing reserves of fat against future famine. Researchers call this trait "the thrifty gene." The problem is that in an era of fast-food abundance, the opportunity for feasting now presents itself 24/7. 
What makes supersizing such an effective business strategy is the cheapness of basic foodstuffs in America. Since the raw materials of soda and popcorn, French fries and even hamburgers represent such a tiny fraction of their retail price (compared with labor, packaging and advertising), expanding portion size becomes a way to multiply sales without adding much to costs. 
Critser, to his credit, is more interested in ferreting out the political history of "overnutrition" in America than indulging in the usual pseudopsychology or sociology of fat. So "Fat Land" begins at the beginning, with the 1971 arrival in Washington of Earl Butz. Butz, you'll recall, was Richard Nixon's secretary of agriculture, a blustering, quotable and foulmouthed agricultural economist from Purdue. The early 70's marked the last time food prices in America had climbed high enough to generate political heat. Bad weather, a grain shortage and soaring costs for agricultural inputs (fuel, chemicals, equipment) were squeezing farmers; at the same time consumers were protesting the high costs of basic foods like sugar, cheese and, perhaps most sensitively, meat. Beef, that American entitlement, had suddenly become a luxury good. 
Recognizing the political peril of cranky consumers and restive farmers, President Nixon dispatched Butz to rejigger the American food system. The Sage of Purdue promptly loosened regulations, beat down trade rules and expanded subsidies. By 1976, when a racist joke he told on a plane cost him his job, Butz had largely succeeded in driving down the cost of food and vastly increasing the output of America's farmers. Say what you will about the problems of a heavily subsidized industrial agriculture, the cost of food is no longer a political issue in the United States.
Now we find ourselves confronted with the unintended consequences of cheap and abundant food, foremost among them the epidemic of obesity. Critser takes us on a brisk tour, by turns funny and depressing, of a society learning to accommodate itself to its new dimensions: restaurants adding square inches to their seats; government agencies relaxing their weight, fitness and dietary guidelines; Seventh Avenue recalibrating clothing sizes to make for happier visits to the dressing room. Less amusing is what our weight is doing to our health, and Critser is sure-footed and clear in describing the science of obesity, especially the precise mechanism by which our diet has led to an epidemic of Type 2 diabetes. What used to be called adult onset diabetes now afflicts millions of children as well as adults, and costs America's health system billions of dollars a year.
In the last year or so, there have been signs that the fattening of America is emerging as a political issue. A grass-roots parents' movement to get fast food and vending machines out of the schools is gathering steam, and several lawsuits have recently been filed by obese customers against fast-food chains, seeking to hold the companies liable for health problems. The suits seem absurd on their face (no one's forcing people to eat this stuff), but then so did the early suits against the tobacco companies. There does seem to be at least one area in which the tobacco analogy is apposite: the ethics of marketing unhealthy products to children. 
Indeed, the question of responsibility looms large in the growing debate over obesity, and it is here that Critser loses his footing a bit. While "Fat Land" does an excellent job connecting the dots between government and corporate policies and the fattening of America, by the end of the book the problem has largely, and somewhat inexplicably, been redefined in terms of personal responsibility. Critser expresses the hope that "the food industry might . . . take it upon itself to do something" like resize portions, but nothing that has come before gives us reason to think the industry would ever do any such thing.
George W. Bush has defined this as "the era of personal responsibility" and finally it is under this banner, so congenial to business, that Critser marches, seemingly in spite of himself and his best journalism. So instead of seriously entertaining any public solutions to what he has so convincingly demonstrated is a public problem, Critser ends by imploring us to eat less, get off our duffs and, incredibly, bring back gluttony as a leading sin. Personal responsibility is all to the good, but everything else in "Fat Land" suggests it is probably no match for the thrifty gene and the Happy Meal.

 MOTOWN
Music, Money, Sex, and Power.
By Gerald Posner.
Illustrated. 350 pp. New York:
Random House. $24.95.
 UNTIL it was sold to Boston Ventures in 1988, Motown Records produced a music that helped transform American popular tastes. Founded and directed by Berry Gordy, a Detroit-born child of middle-class parents who migrated from violently segregationist Georgia in the 1920's, Motown brought together the talents of an amazing, largely Detroit-based, group of songwriters, singers, producers and musicians, who succeeded in creating hit after hit for nearly 30 years.
From Jackie Wilson, Smokey Robinson and Mary Wells in the early 1960's through the Supremes, the Temptations and the Jackson Five (to say nothing of Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and the solo careers of Diana Ross and Michael Jackson), Motown was a veritable music factory. Gordy strove for a sound that would cross over, appealing to whites along with a core black constituency. White singers had previously captured this audience with their versions of black artists' work, and Gordy would change that by making black music more accessible to whites, intentionally softening gospel shouts and rhythm and blues tones. He sought financial success and public acclaim, but in the process he and the artists he worked with influenced the listening habits of young Americans of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. 
It is this complex story that Gerald Posner explores in "Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power." Posner is an accomplished author of numerous books, including well-received studies of the assassinations of John Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and is a highly regarded investigative reporter as well. These skills, however, are less evident in his current effort. Gordy and the "major Motown stars" boycotted him. Other people insisted on anonymity. One source heavily relied on for portions of the narrative remains unknown, visible only in the copies of company documents that periodically arrived in Posner's mailbox. These documents are of interest, but cannot, by themselves, provide Posner with the material he needs for a thorough analysis. The result is a book that depends in large part on previously published newspaper stories and autobiographies, which lend it an air of familiarity and mean that Posner has little to offer in the way of new insights.
"Motown" possesses some structural difficulties as well. Posner, who exhibits something of a tin ear, discusses neither the lyrics nor the music itself, does not examine its origins in earlier black musical expression and never mentions soul music, a contemporaneous popular music that was also deeply grounded in gospel and also appealed to white audiences. Posner is not a musicologist, although that is not a requirement for a book on Motown. But since the issue of crossing over from black to white audiences is central to the music and the economics of Motown, as Posner himself acknowledges, it is unfortunate that the valuable works of Peter Guralnick, Suzanne Smith and Brian Ward, among others, are nowhere mentioned. Gerald Early's indispensable study of Motown and American culture, "One Nation Under a Groove," is only briefly noted, though without particular effect. Even today, crossing over is a contentious issue, producing a variety of interpretations -- as the sharp debates over hip-hop and rap music demonstrate. Disagreements about the meaning of crossing over reveal core beliefs about race identity and racial politics, and the lack of any analysis here is painfully glaring.
Motown began its existence in the late 1950's, at the very end of the postwar expansion of independent record companies. Labels like Chess, King, Sun, Specialty and Keen recorded the early work of everyone from Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis to Muddy Waters, Etta James, Sam Cooke and James Brown. Detroit was home to the tiny JVB and Sensation labels. The bottom line for all these companies was simple survival, and the weapon of choice was a cutthroat business ethic. 
As a former Detroit record store owner, Gordy was no stranger to this environment; so it should not be surprising that from the company's inception numerous Motown artists complained about royalty payments, the requirement that the company retain copyright to the music and other business arrangements tilted to Gordy's advantage. Posner does not situate Motown within the economic context of a changing entertainment industry, and the result is a confusing account of its financial history. He points to Gordy's oft-repeated comment that the company was "a family," but fails to see in Motown's business practices a continuity with Gordy's own family -- which demanded interest on an $800 loan it provided to get Motown started. 
Motown under Gordy never cheated its artists outright, but it did take advantage of them time and again. Posner fails to fully grasp Gordy's drive for economic success and public prominence, instead describing an almost idyllic scene in which a version of standard family values, under a paternalistic Gordy, reigned supreme. To be sure, such a story demands a fall from grace, and Posner provides two: the ascension of Ralph Seltzer as a rigid "bottom line" administrator in 1968 and Gordy's rebuff some years later of his friend and early Motown star, Smokey Robinson, over control of copyrights.
Gordy was always -- and probably foremost -- a businessman. He built a company to create, make and then sell its product as widely as possible, and at every step along the way his intention was to control the process. His commitment to promoting black cultural expression never interfered with his eagerness to maximize profits. Thus the sale of Motown for $61 million prompted Gordy, an inveterate high-stakes gambler, to boast: "From $800 to $61 million. I had done it. I had won the poker hand." Despite claims that the company's move to Los Angeles in the 1970's and its sale in 1988 betrayed Motown's original commitment to black America, it was always the case that Gordy's drive was for success and recognition. 
Still, Gordy had an ear for the music. And he had a sensitivity to consumer trends that helped establish a style that continues to influence American popular culture. That is a significant achievement, one that transcends the sometimes avaricious quality of Berry Gordy's career.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
Filmed on Location: The Gangs of Rio de Janeiro

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
A CAST composed almost entirely of unknown actors, a setting that is none too attractive, a lot of violence and no sex scenes. If ever a studio wanted a formula for a film to fail, that would be it," said the Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles.
 As he was shooting in the slums here two years ago, Mr. Meirelles worried about the commercial viability of the movie he was making. Yet "City of God," which opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday, has become a watershed cultural and political event in Brazil, and has now been seen by more Brazilians than any film in nearly 30 years. 
 Every aspect, from its unblinking portrayal of criminality to its innovative cinematography, has been endlessly analyzed and discussed, to the point that Brazil's new president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is reported to have said that seeing the movie made him change his policy on public security. 
"City of God" ("Cidade de Deus") takes its title from the best-selling novel by Paulo Lins, which in turn is named for a gigantic housing project built here in the 1960's and where some 120,000 people live today. Mr. Lins grew up there, knew the real-life characters portrayed in the book and film, and watched as drug gangs gained a stranglehold over the community.
"The book was the fruit of 30 years of observation and 10 years of research," he said in an interview at his apartment in the middle-class neighborhood where he now lives. "From the time I was a little kid, I watched what was going on around me, so everything that appears in the book is real, and that reality is exactly what the filmmakers wanted to capture."
When "Cidade de Deus" was published in 1997, it became an immediate critical and popular success in Brazil, in large part because it showed slum life from the inside -- and did so without condemning the people who live there. A friend of Mr. Meirelles gave the director a copy of the book with the suggestion that it might make a good movie.
As it happened, Mr. Meirelles (pronounced mere-ELLIES), who is 47, was then at a crossroads in his career. He had always wanted to make feature films, and had directed several television programs and documentaries, but had drifted into advertising and become probably the most successful director of commercials in Brazil.
"I had won Clio awards and all the other prizes you can win, but I was at that point when you start asking if there isn't something more," he recalled.
Mr. Meirelles's proposal to film "City of God" was one of eight that Mr. Lins received, including some from directors much better known and with experience filming in Rio's favelas, or hillside squatter slums. But when Mr. Meirelles outlined his calculatedly risky plan to cast amateurs from Cidade de Deus and other slum neighborhoods, the balance shifted.
"It was the idea of using actors from the favelas that really moved me and won me over," Mr. Lins said. "The money was almost the same in all of the offers, but Fernando's vision of the project was the most interesting."
Once that hurdle was overcome, the sheer Dickensian sweep of the novel offered Mr. Meirelles his next challenge. At 550 pages, "City of God" has nearly 300 characters and covers three decades in the slum's history: an early 160-page draft of the script won a prize at a Sundance Institute workshop held in Brazil, but even so, a dozen drafts were required before a filmable version was completed.
As a white raised in a middle-class Sao Paulo neighborhood, Mr. Meirelles faced an additional problem, that of credibility. The American equivalent of the situation he confronted would be a native of the Upper West Side of New York City deciding to go into Los Angeles' South Central to make a movie about black gangs and expecting to be received with open arms.
To ease his way, Mr. Meirelles decided to enlist a co-director, Katia Lund. Originally from Sao Paulo, Ms. Lund is of Norwegian descent and a Brown University graduate but had made several Brazilian rap videos in the favelas and had also filmed "News From a Private War," a highly praised documentary about the drug gangs of Rio's slums.
"That whole experience was an eye-opener for me, and I wanted to know what was happening and why no one was doing anything about it," she said. "I believe that people change through emotional rather than intellectual understanding, and since a feature film like this offers a way to reach many more people in a much more direct way than a documentary, I welcomed the chance to get involved."
With Ms. Lund's help, Mr. Meirelles set up an acting school in a favela in Rio, without letting residents know that they were in fact auditioning for a movie. For nearly a year, 200 students drawn from an initial pool of 2,000 attended acting classes twice a week, rehearsing scenes with a camera rolling so as "to get them used to the idea," Mr. Meirelles said.
Of the cast chosen, only Matheus Nachtergaele, who plays the drug dealer Sandro Cenoura, is a professional actor. Leandro Firmino da Hora, widely praised in the chilling role of the psychotic drug dealer Ze Pequeno, is a 23-year-old slum dweller who had never acted before; the part of Mane Galinha, a bus driver who vows to take revenge against the gangs after they rape his girlfriend, went to the samba singer Seu Jorge.
Mr. Meirelles also took gambles on the technical side, such as filming with 16- and 35-millimeter cameras at the same time, then converting the film to digital video and modifying the color tones before transferring the video back to 35-millimeter film. Those increasingly colder, washed-out hues, combined with extensive use of hand-held cameras, ended up giving "City of God" a deliberately dizzying and disorienting feel.
"When you see the movie from start to finish, it seems like the director and crew are unlearning everything you're supposed to know about making a film," Mr. Meirelles said. "I wanted it to look like we were losing control, because as time went on the state was losing control of the area to the drug dealers, and that only leads to chaos."
Though happy with the result, Mr. Meirelles still had his doubts about the public's reaction before "City of God" opened in Brazil in late August. Brazilian moviegoers tend to favor big-budget American movies with plenty of special effects, like "Spider-Man" or "Men in Black," and with homegrown fare, they usually prefer frothy comedies starring Brazilian soap opera stars.
But for the last two years, Rio de Janeiro has been under growing assault by drug lords with names like L'il Ze, Elias the Madman and Little Freddie Seashore. In a show of strength early in October, their gangs successfully brought normal daily life to a halt here when they ordered businesses, stores, schools, bus lines and banks throughout the city, including in chic neighborhoods like Ipanema and Copacabana, to close their doors.
In this environment, "City of God" has served as "a wake-up call for Brazilians who haven't wanted to face this problem," said Ms. Lund.
The resulting debate has been emotional and often ferocious. Detractors like Alba Zaluar, the anthropologist who had sponsored Mr. Lins's research and urged him to write his book, complained that the film version of "City of God" was merely recycling the stereotypes "that foreigners expect to see: a country of hungry and abandoned children, of African poverty, of filth and misery, violent."
More typical was the reaction of the veteran film director Arnaldo Jabor, who praised "City of God" for opening "a hole in the national consciousness" that "forces us into the muck, into the slaughterhouse, into everything we hate to see." The movie, he added, shows the world "that hell is here, just behind Ipanema."
Some social commentators have accused "City of God" of both glamorizing and devaluing the bloodshed and brutality that are a daily part of life in Rio's slums, a notion Mr. Meirelles said he found ridiculous. One scene in particular, a young boy's cruel rite of passage into adult gang life, has horrified audiences and become an emblem of the social ills that plague Brazil's showcase city.
"But it is a violence that is intended to generate reflection, not the kind of delight you see in a particular kind of American action film that takes pleasure in showing violence," he said. "In 'Mission Impossible,' Tom Cruise kills something like 30 people, yet you don't feel you are in the presence of an assassin because it's all made to look so pretty and exciting. Here I put the violence in the spectator's head and let them complete the image."
Despite all the controversy, "City of God" has been chosen as Brazil's entry for the Academy Award for best foreign film and has received a Golden Globe nomination for best foreign language film. As for Mr. Meirelles, he is now working on what he describes as "a dramatic comedy about globalization" even as his countrymen continue to argue about the causes of crime and poverty and their solutions.
"I've seen a lot of changes in attitude over the past year, a transformation from the inside out," he said. "Society was asleep, not wanting to recognize this problem, but now it is not, and if my movie has played a small part in that awakening, then I'm pleased."

HEADLINE: Prison Is a Member of Their Family 

BYLINE:  By Adrian Nicole LeBlanc; Adrian Nicole LeBlanc has written for The Times Magazine about female gangs and other topics. This article is adapted from "Random Family: Love, Drugs, Trouble and Coming of Age in the Bronx," to be published next month by Scribner.

 BODY:
Since Nina was born, Lolli has been dressing her for prison. Nina wore new baby clothes for visits to her 16-year-old father, Toney, in a juvenile detention facility not too far from their Bronx neighborhood. As Nina grew, Lolli dressed her daughter for the rarer afternoons in faraway New York State maximum-security visiting rooms. The gaps between visits gave Lolli time to save and shop for the brand-new outfits on layaway. In the inner city, being "dressed" has always been important: it means you are provided for, a part of bigger things. Sloppiness and stains were physical evidence of failure, of poverty winning its battle against you. The night before visits, Lolli would spend hours doing Nina's hair in her father's favorite style -- Shirley Temple curls. Nina groaned and grimaced. Lolli tugged and yanked. Nina winced whenever Lolli cleaned her ears (Toney sometimes checked). In prison, as on the street, a well-dressed family enhanced Toney's stature. Interactions were public, and appearances mattered. 
 On a cold morning early last month, Nina, who is now 12, stood on her stoop, dressed, waiting to visit her father. She was glad about going to see him, eager to go anywhere, to get away from her boring block in an upstate New York town and the chaos of her house. She has been an upstate girl for more than seven years, but like her mom, she still rocks a city style. Nina's thick, dyed blond hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and she flashed a new pair of silver-and-pink Nikes. She was wearing a dark blue velvet sweatsuit Lolli bought for the day. The sweatsuit came from a corner store, whose Bronx-born proprietor imports the New York City ghetto style upstate. 
 As long as Nina could remember, the prison system held uncles and cousins and grandfathers and always her father. Nina, like Toney and Lolli, was raised in the inner city; for all three, prison further demarcated the already insular social geography. Along with the baby showers of teenagers, they attended prisoners' going-away and coming-home parties. Drug dealing and arrests were common on the afternoons Nina spent playing on the sidewalk as she and her parents hung out with their friends. People would be hauled away, while others would unexpectedly reappear, angrier or subdued. Corrections officers escorted one handcuffed cousin to Nina's great-grandmother's funeral; her favorite uncle had to be unshackled in order to approach his dying grandmother's hospital bedside. The prison system was part of the texture of family life.
Since 1974, the year Toney was born, the incarceration rate for young men in America has quadrupled. In his Bronx neighborhood, as in the poorest communities around the country, prison is now a well-established rite of passage. A 2000 study by the U.S. Department of Justice found that about half of the nation's inmates are parents of children under 18. The study also found that almost 1.5 million children had a parent in prison, an increase of more than 500,000 children since 1991. 
Many inmates lose touch with their families -- more than half of all fathers in state prison report having no personal visits with their children. But the family that maintains a significant connection must arrange and rearrange their relationships -- their lives -- around prison. The fact that so many young minority men spend time in jail is "felt acutely at the street level, and influences dating patterns, parenting patterns, the way people do or don't connect to work, the norms of social interactions," says Jeremy Travis of the Urban Institute. These abstractions are the reality for Nina and Lolli and Toney, with whom I have spent countless hours hanging out and shuttling back and forth to prison during the last 10 years. (To gain such access to their lives, I agreed to use only their street nicknames when writing about them.) For them, as for many poor American families, prison and the street are where family life unfolds. 

1988-1990: Toney and Lolli Fall in Love
Love is a place to go in the ghetto. Like thousands of inner-city teenagers, Toney and Lolli met on the street. It was 1988, and drugs had rendered their precarious home situations untenable. Home meant cramped places where too many people and never enough money erupted in too much fighting and sadness and partying. In their Puerto Rican neighborhoods on the eastern and western ends of Tremont Avenue in the Bronx, drug dealing was a mainstay of the local economy.
Lolli wasn't a church girl, and she wasn't much of a schoolgirl either. But she wasn't truly hardened, and she had family. She liked action, although she preferred to watch from the periphery. Boys called her Lollipop because she liked to tuck lollipops in the topknot of her ponytail; her teachers called her Motor Mouth because she talked a lot. After school, she liked watching the boys fooling around in front of a nearby bodega: boys talking to other boys, boys eating Cheez Doodles, boys idly bouncing basketballs, boys on bicycles. 
Toney called attention to himself just by appearing. He sported a red leather jacket with a collar trimmed in what looked like real rabbit fur. His clothes were pressed and clean. He squinted as if he had just sucked on a lime and had a hop in his sexy walk. He was 14 and looked like a boy headed somewhere. 
What Lolli didn't know at the time was what Toney was running from. His mother's life was spiraling out of control, and her longtime boyfriend, a workingman who had given structure to Toney's turbulent household, had recently moved out. Toney usually retreated to his homeboys -- Four-Man Posse, as they called themselves, or F.M.P. As Toney remembers it, within no time he went from playing tag to hiding drugs in his pocket to carrying guns. F.M.P. had an M-1 rifle, a .45 and a shotgun. They hunted for victims on the subway and did a daylight robbery at a sporting goods store.
Toney caught Lolli's attention immediately. "Damn," Lolli remembers saying to her best friend the day she saw him. "That guy looks good." 
At first, Toney later recalled, he'd noticed Lolli the way he noticed all kinds of girls. She was pretty, "real short and thick." He wanted to have sex with her. Having sex with girls was for Toney a daily goal, one he met fairly regularly. "Different girls gave me an opportunity to experience different things," Toney said. But Toney found himself actually liking Lolli, and they started speaking every day. They talked and talked and then they kissed and kissed. When they began to make love, Lolli was silly and happy, not scared and sad like other girls he'd been with. Some neighborhood girls moved like somnambulists through the haze of their depressing streets, but Lolli was playful, ready to try anything. Toney said, "She had this vitality." 
Toney was a player, and even love wasn't going to stop a boy's philandering, but Lolli was the girl he came back to, his "wife." Toney also spent less time robbing and mugging once he had Lolli. It was common knowledge in the neighborhood that a girl could save a boy from the dangers of the street, but Toney wasn't looking to be saved, and Lolli wasn't looking to rescue him. She liked the adventure and wasn't thinking further than that. She started cutting school.
By the fall of 1989, Lolli was pregnant. She was hopeful: both she and Toney said they believed the relationship would go on much as it had, and that they would get help from their moms. Lolli's mother, who had her first child at 14, was less worried about the pregnancy -- lots of girls had bellies -- than about the extra hardship Toney's hoodlum lifestyle guaranteed. She had cousins and siblings who'd been in and out of prison. Her own longtime partner, who was addicted to heroin, managed to stay out of jail, but even with him at home, raising children was a struggle. 
Within weeks, Lolli's mother's fears were realized: Toney was arrested. His crew was involved in a shootout. Toney took the blame -- he knew he'd get less time as a juvenile; his best friend, Pee Wee, also took the rap as a gesture of solidarity. 
In 1990, Toney was sentenced to two-to-six years for attempted murder and shipped to Harlem Valley, the juvenile detention center in Wingdale, N.Y., 50 miles north of the Bronx. By this time, Lolli had quit school. She was now not only a pregnant 15-year-old, but a jailbird's "wife." 

1990-1991: With Bars Between Them
Toney didn't know it, but Harlem Valley would have the best conditions that he would experience during his prison years. In the early 90's, juveniles were still treated like older children who might turn things around. In addition to offering Toney a chance to get his G.E.D., the institution encouraged connection with his family. He had easy access to a phone. He could shoot his own rolls of film with a camera that the staff let the teenagers use. He mailed Lolli pictures of himself sitting in his cinder-block room on his Ninja Turtle sheets. Toney ate the home-cooked food that his mother brought for visits, which she made often, because Metro-North trains ran from New York City to Wingdale. 
Toney's mother hoped that jail would teach her son the lessons she had not been able to. Prison wasn't safe, but it was safer than the street, though you had to establish that you could take care of yourself. Early on, two bigger boys beat Toney, and while he was getting stitches, they stole a pair of his sneakers. In a move that would establish his reputation in the system, Toney did them one better: he waited a week for one of the boys to wear the sneakers, jumped him and took the sneakers right off his feet. 
For Lolli, prison made the relationship hard instead of fun. Face to face in the visiting room with full hours stretched out before them, Lolli and Toney had to figure out new ways to communicate. The unborn baby became their strongest link. Toney hated the idea of being an absent father, like his own father, who moved out when Toney was 2 and was in and out of prison. "For the next four years I'm going to have to handle it," Toney wrote to Lolli. "But anyway at least I have something that's mine and will never stop loving me. My kid."
In April 1990, a healthy, full-term baby girl arrived. Lolli mailed Toney his own baby book. They charted their daughter's progress. Toney wanted Lolli to document with photographs each day he was missing. He stopped asking Lolli questions about herself and wanted to hear only about the baby: does she still have that rash? That bump on her chest? Was Lolli changing her diapers enough? The more controlling Toney became, the more Lolli avoided him. She let Toney's mother take Nina to see Toney on weekends instead. Toney fed her and changed her diaper. When the baby cried, he said, "I ain't letting go till you get used to me." He badgered his mother to keep a close eye on Nina, and promised to take care of her when he got out. 
Lolli's mother also helped with the baby. Lolli welcomed the break. It was summer. Her friends were hanging out and going for midnight swims at Roberto Clemente State Park. She missed having sex with Toney. One night, she and an ex-boyfriend got together. Within three months of Nina's birth, Lolli was pregnant again. 
Toney was devastated -- and furious. He didn't want Lolli to turn out like his mother or his oldest sister, having babies by different fathers. Lolli loved Toney, but she could not go through with an abortion. Toney still called regularly to check on Nina -- Lolli would hold the receiver to Nina's mouth to capture sounds -- but Toney's inquiries quickly turned into diatribes. He promised to make Lolli's life miserable once he got out. 

1991-1993: Back to the Neighborhood
In October 1991, after completing the minimum two years of his sentence, Toney arrived back home in the Bronx. He stripped at the threshold of his mother's apartment door. His prison clothes formed a puddle at his feet. Prison clothes were believed to bring a house bad luck, and his mother's house had already had enough: Toney's oldest sister, who had contributed to the household, had recently been arrested on a drug charge, leaving behind three little girls. 
A condition of Toney's parole was that he either get a job or return to school. He attended Bronx Community College, thinking it would be easier to skip. The B.C.C. campus was on the west side, close to Lolli's mother. Toney and Lolli soon started sleeping together again. Lolli would leave her new baby girl, Che Che, with her mother, and wait with Nina for Toney after class. Watching the students, Lolli wished she had never dropped out of school. Toney shared whatever he was learning -- math, new words. Lolli liked math the best. Within a couple of months, though, Toney stopped attending college. His mother's latest boyfriend was arrested; she was getting high, and someone needed to pay the bills. Toney took a job overseeing crack sales and tried to keep his mother in check. 
Toney still loved Lolli, but wanted to punish her for becoming pregnant by someone else. He brought other girls into his bedroom at his mother's house. Lolli waited out his company. Sometimes, she and Nina slept on the couch. Even after one girl moved in at his mother's, he regularly saw Lolli; he would pass by her mother's apartment at bedtime to tuck in Nina. Lolli accepted his divided attention as punishment for having another boy's baby. But Nina, who was 2, wasn't having it. She fought on behalf of both of them. Sometimes Toney would drive Nina around in his car. If he offered a girl a ride, Nina refused to relinquish the passenger seat. "My chair!" she'd say, or, "Mommy's chair!" and the girl would have to sit in back. 
The repetitiveness of drug dealing quickly bored Toney, and he started robbing again with F.M.P. He was hardheaded and 17, bursting with angry energy. He understood that his actions had consequences, but in his world, the consequences seemed less determined by action or intention than by the luck of the draw. That Christmas, after robbing a drug dealer, he came home with $25,000, intoxicated with the ease of the job. He paid his mother's overdue rent, stocked the shelves with food and bought presents for his nieces. He outfitted himself and his live-in girlfriend with sneakers and jewelry and coats. He always made sure Nina had everything she needed, and with his new money, he bought her a black leather shearling. He even bought things for Lolli's other daughter, Che Che, a gesture that Lolli interpreted hopefully. 
But Toney was stopped one night and charged with driving without a license; he spent the summer of 1992 on Rikers Island for violating parole. By the time he got out that fall, his mother had been evicted. Toney quickly found a new girlfriend. One night she had a party, and everything was upended again. 
Toney's friend Pee Wee became deadly when he partied, and on this night, after drinking, he got into an argument with a group of boys at a White Castle. Toney arrived and tried to calm Pee Wee in the parking lot, but couldn't. He then accompanied him inside. The trouble exploded instantly. Guns blasting, Toney and Pee Wee backed out the glass front doors.
Pee Wee had a habit of stepping in front of Toney whenever they got into shootouts; he was shorter, and Toney fired over his head. Toney had repeatedly warned Pee Wee about this habit, but it was also a testament to the trust between them. But this time, Toney tripped. He doesn't remember pulling the trigger, but he remembers his friend going down, his chin lifting toward the sky as the bullet tore through the back of his head. 
Toney, anguished, spent those first hours after the shooting at his girlfriend's, muttering incoherently and threatening to kill himself. For the next several months, he lived on the lam, staying with her and with other girls. When he thought it was safe, he met with Lolli and saw Nina. These stolen moments between other girlfriends were the closest Toney and Lolli ever came to conventional family life. In January 1993, the police picked up Toney. He pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter. 
Around the same time, Lolli's mother suffered a nervous breakdown. By the time the authorities transferred Toney upstate, Lolli and her two young daughters were living in a homeless shelter. And Lolli was pregnant by Toney again. 

1993: Toney Hedges His Bets
By the fall of 1993, Toney was 19, an inmate at the Coxsackie Correctional Facility in Coxsackie, N.Y., facing 9 to 18 years. Most of Coxsackie's inmates were young, so there were lots of stabbings and cuttings and robberies. Some inmates called it Gladiator School. Toney promptly immersed himself in the mix -- conning and fighting, the prison version of inner-city streets. In the yard, he ran into his old friend Ace from the F.M.P. crew. They hung out and spoke of all the girls they'd known, or wished they'd known, and wondered which girls would answer the letters they floated into the world -- inmates called them kites. 
"The whole thing is about getting women to write to pass the time," Toney said then. If you were a boy with a long sentence, letters reminded you of what was out there, what else was possible -- which was why some lifers preferred no letters at all. Toney cast a wide net. For starters his correspondents included Lolli and the girl he had been with right after he killed Pee Wee -- he had gotten her pregnant, and she had just had a baby. He wrote another girl named Ily, whom he knew from childhood. He wrote other girls in care of friends, because he remembered only their nicknames, buildings or blocks. He recalled telling Ace, "We shoulda kept their addresses if this was the kind of life we was gonna lead." 
Toney feared that no girl would stick by him. He didn't doubt Lolli's love as much as her ability to remain faithful to him. 
Lolli herself was overwhelmed, with two toddlers and her and Toney's new baby, Tati. Her life was a string of appointments -- recertification for welfare, screenings for public housing, the sign-ins to collect vouchers for the federal food supplement program, W.I.C. If she wasn't dressing the girls for an appointment, on the way to an appointment or on the bus ride home from one, Lolli was sitting in bleak rooms crowded with women and children in the long yawn of waiting to be seen. 
Toney went through periods of writing Lolli every day -- love letters, angry letters, letters brimming with baby instructions and fathering commands. He was constantly after her to bring the children to the prison, so that Nina wouldn't forget him and so that Tati, the baby, would get to know him. He also wanted Lolli to make arrangements to bring the daughter he'd had with his girlfriend, who had dropped out of contact. But getting upstate was much harder than hopping the train to Harlem Valley; the shuttle bus cost $60, which had to be saved in advance. Often, after using her welfare check to buy her daughters what they needed, Lolli had to make $5 stretch for the last two weeks of the month. Sometimes she borrowed fare from a loan shark, but with the 100 percent interest, the loans left her weeks behind. 
When Toney wasn't writing Lolli, the possibility of conjugal visits preoccupied his restless mind. His adult designation made him potentially eligible for the Family Reunion Program, known inside prison as "trailers" -- for the trailers on the compound where an inmate could spend a few days every three to six months with his family in relative privacy. (Although some researchers believe that strong family ties may lower recidivism rates, New York is one of only a handful of states to allow trailers.) But to qualify, wives had to be legal wives. If Toney wanted sex, he had to marry; and trailers required a girl with resources -- money for the traveling and the three days of food, persistence to assemble all the necessary documentation and fill out the required paperwork and stamina to withstand the duration of her husband's prison sentence, or "bid." 
Toney needed a pretty-enough stand-up girl who did her job -- brought his children regularly to visit, gave him sex, sent him monthly food packages and put money in his commissary account. He hoped for a girl who would understand him and also check up on his mother, but he wasn't expecting that. Lolli was disorganized and easily distracted, and she was always letting him down. He considered Ily, his childhood friend. Each weekend Lolli failed to visit increased Ily's appeal. Ily wasn't enamored of the hoodlum lifestyle. She used to warn Toney to tuck in his gold chains whenever she passed him on their old Bronx streets. Prison life was familiar to Ily -- so many of her relatives had been in prison that her mother had inherited nine children. Like Lolli, Ily wanted to get out of the neighborhood, and although she was also a single mother on welfare, her family situation gave her a chance. She had only one child, and her ex-husband and mother helped out. 
Lolli couldn't fix the past, but she did her best at mothering. She didn't visit Toney much, but she bought Father's Day cakes, read his letters aloud and decorated her space in the shelter with his prison Polaroids. She kissed his image at night before she tucked the girls in bed. Whenever she could afford to, Lolli took pictures of Nina and Tati and mailed them to Toney. Nina, who was now 3, posed gangsta style, like the Polaroids of her father and his F.M.P. friends -- hands on bent knees, with a menacing look, or standing, arms folded across her chest, her expression intently grim. Lolli worried about Nina's toughness, because she was already getting into altercations with her classmates at preschool; her favorite TV show was "COPS." But Lolli encouraged it -- she wanted to keep alive Nina's connection to her father.

1994: In the Hole
By early 1994, visiting Toney had gone from being difficult to almost impossible. The authorities had moved him four hours farther north to a prison called Southport -- nearly seven hours from the city, an unwelcome relocation that he'd earned for injuring a guard during a riot in the Coxsackie yard. Southport was an isolation-unit facility in Pine City, N.Y., where inmates were sent if the isolation units of their own prisons weren't punishment enough. Toney could still receive visits, but otherwise he faced endless days of 23-hour lockdown in a single-man cell, or box. He was desperately lonely. He started suffering anxiety attacks. The endless hours with nothing to do gave him the chance to think about the way he had lived his life. To his surprise, he missed playing with Nina more than he missed hanging out with his friends. He spent most of his time writing letters to Lolli and to Ily. Ily's mobility placed Lolli's passivity in a harsher light. But he begged Lolli to visit and to bring the girls. 
One cold night that winter, Lolli, Nina and baby Tati boarded a bus at Columbus Circle, one of several private buses that haul families and friends of prisoners upstate. Without them, the visits would have been impossible; few neighborhood people had cars. Passengers often recognized one another -- from other routes, from the long hours spent together waiting in prison processing or from the neighborhood. Some of the women became friends.
On the bus, veteran visitors had equipped themselves with rolls of quarters and crisp dollars for the vending machines, clear plastic bags for locker keys and change. Some brought along pretty outfits, whose perfection they preserved in dry-cleaning bags. The cost of the trip used up most of Lolli's money. Toney's mother's new boyfriend sent along $20 to deposit in Toney's commissary account, and Lolli had budgeted an additional $20 for the vending machines so that Toney and the girls could eat. 
About half an hour from the prison, the bus pulled into a truck stop. The women gathered themselves and crowded into the cramped bathroom. They didn't want to dress in the prison bathroom -- that would take precious minutes of their visits. They tucked and scrutinized and tightened, sharing compliments and lipstick and complaints in the toasty bathroom air. 
In a stall, Lolli slipped into a conservative outfit one of Toney's sisters had lent her -- a beige turtleneck and matching skirt, topped by an embroidered vest. Her own style was sporty, but she wanted Toney to see that she had matured. She wore sheer stockings beneath the slitted skirt, so she could show Toney a new tattoo of his name that she'd gotten. Inside the visiting room, Lolli followed Nina, who searched for her father among the inmates in an interior cage in the center of the dreary room. As they headed to their seat assignment, Toney shuffled toward them, despondent, chin down, shackled in leg irons and handcuffs attached to a chain around his waist. Nina looked terrified. "Come out!" she said desperately. "Over here."
"Can't you see I'm chained up?" he said, lifting his wrists slightly. "I can't move."
"Take them off," she demanded. "Take them off! Take them off!"
"I can't."
"Play patty-cake!" Nina pleaded.
"Nina," Lolli chided.
Suddenly Nina brightened. It was as if she grasped that her father couldn't tolerate the view of himself that her panic reflected. "Wanna hear a song?" Nina asked. Toney squinted, as if he had suddenly recognized her voice from far away. Then she sang. Her father was smitten by her performance until she said, "That's Che Che's daddy's song," referring to the father of her half-sister, and puncturing the moment. Toney looked away stonily. 
Toney often smarted at reminders of Lolli's infidelity, but solitary confinement magnified his need for a reliable family. At other prisons, Lolli and Toney could bridge their troubles by hugging and kissing, but the cage between them at Southport made what was always hard more difficult. Lolli busied herself with Tati. Toney didn't tease Lolli affectionately the way he used to, or compliment her dressy outfit. He said nothing about the special Weeboks Tati wore. Nina provided distraction by exploring the visiting room, collecting compliments. Lolli didn't dare say anything; she didn't want to ruin what little time they had together with their kids.
Around noon, Toney reached through the slot and held what he could of Lolli's hand. Touch did what only touch could do. Lolli's words poured out. She told him about a new girl at the homeless shelter who was sharing her prison expertise. The girl had had a prison wedding. She had told Lolli about all the right things to bring for trailers -- satin sheets, and cream and strawberries. 
Toney waited for her to finish, then said tenderly, "Sex ain't everything." The box had forced him to do some thinking. If they were going to marry, they needed more than a physical connection. They needed to communicate in ways that didn't require privacy. At best, they'd have trailers three or four times a year, and fewer if Toney didn't improve his disciplinary record. Lolli bit her lip. His new hopes came across as a reprimand: "I want it to be you love me and I love you. Where happiness comes in is when I'm making you happy and you do things to make me happy." Neither of them was clear on what those things could be. 
All around them, couples were whispering. Some were laughing, others were scolding increasingly restless kids. Next to them, a young black man placed his head down near the slot so an older white woman could braid his hair through the wire that separated them. 
"I'm starting to think about going back to that cell, and it's got me real depressed," Toney said with an hour of the visit left. The pending goodbye wedged between them as the remaining minutes dwindled. A guard called time. Chairs scraped the linoleum. The men tried to stretch. Children's hands clasped the grating like small claws, and men and women tried to kiss through the mesh.
"You better come next week, or I'll punch you in the face," Toney said miserably. "You got my hopes up." 
Shortly afterward, Toney wrote and told Lolli to limit the girls' visits. He didn't want them to see him caged that way. He later admitted that not being able to play with Nina and hold the baby during the visit hurt more than not seeing his children at all. 

1994-1996: New Relationships
If reason played a part in Lolli and Toney's relationship, its role kept changing. They broke up, and got back together, then broke up again and reunited, for reasons both of them eventually lost track of. Toney threatened and cajoled her to bring the children, but Lolli was chronically broke. Meanwhile, Toney tested Ily's level of devotion. When he left Southport and was moved farther north, to Clinton, he invited her up: "I was the farthest I could be. If she can troop here, then I'm cool." Toney still corresponded with Lolli, and on the envelope of one of his conciliatory letters to her was a reminder that suggested he knew, even if Lolli didn't, the inevitable outcome of the growing distance between them: "Use your mind to control all your body parts." 
But it was too late. Lolli had already cheated. An old flame with whom she had been corresponding while he was in prison had been released and had paid her a visit. She was pregnant. Shortly after Toney heard the news, he proposed to Ily. They married in February 1995. He was fond of Ily, but, he said: "I wasn't focusing on what a relationship should be -- I was focusing on what I could get out of a relationship." But even the limited connection motivated him to behave. "I didn't want to get in trouble no more because I wanted to keep getting trailers," Toney said. "My main concern was sex."
Lolli's main concern was how to survive. Her newest baby was premature and remained in intensive care for several months. Meanwhile, Lolli had been placed in her own apartment, but dealers ruled the decrepit building, and her kitchen was infested with rats. Her mother's apartment was no better: a dealer was using one of the bedrooms as a stash house, and with all the traffic, Lolli worried for the safety of her daughters. Lolli decided to move upstate, outside of Albany, with a friend who promised to help with the children. The friend was caring for three of Toney's nieces (Toney's sister having been sentenced to 10 years in prison). When Lolli learned of Toney's marriage, she impulsively asked a boy she knew, Capone, to move away with her. She wasn't in love, but she didn't want to be alone. She cared for Capone, and he was good to her daughters. And he wasn't a player. Nina, who was nearly 5, reserved judgment, but within weeks, Che Che and Tati called him Papi, and he treated the newest baby like his own. 
Despite their ties to other people, Toney and Lolli kept in touch. Sometimes they grew nostalgic and spent hours on the phone. In one call, Toney and Lolli fantasized that on his release date, he'd take Nina and Tati somewhere far away -- maybe Florida -- where they could be a family just once, before Toney returned to his legal wife. 
Lolli pretended more generosity toward Ily than she felt: "Who knows? You could fall in love with your wife." Lolli still loved him absolutely, but felt foolish telling him -- not so much because he'd married, but because she'd let him down again. 

1996-1997: Problem Child
For the next few years, Toney and Lolli had erratic contact as their lives ran along parallel tracks, each trying to scrape by financially and make their new relationships work. Nina was the glue that held them together. She was very bright, but she was starting to have disciplinary problems at school and was difficult at home. Lolli tried to control her, but she didn't know how to hold the line. If Capone got involved, Nina yelled, "You ain't my father!"
Lolli would write Toney for advice. Sometimes she was desperate: "I need help with your daughter so bad." But what could Toney do from prison? He spent more time with Ily's son, Jay, than with his own child. He asked Lolli to bring Nina to visit, but the prison was too far and money too tight. Toney wrote to Nina, but she was still too young to write back. Nina did, however, dedicate songs to him that she liked to sing with the radio, and she took seriously her job of teaching Tati that Toney, not Capone, was her dad. Nina quizzed her sister with photographs. But too many nights, Nina stomped to bed, screaming, "I want my father," raging until, exhausted, she fell asleep.
At one point when things were especially hard, Lolli wrote Toney about her urge to move back to the city. But Toney thought she would be resigning herself to a lifestyle she'd tried to escape. He wrote back: "I really don't want my daughters growing up in the Bronx. . . . I don't want my daughters to come out like you or me."
One night, when Nina was 6, she asked her mother if she would write a letter to her father. A few weeks before, Lolli had bailed Capone out of jail after a minor charge. Nina had been preoccupied by what had happened. She dictated as Lolli scribbled:
Dear Daddy,
How you doing? Fine I hope. As for myself I'm confused about something. Mommy's boyfriend got locked up, and she bailed him out. I want to know why she didn't bail you out. . . . I don't understand. Mom tried to explain to me. I want to hear what you have to say now. Daddy I'm telling Tati every day that you love her. Daddy write back once you get my letter. I love you. 
Love,
Nina and Tati
Lolli didn't know where to begin the explanation. She dreaded Nina's reaching an age where she would ask serious questions. Lolli had never explained to Nina why her father was locked up, or why her sisters had different fathers. 

1997-1998: Forced Reflection
While Nina was getting into trouble at home, Toney descended into the self-destruction of the prison mix. He had long ago decided not to join a gang for protection, but his independence meant he had to prove he was capable of doing anything. He fought often and had many enemies. He spent part of 1997 in the box for carrying a shank. In a panic, he wrote his oldest sister, who was also in prison, about his greatest fear: "The only time I feel at ease is when I'm with Nina. Tati and my other daughter are lost to me. They don't treat me like their father. . . . Nina is all I have left. And she's slowly slipping away. . . . Once she's gone . . . I will lose myself."
In 1998, he almost did. After not seeing his daughters for more than a year, Toney arranged for Ily to bring Nina and Tati along with Ily's son during their next trailer visit. The trailer happened to coincide with Nina's 8th birthday. For weeks, it was all she spoke about. But at the last minute, the trailer was canceled -- there had been a fight at the prison, and Toney had been slashed. In the mix, such trouble was inevitable. He was thrown into protective custody, with 29 stitches across his back. Nina was crushed. And Toney was once again shipped back to solitary confinement at Southport. 
In the hole again, without distractions, Toney felt the pain that he'd caused his family outside. In addition to having to cancel his trailer with his daughters, he was looking at one to three more years added to his term for possessing the shank. Serving time for killing his best friend was justice; hurting his wife and children was unbearable. 
The trailers forced fidelity to a single woman and exposed him to a more conventional notion of family. Temporarily losing the trailers made him acutely aware of what he needed. Not just the sex, but something he'd never had in his own home: three days of living in peace. "The first time I've ever been truly able to be part of a family has been at those trailers," he said. 
Prison had been the perfect place for shutting down, and when Lolli became pregnant with another boy's baby all those years back while Toney was in juvenile detention, he'd sworn never to make himself vulnerable again. He'd been conning Ily all along -- not thinking about what he could offer her but scheming to make sure that she didn't stop taking care of him. Ily, on the other hand, had stood by him, throughout all his prison troubles, with a faith that he could barely imagine for himself. 
"She gave me her life," he said later, still stunned at the enormity of it. He wanted to be the family man he was on those weekends. To be there for his children he had to plan for a future. For that, he needed hope. And there was no way to hope without being vulnerable. 

1999-2001: Out of the Mix
By the spring of 1999, after turning 25, Toney had finally stepped out of the mix and kept to himself. Toney said, "I was either gonna end up killed or murdering someone, and I thought about how that would make my daughter feel, to come to my funeral for that."
He volunteered as a speaker for teenagers from juvenile hall. Toney told them about his own days in juvenile, wanting to be a gangster, being locked up. The interactions inspired him, but he remained troubled at the paradox. He was a better father to others' kids than he was to his own.
He stopped writing to other girls and told Lolli their relationship was truly over. It hurt Lolli, but her feelings for Capone had been growing, and eventually she said that she was happy for Toney. They'd failed each other, but still had their kids.
By early 2000, Lolli was dealing with her fifth child, a son with Capone. And Ily was pregnant with Toney's baby. Toney had wanted to wait to be sure that his marriage would hold before having another child. He also wanted to focus on the children he already had. But Ily thought a baby would prove Toney's commitment to a positive future, and Toney felt he was in no position to resist. 
In July 2000, Toney's security status was reduced, and he was sent to a medium-security prison, Woodbourne, the calmest of all the prisons he'd been in. Most of the inmates at the prison, which was in Woodbourne, N.Y., were in their late 30's and older. Toney was used to prisons where stabbings happened daily; at Woodbourne, months passed between incidents. His relative freedom was exciting. Toney's enthusiasm for the tiny, substantial pleasures was contagious. He beamed like a child. 
Two years ago, he signed up for an inmate-run college program. Higher education for New York State inmates was a rarity. Of the 30 men who signed up, only half stayed on. Toney was one of them. The inmates were tough professors. He loved school.
But Nina weighed heavily on his mind. Lolli's letters showered Toney with worries about Nina, who was expressing interest in boys and edging closer to the street. At home, Nina, who was now 10, inherited more responsibility. Lolli was working hard hours at a factory, and Capone, who was unemployed, was supposed to watch the children. But Lolli would often arrive home after her shift and find Nina taking care of the kids and Capone hanging out with his friends on the street. At school, Nina would fall asleep in class or be disruptive and resist authority -- she refused to open her book or salute the flag and pounded the computer keys. Her exasperated teacher often sent her off to the nurse's office or to the guidance counselor, where Nina inevitably napped.
By the spring of 2001, after many suspensions, Nina was expelled from fifth grade and placed on probation. Until the academic year ended, a home tutor visited Nina an hour a day. The rest of the time she spent watching TV and watching her siblings, yearning for something interesting to do. After Nina's suspension, Lolli mailed Toney a copy of the thick packet of Nina's school records. In his cell, he pored over the many pages and said sadly, "It's like reading a book about myself."
Toney was taking parenting and psychology classes, and the more he learned, the more he hungered for news about Nina that was positive. In his letters to her, he made a point to acknowledge her strengths instead of just reprimanding her for her weaknesses. He hated the long gaps between the visits with Nina and Tati. "I don't think it's fair, you know. But I'm not saying it's Lolli's fault. I gotta understand that she got all them kids, and she's going through her own problems, and sometimes I say, You know, I ain't got it that bad." The absence of Lolli and the kids was underscored by the growing connection he had with Ily, her son, Jay, and their new baby, Elexis, whom he saw nearly every weekend. He was a better father now. When Nina was Elexis' age, Toney said, "I was more curious about what was happening in New York City, what girls was over there, what's going on in the street." Now he spent hours playing with Elexis in the walled-in children's room. 
Last January, Toney graduated near the top of his class. Lolli was proud. She always knew he was intelligent -- just like his daughters -- and she admitted her admiration for the steadfastness of his wife. "I got to give it to her, sticking by him all this time," Lolli said. Lolli was experiencing her own evolution. She had held several full-time jobs, and had recently found one in which she thrived. She did "disaster restoration," chemically cleaning up after fires, floods and bloody crimes. Though the days were long -- she sometimes worked a 16-hour shift -- the pay was poor and the job was dangerous, she liked helping people. And she was considered one of the best workers in the region. 
Now that Lolli was a working woman, being a prison wife was a lifestyle she could no longer even imagine. But she and Toney worried that its lore beckoned to Nina. Toney blamed Lolli for burdening herself and Nina with too many children. But mostly he blamed himself. He'd been in prison for most of Nina's life. Nina was 12, and all they'd really had together were the rare, timed phone calls, and rarer visits. 

2002: Nina Visits
Last month, I took Nina to see her father. Woodbourne -- a 90-minute drive from her front stoop -- was the 10th prison Nina had visited of the 12 that had housed her father over the past 13 years. Lolli rarely sees Toney anymore, but he speaks to his daughters periodically. Lolli is happy to pay for Toney's calls when she can: the fathers of her two other daughters have been out of prison for years, but they rarely call in. 
In the Woodbourne visiting room, Nina bought her father his favorite snacks from the vending machines -- inmates cannot handle money -- walked over to their assigned table and sat down. Toney came over and stood above her, radiant and wanting. 
"C'mon!" he said, pulling Nina up from her chair to hug him. She reluctantly stood, grinning shyly into his broad chest. He reached across the table, grabbed her pale cheeks and pinched. 
"Stoppit!" she yelled, burying her delight. 
"How's your new school?" he asked excitedly. 
"They trying to give me a disability," she continued, the current of connection tugging her toward her trouble. The disability referred to a school meeting she faced in a few weeks time, the purpose of which she didn't understand. It involved assessing whether or not Nina should be placed in special ed. "They didn't tell me what for -"
"They are probably going to say you are psychologically unstable, and have an attitude that they can't control -"
"Tell me what they mean," Nina asked, frustrated by the verbiage. 
"I am," Toney said, "psychobabble -"
"Just stop please with them big words -" 
Toney paused, and tried again. "They're saying you're crazy."
Wounded, Nina replied, "But I'm not." 
Toney looked hurt. "I'm not saying you are." 
Toney explained how the same things had happened to him before he dropped out of junior high. "I want you to learn from my mistakes. I don't want you to walk in these footsteps. If I was home, I would take you on a crash course on the streets. I'd show you for real what the streets are."
"I know what the streets are like," she said.
Toney nodded. "That's what I'm worried about."
These days their infrequent visits often went this way: Toney lecturing, determined to cram in life's larger lessons in their limited time, while Nina demanded to know why she couldn't have a boyfriend or get an eyebrow ring. Toney saw through the surface to the dangers Nina couldn't see -- a street culture that pooled around their lives and whose currents were made stronger by the absence of other, more positive things. Toney tried humor. He tried facts -- rape, early pregnancy, drugs. He tried to explain that both he and Lolli had grown up too fast, that there was life beyond the street. But, he later admitted, he didn't really know what that life was. It was a world he himself was trying to reach. 
Nina had some inkling of that larger world. After being on a waiting list for two years, she had been assigned a Big Sister mentor. Each week they spent time together outside Nina's neighborhood. They have gone apple-picking and have carved pumpkins, things Nina had never done before. The match is not unlike Toney's marriage to Ily, a vital relationship, but one that exists in a vacuum.
Toney knew that Nina's future rested on what he had learned the hard way -- how to create some sanctuary within yourself. For him it was a precarious balance -- holding out hope for a normal life while still needing to cope in the prison world. Nina faced a similar challenge: how to find a future she couldn't know, while navigating the minefield of adolescent street life. 
Toney, now 28, is scheduled to appear before the parole board in May. He has four children and has never held a legitimate job. But he is better off than most inmates like him: he managed to acquire some higher education, and he has a home life waiting for him. 
As she did on every visit, Nina begged her father to give her his gold chain, a cross he has had from the beginning of his bid. As he always did, he told her he didn't want her to have something from prison. "Kind of like superstition," he said. Nina wanted to make the bad time good. "If I have that, it's like I have him, because that was him those years," she said. 
Toney knew that their shared past was lost. He could look forward only to the future and hope that Nina would be a part of it. She will soon be the same age that he was when he met Lolli. "Everything at the tip of your fingers," Toney said, "and at the same time slipping away."

HEADLINE: FILM; 
Laughing Through the Pain In the Holy Land

BYLINE:  By LESLIE CAMHI; Leslie Camhi's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the film "Russian Ark."

 BODY:
IN the Palestinian filmmaker Elia Suleiman's vision of the Holy Land, motorboats pull water-skiers across the lake where Jesus walked. Souvenir bottles of "sacred water" are filled at the tap. Soldiers go haywire and begin folk dancing at checkpoints. And Santa is stabbed by a bunch of street kids from Nazareth.
 "Divine Intervention," Mr. Suleiman's second feature, which he directed, wrote and stars in, is an unlikely comedy set on the West Bank and in Israel. It opens in New York on Friday. Mr. Suleiman (whose melancholy, silent deadpan recalls that of Buster Keaton) portrays E. S., an enigmatic hipster from Jerusalem, whose father lies dying in the hospital and whose unnamed lover (played by the Palestinian journalist Manal Khader) lives across the Green Line in Ramallah. Because she lives in the West Bank, her movements are restricted, so she and E. S. meet regularly to hold hands in the deserted parking lot of an Israeli checkpoint between their two cities. 
 This slender, episodic plot is merely the excuse for a series of elegant, barbed gags, distilling the frustration, rage and hopelessness of contemporary Palestinian existence into a wry burlesque. Imagine Jacques Tati stumbling, with impeccable comic timing, across the potholes of the Middle East. Mr. Suleiman manages to infuse the region's dark conflicts with a gleeful absurdism. 
"People sometimes ask me, 'How can you talk about a tragic situation with humor?' " Mr. Suleiman said in New York in the fall while showing his movie at the New York Film Festival. "Well, that's exactly the place where we want to create some kind of lightness. It's not a political strategy, but it's a way of resisting any kind of dominance over my imagination. In fact, it's a form of liberation."
"Divine Intervention" (subtitled "A Chronicle of Love and Pain") begins in the Israeli-Arab town of Nazareth, where Mr. Suleiman, 42, was born and raised. (He now divides his time between Paris and Jerusalem.) In a series of hilarious vignettes, Palestinian neighbors heap garbage in each other's yards, puncture basketballs and trade imprecations.
"I sucked from the street life of Nazareth a kind of ghetto humor," Mr. Suleiman recalled, describing his hometown as "two square kilometers filled with 80,000 people -- unemployed, harassed, frustrated and living in stasis."
"There's a total disintegration of any form of social communication or harmony between them," he said.
Quitting school after the ninth grade, Mr. Suleiman escaped at 17 to London, and then to New York, where he worked at odd jobs while friends who attended New York University film school sneaked him into screenings. He remained on the Lower East Side for 14 years, cadging grants for short videos and returning home intermittently. "Introduction to the End of an Argument" (1991), a collaboration with the video artist Jayce Salloum, was a fast-paced collage of found footage aimed at deconstructing images of Arabs and Palestinians drawn from Western media. "Homage by Assassination" (1992), commissioned during the Persian Gulf War, marked the first appearance of Mr. Suleiman's cinematic alter ego. He plays a man sitting in New York while Baghdad is being bombed and dreaming of what it means to be a Palestinian.
In 1994, Mr. Suleiman moved to Jerusalem to establish the department of Film and Media Studies at Bir Zeit University near Ramallah. Two years later, his "Chronicle of a Disappearance" won the prize for best first feature at the Venice Film Festival. Its loose, diarylike narrative, about a Palestinian filmmaker who returns to Jerusalem to develop ideas for his latest project, is the thread on which Mr. Suleiman hangs a series of visual puns and poetic imagery that capture the strange temporality of life in a land that is at once ancient and hyper-modern and where a people exist in a state of suspended identity.
"Elia's films catch people by surprise," said Richard Pena, director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center. "People brace themselves if they're going to see a Palestinian film, thinking it's bound to be full of anger. Instead, they discover this gentleness and soft humor. Few people would doubt that these are committed works. But they approach people at odd angles, and make them rethink their positions."
"Chronicle of a Disappearance" ends with Mr. Suleiman's parents at home, dozing in front of the closing shot on late-night television, a picture of the Israeli flag waving to the tune of the national anthem, "Hatikva.""It's a total snub," Mr. Suleiman explained. "It's the fact that my parents don't give a damn about the Israeli flag, even when it's in their living room. Israeli critics said it was one of the most painful moments in the history of cinema against Israel. And at the same time, critics in Arab countries misread the irony and called me a Zionist collaborator, and I couldn't go anywhere in the Arab world with the film."
His more recent works include "Cyber-Palestine" (2000), a 15-minute video commissioned by the town of Bethlehem for the year 2000. In it, Mary and Joseph are Palestinians living in Gaza; she's pregnant and trying to make it to the West Bank through various checkpoints in order to give birth in Manger Square.
"Divine Intervention" had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, where it won both the Jury Prize and an award given by the International Society of Film Critics. Admirers were quick to draw comparisons with Chaplin and Keaton. In fact, the influences Mr. Suleiman claims are mostly literary: the ruptured, episodic style of the critic Walter Benjamin, or the tender humanism of the writer Primo Levi.
On the telephone from Paris, Humbert Balsan, the film's producer, said that Mr. Suleiman's refusal of realism and his use of the still camera (a common stylistic device in silent films) lend his work a timeless quality. "The aesthetics of the still camera puts him in touch with a certain calm in the midst of the insanity of war," Mr. Balsan said.
Mr. Suleiman finished the script for "Divine Intervention" well before the onset of the second intifada, in September 2000. The filming was planned for Bethlehem but had to be relocated when fighting broke out there. At one point, the crew of Israeli, Palestinian and French technicians found the main street of Nazareth, where their production office was situated, engulfed by Israeli-Arab demonstrations, which were violently quelled by the police.
Though its charm may be disarming, the film also anticipates the raw emotions that have boiled over in the last two years. Its most disturbing sequence is a highly stylized, digitally assisted fantasy in which Ms. Khader, disguised as a keffiyah-clad Ninja, wreaks havoc on a group of Israeli soldiers in training, defending herself with a shield shaped like the map of pre-1948 Palestine, before disappearing into the sky.
"Israelis may be angered or offended by those scenes," Avi Kleinberger, an Israeli Jew and the film's line producer, said by telephone from Tel Aviv. "But I think people will also identify with the frustration and the fantasy of just blowing the other away in a burst of violence. It's not California here. People are loud, pushy, on edge. Sometimes I have a fantasy that I'm Chuck Norris, a karate expert, and can cut them all down."
Although "Divine Intervention" received a rapturous premiere in November in Ramallah, it has yet to be shown within Israel proper. But like the movie's image of a toy balloon imprinted with the face of Yasir Arafat, which floats comically across the check point as Israeli soldiers look on in consternation, "Divine Intervention" may find its way.
"Cinema is the negation of the notion of nationalism," Mr. Suleiman said. "Of course, if there's a denial of Palestinianism as a cultural or national entity, then you fight for it. But in fact, cinema is yearning to cross those boundaries all the time."

HEADLINE: California Waves; 
Los Angeles Becomes A Base for Cutting-Edge Performance

BYLINE:  By JOHN ROCKWELL 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
IN the beginning, there were mountains and beaches and deserts and American Indians and, a little later, some scattered Spanish villages and orange groves. Then urbanity and suburbanity connected the villages, turning Los Angeles into a sprawling metropolis dominated artistically by the entertainment industry.
 But it was only in 1984 that light broke upon the waters, at least in terms of a vanguard performance culture. It was then, at the still fondly remembered Olympic Arts Festival, that Los Angeles and its surrounding communities discovered a new world of cutting-edge performing arts. They liked what they saw, but they weren't able to sustain it. Until maybe now, nearly 20 years later. 
 Today, seemingly all of a sudden, theater, dance, music and strange hybrids thereof are cropping up all over the Los Angeles basin. Many of the attractions are well known at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and around the country, although their proliferation represents a decided plus for Southern California. What is really exciting, though, is the steady evolution of an arts sensibility distinctive to this part of the country. 
That sensibility involves not just an enthusiasm for local artists who are as yet unknown on the East Coast, but also a growing awareness of Southern California's large Asian and Latin American communities and its presence as part of the Pacific Rim.
Until lately, much of the credit for arts innovation here has rightly gone to the museums: the Los Angeles County Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Getty and several more, all with flashy architecture, ambitious curatorial programs and youthful publics.
The biggest effort in the performing arts was the Los Angeles Festival, which offered installments of a month or two in 1987, 1990 and 1993, the last two under Peter Sellars's direction. They ultimately failed because of a lack of funds and of accessibility to a broader public. Still, Mr. Sellars's programming, with its emphasis on the work of Asians and local minorities, has proved prescient in today's climate.
Since then, apart from some periodic good work from the U.C.L.A. Performing Arts series, most of the lively efforts here have been smaller and centered in downtown Los Angeles, where in recent years clubs have proliferated that sometimes transform themselves into vanguard performance spaces.
Some of the larger performing institutions have also shown signs of new life. The Los Angeles Opera, now directed by Placido Domingo, has followed on the heels of the Long Beach Opera, which specializes in postmodernist productions. The Los Angeles company has done so by bringing in film directors like John Schlesinger, Maximilian Schell and William Friedkin to stage productions, and by hiring Kent Nagano, an American conductor steeped in European new music and new staging ideas, as its music director. 
The Los Angeles Philharmonic has cultivated a youthful image with its baby-faced Finnish conductor, Esa-Pekka Salonen, who is also a composer interested in contemporary music. Although box-office response has been underwhelming, it is likely to perk up with the opening this fall of the orchestra's new home, the spectacular new Walt Disney Concert Hall downtown, designed by Frank Gehry.
But none of this institutional activity speaks to a need for the sort of work encountered in 1984 -- like that of Robert Wilson, Ariane Mnouchkine, Pina Bausch and "The Tempest" of Giorgio Strehler -- and later at Mr. Sellars's festivals. 
Presenters of truly experimental work in the Los Angeles area have sprung up because of a lively, interested public, and they have been bolstered by the success of attractions elsewhere that are like those of the Brooklyn Academy; their sheer critical mass in the rest of the country, and periodic outcroppings here, have created a demand all by themselves. There has always been a teeming student population in the area, and more recently the new museum culture and a burgeoning club scene have evolved. One might even argue that the very dominance of the corporate entertainment business here has created its own postmodernist commentary on pop culture that informs so much of the local indigenous art -- a fascination with video and computer games and Japanese anime, for instance, or with Chicano and Asian performance art or with art-rock bands playing on pop-culture themes.
Financial support for the new presenters comes from local individuals and foundations that have underwritten more conventional performance groups and the museums. That support remains, despite the nationwide effects of Sept. 11 and the recession, and it is fostered by a now largely sympathetic critical climate. The only lingering question is whether this upsurge represents a real change or merely another, soon-to-be-lamented blip on the screen. 
The new performance culture in the Los Angeles area has three flagbearers:
* U.C.L.A.'s Performing Arts series, kick-started by the arrival two years ago of an Englishman named David Sefton, who promptly renamed it U.C.L.A. Live, although the old name is still officially on the books. U.C.L.A. Live is now the dominant player on the scene, the King Kong of Southern California performance. Its activities are naturally focused on the University of California at Los Angeles campus in trendy West Los Angeles, but are increasingly spreading to downtown as well.
* The Eclectic Orange Festival, an annual fall series that in 2002 presented a four-week series of mostly cutting-edge work offered by the Philharmonic Society of Orange County in the lavish Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa and in other halls and churches (and even a tent) in Costa Mesa, Irvine, Laguna Beach and Long Beach.
* The still-abuilding Redcat Performance Space and Gallery, a handsomely appointed experimental theater, visual arts display area and bar in the basement of the new Walt Disney Concert Hall. Redcat, which is to open this fall along with the hall, is an offshoot of the determinedly progressive California Institute of the Arts (known as CalArts) in far-away Valencia, at the northwestern end of the San Fernando Valley. Its former president, Robert J. Fitzpatrick, directed the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival, and it has sought a downtown forum ever since. 
Although Mr. Sefton, 40, arrived at U.C.L.A. in the fall of 2000, fresh from presenting all manner of outre innovation at London's South Bank Center, 2002-3 represents the first season he has fully planned. By all accounts -- critical and popular -- it has been a rousing success.
The dense and busy U.C.L.A. Live program -- 83 events in the brochure -- lasts the entire academic year, with a postlude mini-festival called All Tomorrow's Parties in June. Within the overall schedule are various subgroups. The principal one is the International Theater Festival, which ranges from theater at least recognizable as such (the Wooster Group's "To You, the Birdie!" and the Robert Wilson-Tom Waits version of Buchner's "Woyzeck") to explorations into music, dance and unfamiliar performance by less well-known European artists and troupes. These include the reportedly shocking, imagistic theater company Societas Raffaello Sanzio from Italy (The Los Angeles Times said its work was full of "surreal horrors"), France's Compagnie de Hanneton (a circus-theater-dance-mime troupe) and the Netherlands' ZT Hollandia, which presents collages from real life with electronic music accompaniment.
"It took me 18 months to realize that what people here thought of as theater was different from what I thought of as theater," Mr. Sefton said in an interview at an outdoor restaurant at the Long Beach Airport. "Characters shouting at each other can be O.K., but it's very conservative. This festival is about extending the definition of theater from what existed here before." 
Many of his attractions are staples at the Brooklyn Academy and on what might be called the "BAM circuit," organizations (often universities) all over the country that present this style of work. But Mr. Sefton (and Orange County and CalArts, as well) brings his own sensibility to the process of assembling a season. 
In his case, that means British and European acts he encountered while in London, along with world music. There is also a lot of rock (Elvis Costello, Brian Wilson), reflecting the influence of pop culture on artists, including the bulk of the not-yet-announced All Tomorrow's Parties repertory. This last continues a series Mr. Sefton produced in London, mini-festivals curated by artsy popular artists like Mr. Costello, Laurie Anderson, Brian Eno and, for this June in Los Angeles, Matt Groening, creator of "The Simpsons." The London version was called Meltdown. 
All this is presented in a range of facilities including, on campus, Royce Hall, handsomely renovated in the mid-90's and seating 1,800, and the well-equipped Freud Playhouse (built by descendants of Sigmund).
Mr. Sefton works with an overall budget of $9.2 million, and needs 65 percent of that to come from the box office and theater rentals. (Orange County needs a roughly comparable ratio of fund-raising to box-office income.) He said that attendance was "up and down" this fall but that it had solidified with sold-out hits like "Woyzeck." Early on, he was heartened by the response to Romeo Castelluci's implacably progressive Societas Raffaello Sanzio in a piece called "Genesi -- From the Museum of Sleep." "This is really, really difficult work," Mr. Sefton said, "and the audience lapped it up." 
In terms of background and personality, the avuncular Dean Corey, executive director of the Philharmonic Society of Orange County, could not be more different from the spiky-haired Mr. Sefton -- and yet the two men share many tastes.
Mr. Corey, 55, is a former French horn player from Texas who took over the society 10 years ago. Much of the season, he presents mostly standard classical music and ballet for mostly middle-class audiences. But in the fall, he metamorphoses into an avant-gardist. Though his Eclectic Orange Festival contains a few anomalously middle-of-the-road items, it is devoted to Brooklyn Academy-style attractions.
This past fall, Mr. Corey's Eclectic Orange budget was $3.2 million, not counting an additional $1.5 million put up by outside presenters within the festival, like Opera Pacific. (The overall Philharmonic Society budget, including Eclectic Orange, is $5.9 million.) Two-thirds of the $3.2 million was devoted to a Stravinsky spectacular from Theatre Zingaro, the French equestrian troupe that has appeared twice under Brooklyn Academy auspices. The other hotly attended event, also drawing at least a third of its audience from beyond Orange County, was the West Coast premiere of the Argentine composer Osvaldo Golijov's "Passion According to St. Mark."
The rest of the festival included dance (Sean Curran, a Hawaiian company, Ballet Preljocaj), a linked series of Passions (including Arvo Part's "Passio"), world music and a Latin American theme (both classical and folk and including the inevitable Kronos Quartet in a Mexican program). 
Given Orange County's reputation as a nest of intransigent Caucasian conservatives, how to account for Eclectic Orange? "We have different cities, more students, a different ethnic mix now," Mr. Corey said during an interview in his Irvine office, citing burgeoning Chinese, Vietnamese, Latino and Japanese populations. "They'll attend if you do their work." 
Ticket sales for last fall's festival did come in about 25 percent under projections, however, which Mr. Corey attributes to lingering concerns about terrorism, the recession and even the proximity of the nearby Anaheim-San Francisco World Series. He plans some belt-tightening this fall. 
If Orange County is retrenching, CalArts is looking forward optimistically. Steven D. Lavine, 55, the institute's president since 1988, is highly conscious of its connection to the 1984 Olympic festival, which was run by his predecessor, Mr. Fitzpatrick. "My generation still has memories of the festival as the great moment in Los Angeles cultural history," he said in his expansive CalArts office. "There have been people here ever since who have wanted to establish a West Coast branch of BAM." 
CalArts played its part in that effort by trying to sustain the Olympic spirit in the mid-80's, but performances petered out. Mr. Lavine said his sights had now shifted from replicating the Brooklyn Academy to trying to create a space for artistic incubation along the lines of the Kitchen or Dance Theater Workshop in New York. 
One reason for his desire for a downtown presence, Mr. Lavine explained, was that so many students and faculty members live there. Another is a desire to heighten the CalArts image for fund-raising, and a third is to build diversity among the student body.
It is no accident that Redcat is taking shape in the Walt Disney Concert Hall. The Disney family started CalArts, fulfilling a wish of Walt, and has supported it ever since, as well as the Los Angeles Philharmonic's new hall. The $20 million it has taken to build Redcat, all scrupulously separated from CalArts' annual budget and fund-raising, Mr. Lavine said, was jump-started by a $5 million gift from the Disney Corporation and another $5 million from Roy E. Disney, Walt's nephew. Redcat is an acronym for the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater, named for Roy E. Disney's parents. 
To run Redcat, Mr. Lavine recruited Mark C. Murphy, 42, widely known as the artistic director of On the Boards in Seattle, one of the West Coast's most innovative performance spaces. To start with, Mr. Murphy will work with an annual budget of some $3 million, but only one-sixth of that is projected to come from the box office. That is because of the flexible space's small size (a maximum of 270 seats) and ticket prices in the $20 to $30 range, sharply below U.C.L.A. and Orange County, with CalArts students let in for next to nothing.
Mr. Murphy said the programming philosophy for Redcat would involve roughly one-third outside artistic residencies, with the artists developing new work and also appearing on the CalArts campus; one-third local and visiting artists in performance; and one-third CalArts performance projects.
Although the school has active performance programs, Mr. Murphy insisted that its performing presence at Redcat would be by invitation only. A program of major artists in residence will start in the spring of 2004 with the "Peony Pavilion" director Chen Shi-Zheng, followed by the playwright and director Richard Foreman in 2005 and the playwright Suzan-Lori Parks in 2006. 
Given the distances involved -- some 80 miles from CalArts, in the upper reaches of the San Fernando Valley, to Orange County, with downtown on that axis and U.C.L.A. some 25 miles to the south of CalArts -- competition among these three entities seems muted. But it's remarkable that a sense of artistic community exists at all. 
MR. SEFTON and Mr. Corey said they still had regular dealings with Joseph V. Melillo, artistic director of the Brooklyn Academy, but more and more they seek to present their own distinctive work, individually or as part of a larger West Coast style. All of them attend one another's performances and keep in contact.
"I'm embarrassed to say that I used to find it easier to go to New York to see things that would be at Eclectic Orange," Mr. Lavine said. "Now, after Golijov, I realize it's do-able."
All four men think the presence of the others will help his own cause, and build a lasting Southern California community for experimental work. 
"When David announced his program, I said, 'Uh-oh,' " Mr. Murphy conceded, standing amid the bustle of the unfinished Redcat interior. "But then I realized it was an advantage in developing emerging artists and audiences. The more, the merrier."
Mr. Corey, too, wants to create a new Southern California performance culture. "We're not doing this work for an audience that already exists," he said. "I think the climate is here. But we need to create a new audience, too." 
Mr. Sefton thinks that this time, unlike 1984, something permanent has taken root. "Sustainability is the difference," he said. "People are coming to stuff they don't know, and then coming back."

Australia Steps Up Security After Bali

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: SYDNEY 

 BODY:
A FAIRLY homogenous society, great open spaces and relaxed attitudes have given Australia a reputation as a haven from the world's cares. It still is. 
 But the terrorist bombing in Bali in October shook the nation. Nearly 90 Australians died in an attack that many believe was aimed at them, in a place that is a favorite playground not too far from home. 
 Following the attack, the Australian government's security services raided 18 homes in Australia, saying their residents were adherents of radical Islamic groups. One man -- Jack Roche, a British-born Muslim convert believed to be linked to Al Qaeda -- was arrested in Western Australia on charges of planning to blow up Israeli diplomatic buildings in Sydney and Canberra, the nation's capital. 
Also, in an audiotape believed to have been made by Osama bin Laden that was broadcast after the Bali attack, the speaker named Australia as an enemy of Islam. It was the second time Al Qaeda singled out Australia as a devoted ally of the United States that deserved punishment. 
Though Australians generally regard their country as an unspoiled paradise, these events have raised anxiety levels. People are staying home more, and travel agents report cancellations of long-planned overseas trips since the attack. In response, the government has introduced a variety of security measures at airports and increased security at some landmark buildings. 
A passenger arriving at Sydney's international airport will immediately notice a new security measure: after travelers go through the usual procedures at passport control, some are checked again. A second tier of newly placed uniformed immigration officers makes random passport checks at the baggage carousels. 
These new officers were highly visible on a recent visit. As passengers from several overseas flights waited for their baggage, the officers focused on non-Caucasian travelers, inspected their passports again and asked questions about the purpose of their stay in Australia. 
The government has also required tougher baggage screening at all of Australia's 37 major airports. The new machinery for this must be installed by December 2004, although some airport officials have complained that the baggage machinery is too costly. To pay for it, air fares would rise, the officials said. Even smaller airports, like the one at Canberra, have upgraded security, airport officials said. Dogs now patrol the terminal, and stricter rules about dropping passengers in front of the terminal have been introduced. 
Also in the wake of the Bali attack, the government has introduced more visible protection to well-known buildings -- the Parliament in Canberra, the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House in Sydney -- including uniformed patrols with dogs. 
Several managers at Australian hotels and resorts said they were paying extra attention to security, but they echoed Shaun Campbell, the director of marketing for Hyatt hotels in Australia, in pointing out that Australia is not considered a flash point of terrorism and that he was unwilling to turn his hotel into an armed camp. Unlike some resorts in Asia, where armed guards have become de rigueur, the atmosphere here is more relaxed. 
"Americans and Europeans still see Australia as a safer destination," Mr. Campbell said. He added that he had detected little nervousness among guests, in part because those still traveling in Asia are the "more resilient" guests.
So far, the impact of terrorism on travel to Australia has not been extreme. From July 2001 to June 2002, 4.8 million international visitors traveled to Australia, compared with 5.1 million during the same period the previous year -- which includes an increase in arrivals due to the Sydney Olympic Games -- and 4.7 million visitors the year before that. 
But in a report issued in early December, the government trimmed its estimate of arrivals in 2012 by 20 percent to 8.1 million. Among the reasons cited for the lowered forecast: fewer flights to Australia, an uncertain global economy and the continued threat of international terrorism.

HEADLINE: The Baby Ivies 

BYLINE:  By Victoria Goldman; Victoria Goldman is co-author of "The Manhattan Directory to Private Nursery Schools" and "The Manhattan Family Guide to Private and Selective Public Schools" (both SoHo Press).

 BODY:
To enter the 92nd Street Y Nursery School, parent and child pass through a large granite and marble lobby. Beyond the Felix M. Warburg Lounge, beneath an exquisitely stenciled ceiling, they wait in a long line behind a red velvet rope for the special elevator that carries them to the sixth floor. When the shiny brass door opens, an impressive display case filled with ribbon designs and candleholders made by the children greets them. 
 No ordinary handprint art here. Around the corner hangs a 6-by-8-foot American flag of canvas, foam and pasta set in a plexiglass three-dimensional frame reminiscent of a Jasper Johns. 
 "Flags are fascinating to 5-year-olds," explained Lynn Rosen, the teacher. "While the children were working on it, they'd break into song, singing or humming either 'It's a Grand Old Flag' or 'America the Beautiful."' The cutting, painting and gluing took three months. A parent paid $1,800 for the special frame, and a little extra to have it carried up six flights. 
Welcome to one of Manhattan's most exclusive nurseries, founded in 1938 with just three classes. Now there are 10. But to get in one of them without some prior connection is almost impossible -- just ask Jack B. Grubman, the former Citigroup securities analyst who sent an incriminating e-mail message suggesting he swapped a favorable stock rating for help getting his 2-year-old twins into the Y (in the form of a $1 million donation from his boss, Sanford I. Weill). A motive is obvious. New York's top-tier nurseries can be feeder schools to the "right" kindergarten, and then Trinity and Dalton and upward to Harvard, and they offer the "right" social element. 
But while the world might sniff at such admissions shenanigans and five-figure tuitions, educators do not disagree with the parents' priorities. Study after study shows the importance of a good preschool. In the latest, the National Institute for Early Education Research reports that children in high-quality programs make roughly $143,000 more over their lifetime than the control group -- and they're less likely to smoke, too. 
Manhattan's top schools for 2- to 5-year-olds offer some of the finest education a preschooler can get, with on-staff child psychologists, movement and music specialists, artists in residence, custom-tailored programs and computers. Children enjoy individual attention from directors with 20 years' experience and multiple degrees in education and early childhood development. Classes have three teachers for 11 to 20 children. To insure matriculation at a good private kindergarten, most have on-site testing for the ERB, the preschool equivalent of the SAT. 
"Never say nursery, it's early childhood," admonishes Marlene Barron, head of the West Side Montessori School since 1979, a Ph.D. and author of seven books.
Here's what you get at five of Manhattan's most desirable preschools, for up to $15,000 a year (or, for extended days, almost $18,000).

The Episcopal School
Enrollment: 220
Cost: $8,788 (age 2) to $9,812 (age 3 to 5) for five half days
On East 69th Street near Park Avenue, Episcopal was one of the first preschools to join the National Association of Independent Schools -- "that changed the way early childhood education was thought about," said Betty Baxter, who directed the school for 14 years beginning in the early 70's, when bras were burning and a critical mass of moms entered the workplace. Not coincidentally, more youngsters needed a place to go, and playtime began to evolve into education. 
If the icon of preschool before Dr. Baxter was a little old lady in a kilt, now she had a doctorate from Columbia's Teachers College and wore a Chanel suit and pumps. Dr. Baxter hired only professional educators, lured by competitive salaries. "Episcopal was one of the first nursery schools interested in credentials," said a competitor, Lydia Spinelli, director of the Brick Church School, who also has a Columbia doctorate.
Formality permeates. Good manners are stressed. Teachers are addressed with honorifics -- Mr. Jones, Ms. Smith. Children must wait for everyone in the class to sit down before starting snacks. They shake hands, usually with the director, on arrival and departure. 
Episcopal tries to maintain a balance between support and challenge. But to ready children for competitive elementary grades, the curriculum emphasizes the latter, especially prereading and phonics. The school has a director of expressive arts -- a storyteller, who has been with the school 15 years. He writes books and music and asks the children to spin a globe and put their finger on a country, and then he tells them a story about that country. It's all part of a cultural-awareness program that might find little hands helping tie-dye saris or comparing spices from different countries.
High-profile parents join their children, regardless of religious affiliation, at a weekly chapel service that has become an Upper East Side social event. The Episcopal School is where the children of Pia and Christopher Getty, Harvey and Eve Weinstein, Jane and Jann Wenner, Ronald O. Perelman and Patricia Duff, Jerry Della Femina and Judy Licht, and Edgar Jr. and Clarissa Bronfman first learned to socialize like their parents. 
The best nurseries get up to 350 applications for 35 to 60 spots. At Episcopal, applications become available on the Wednesday after Labor Day and are gone in two days; everyone else winds up wait-listed for one. "It's the place where you can be with your own kind, or the kind you want to be with," said Mitchell Moss, a social scientist and director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "Nursery school is the first chance parents have to brand-name their child." 

92nd Street Y Nursery School
Enrollment: 175
Cost: $7,300 (age 2 1/2, two half days) to $14,400 (age 4 and 5, five full days)
To teach her charges about Jackson Pollock, Beryl Roth, who has a double master's in education and fine arts from Columbia University, first explained his techniques, the splattering and dripping -- the kinds of things young children like to do. She then draped the room in plastic and paper. She turned on the jazz that Pollock listened to while painting. The 4-year-olds swayed to the music, throwing and dripping the paint as they flung their arms. The final canvas looked, to the layman's eye, almost indistinguishable from the master's. As their handiwork was pinned up for display one morning in mid-November, they sang "This Land Is Your Land." 
Art and song play prominently at this Upper East Side preschool, which is more relaxed than Episcopal. According to its Statement of Philosophy, the Y "strives to facilitate children's social, emotional, physical and intellectual growth through a curriculum attuned to the individual child's unique pattern of development," with an emphasis on "creative expression through hands-on experiences."
Indeed, the children grow herbs, flowers and vegetables in their own garden. They play "outdoors" rain or shine under a retractable roof. In the Red Room (each class is named for a color), children compose a newsletter, the Red Room Reporter, with book review, letter of the week and joke of the week. In the Rainbow Room, 3- and 4-year-olds learn about the science of balance and weight on a life-size scale they help assemble. Each child sits on one end while classmates put blocks on the other until the scale is balanced. They graph the number of blocks they need for each child, learn math concepts and also how to work cooperatively.
"It's a visual way to introduce fractions as well," Barry Goldberg, a ceramicist, sculptor and singer who has taught at the Y for 20 years, explained to a visitor. He showed off a project on what he called "water displacement" -- how sponges work and how liquid-filled tubes make music.
On this morning, the day the contents of the Grubman e-mail message made headlines, Nancy Schulman, the director, was busy counseling a group of mothers on parenting techniques. (She recommends Wendy Mogel's "Blessing of a Skinned Knee: Using Jewish Teachings to Raise Self-Reliant Children.") With the news media gathered outside the building, Mr. Grubman stood at the Red Room door, watching silently as his daughter was comforted by a teacher: she had gotten a red spot on her pants. 
Since that day, the admissions process at the Y has become legendary: how parents hire help to hit redial the day tour appointments are scheduled (it can take six hours to reach the school by phone), first come first served for 300 spots. No tour, no application.
At some elite schools, like Episcopal and Christ Church Day School on Park Avenue, parents and children meet individually with the director and perhaps a few teachers for an interview. Other schools schedule play-date "interviews." At the Y, roughly five children, parents and teachers interact together for about 45 minutes. Considering toddlers' unpredictability, the process can wreak havoc on parents' already frazzled nerves. 
One parent, an investment banker, took her 20-month-old son on four interviews, including City and Country in Greenwich Village, which also has elementary grades. "The head of the lower school, the head of admissions and several teachers were observing and taking notes on a clipboard," she recalled. "I wondered, 'What are they looking for? What are they writing down while he's playing at the water table?"'
"Of course, you're nervous that your child will have a breakdown," she added. "But every child was sweet and nice, just an angel, and I didn't see how they could distinguish between children."
What they are looking for, directors say, is a 2-year-old who can "separate" -- no excessive leg hanging on parents or caretakers -- and who will not bop other children on the head. 
"Some 2-year-olds show up with a c.v. attached to their application," said Mitten Wainwright, former director of the Park Avenue Christian Day School, a solid nursery school with a long list of graduates placed in good kindergartens. The curriculum vitae might list prenursery classes and participation in the prestigious Madison Play Group at Madison Presbyterian Church. 
Of the 65 places available for 2- and 3-year-olds every year, siblings of Y students and relatives of board members account for most. Ms. Schulman estimates that the chances for the unaffiliated parent are 10 to 1 at her school. Some think the odds longer. 
Members of the Lauder, Tisch and Crown families are Y alumni. Other Y parents have included Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates, Michel J. Fox and Tracy Pollan, Maury Povich and Connie Chung, Woody Allen and Soon-Yi, and Wendy Wasserstein, Lisa Birnbach and Matthew Bronfman. Katie Couric sent her children to the Y and Brick Church.
While there are no guarantees, applications with a history of donations attached receive more attention, several parents note. The annual benefit alone raises $200,000; one year, tickets to the Oscars were auctioned off. At last year's, at Pier 60, a group of Y parents named the Y Nots -- an investment banker, psychiatrist, lawyer and neurosurgeon -- sang. 
"The neurosurgeon was the most nervous," Ms. Schulman said, chuckling.

The Brick Church School
Enrollment: 130
Cost: $10,200 (age 3 to 5, five half days) to $13,200 (age 4 and 5, four full days, one half day)
Brick students adhere to a posted daily schedule of activities that seldom varies. But that orderliness, balanced with a sensitivity to a child's development, helps create a warm and secure environment, according to Dr. Spinelli, the director of 27 years. 
"In every area," she said, "the teachers assess where the children are cognitively and try to raise them to the next level by using a combination of teaching skills, games and concrete objects, and then integrating them into project work." 
The program stresses age-appropriate activities in math (through block building), social studies (community awareness projects) and language arts and literacy (phonics and reading aloud). 
Though the school is in the Silk Stocking District of the Upper East Side, diversity is the new watchword. While there is no quota for minorities (currently 22 percent of students), there is for financial aid. "To ensure economic diversity," Dr. Spinelli said, 10 percent get it. The church has set aside $130,000 and forged a relationship with Early Steps, a nonprofit program that places disadvantaged children in private schools. 
One result: fewer opportunities for other applicants to get a signature Brick backpack. 
Preferential treatment for admissions is given to siblings and church members (the requirement was just increased to two years' membership, from one) for the 53 places that are available each year for 3-year-olds. Original parents might have been Calvinist, but no longer. Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, Jane Pauley and Garry Trudeau and "a branch of the Rockefeller family" have all sent children to Brick. But mostly, "it's Wall Street, Wall Street, Wall Street," one parent said. 
Accordingly, it took just five months to raise $6 million for a recent renovation. Now Brick has fiber-optic cable, central air-conditioning and new millwork.
"They are never heavy-handed about fund-raising," one parent said. "You can go every Sunday, send your kids to Sunday school, get married there and buried there and never give a thing." But there's a giving pyramid, a chart that shows how much people donate, but don't expect a board seat or something named for you. There's only one name noticeable: Watson Hall -- for Thomas Watson Sr., I.B.M.'s founder -- a room in the basement where parishioners have coffee after Sunday services.

The Washington Market School
Enrollment: 250 children
Cost: $4,400 (age 1 1/2, two half days) to $15,800 (age 2 1/2 to 5 1/2, five extended days)
The converted loft in TriBeCa that is Washington Market looks like "Romper Room" at first glance, with children jumping and running in circles. But there's a healthy hum and serious learning going on. 
Washington Market borrows a few elements of Montessori -- mixed-age groupings, binomial and trinomial cubes for number relationships, and spindle boxes for counting -- but the curriculum is ultra-progressive. The school aims to infuse a love of learning, self-confidence, individuality and creativity in what administrators call a nonracist, nonsexist, nonelitist and nonjudgmental way.
"There's no shame in squiggles of development," said Ronnie Moskowitz, who has directed the school since its inception 27 years ago.
Partial walls, open space and flexible hours hark back to those founding days, when "we all sat on the floor and brainstormed" about what the school should be, recalled Ms. Moskowitz, who helped found the school with neighborhood families. "We wanted no doors, so we could cross-pollinate ideas."
In fact, children's interests often influence the program. One class wanted to learn to play chess, so a chess teacher was hired. A medieval feast tied into the chess program, and each child made a castle. A group of older children "wanted to get off their cots" during rest time. Ms. Moskowitz asked them what they wanted to do. "They said they wanted to learn about dinosaurs," she said. "And since I love to teach, we went back to before the dinosaurs. I taught them everything about evolution, the Big Bang theory, then we went through all the phyla. This was not for creationists."
Ms. Moskowitz fondly remembers the parents of her first class. "It wasn't the old-boy network. It was the old-hippie network." But no longer, as TriBeCa has welcomed Miramax executives, investment bankers, the new gallery crowd and celebrities. Julian Schnabel, Nicole Miller and Spike Lee sent children here. 
"It's a new generation of parents," she said. "It's the $2 million lofts. We were used to having aging hippies here and artists and pioneers. They were willing to live without much, no shoe stores or supermarkets. Now, parents walking in are asking about reading and worrying about testing. They're parents who're afraid of being judged."
In the application process, Washington Market interviews only parents because the school "appreciates all children," Ms. Moskowitz said. Although admissions may seem less intense, don't be fooled. The ratio of applicants to openings is about 6 to 1 -- a rebound to the days before Sept. 11. Ms. Moskowitz is planning a lottery for the popular morning sessions (naps interfere with afternoons, which is why those sessions are less expensive at most schools).
This year, Washington Market enrolled nine children whose tuition was partly financed by the city's Agency for Child Development, which paid $6,100 for each child. The school's scholarship fund made up the $32,000 difference. Lorraine Bracco, whose children attended the school, recently donated a "Sopranos" coffee table book autographed by the entire cast of the television series to raise money for the fund.

West Side Montessori School
Enrollment: 210
Cost: $9,940 (age 3 to 5, 
five half days) to $17,884 (age 3 to 5, five extended days)
Marlene Barron refers to her school's philosophy as urban American Montessori. While the program uses traditional Montessori principles -individualized projects, mixed-age groupings, practical tasks like sweeping the floor to teach focus and social responsibility -- non-Montessori materials like blocks, Legos and a dress-up corner suggest flexibility with the concept. 
The school's motto, "Where to begin," reflects its goal: to develop each child's abilities in reading, math, science, the arts and, most important, problem-solving strategies. In one strategy, a teacher pretends not to remember something a child has told him -- say, who he likes to sit next to. This fosters an exchange between child and teacher, and the child uses writing with invented spelling and drawings to explain himself. 
Children also master basic addition and subtraction, counting and simple squaring. "Our kids are adding and subtracting in the thousands," Dr. Barron said. She takes offense at the title nursery director. "We are early childhood heads of school," she insisted. She's every bit the part, wearing a navy blue suit, tapping on the iMac on her desk. 
As you walk through her school, you see children writing and illustrating a book on the solar system; in another room, children do tracings of their body and label the drawing with internal organs and muscular and skeletal systems. Children in one room study real spider webs, in another the artist Paul Klee. Meanwhile, a former chef from nearby Carmine's Italian restaurant whips up hot lunch -- her specialties: penne with meat sauce, grilled salmon, tacos, chicken with rice -- in the basement kitchen. 
Since the school admits 98 children a year, acceptance is not as long a shot as at comparable schools, but it's still 4 to 1. 
When Dr. Barron describes West Side Montessori as a "multi-multi-school," which she often does, she means enrollment reflects the social diversity and multiethnicity of the Upper West Side. Thirty poor children -- subsidized by the school and the Agency for Child Development -- attend alongside offspring of the stars. Diane Wiest, as well as Kyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon, have sent children here. Cheryl Jaeger, a former principal dancer for the American Ballet Theater, once headed the parents association.
"We're a school that involves parents, caregivers, family -- everyone has to work," Dr. Barron said. And they do. In the "parents room," sipping coffee from a special Filterfresh machine that the school leases for up to $500 a month, parents plan the annual auction. 
"The auction is organized up the kazoo," Dr. Barron said. 
At a recent one, a class project went for $7,500, and $3,400 took a set of single sheets decorated with children's handprints.

 BODY:
FOR a college founded in 1614, the University of Groningen in the northern Netherlands is surprisingly open to change. This fall, it divided its five-year undergraduate program into separate bachelor's and master's degrees. It will soon adopt a new European credits system. And its recruiters are busy wooing young Asians and Eastern Europeans to do their postgraduate studies -- in English, naturally -- in this friendly medieval city.
 But what is happening in Groningen is merely a harbinger of a revolution that is beginning to shake up institutions of higher learning across Europe, a revolution that includes a clarion call to compete with the United States for a larger share of the increasingly globalized education market. 
 Groningen and other Dutch universities are among the first to put in place an initiative, backed by a federation of European governments, to harmonize curriculums and requirements. The objective is to make it easier for students to transfer among universities and find jobs across Europe. In other words, a European degree should serve as a kind of academic passport that warrants the holder's skills and knowledge. Once recognized abroad, it should increase the appeal of European universities to foreign students. 
"Ultimately, educational reform is an instrument for creating a European identity, but also for making Europe more competitive," says Frans Zwarts, the new rector of the University of Groningen, which has long had a strong international profile; almost half its 775 Ph.D. candidates come from overseas.
"Traditionally," he says, "European educational systems focused on accessibility. Now they are realizing that they have to compete for top talent on a global level."
That said, Europe has been slow to recognize that its integration is being hampered by the archaic structures of its universities, which are, in the main, government owned. For example, while Europeans are free to study and work in other countries, degrees received in one country are not automatically recognized in another. Even top universities, like Oxford in England or the Sorbonne in Paris, are sometimes uncertain how to evaluate one another's diplomas.
Then there is the question of access. Because governments prefer to see young people studying rather than out of work, it is generally easy to gain admission to universities (beyond the most elite institutions like the grandes ecoles, the French equivalent of the Ivy League). The results are high dropout rates and a tendency to take far longer to complete a degree than the programmed four to five years.
A confusing variety of teaching methods, curriculums and qualifications on the Continent have led many non-Europeans to prefer the British-American system. In 2000, 1.6 million students enrolled outside their own countries -- 28 percent in the United States and 14 percent in Britain compared with 12 percent for Germany, 8 percent for France and 2 percent for Italy.
"Europe is slowly understanding that having the oldest universities doesn't necessarily mean having the most attractive ones," says Bernd W* chter, director of the Academic Cooperation Association in Brussels, which represents 20 European organizations supporting internationalization of higher education.
While the need for change was self-evident, no one expected a revolution in 1999 when education ministers from 29 European countries met in Bologna, Italy. They concluded that the time had come to increase the employability and mobility of their students and to become more competitive on the international market. A European Higher Education Area would be created, they decided, analogous to the region's trade and euro zones.
A detailed plan gave credibility to their declaration: by 2010, Europe would adopt a common framework of degrees, with clearly defined undergraduate and postgraduate levels, apply a Europewide credits system, develop quality controls and eliminate obstacles to students and teachers changing schools. Overnight, the Bologna Process was born.
Since then, 35 European countries have backed the initiative. 
"There's a general consensus that things need to change," says David Crosier, project manager at the European University Association in Brussels, which represents institutions in 32 countries. "Not many universities oppose the Bologna Process. But they want to feel responsible for their own evolution, not to have things imposed on them."
While they have concerns -- some German professors have objected to the threat to their autonomy, for example -- most universities recognize that the Bologna Process is unstoppable and are participating in discussions. Universities in Eastern Europe have embraced the initiative as a map to modernization. France sees it as a way to attract more non-European students. Italy hopes to save money because students spend fewer years enrolled. Britain says it has already put in place much of what is being discussed.
Indeed, in some ways, the Bologna Process represents a victory of the British model. Across the Continent, the current five years of undergraduate study will be divided into three-year bachelor's and two-year master's programs, a two-tier system that has long existed in Britain. Similarly, British universities have taken the lead in linking education to employability, something encouraged by the Bologna Process.
But for the changes to become reality, more than persuasion will be necessary. One crucial step involves defining what knowledge and skills are necessary if degrees from universities with different academic cultures are to be compared. In Europe, 105 universities have joined in what is being called the Tuning Project, coordinated by the University of Groningen and the University of Deusto, a Jesuit college in Bilbao with Spain's oldest business school.
Core curriculums are being prepared in seven disciplines: business, chemistry, education sciences, geology, history, math and physics. Eventually all subjects will be covered. Groningen's coordinator, Robert Wagenaar, stresses that the purpose is not to unify curriculums but to establish generic competences that students are expected to master, like abilities to research, analyze and communicate, and to define what students are expected to know.
The curriculums will be recognized through a system of credits that will enable students to transfer among universities. But credits are also new to Europe, and this has raised questions about how they should be allocated and whether it is fair to equate those given by top universities and those from mediocre ones. A new body, the European Network for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, is intended to ensure that standards are applied.
The hope is that employers will have a way to measure the qualifications of job seekers from different countries. But employers must also learn to accept the new three-year bachelor's degrees. "Most Dutch universities do not yet consider a bachelor's to be an independent degree," Mr. Zwarts, Groningen's rector, says. "This will change. In 10 years' time, a bachelor's degree will be recognized as a full qualification."
But if graduates are to have the kinds of skill that make them more attractive to employers, Mr. Wagenaar says that universities may have to limit the power of professors to define their courses. Such a move represents a fundamental change in European academics, where professors have traditionally enjoyed unchallenged authority. "The focus will switch from the wishes of teachers to the needs of students," he says.
IT is too early to see how all this will play out, but the Bologna Process has raised a number of questions. Proud of their independence and reputations for excellence, some top-ranking universities fear that core curriculum will drive away brilliant teachers. Academics also point to diversity as a strength of European higher education.
Eric Froment, the former rector of the University of Lyon-2 in France and now president of the European University Association, plays down some of the fears, saying that curriculums will not be standardized. "There will still be a hierarchy of universities, but even elite students will benefit from more mobility," he says. "If you want mobility, you need quality assurance, but there's no reason for curriculums to be identical."
There is also reticence over what some see as a slide toward commercialism, particularly if higher education is included in negotiations for a new General Agreement on Trade in Services, the pact that seeks to liberalize trade in services, like architecture and real-estate brokerage. "We are against seeing education as a competition," says Alex Bols, secretary general of the National Union of Students of Europe, referring to the growing number of American universities with campuses in Europe. "Education is not a tradable service, but a public good."
Certainly, the notion of linking education to the needs of business is novel in Continental Europe. "For a number of my German colleagues in the humanities and social sciences, it's the game of academic ivory tower versus sellout to industry and capitalism," says Jurgen Kohler, an economics professor who anticipated many of the proposals when he was rector of the University of Greifswald in northern Germany from 1994 to 2000. "It has been difficult to convince them that employability and academic quality are not contradictory." 
Even the planned introduction of credits is stirring suspicion. Percy Lehning, former dean of the faculty of social sciences at Erasmus University of Rotterdam, says that he will continue to give greater weight to an institution's reputation than to whether a student has compiled the approved number of credits. "I want to know what a student has learned, not just his points," he says. "If I have a slot in a master's program, I'll give it to someone from the London School of Economics because I trust the L.S.E."
The credibility of European degrees is nonetheless crucial to attracting non-European students. "A student who is shopping around the world for an education needs to know the quality of this education," Mr. Wagenaar says. "It's easier to find out in the United States and Britain. Europe needs to be able to offer foreign students a guarantee of quality."
Students will in turn need to understand what they are being taught. And for that reason, a growing number of European universities are teaching in English, the accepted global lingua franca. English-language master's and Ph.D. courses are already the norm in Nordic countries. Even universities in France, Germany, Italy and Spain are introducing courses in English, although some are resisting.
"To my knowledge there are no plans to introduce English at our university," says Anne-Marie Crettiez, head of the International Relations and Foreign Students Department at the Sorbonne. "It's just not in the school's tradition." 
At Groningen, the teaching language for graduate work is English. With a student body of 19,000, Groningen has 1,250 foreign students, including 115 from China, 60 from Indonesia and smaller numbers from Eastern Europe, Latin America and elsewhere in Asia. 
"Our purpose is not to earn money from foreign students," insists Madeleine C. Gardeur, who heads the university's 19-member international relations staff. "The main reason we recruit is to have good students in key areas. Groningen is strong in sciences but we don't get enough Dutch students."
For Koos Mars, research manager of the university's Material Science Center, the answer has been to seek out Russian and Romanian science students who have excellent theoretical training but little access to modern equipment. "A good master's program will attract students who then stay on to do a Ph.D.," Mr. Mars says. "There's fierce competition for these brains from Western Europe and the United States."
Denis Markov, who studied in the prestigious Moscow Academy of Physics and Technology before embarking on a four-year physics Ph.D. program in Groningen, received offers from the United States but chose Groningen because it was advanced in his specialty of optical studies.
But the principal source of foreign students, for European and American universities, is China. Competition for its top students is intense. To improve ties with Chinese institutions, Ms. Gardeur recently hired Xuefei Cao, a young Chinese woman who received a master's degree in economics at Groningen and is now commuting between China and the Netherlands. 
"American universities give two-thirds of the scholarships, but Europe is becoming better known," Ms. Cao says. "One reason is that European companies are investing more in China and students can find jobs in these companies if they have studied in Europe. In the past, because of the English language, they always went to the United States, Britain and Australia. But I tell them, 'Don't worry, everyone speaks English in Holland."'
Certainly, the Bologna Process will make Europe more appealing to foreign students. But the measure of success will be its impact on Europe, which has recognized the high cost of maintaining an outdated higher education structure. It has also set itself a monumental task: to ask universities to turn their backs on tradition in the name of European integration.
"What is remarkable," Mr. Kohler says, "is how far we have gone in only three years."

HEADLINE: How to Win a Rhodes 

BYLINE:  By Michael Winerip; Michael Winerip is education columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
When Keri Steffes, a senior with a 4.0 average at the University of Arkansas's honors college, is asked exactly when she began the application process for a Rhodes Scholarship, she says: "Freshman year really, that's when they start talking to you about it. They're like, 'You can be a Rhodes, you can be a Marshall Scholar' -- and you've been on campus two months!" 
 Freshmen are warned that for the Rhodes, they will need eight recommendations and if they wait until senior year, they're dead. "They told us we need to make sure we get to know a lot of professors personally, and to start early," Ms. Steffes says. Freshmen learn that to win one of these postgraduate fellowships, experience abroad is crucial, and so they hit the road early and often. In the last five years, the number from the University of Arkansas studying outside the country has doubled, to 16 percent of all students. Ms. Steffes, of Siloam Springs, Ark., has traveled extensively in Jordan, worked at an orphanage in Honduras and spent her junior year at Cambridge University. 
 By the time they return for senior year, the fellowship push is at full throttle. The fall 2002 semester began with a two-day Marshall/ Rhodes/Gates/Truman Retreat at the Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs, Ark. Candidates listened to lectures on the European Union and bioterrorism and attended workshops on how to write a fellowship essay and how to sit at an interview (hands folded on the table in front of you).
"Going for the Rhodes is way more work than I anticipated," a weary senior, Jeff Sparks, said one day in mid-November, before dragging himself to yet another Rhodes practice interview with faculty members. "I think this is my 10th mock interview. But you hope all the preparation can give you peace of mind. I don't want to walk away and say, 'There was one thing I could have done to prepare and didn't' and regret it."
At 100 years old, the Rhodes is the granddaddy of all fellowships, both the most prestigious and the most arduous. To become one of the lucky 32 scholars selected nationwide each December, candidates must be nominated by their university, approved by their state Rhodes committee, pass muster at a cocktail party, interview on the state level and, finally, survive a second cocktail party and interview on the regional level. By late November, 981 had learned that they made it to the 50 state competitions. In sparsely populated Arkansas, maybe one applicant wins a Rhodes. Some years, none do. As Mr. Sparks said, "It begins with a select group and things happen and it's almost last man standing." 
To ready themselves, the four University of Arkansas candidates for the 2003 Rhodes -- Mr. Sparks, Ms. Steffes, Eric Jackson and Rachel Driver -- met for three hours every Sunday afternoon during the fall semester with their fellowship adviser, Suzanne McCray. "It's like taking a course on the Rhodes," Mr. Sparks said. Dr. McCray sent them daily e-mail messages with articles to read from The Economist, The New Yorker, Foreign Affairs, The New York Times and the Society for Medical Anthropology, as well as books, poems and the odd tidbit about Cecil Rhodes. She assembled faculty committees to grill them in mock interviews in numerous campus settings. ("We don't want them getting too comfortable in one place," Dr. McCray says.) She even insisted they do a mock interview sitting on a couch. ("Ben Hood, one of our Marshall winners, had an interview on a couch," Dr. McCray explains.) She had them rewrite their essays. ("I did 25 drafts," Mr. Jackson says.) She gave them long lists of questions she had culled from candidates at past interviews. ("You have one minute to tell the prime minister of India how to end religious violence. What do you say?")
And she scheduled a mock cocktail party at Gaylord's in Fayetteville to simulate the Rhodes cocktail parties. ("Megan Ceronsky, our 2001 Marshall winner, got killed at her Rhodes cocktail party," Dr. McCray says. "After that we decided we would help our kids learn how to handle themselves in tough social situations.")
In short, Dr. McCray strained to give them every edge in their quest to study free at Oxford for the next two to three years.
And so, it is not surprising that they all saw yet another opportunity to get some priceless insight into the process when, one day last fall, the most famous Rhodes of all, former President Bill Clinton, happened to be on campus for a public appearance. The four were hoping for a few words of wisdom from Mr. Clinton, hoping he would suggest some little-known publication they had not thought to read, that he might clue them in on some secret question that Dr. McCray had not prepped them for.
Though the crowds for Mr. Clinton's visit were large, the four Rhodes candidates were determined, and they elbowed and squeezed to the front of the room, until only one obstacle remained. "There was a man holding a baby in front of us," Mr. Jackson recalled. Mr. Sparks, the son of a wholesale food salesman in Fort Smith, Ark., is probably the shyest of the four candidates ("I've been trying to learn to talk about myself more"). But as Cecil Rhodes himself knew from years in the African bush, true leadership emerges under times of duress. "I pushed my way around the guy with the baby," Mr. Sparks said. "The others followed. I didn't knock the baby over or anything. I kind of felt bad but. ..." A lot was at stake. "We explained who we were, and asked if he had any advice," Mr. Jackson recalled. "President Clinton said, 'Just read Time and Newsweek and get plenty of sleep the night before."'
A LOT has changed since Mr. Clinton won his Rhodes in 1968. While the Ivy Leagues, elite private colleges and military academies have long dominated, over the last five years aggressive state universities have begun to make some inroads, and it is people like Dr. McCray and her full-court press who are responsible.
In 1997, Dr. McCray attended a conference on the Truman, a fellowship for students interested in public service. "That's when I realized there was all this insider information we didn't know," she says. "Truman has a Question 15, 'Tell us something about your personal background.' I didn't understand that was so important. On the other hand, there's a policy statement and it's not critical and not explored at the interview. We were wasting precious time on that one."
That prompted Dr. McCray to organize a national fellowship conference in 1999 called "Breaking the Code," which a year later led to the formation of the National Association of Fellowships Advisers. About 200 colleges now belong, and Dr. McCray is the incoming president. "It's about democratization and access," she says. 
The upstart organization got a break early on, in December 2000, when for the first time since 1930 Harvard did not win a single Rhodes. And Yale did not win a Marshall, which also provides for study in Britain. (At the time, a Yale Daily News reporter asked Yale's fellowship director, Catherine Hutchison, what went wrong. "We are puzzled," she replied, but then made sure to add: "Harvard must be puzzled too because they got no Rhodes.") That year of puzzlement, the University of Arkansas won a Rhodes and Marshall, while eight other state universities won a Rhodes, including the first for the University of Illinois at Chicago. "State universities everywhere said 'Ha!"' recalls Dr. McCray, who was in the forefront of those ha-ha-ing. "Of course, next year Harvard had five."
But if spreading fellowships around is a positive, there is an unfortunate side. As state universities and smaller, less selective colleges grow more aggressive, the elite colleges have responded in kind, with the result being that the whole process is more high-pressured and cut-throat for everyone. New York University recently hired its first fellowship specialist, from the Fulbright program. "It will help us ratchet up our fellowship program a bit," the associate dean, Richard Kalb, says.
Dr. McCray notes that Yale did not join the national fellowships group at first. "But after they didn't win a Marshall, they joined," she says.
For some universities, winning a Rhodes is now part of the whole U.S. News & World Report rank-us-high-to-the-sky syndrome. In 2000, the president of Clemson, James F. Barker, announced a goal of winning two Rhodes Scholarships in the next decade as part of a push to be one of the top 20 public universities in the nation. It is not hard to imagine the pressure this put on his fellowship office. 
"I'm on pins and needles," Stephen Wainscott, Clemson's director, said in mid-November as he waited to see if Katie Brock, a double major in biochemistry and fine arts, had been chosen by South Carolina's state committee to compete for a Rhodes. "I'm assuming Katie has an e-mail waiting when she gets back to campus. We're getting closer and closer each year. I have a good feeling about this year. I'd bet a week's salary."
Indeed, Harvard may be one of the last places to at least sound nonchalant about the Rhodes. Of course, having such an extraordinary student body that has captured 304 Rhodes Scholarships -- 100 more than second-place Yale -- might have something to do with it. "I don't mean to sound snooty," says Paul Bohlmann, fellowship director at Harvard, "but in a lot of schools it's a big deal if they get one selected for a Rhodes interview." Harvard had 30 selected to compete in November, from 18 states. Over the past 35 years, Mr. Bohlmann says, Harvard has averaged 5.3 Rhodes winners a year, with a single year record of 10. In contrast, the University of Arkansas has had 10 winners in 100 years. "If we have five Rhodes Scholars, it's a footnote here," Mr. Bohlmann says, "whereas if Oberlin has its first in 25 years, it's front page."
"Nominating for the Rhodes seems to come more or less naturally here," says Mr. Bohlmann, although that isn't exactly true. It's just the machinery has been in place longer. Harvard has a fulltime fellowship staff of three, and each of the 13 residence houses has one or two graduate students coaching candidates through the process. (At Arkansas, Dr. McCray is one of two fellowship advisers.) Harvard officials may seem blase about it, but they prep too. Anna Weiss, a senior who was a professional ballet dancer before attending college, felt "mildly uncomfortable" about rehearsing for the Rhodes, but she still joined six other candidates from Harvard at a mock cocktail party at Pforzheimer House the Sunday night before Thanksgiving. During a post-mock-cocktail analysis, Rick Bell, a fellowship adviser, told the students: "Don't fiddle with your wine glass, don't shift your weight. If someone backs away from you, don't follow them -- you're probably too close."
Among hopefuls, Michelle Kuo -- a Harvard senior who has studied women's issues in Kenya and China and spends 30 hours a week running a homeless shelter -- was that rare individual to snub the mock cocktail circuit. "I just couldn't do it," she says. "It felt too phony."
Mr. Bohlmann is aware that Harvard's numbers could decline if recent trends hold. Harvard's Rhodes average has dropped almost in half during the last five years, to 2.8 per year. "If Harvard gets two or three instead of four or five, we can live with that," he says, "as long as the winners are deserving." Asked why Harvard has not joined the national fellowships group, Mr. Bohlmann says, "You know, we just haven't got around to it."
AS Miles F. Shore and Robert I. Rotberg point out in their 1988 book, "The Founder: Cecil Rhodes and the Pursuit of Power," Rhodes the man was every bit as odd and eccentric as Rhodes the fellowship. He was a rabid colonialist. (The English, he said, "are the finest race in the world," and "the more of the world we inhabit, the better it is for the human race.") And he did much harm. He helped establish apartheid in South Africa and made his wealth by cornering the gold and diamond markets there. On the other hand, he was personally generous and a big believer in education. His scholarship to his alma mater, Oxford University, was not to be for bookworms (no "Latin and Greek swots") but instead for, well, young men like Rhodes -- outgoing fellows of action. The original formula counted academics four-tenths, athletics two-tenths, character two-tenths and manhood two-tenths.
Over time, the formula has been modified (women became eligible in 1977) and today, athletics is interpreted to mean personal vigor. (Ms. Driver of Arkansas is an extreme Frisbee player). Truth is, it takes lots of vigor to survive Rhodes crunch week, the week after Thanksgiving. On Tuesday evening, Dec. 3, all 50 state Rhodes committees -- a mix of academics and professionals, some of whom have been Rhodes Scholars themselves -- hold cocktail parties. On Dec. 4, each committee conducts a daylong series of interviews and, after deliberating, announces the first-round winners on the spot -- "just like Miss America," as Dr. McCray says. The state winners proceed to cocktail parties on Dec. 6 thrown by each of the eight regional committees, go through another full day of interviews on Dec. 7, and then -- Miss America all over again.
Because it's all done behind closed doors, rumors were rampant as the four University of Arkansas students prepared to head to Little Rock for the state competition. "What I heard," said Mr. Jackson, a pre-med who does triathlons, "is they take all the kids, line us up like a firing squad and tell you in front of everybody whether you made it. You wonder if the whole process isn't meant to mortify you, to see how you hold up."
They made the three-hour drive in a car Mr. Sparks borrowed from his parents. Dr. McCray had e-mailed "the ladies" a fashion advisory -- a dress for the cocktail party, pantsuit for the interview. (As Dr. McCray told them, Megan Ceronsky, Arkansas's 2001 Marshall winner, had worn a pantsuit to her interview, and "it worked out great.") She had reminded them to make eye contact with committee members. (Anna Terry, Arkansas's 2001 Rhodes winner, had prepared by setting up a room full of empty chairs and then talking to each chair.) Dr. McCray also told them that it was O.K. to drink at the cocktail party. (The legendary Ms. Terry had a glass of wine at both her parties.) Among the four, the word was, "Go for the merlot."
Dr. McCray had predicted that committee members would seek them out, but at the real cocktail party, in the Cherokee Room of the Capitol Hotel, the seven committee members held back, and as Mr. Jackson said later, "We realized pretty quick we had to go out and work that room." Ms. Steffes thought it was weird how much these strangers knew about her. They would say, "Oh, Keri, I've been fascinated by your work with orphans in Honduras." There were 10 competitors and Mr. Sparks found one particularly annoying: "He seemed to take things I said and try to sway the conversation toward him. He kept making light of what I was saying."
At evening's end, a sheet was passed out with their assigned interview times for the next day. "They said they'd generated a random list from a computer program," Ms. Steffes recalled. She was first, a bad omen. "Dr. McCray says the danger of going first is, by the time they get to the end of the interviews, they forget you."
Normally, Mr. Jackson sleeps like the dead, but not that night. "I had two awful dreams," he said. "I woke at 2 and 4. You think it's the day after and you're living your life after you've slept through the Rhodes."
Ms. Steffes, an international relations major, was asked a lot of questions about the United Nations, about statistics and the Six Day War and didn't feel like she did her best. Mr. Sparks, a physics whiz, was asked if technology always meant progress, and he talked about the dangers of atomic weapons. "That might not have been the best answer with a military person on the committee," he said. He also said, "They asked Trivial Pursuit questions I didn't know, like the number of the U.N. resolution for the Six Day War."
Most of Mr. Jackson's questions were about medicine, his major, which worked out well for him. While they waited for the committee to finish deliberating, they discovered they had all answered one question the same, about their biggest weakness. They had all confessed they were perfectionist. "You can't say something too bad," Mr. Sparks said. "You don't want to give away too much." 
At 3:15 they were called back to the Cherokee Room and lined up against the back wall. 
"They made a speech about how we were all winners," Ms. Steffes said. "I'm thinking, please, just tell us. They gave us some statistic that people who were almost Rhodes Scholars are more successful than ones who get it. I'm not sure I buy it."
Two state winners were announced in alphabetical order. First was John Henderson, a senior at Emory from Little Rock. 
"I heard my name," Mr. Jackson said. "I'm not a religious person but I said, 'My God.' It's very vindicating. Basically you spent your entire undergrad career pruning yourself for this." He looked at his three classmates. "They were all smiling for me." 
"Definitely disappointing," Ms. Steffes said. "I mean, it takes a lot of work, all these applications, hours and hours. I'm excited for Eric. It's definitely disappointing."
"We could resent Eric," Mr. Sparks said. "But we definitely would not do that."
On the drive back, Ms. Steffes and Ms. Driver were quiet, doing homework until it got dark. Mr. Jackson used a cellphone to make travel arrangements for the finals in Atlanta.
That night, Ms. Steffes was up past midnight. She had a final in Spanish, a presentation on the banana trade wars of 1996 and a paper due. "I'm exhausted," she said. "Of course, none of it would seem like a lot if I were going to Atlanta."
THE night before her state Rhodes interview, Michelle Kuo was working past midnight at the Cambridge homeless shelter she runs with other Harvard students. Before leaving, she said goodbye to several residents, who were clearly fond of her. "When you're homeless, you get grouped a certain way," a shelter resident, Paul Phaneuf, said. "Michelle always reminds me I'm smart."
She is from Kalamazoo and had opted to compete in Michigan. (Candidates have a choice between the state where they attend school and their home state and usually pick the one they feel will give them a better chance.) The next morning, her parents, immigrants from Taiwan, picked her up at the airport and drove to the University of Michigan, where the cocktail party was to be held. "I wasn't nervous but my parents were making me nervous," Ms. Kuo said. "My mother was trying to make me wear makeup. She kept putting on a lot and I kept wiping it off."
"I had a vision people would be aggressive and obnoxious and tooting their own horn," she said. "But the cocktail party was only nice people talking about very innocuous things." To set the order of interviews the next day, they picked numbers from an envelope, and Ms. Kuo drew No. 9. "I could sleep in," she said. "I was glad I didn't get first; they forget the people at the beginning."
They asked her a lot about the homeless shelter. She knew she was doing well, because several times she made them laugh. They questioned why she felt women's studies was relevant, and Ms. Kuo, who has worked for a legal rights group in Kenya and a domestic violence group in China, said: "You sound like my parents. They want me to go to med school."
After the deliberations, the committee chairman gave a speech about how they were all winners, then read the two actual winners in alphabetical order. "When I heard my name I was sort of shocked and relieved," Ms. Kuo said. "My parents took off two days of work to drive me around. I was glad I didn't waste their time."
Anna Weiss, the ballet dancer who has twice studied in Russia, also made the finals, from Massachusetts. Of the 30 Harvard students who had state interviews, 11 were finalists.
KATIE BROCK, of Irmo, S.C., Clemson's top hope for a Rhodes and a shot at the U.S. News pantheon of top-20 public universities, hated the entire process. "The cocktail party unnerved me," she said. "I'm not a schmoozer kind of kid. Honestly, we're in this huge room, but we're all crowded into this little area. And people you've never met are saying, 'Hi, Katie, how was your trip to Africa?"' She did not feel her interview the next morning went well, but then she had to sit with the committee and other candidates and make small talk over lunch. "Everyone's pretending to be happy," she said, "and you're wondering what they really think of you." 
During deliberations, the 10 hopefuls waited in a suite. "I got so tired of all these people trying to impress each other," Ms. Brock said. "Two of them were called back for one-question interviews. Bizarre."
"At 5:30 they called us in. They gave this speech that we were all winners. I'm like, just tell us, I want to go home." 
Asked if she was upset, she said, "No. I'm a Christian. I'm at peace. God's in control."
THE final round for the Southeast region was in Atlanta, on the 42nd floor at Alston & Bird, the downtown law firm of a committee member. "The most opulent place I've ever been," Mr. Jackson said, "aside from the Louvre." At the cocktail party, they picked numbers from a bowl, and he pulled nine, "a good sign." 
But the interview played like an anxiety dream. "I just couldn't get close up enough to the topics I needed to be talking about," he said. "I tried, but it seemed we spent the whole time on random current events." The conference room had floor-to-ceiling windows, and he kept noticing a TV news helicopter flying back and forth outside.
The committee deliberated three hours. "We were pretty tense waiting," Mr. Jackson said. Once again they were all winners, although the four actual winners were named alphabetically: Adam Cureton, University of Georgia; Tyler Fisher, University of Central Florida; John Henderson, Emory. When Mr. Jackson's alphabetical moment arrived, instead the winner was Devi Shridhar, an 18-year-old University of Miami senior who speaks five languages, is a ranked tennis player, has written a book on Indian myths and founded an organization for autistic children.
"Everyone's acting really happy," Mr. Jackson said. "Well, I was crushed. It was such an emotionally draining experience, this unbelievable high on Wednesday chased by an unbelievable low on Saturday."
"It's not scientific," he said. "A week later they could have asked some question, and the way they phrased it, it would have set me off to say something that made the whole interview go differently. Dr. McCray said, 'Eric, don't spend time thinking about what you could have said,' but of course, I do."
MS. KUO did not make it either. At the regional finals in Chicago, she drew the first interview. "I'm the least morning person in the world," she said, "and I had to get up at 6. I didn't have very good energy. At one point they asked, 'Do you really think homeless people are your friends?' I was offended, but I just said, 'That's a good question.' I didn't fight enough. I should have said, 'Come to the shelter and see for yourself."' This time, when she tried being funny, no one laughed. 
Afterward, her parents picked her up. "They were so nice and supportive, which made me feel nice, but I felt I let them down." Ming-Shang and Hwa-Mei Kuo drove their Michelle to the airport for her flight back to Boston. By the time they got home to Kalamazoo, it was midnight.
"WE had been warned that the district would be less pleasant," Anna Weiss of Harvard said. "But it wasn't true. All the committee members were wonderful, fun to talk to." Her final interview was at the St. Botolph Club in Boston, which Ms. Weiss said reminded her of the Harvard Club. "They immediately put me at ease by their demeanor," she said. "We talked a lot about my interest in Russia, why I thought Russia was such an important player on the world stage, what I thought I could do to contribute to Russia's development. Everything we discussed was something I was interested in."
They asked if, based on her years in ballet, she believed suffering was necessary for great art. "I said, 'Not per se. An internal emotional life is required, but it needn't be suffering. It could be joy."' Ms. Weiss was at the end of the alphabet and the last of the winners announced, but, she said, "it went so quickly, nothing went through my mind really. Afterward, we all stood and hugged. It was very collegial, very nice."
IN a century, 2,982 Americans have won a Rhodes: Bill Bradley and Richard G. Lugar, the senators; Byron R. White, the Supreme Court justice; Reynolds Price, the writer; George Stephanopoulos, the television commentator. And now, Anna Weiss, the ballet dancer and Russian major.
The National Association of Fellowships Advisers emphasizes that whether students win or lose, the truly important part is the process, which encourages them to study abroad and exposes them to new ideas. And so, even though Dr. McCray has no Rhodes Scholars this time, she is throwing several parties and dinners throughout the year for each and every student who applies for a fellowship. "Whether they win or not, we want them to feel just being involved in the process is something to celebrate," she said.
Winning may not be the important thing, but just for the record, Harvard once again had the most Rhodes winners, four. At Harvard, Mr. Bohlmann said he planned nothing special for his winners. "I believe the dean sends them a congratulatory e-mail," he said, "and the president writes a letter."

 BODY:
THE Rhodes is just one of a number of international fellowships coveted for their prestige and opportunity. The programs, which pay tuition and a stipend, seek postgraduates who have demonstrated academic excellence and leadership potential in their fields. SARA IVRY
Marshall Scholarship 
The British government established the Marshall as a gesture of thanks to the United States and Gen. George C. Marshall, who oversaw the economic recovery program to rebuild Europe after World War II. Fifty years old next year, the scholarship was conceived as a coeducational alternative to the Rhodes, which until 1977 excluded women and requires study at Oxford University. The Marshall, on the other hand, allows two years of study at any British university. There is no age restriction, but applicants must have earned a bachelor's degree within the previous two years. The program, which awards an annual stipend of $30,000, is highly competitive. Generally, 40 winners are selected from a nominated pool of 800, but last year, applications rose more than 20 percent. Many applicants have grade point averages of 4.0. Past winners include Ray Dolby, inventor of the eponymous noise reduction system, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the Supreme Court. www.marshallscholarship.org
George J. Mitchell Scholarship
George Mitchell, a former senator from Maine, mediated the Northern Ireland peace process from 1996 to 1998. The scholarship, administered by the United States-Ireland Alliance, was started four years ago to promote exchanges between the two Irelands and the United States. Students spend a year at any institution in Ireland or Northern Ireland and typically earn a master's, but some apply their year toward a degree they have already started, like an M.D. Each class is limited to 12 scholars, who must be no older than 30. The Mitchell, which awards an $11,000 stipend, is financed by the Northern Ireland executive and the Irish and British governments. Because the Mitchell seeks to introduce future American leaders to Ireland, applicants without a connection to Ireland may have an edge, according to Trina Vargo, president of the United States-Ireland Alliance. But being of Irish descent has no bearing on the selection process. 
www.us-irelandalliance.org/scholarships.html
J.W. Fulbright Student Program 
This flagship program of the American government was inaugurated in 1946 by Senator Fulbright (himself a Rhodes Scholar) to promote international understanding after World War II. Each year, 1,000 American students -- seniors or graduate students -- receive up to $40,000 a year to study in a foreign country, many of them uncommon destinations for scholars. In fact, applicants whose proposals entail research in less-sought-after nations (and veterans) may have an advantage in the selection process. On the flip side, 1,500 foreign students study in the United States under the program. Recipients design their own course of inquiry and need not be pursuing a degree. Past recipients include Joseph E. Stiglitz, who shared the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in economics; Ruth J. Simmons, president of Brown University; the actor John Lithgow; and the soprano Renee Fleming. www.iie.org
Harry S. Truman Scholarship
Recipients are expected to pursue careers in the public sector, including uniformed service, and must have demonstrated such a commitment during college. To prove the point, applicants submit a one-page statement tackling a public policy issue and offering a solution. Truman Scholars are nominated by their university while in their junior year, and get a tenth of their $30,000 stipend senior year, the balance during graduate work. Scholars may study at any university or professional school in the United States or abroad, though they typically stay here. Congress established the scholarship in 1975 as the federal memorial to the 33rd president, who had dabbled unsuccessfully in haberdashery, oil wildcatting and banking before entering public service. An endowment for the government-financed program is held in trust at the Treasury. Past winners include George Stephanopoulos, ABC political analyst (who went on to win a Rhodes); Janet Napolitano, governor of Arizona; and Jeffrey Toobin, legal affairs writer for The New Yorker. truman.gov
Gates Cambridge Scholarship
 In 2001, Cambridge University welcomed its first group of 153 Gates recipients, who can work toward a second bachelor's degree on up to a doctorate. Applications are accepted from any country but Britain, with a third thus far from the United States. In what was then the biggest single gift to European higher education, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation granted $210 million to Cambridge to endow the scholarship, which awards a $15,000 annual stipend. The university had approached Mr. Gates, who had shown interest in the city of Cambridge's ambitions to become Britain's Silicon Valley, with its research institutions and start-up technology companies. www.gates.scholarships.cam.ac.uk

If You Mean Business

 BODY:
The appeal of an M.B.A. shows no signs of abating: almost 245,000 Graduate Management Admissions Tests were given in 2001-02, up 15 percent from the previous year and 180 percent from 1970-71. Theorists point to the sour economy, which traditionally sends people into hiding -- or into a new career. The degree would not be enjoying this kind of historic popularity if it didn't deliver results, in jobs and salaries, notes Daphne Atkinson, a vice president at the Graduate Management Admissions Council. Below, a sample from G.M.A.T. reasoning sections.

Critical Reasoning
 1. The average normal infant born in the United States weighs between 12 and 14 pounds at the age of 3 months. Therefore, if a 3-month-old child weighs only 10 pounds, its weight gain has been below the U.S. average.
 Which of the following indicates a flaw in the reasoning above?
 a. Weight is only one measure of normal infant development.
 b. Some 3-month-olds weigh as much as 17 pounds.
 c. It is possible for a normal child to weigh 10 pounds at birth.
 d. The phrase below average does not necessarily mean insufficient.
 e. Average weight gain is not the same as average weight.
 2. Kale has more nutritional value than spinach. But since collard greens have more nutritional value than lettuce, it follows that kale has more nutritional value than lettuce.
 Any of the following, if introduced into the argument as an additional premise, makes the argument above logically correct EXCEPT:
 a. Collard greens have more nutritional value than kale.
 b. Spinach has more nutritional value than lettuce.
 c. Spinach has more nutritional value than collard greens.
 d. Spinach and collard greens have the same nutritional value.
 e. Kale and collard greens have the same nutritional value.
 3. A drug that is highly effective in treating many types of infection can, at present, be obtained only from the bark of the ibora, a tree that is quite rare in the wild. It takes the bark of 5,000 trees to make one kilogram of the drug. It follows, therefore, that continued production of the drug must inevitably lead to the ibora's extinction.
 Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?
 a. The drug made from ibora bark is dispensed to doctors from a central authority.
 b. The drug made from ibora bark is expensive to produce.
 c. The leaves of the ibora are used in a number of medical products.
 d. The ibora can be propagated from cuttings and grown under cultivation.
 e. The ibora grows in largely inaccessible places.
 4. Large national budget deficits do not cause large trade deficits. If they did, countries with the largest budget deficits would also have the largest trade deficits. In fact, when deficit figures are adjusted so that different countries are reliably comparable to each other, there is no such correlation.
 If the statements above are all true, which of the following can properly be inferred on the basis of them?
 a. Countries with large national budget deficits tend to restrict foreign trade.
 b. Reliable comparisons of the deficit figures of one country with those of another are impossible.
 c. Reducing a country's national budget deficit will 
 not necessarily result in a lowering of any trade deficit that country may have.
 d. When countries are ordered from largest to smallest in terms of population, the smallest generally have the smallest budget and trade deficits.
 e. Countries with the largest trade deficits never have similarly large national budget deficits.
 5. Which of the following best completes this passage: The more worried investors are about losing money, the more they will demand a high potential return on their investment; great risks must be offset by the chance of great rewards. This principle is the fundamental one in determining interest rates, and it is illustrated by the fact that ...
 a. successful investors are distinguished by an ability to make very risky investments without worrying about their money.
 b. lenders receive higher interest rates on unsecured loans than on loans backed by collateral.
 c. in times of high inflation, the interest paid to depositors by banks can actually be below the rate of inflation.
 d. at any one time, a commercial bank will have a single rate of interest that it will expect all of its individual borrowers to pay.
 e. the potential return on investment in a new company is typically lower than the potential return on investment in a well-established company.

Data Sufficiency
 For the questions below, indicate whether the data given in statements (1) and (2) are sufficient for answering the question: 
 a. Statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient.
 b. Statement (2) alone is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient.
 c. Both statements together are sufficient, but neither statement alone is sufficient.
 d. Each statement alone is sufficient.
 e. Statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.
 1. A circular tub has a band painted around its circumference, as shown below. What is the surface area of this painted band?
 (1) x = 0.5
 (2) The tub is 1 meter high.
 2. A thoroughly blended biscuit mix includes only flour and baking powder. What is the ratio of the number of grams of baking powder to the number of grams of flour in the mix?
 (1) Exactly 9.9 grams of flour is contained in 10 grams of the mix.
 (2) Exactly 0.3 gram of baking powder is contained in 30 grams of the mix.
 3. Is the integer n odd?
 (1) n is divisible by 3.
 (2) n is divisible by 5.
 4. If the Lincoln Library's total expenditure for books, periodicals and newspapers last year was $35,000, how much of the expenditure was for books?
 (1) The expenditure for newspapers was 40 percent greater than the expenditure for periodicals.
 (2) The total of the expenditure for periodicals and newspapers was 25 percent less than the expenditure for books.
 5. Yesterday, Nan parked her car at a certain parking garage that charges more for the first hour than it does for each additional hour. If Nan's total charge at the parking garage was $3.75, for how many hours of parking was she charged?
 (1) Parking charges are 75 cents for the first hour and 50 cents for each additional hour or fraction of an hour.
 (2) If the charge for the first hour had been $1, Nan's total parking charge would have been $4.
 6. What were the gross revenues from ticket sales for a certain film during the second week in which it was shown?
 (1) Gross revenues during the second week were $1.5 million less than during the first week.
(2) Gross revenues during the third week were $2 million less than during the first week.
 7. How many books does Ricardo have?
 (1) If Ricardo had 15 fewer books, he would have only half as many as he actually has.
 (2) Ricardo has twice as many fiction books as nonfiction books.

HEADLINE: OPINION; 
The Cost of Winning at Science

BYLINE:  By GEORGE RAND; George Rand, a Franklin Square resident, is a former engineering research manager and university instructor.

 BODY:
I AM appalled whenever I hear about high school students trying to do research instead of concentrating on their fundamental education. Long Island school officials are spending millions of tax dollars to have their students win prizes in the Intel and Siemens science contests. That money would be better utilized if channeled to underachieving students or applied to the science training of high school teachers. 
 It is unfair to the vast majority of students to set aside $100,000-a-year teachers to put the school's name in the headlines while too few of the students know which travels faster, light or sound, or whether one-fourth of something is bigger or smaller than one-third. 
 We have the most expensive public schools in the world, yet in recent international mathematics and science test involving 23 nations, American 12th graders scored far lower than students from Lithuania and other less well-off nations.
The cost of science contest participation by Long Island schools is staggering. There are more than 25 science teachers who devote their effort to winning contest prizes. To produce one Intel or Siemens finalist consumes about $1 million of school tax money. These funds would be welcomed by any of the 14 public schools on Long Island that the state Education Department reported as failing to meet education standards.
The high school teachers assigned to the science competition are neither scientists nor engineers and few have any research laboratory experience. As a result, the competing students are teamed with scientist mentors from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory or one of the local universities. Having a contest finalist may inflate the school's superintendant's ego but it does little to improve science education.
It has been reported that one-quarter of the finalists in last year's Intel science competition were born abroad and that many are the children of parents who immigrated to the United States and have advanced degrees. Not surprisingly, the father of one finalist is a mathematics professor while the mother is a physician. These students have high benchmarks set for them by their parents and could gain admission to our nation's top universities without winning science competitions.
Most industrialized nations place great value in math and science skills. Rather than lifting the bar for academic achievement in these fields, our Long Island public school administrators are trying to scuttle a Board of Regents proposal that would require all high school students to pass five Regents exams including math and science in order to graduate. The passing grade in these exams would be phased in from 55 to 65 over a 10-year period, yet school officials staunchly oppose this requirement.
Public school budgets on Long Island exceed $6 billion and, driven by escalating teacher salaries, have been rising at twice the rate of inflation. Spending on education is the second largest expense in the state budget, but the state will not be able to continue subsidizing high-spending school districts at the current rate. New York State already has a $2 billion budget gap and is facing an estimated $10 billion shortfall next fiscal year.
Our public school system must operate more efficiently and more effectively. School administrators should be prohibited from spending millions of tax dollars in an effort to win science competitions. Science teachers, who are in short supply, should not be allowed to concentrate on a few select student to the detriment of the vast majority.
Most importantly, it is an injustice to allow students to attempt science research before they master the technology that only a university education can provide.

HEADLINE: Man Behind the Numbers Is Now a Statistic, Too 

BYLINE:  By JANE GORDON 

 BODY:
SAL DIPILLO is accustomed to being Connecticut's man behind the numbers: Information seekers call Mr. DiPillo, a soft-spoken superviser at the Connecticut Department of Labor, when they want to know statistics for the labor market in the state.
 How many people were hired in the retail sector for 2002? He knows immediately. How many people lost their jobs in November? He knows that too, and quickly. 
 But the one number he didn't have was his own. When his superviser, Roger Therrien, called him into his office the first working day of the new year, Mr. DiPillo was surprised to learn that although he still had a job, he would lose his supervisory position as up this Friday. He had become, unbeknownst to him, yet another body dropping from state budget cuts, which have resulted in layoffs of thousands of state workers. Ouch, he said.
"When my boss called me into his office, I thought, "Oh gosh, we have to lay somebody off, somebody with the least seniority'," Mr. DiPillo said. "So I was completely shocked to find out it was me."
Mr. DiPillo has supervised a staff of nine, the writing and editing of the monthly Connecticut Economic Digest in conjunction with the office of Economic and Community Development, and the monthly news release, the Connecticut Labor Situation. Although he lost his supervisory job, he was able to bump another employee in the statistics department with less seniority to keep a job.
The person he bumped, then bumped somebody else. "I feel badly about it," Mr. DiPillo said. He doesn't know what his new job will be, but it will be for a smaller salary.
"I'm not sure what I'll be doing in the office," he said. "I may be doing this, but for less money. Won't that be interesting?" 
He quotes from a recent report by the Center for Economic Analysis at the University of Connecticut, which said that Connecticut ranked second in the nation for efficiency in government employment, trailing only behind New Hampshire for the leanness of its public sector.
"I think that says we're not over-employed," he said.
The layoff is even more baffling to Mr. DiPillo because the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics pays for a percentage of the cost of the state labor statistics department in which Mr. DiPillo works.
"Because our office is substantially federally funded, we haven't faced this in the past," Mr. DiPillo said, "so I'm not sure this layoff is going to save the state money."
Nancy Steffens, a spokeswoman for the labor department, said the whole department was losing about 45 jobs, with a handful coming from statistics. It turns out that the percentage the state contributes to the running of the statistics department was so small it's not even a percentage. The department, as far as the state is concerned, is 92 percent federally funded.
So what's the point of the reshuffling?
"I wish I knew," he said.
Actually, there is a point. Marc S. Ryan, the state's budget chief, said the federal money that would have gone to pay for the salaries of the laid-off employees will be redirected to other uses, and not necessarily in the labor department. The state can use the federal money any way it wants.
"Once federal funds are in the state budget, they can be moved around to do other things," said Kathleen Harrington, a spokeswoman for the federal Department of Labor, "as long as the state continues to perform the services required by the federal government."
Mr. Ryan said he wasn't sure how much money was involved or where it would end up.

SUFFOLK jails have been overcrowded for decades, and now the state is pushing the county to add 1,200 more beds by 2007. But the county's budget woes could render such an expensive project politically unpopular unless, perhaps, the alternative was worse.
 Sheriff Alfred C. Tisch said that if Suffolk did not commit to building the more jail space by next month, hundreds of inmates could be transferred to less crowded jails upstate. And in the long run, he said, that could cost more than a new jail. 
 Oneida and Onondaga Counties have agreed to take Suffolk's overflow, but Sheriff Tisch estimated that housing 400 inmates upstate could cost as much as $20 million a year. "I don't think the Legislature wants to answer to the taxpayers for wasting that kind of money," he said. "I don't think it wants to answer for delays in court cases or for inmates' families having no visitation." 
To help stem the overcrowding, the sheriff is proposing building an 850-cell, $106 million jail, which would bring the total number of jail beds to 1,976. That figure does not include 120 beds that are being planned in Yaphank. 
County Executive Robert Gaffney said: "Clearly something needs to be done. The sheriff and I both understand a long-term solution would be more cost-effective." 
Though the county's current fiscal climate "is not the best time to be doing it," Mr. Gaffney said his 2004 capital budget would be sent to the County Legislature with "most, if not all of the sheriff's requests." He and the sheriff are Republicans.
But David Bishop, a Democratic legislator from Lindenhurst, scoffed at a $106 million jail. "That's more than the county's entire capital budget," he said. "You can undertake a capital plan in bad economic times, but the one thing Suffolk can crow about is that we have our debt level under control. A big borrowing could blow that."
"I don't dispute we're overcrowded, but the solution may not rest in building more jails," said Mr. Bishop, a member of the Legislature's public-safety committee. "We won't know what we need until we study the issue."
Last month, in response to a warning from the New York State Commission of Corrections, the County Legislature approved $1.1 million in planning and design costs that will lead to 120 additional beds at the existing county jail in Yaphank. That project is expected to total $38 million. The Legislature also appropriated $150,000 to complete a survey of jail needs. 
On Dec. 11, the state commission's staff members told the public-safety committee that the time for studies had passed. Variances permitting the jails to house more inmates than they were designed to hold expire next month. James Lawrence, the commission's operations director, said the variances would not be extended unless the county commits to expanding its jails. 
Mr. Gaffney is taking the commission at its word. "I don't think they were fooling around," he said. 
According to a transcript of the Dec. 11 meeting, Mr. Lawrence said that the county must "literally address the problem" rather than making "a gesture" at reducing overcrowding. He said the 120 additional beds at Yaphank would be "a good first step," but "the bottom line is that you need 1,200" more beds by 2007.
The Yaphank jail, completed in 1961, was designed for 504 inmates but now houses about 588. Space for 280 new beds is to be built there, but in the expansion, 160 beds will be eliminated, so the net increase will be only 120 beds. 
The other county jail, which is in Riverhead, was built in 1969 and expanded in 1988. It is designed for 760 inmates but more than 1,100 are housed there.
Suffolk's jail population has exceeded its capacity of 1,112 inmates every day since at least 1980, the Sheriff's Department said. Variances raise the legal maximum to 1,712, but that means that two inmates must bunk in an 8-by-6-foot cell designed for one. Other inmates sleep in day rooms or in the gym in Riverhead. Variances are intended to address temporary space shortages, but Suffolk has had a succession of them since 1995.
Angie Carpenter, a Republican legislator from West Islip and the chairwoman of the public-safety committee, disagreed with the state. She contends that taking the preliminary steps to build 280 new cells and appropriating money for the study of jail needs ought to qualify the county for an extension.
"I think it demonstrated a good-faith effort, but we'll find out," she said. The state commission plans to discuss the matter on Feb. 4.
Ms. Carpenter and Mr. Bishop said the study would identify ways to reduce the jail population, including alternative sentencing programs. But Suffolk already has one of the best alternative sentencing programs in the state and has "probably maxed out the capability," Mr. Lawrence said last month.
He said the commission had pushed for the construction of many of the 16 new jails now being erected in the state. Overcrowding forces 15 jails to board inmates elsewhere.
Mr. Bishop said that any suggestion that Suffolk might have to do the same was "rhetoric designed to obfuscate the fundamental issue: the need to first look at the system in its entirely."
Jeffrey Tavel, the president of the Suffolk County Criminal Bar Association, said that having inmates housed upstate would be unworkable. "That would be a horrible situation," he said. "Defense attorneys can't go all the way upstate to meet with their clients. It would wreak havoc on the court schedule. And no family visits would be devastating."
If approved, the new jail would likely be built in Yaphank, which is fast becoming a hub for law enforcement. The county owns land near the police headquarters there, and a training center for fire and other emergency services volunteers was recently completed.
A renovated kitchen at the Yaphank jail will be able to turn out 1,000 meals and could easily serve a larger jail, Sheriff Tisch said.
Mr. Gaffney said that as many as 40 percent of Suffolk's inmates "would probably be better off in psychiatric facilities," but since the state shut down three Long Island psychiatric hospitals in recent years, that left the jails with what he called "a hidden mandate."
"We're just going to have to bite the bullet," he said.

HEADLINE: Lifeboat Long Island 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
LONG ISLAND governments have plenty of emergency plans and protocols for dealing with disasters like hurricanes, toxic spills, explosions and fire. Emergency officials say these same plans would make for a swift response to a terrorist incident.
 Now, with New York City and more particularly Manhattan widely perceived as a terrorist target, Nassau and Suffolk are stepping over county lines to join in preparing for an unnatural disaster of longer duration: an attack on the city that cuts off geographic Long Island from the mainland, and not just for days, but for weeks. 
 The two county executives, Thomas R. Suozzi in Nassau and Robert J. Gaffney in Suffolk, said as long ago as last winter that they wanted a single, unified master plan for responding to a long-term emergency situation even as it more closely coordinates immediate emergency actions. Now work has begun. 
Quietly and without waiting longer for a requested but never-received $3 million in state financing, emergency officials in the two counties have set up five bicounty subcommittees to look into and eventually preside over all aspects of keeping Lifeboat Long Island afloat and provisioned in a protracted and regionally immobilizing emergency. Some of those emergencies could include bioterrorism or a nuclear attack in some form. 
The emergency plan will not delve into the massive cultural and social upheaval on a hunkered down Long Island, under siege and split off from the mainland. But it will try to assure continuity of vital services, including alternative forms of commuting and travel, to minimize economic disruption. 
"What we are developing is a survival plan for how we can function for two months cut off from the city, with no bridges and no tunnels," said Richard A. Rotanz, director of the newly created Nassau County Emergency Management Office.
Mr. Rotanz, a former deputy director in the New York City Office of Emergency Management who was involved in emergency response to the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, and emergency officials in Suffolk agreed this would be no easy job.
If the bridges and tunnels are closed, the planners will need to inventory alternate ways for bringing in supplies, including airlift, ferry, barge and freighter, to the island, which is unable to feed or fuel itself. Warehouses for storage and distribution of emergency food and water, evacuation centers for displaced people, police-enforced curbs on all but essential motor vehicle travel, restricted gasoline sales and detailed measures for continuing vital services would all be within the plan's scope.
"Everything is under development now," said David H. Fischler, the commissioner of fire, rescue and emergency services for Suffolk County. "But this is a massive undertaking. It's not something that can be done in a day or a year."
Subcommittees for transportation, communications, utilities, medical facilities and stockpiling of food and other essentials will include representatives of private businesses and the local, state and federal governments. Final authority locally will rest with the two county executives.
As crucial as it will be to emergency management, as a security measure the finished plan will never be shown to the public. Emergency officials said that residents should prepare now by having battery-powered radios, flashlights and supplies of batteries, food and water, the same advice they give for preparing for a hurricane.
With the counties and the state financially strapped and the timing and amount of federal emergency preparedness aid in question, resources are limited.
"We are going to provide the best system we can with what we have," said Joseph C. Michaels, the assistant deputy Suffolk County executive for public safety.
Last month Suffolk activated a new $300,000 computer system using emergency management software that would keep all officials on the same page during a prolonged emergency. Forty computer stations are now set up in the county's emergency operations center in Yaphank. 
But the Nassau emergency management office has yet to install a similar system for lack of funds. Although the office recently moved from a decrepit emergency center in the basement of police headquarters in Garden City to a new and undisclosed location in Hicksville, the new office has been getting by on state and federal grants and currently has only eight staff members. "As the budget gets going we'll be a little more robust," Mr. Rotanz said.
The two counties will have to overcome a long history of apartness, and other impediments including weak links between police and volunteer firefighters and emergency workers. Mr. Fischler said they would also have to reach out to Queens and Brooklyn, which might have seats on the hypothetical lifeboat but which for a century have been on the other side of a political and social wall.
If all goes well, what would emerge late next year is a computer-based plan using emergency management software seamlessly linking Nassau and Suffolk, at least. Everything from inventories of food and medical supplies to emergency announcements advising the public would be part of the program.
While officials and agencies monitored events in real time on a computer system designed to stay up and running amid widespread power failures, residents would be asked to take shelter at home or wherever they could, turn on the television or listen to a battery-powered radio if power were out, and await official instructions. "We will direct them accordingly when the time comes," Mr. Fischler said.
Discussions with a number of emergency officials threw little light on how they would deal with public panic, spontaneous evacuations and large numbers of people fleeing the city for Long Island.
All of them said they were ready for whatever came. "I won't say we are totally prepared, but we have a working group that can make decisions," Mr. Michaels said.
But questions about the level of coordination and public education have arisen. "Long Island does not have a single plan to respond to an emergency," said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, which supports the longer-term planning. "It is not clear that there will not be conflicts among the plans of various jurisdictions, and it is not clear that the population knows what to do in the event of an attack."
Mr. Rotanz agreed that public education was needed, but said it would come after organizational and emergency preparedness was complete. "Once we get our plans up and running we will have an outreach program," he said.
Mr. Fischler said it would be unwise to tell people where to go or what to do in advance of an attack. "To say do this or do that may be putting people in harm's way," he said. "That's why we won't identify shelters ahead of time: because every incident is fact-specific, and certain shelters may be too close to the incident."
The absence of information for the public extends to the state Office of Emergency Management, which would assist in an emergency. The office's Web site lists public awareness campaigns for hurricanes and other weather hazards, but not for nuclear releases or any terrorist-related hazard.
Asked why, Dennis Michalski, a spokesman for the emergency management office, replied: "That's a good question. I don't have an answer for that right now. We do have things in development." 
County health departments in Nassau and Suffolk have received federal financing through the state for bioterrorism preparedness and now face local costs and administrative responsibility for mass smallpox vaccinations ordered by President Bush.
The first phase, vaccinations for health care and some emergency workers, was to begin by later this month. A second phase for other emergency workers, police and firefighters would follow. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta will supply the vaccine.
David Ackman, the Nassau health commissioner, said his department received $1.25 million for bioterrorism preparedness and spent it for communications, equipment, software, training and staff. "It does not account for the expense of vaccinating thousands of people," Dr. Ackman said. He said he expected additional funds this year and in 2004. 
Dr. Ackman is also a co-chairman of the bicounty medical facilities subcommittee. "We are certainly better prepared than we were at this time last year," he said. "There is a sense of urgency and a great deal of effort going into making sure Nassau County can respond to any event."
Jeanne Alicandro, the director of emergency medical services for the Suffolk Health Department, said the county was completing plans for giving mass vaccinations if they became necessary. She said the county had a limited stockpile of antibiotics for anthrax, plague and other biological agents.
Dr. Alicandro said that the department, which is also represented on the medical facilities subcommittee, was investigating how to cope with major disruptions in the delivery of medicine and supplies. But she said the problem seemed solvable. "It would be hard to imagine no air and boat," she said.
Mr. Michalski said the state recently received a consultant's audit on the adequacy of state emergency response plans for nuclear plants in New York.
He said the audit, which was ordered by Governor Pataki last year, reviewed plans for communities around the Indian Point nuclear complex in Westchester County and also for Fishers Island, which is partly within the federally required 10-mile evacuation zone for the Millstone nuclear complex in Waterford, Conn. Fishers Island, part of the Town of Southold, is the only area within the federal zone that is part of New York, though the Star Foundation, an antinuclear group in East Hampton, has warned that a worst-case disaster at Millstone could make parts of Long Island uninhabitable.
Utilities and private companies advised by authorities that they are potential targets have increased security and made preparedness plans. Stephen M. Jones, chief executive officer of the Suffolk County Water Authority, Long Island's largest public water supplier, said the authority had spent about $2 million since September 2001 on new security.
He said the authority changed the locks on all pump station gates, put welded steel cages over the openings of ground-level storage tanks, upgraded computer security and issued new security identification badges to employees.
The authority also used a $65,000 federal grant to hire an engineering company to perform a vulnerability risk assessment. Mr. Jones said he expected its report within weeks.
Bert J. Cunningham, the spokesman for the Long Island Power Authority, said the authority had been "fairly close-mouthed about contingency plans" because of security considerations. "We have certainly been looking at and shaping plans for the possibility of terrorist incidents," he said.
He said LIPA also received alerts from federal, state and local authorities on possible threats. Last week, the power authority, Keyspan, emergency management officials from New York City, Nassau and Suffolk and representatives from the F.B.I. and the New York Air National Guard met to discuss terrorist threats and preparedness, Mr. Cunningham said.
Mr. Cunningham said the authority had increased ability to supply power during an emergency that cut off power imports because of small units installed at various locations on Long Island over the last two years to meet summer peak demand. The units added 450 megawatts of locally generated power.
He said the transmission system had also been outfitted with connections for small portable generators that could be trucked to Long Island in an emergency. If bridges and tunnels to Long Island were closed, he said, alternate delivery would be no problem.
"We would fly them into Gabreski Airport on military aircraft," he said, referring to the Suffolk County airport in Westhampton. "There are ways of dealing with this."
An increased role for passenger and vehicle ferries during a lengthy closing of bridges and tunnels off Long Island has become part of a waterborne transportation study by New York and Connecticut.
Alan Meyers, the lead consultant for the plan, said emergency ferry terminals could be quickly set up using barges supported by piles. "We need to ask how much we are capable of doing if you looked at every place you could have ferry service," Mr. Meyers said. "It's an important question now."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Country Club, the Bronx; 
A Waterfront Enclave Within the City

BYLINE:  By CLAIRE WILSON 

 BODY:
DURING the five years that Joan Varela lived the green life in Putnam County, all she could think about was getting back to the Bronx. But the move back had one condition. 
 "I would only move back if we could go to Country Club," she said. "It is upscale, prestigious and immaculately maintained." 
 On Eastchester Bay opposite City Island, the neighborhood is rare within the city limits for its waterfront properties with private deep-water docks, beaches and nearby beach clubs that hum with life year-round. By night, the lights of the Throgs Neck Bridge twinkle in the distance like so many diamonds. 
It was a view of the bay from the kitchen and the back deck that immediately sold the Varelas on the 3,500-square-foot house, for which they paid $470,000 early in 2001 and which Mrs. Varela said would now sell in the $600,000 range. It has three bedrooms, two and a half baths and many amenities, but it is the setting on the water that she and her husband, Mike, a letter carrier for the Postal Service who also has a landscaping business, enjoy the most. 
"You smell the salt water at night and feel like you're on vacation," said Mrs. Varela who is the operations manager at the The Bronx Times, a weekly newspaper, as well as a part-time sales representative for a designer fragrance company. "When it storms, we sit out on the deck and watch." 
The Varelas' house is one of 11 modern Nantucket-gray homes that were built in a cluster called Country Club Estates at the water's edge some 15 years ago. The Varelas pay $140 a month for landscaping and outdoor maintenance services. While they have a view of the bay, they have no access to the water and they are ready to buy property with access as soon as something comes up. Being a Country Club resident should work to their advantage. Houses in the area are in such demand that they sometimes change hands within days among people who know each other, often without brokers. 
George Febles, a teacher of American history and economics and a track coach at Fordham Prep, bought his house -- a $350,000, three-bedroom, 1,800-square-foot colonial with Tudor accents -- through word of mouth, thanks to someone in Staten Island that he knew from high school track circles. The house has three bedrooms and one and a half baths. 
"Her father wanted to sell it to a young professional family, and he didn't want to go through a broker," said Mr. Febles, who has two children. "We thought it was crazy to buy the first thing we looked at, but it's great -- very quiet and near all the main highways." 
Country Club is a small enclave defined by Interstate 95 to the west, Spencer Drive to the north, Layton Avenue to the south and the waters of Eastchester Bay, according to Marcia Pavlica, president of the Country Club Civic Association. Some residents believe the neighborhood derives its name from the Westchester Country Club, currently in Rye, but in fact it is named for another club, the Country Club of Westchester, which stood on Eastchester Bay from 1881 until 1922.
Residents' livelihoods cover a wide range, including public officials, teachers, lawyers, engineers and small business owners. Those who commute to Manhattan can do so by local bus and subway or by express bus, run by a company that is involved in a dispute with the city but which has agreed to provide service until April. 
Waterfront properties like those along Country Club Road are the jewels in the crown in Country Club, whose overall cozy atmosphere is created by a whimsical mix of housing styles, from wooden saltboxes to brick or fieldstone colonials and Tudors to 50's-era Capes and ranches. Away from the water, most plots are small, usually 100 feet deep but sometimes only 30 feet wide. Adding to its charm, not every block has sidewalks and lawns along the tree-lined streets roll softly down to property lines defined by neat rows of Belgian blocks. Garages abound and on-street parking is plentiful. 
"It is not a cookie-cutter kind of community," Mrs. Pavlica said. "You'll find houses of all descriptions and sizes, giving it a very comfortable look."
NEW houses are being built on plots where older homes have been knocked down, and prices are going up across the board.
"We've seen the greatest increases in the past 24 months," according to Joseph Lemongelli, owner of Better Homes Realty and president of the Bronx Manhattan-North Association of Realtors. "Houses that sold for $250,000 have gone up by 30 percent or more." 
Prices on one-family detached homes start about $255,000 for a house that needs work and can go up to $475,000. Two-family houses start at $450,000, according to Phyllis Basilone, sales associate with Prudential Kafcos Realty. 
Houses on the waterfront are harder to price because there are few of them. Dorothy DeMarco, principal in Town and Country Homes & Properties, herself the owner of a spacious waterfront two-family with private dock and koi pond at the back, said that in five years she has sold two waterfront houses -- one for $515,000 and one for $545,000 -- that were knocked down and replaced with new structures. Mrs. DeMarco guesses a waterfront house might now sell for more than $700,000. "Where else do you have a two-family house on the water with a deep-water dock and city taxes?" she asked. 
Taxes in the area are deemed reasonable, especially compared with areas in Westchester or Long Island. "They're around $2,000 now, and that's as good as you can ask for," Mr. Febles said. 
As for rental properties, John Velez, a sales agent with New Directions Realty, said studios in a two-family house go for about $850 a month and one bedrooms for about $1,000, but $1,300 with a water view, while two-bedrooms without water views rent for $1,250 to $1,400. 
Young people who were raised in Country Club often want to stay there to raise their own families, largely because of the quality and variety of schools that serve the area. There are two public schools for children in kindergarten through fifth grade: Public School 71 on Roberts Avenue and Public School 14 on Bruckner Boulevard.
Of students at P.S. 71, 52.4 percent are reading at or above grade level and 49.8 percent are scoring at or above grade level in math. Fourth and fifth grade students there can participate in a special architecture workshop, where they make sketches and scale models two afternoons a week. Of P.S. 14 students, 63 percent are at or above grade level in reading and 61.9 percent in math. Last year the school started a popular after-school Video Club where students made an entire film, from writing the script through editing the finished product.
Intermediate School 192 Hollywood Avenue, for Grades 6, 7 and 8 has a magnet program, Mathematics Integrated Theme Academy, for students who are good in math and who enjoy a math-related approach to other subjects like social studies and literature. Of all students in the school, 30.7 percent are reading at or above grade level while 29.8 percent score at or above grade level in math.
Middle School 101 on Lafayette Avenue is a small five-year-old school with only 540 students in Grades 5 through 8, who are chosen by lottery from 20 elementary schools. The school is designed for advanced students, with 89.2 percent reading at or above grade level and 83.9 percent scoring at or above grade level in math. 
Herbert H. Lehman High School on East Tremont Avenue is so popular that it gets more than 6,000 applicants for the 100 places open annually for children outside its home area, according to Robert Leder, the principal, who has been at the school for 24 years.
On the SAT reasoning tests, Lehman students who graduated in June 2001, the most recent figures available, scored 437 on the verbal test and 447 on the math, compared with a statewide average that year of 495 in verbal and 505 in math. Of seniors graduating in 2001, 61 percent went on to four-year colleges and 36 percent to two-year colleges. 
Many children from Country Club, which has a high proportion of residents of Italian heritage, attend three parochial high schools. Preston High School in nearby Throgs Neck is a Roman Catholic girls-only school for Grades 9 through 12. Tuition there is $4,850 per student per year, and 100 percent of graduates go on to college. Admitting both boys and girls in Grades 9 to 12, Cardinal Spellman on Eastchester Road is another popular choice for college-bound students. Tuition and fees are $5,000 a year. 
SITTING on a bluff overlooking Eastchester Bay in Country Club, the co-ed Villa Maria Academy, another Catholic school, has been in the same location for more than 100 years. Tuition is $3,600 per student for Grades 1 through 8 and $3,000 for prekindergarten. St. Benedict's School, which is on Edison Avenue in Throgs Neck, charges $2,700 for students in the parish and $4,000 for students from outside the parish. It offers kindergarten through eighth grade and will resume its pre-K program in September after a one-year hiatus. Closer by is Our Lady of the Assumption on Parkview Avenue, where tuition varies from $2,350 per year per individual child in the parish to $4,500 for parish families with three or more children enrolled. 
There is no commercial area in Country Club, a feature that adds to the welcome quiet of the neighborhood. A number of family-owned Italian specialty stores and delicatessens like the popular Lizzie's Supermarket on Layton Avenue are sprinkled throughout the neighborhood, but for large chain supermarkets residents must make the 15-minute drive to the Bay Plaza shopping center or go farther afield to Westchester. Good restaurants, especially Italian ones, abound. For seafood lovers, City Island is just a few minutes away by car or boat, which can tie up at restaurant docks.
Waterfront beach clubs like the Manheim and the American Turner's Club in adjacent Eastchester Bay have been a staple of Country Club social life for decades, providing beach access, function rooms and in some cases pool and gym facilities.
The Bronx Zoo and the New York Botanical Garden are about three miles away, and lovers of the great outdoors can drive five minutes to nearby Pelham Bay Park, which at 2,764 acres is three times the size of Central Park. It offers tennis, horseback riding, the historic Bartow-Pell Mansion and Museum and the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary as well as nine miles of shoreline, including Orchard Beach. Greens fees at the two golf courses run $24 for 18 holes.
On summer evenings, the sprawling park is a magnet for Country Club residents who converge there for after-dinner strolls or to watch teams from different countries play soccer. "It's like our village green," Mrs. DeMarco said.

One of the oldest and most exclusive clubs in the country, it offered golf, tennis, shooting, yachting, swimming, sailing and skating and was one of the first places that polo was played on American shores. Members included New York society families like the Vanderbilts and the Knickerbockers, some of whom may have been present on Jan. 2, 1922, when the elegant clubhouse burned to the ground. According to an account in The New York Times, not even the best efforts of the ladies' bucket brigade could save the structure, built in 1888. The parcel was auctioned for development in the 1930's, about the time of the sale of the adjacent Spencer Estates, once owned by a magazine publisher, Lorillard Spencer, who died in 1912.

HEADLINE: When the Rich Are Not So Different 

BYLINE:  By MARGE PERRY 

 BODY:
PORSCHES in the parking lot of the local food pantry? It may come to that.
 Last year, as unemployment in New Jersey reached a six-year high, hunger relief groups recorded a 17 percent increase statewide in the number of people seeking food assistance. Poor areas were hard hit, of course, but the big surprise is that the increase in some of the wealthiest areas was double that. 
 "In the last 14 months, we've seen a 30 to 40 percent increase in people seeking food assistance," said Bea O'Rourke, manager of the Center for Food Action, which is based in Mahwah and serves parts of Bergen and Passaic Counties.
Food pantries say upper-middle and middle-class families throughout New Jersey are facing a choice: pay either to keep a roof over their heads or to put food on the table. They cannot afford both. And the future looks even worse for some; although economists cite signs of economic recovery in New Jersey, they also warn that industries like the high-technology sector, which has already laid off so many workers, may continue to lag. 
In affluent Morris County, one man who spoke on condition of anonymity said that in 2001 he grossed $185,000 as a senior executive of a Fortune 500 company. His salary easily covered the mortgage and upkeep on his $500,000 home as well as the maintenance of two cars and his 13-year-old daughter's piano lessons, sports activities and tutoring. He donated regularly to the United Way, and several times a year his daughter took groceries to the local food bank.
The man, who lost his job in March, now visits the food bank himself. Twice a month he picks up groceries for his family.
"I've never taken assistance from anyone in 19 years of working," he said softly in a recent phone interview.
"People need to know this can happen," he continued. "I couldn't appreciate this until I went through it. When you make a six-digit salary, you can't imagine people like you in this situation. I would have thought people who use pantries are losers -- drug addicts, people who don't want to work."
His family is living on his wife's $20,000 annual salary and what is left of their savings after stock market losses. It is not enough money to keep their house, pay medical bills and buy groceries.
As others are discovering, although expenses like dance lessons, restaurant meals and vacations may be relatively easy to pare back, rent and mortgage payments are not. Housing expense remains a colossal monster to feed each month, but the alternative is homelessness.
In a strong economy, New Jersey's high housing costs force residents to spend much of their income on rent or mortgage payments, which leaves less money to sock away for a rainy day. When the economy takes a downturn, that rainy day comes as companies downsize or reduce medical benefits. As families put their limited funds into having a place to live, not enough money is left for food.
Record numbers of residents in wealthy areas now turn to pantries for help. In Morris County, for example, the Interfaith Food Pantry distributed 31,394 bags of food in 2002, far surpassing the 25,861 distributed in 2001 and the 18,101 in 2000. 
"We serve towns that are not usually considered towns in trouble," said Ms. O'Rourke of the Center for Food Action in Mahwah. "Our hunger is a silent hunger. Most of our clients are the working poor. Some lost a job and can't find another of equal pay. So maybe they take two lower-paying jobs and try to scale down. Meanwhile, they lose health benefits. But they have to keep a roof over their heads, and you can't really work in suburbia without a car."
It doesn't always take something as financially drastic as losing a job to send a family over the precipice and into the food pantry. One middle-class family was living fairly comfortably, even after the husband's health benefits had been decreased, until doctors told them that their son had leukemia. 
"The mother has to stop working to care for the child, and on top of that, she's now paying for gasoline to drive into the city, parking and meals when he spends the day at the hospital," Ms. O'Rourke said. "The family ended up at the pantry because after paying their mortgage and costs associated with their son's illness, they didn't have enough money left to feed their other three children."
The need for food assistance is not restricted by class, education, work ethic or income level.
Ms. O'Rourke described another new client, a family where the father was laid off two weeks ago: "Two kids and a mortgage of $1,100. They were living right on the edge before he lost his job, because the mother had been ill and couldn't work. He applied for unemployment, but that takes six weeks. The mother is now able to go back to work part time, as an adjunct professor, if she can even find a job."
The father and the mother, nearly desperate to work, cannot withstand the financial setback of even temporary unemployment.
Families who rent are no better off than those paying a mortgage. According to a study by Legal Services of New Jersey, to afford the statewide average rent of $980 for a two-bedroom apartment requires annual income of about $40,000. Though census data for 2000 showed that New Jersey had the highest median household income in the nation, $54,276, the flip side is that about 35 percent of households in the state earn less than $40,000.
"We're the first line of defense in a bad economy," said Meara Nigro, director of communications for Community FoodBank of New Jersey, the largest food bank in the state. She and others say the pantries are no longer used for only short-term crises; families in financial straits rely on them to free up enough money to pay for housing.
Rosemary Gilmartin, executive director of the Interfaith Food Pantry in Morris County, said, "We've become a supplemental feeding program."
The problem deepens because as the need for their programs increase, donations to pantries decrease.
Food pantries operate mostly on donations from food companies, private groups and individuals and surplus commodities from government organizations.
In a leaner economy, food companies tend to manage their inventories more closely to avoid overproduction. As a result, they give away fewer items that are nearing expiration dates. Such donations represented the single largest source of the 24 million pounds of food distributed by Community FoodBank of New Jersey in 2002. But the amount given by food companies, 8.3 million pounds, was down significantly from the 9.3 million pounds that they donated in 2000.
Donations from individuals also decreased.
"All of us are having trouble getting food and volunteers because of the economy," Ms. O'Rourke said. "People who used to give us $25 now give $10. And we have volunteers who have become clients."
Some programs to feed the hungry, however, are actually growing, despite the economy.
One such organization is Table-to-Table, which picks up cooked and highly perishable foods that would have been thrown out from restaurants, food manufacturers and wholesalers, country clubs and grocery stores and delivers it in refrigerated trucks to food assistance programs that have the capacity to store and serve it at safe temperatures.
"There's a tremendous amount of food out there," said Claire Insalata Poulos, president of Table-to-Table, a group that is based in Englewood Cliffs and is financed by corporate grants and private donations. "We haven't even scratched the surface."
The organization's three refrigerated trucks are constantly on the move five days a week, delivering food for less than 15 cents a meal. Ms. Insalata Poulos says recipient agencies supplement their usual items with what Table-to-Table brings them.
When a Table-to-Table truck pulled up recently at the loading dock of the A.&P. in Midland Park, the store manager, Joe Sidor, talked about the food he was about to hand over.
Looking at four shopping carts filled with frozen chickens (stamped with a sell-by date of that day), deli-counter sandwiches and salads, and an assortment of frozen foods, produce and store-baked pies, he said: "I love this program. All these years, it killed me to throw this stuff away. This is stuff I would eat at home if it were in my refrigerator, and we had to just throw it. It's great to know it's going to people who really need it."
An hour and a couple of pickups later, the truck delivered its haul to the Father English Food Pantry in Paterson. Barbara Gaschler, who as president of the Emergency Food Coalition of Passaic County has her office there, was especially happy to see fresh oranges among the delivered goods. "This is great," she said. "Kids will actually get fresh fruit."
Ms. Gaschler says she sees 100 to 110 families a day and refers them to 24 pantries in Passaic County. Many of them wait two hours for a screening interview and then an hour for one or two bags of food.
"It's hard enough for them to come here, take time off from work, maybe," she said, shaking her head. "They don't want to be here." 
Like those people, the man from Morris County who lost his executive position does not want to be using his local pantry. In a race against his dwindling resources, he has sent out more than 1,000 resumes. Until his savings and unemployment benefits run out, he says, he will keep looking and hoping for any kind of job, even an entry-level position. Meanwhile, with so much time to spare, he helps sort and stack groceries at the pantry that helps him.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME; 
When Rents Exceed Legal Limits

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
IN the various interactions between tenants and landlords, few are as vexing as disputes over overcharges in rent-regulated apartments.
 The stakes, lawyers for both groups say, can be high. Landlords who overcharge tenants can be required to refund up to four years worth of overcharges -- often with a refund for the last two years of triple the amount of the actual overcharge. But tenants who do not file a complaint within two years of the first overcharge for apartments under rent control and four years for those under rent stabilization could lose the right to obtain any refund at all. 
 "This is a complaint-driven process," said Marcia Hirsch, general counsel for the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which handles rent overcharge complaints. "A tenant can file a complaint that basically says, 'I think I'm being overcharged,' and we will open a file." In fact, since July 1997, the division has accepted more than 8,500 overcharge complaints, Ms. Hirsch said. Because many cases are appealed, the agency does not maintain statistics on the outcomes of the cases, she added. 
Actually completing the complaint, however, is a bit more complicated. The complaint form (available from housing division offices and on the agency's Web site at www.dhcr.state.ny.us under "rent administration: forms") is a four-page document with 25 questions. And while the form poses some fairly predictable questions about the tenant, the building and the lease, it also requires the tenant to articulate why he believes he is being overcharged and to submit evidence. In addition, the tenant must record his rental payments month by month from the date of occupancy or for the past four years if rent-stabilized or two years if rent-controlled, whichever is shorter. The form also elicits whatever information the tenant may have about rent increases charged by the landlord.
"There are four common ways that landlords may increase rents," Ms. Hirsch said. The most common is the result of increases approved by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board (for rent-stabilized tenants) or by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (for rent-controlled tenants.) For example, Ms. Hirsch said, for rent-stabilized renewal leases signed from Oct. 1, 1997, to Sept. 30, 2000, the board allowed increases of 2 percent for one-year leases and 4 percent for two-year leases. For leases signed from Oct. 1, 2000, and Sept. 30, 2002, increases of 4 percent and 6 percent were allowed.
Besides those increases, Ms. Hirsch said, landlords have also been able -- since June 15, 1997 -- to raise the legal rent for a vacant apartment by adding a "vacancy allowance." For new leases since that date, she said, landlords have been entitled to an 18 percent increase for a one-year lease and a 20 percent increase for a two-year lease. Under some circumstances, Ms. Hirsch said, additional vacancy increases may be allowed. For example, if the prior legal rent for an apartment was less than $300 a month, the landlord is entitled to an additional vacancy allowance of $100 a month.
Landlords may also legally increase rents, Ms. Hirsch said, are by passing along the costs of major capital improvements made throughout the building or to individual apartments. With a buildingwide improvement, she said, the landlord is typically entitled to a permanent per-room increase of one eighty-fourth of the cost of the improvement, with each tenant's increase being allocated based on how many rooms he has. With an individual apartment improvement, the landlord is entitled to permanently increase a unit's rent by one-fortieth of the cost of an improvement without going through the housing division. (When an individual apartment improvement is made to an occupied apartment, Ms. Hirsch said, the tenant must consent to the improvement in writing for the landlord to be entitled to an increase.)
Knowing the amount of allowable increases over a period of years, of course, is of little use unless the tenant has a starting point upon which to base his or her calculations. And that, lawyers say, is where the going gets a little rough.
David Ng, a Manhattan lawyer who frequently represents tenants, said that one way for a tenant to identify a reference point of the last legal rent is to ask the housing division for a list of recent rent registrations for that apartment filed by the landlord. Some landlords routinely provide this information directly to tenants. Having that list, Mr. Ng said, will provide the tenant with a point of reference from which he or she can determine the legal rent. 
But there is no guarantee that the landlord has registered the rent. Mr. Ng explained that while the law requires landlords to file registered rents annually, there is basically no penalty for failing to do so. As a result, it is conceivable that a tenant who rented an apartment in, say, January of 2000 could find that the landlord has not registered any rent for the apartment since January 1998. That could be a problem, Mr. Ng said, because of a change in the law that took effect on June 15, 1997.
That change, he said, established a "statute of limitations" for rent overcharge actions. A statute of limitations, Mr. Ng said, is a time frame within which a lawsuit -- or administrative complaint -- must be brought in order for the plaintiff to recover damages. For rent-stabilized tenants, he said, a complaint for a rent overcharge must be filed within four years of the date of the first alleged overcharge. For rent-controlled tenants, the time frame is two years. 
Under the 1997 change in the law, Mr. Ng said, the Division of Housing and Community Renewal will go back only four years to establish a starting point for determining the current allowable rent for a rent-stabilized apartment. So, for example, if a tenant rented an apartment on Feb. 1, 2000, and then filed an overcharge complaint on Jan. 31, 2003, the division will go back to the beginning of the tenancy to calculate the overcharge up to the present time. On the other hand, if a tenant rented an apartment for more than the legal rent on Feb. 1, 1999, but the tenant did not discover the overcharge or file a complaint until Feb. 2, 2003, and all increases since then have been legal, the tenant probably will not be able to recover anything. 
A tenant who is being overcharged and who does file within the period prescribed by the law, however, may be entitled to recover even more than the actual overcharge.
Sherwin Belkin, a Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords, said that when housing division determines there has been a "willful" overcharge, the agency has the power to order the landlord to reimburse the tenant for the amount of the overcharge -- for up to four years of overcharges in the case of a rent stabilized tenant and two years for a rent-controlled tenant -- and can order that the amount of the reimbursement for the last two years be tripled. The tenant then has the right to deduct up to 20 percent per month from the rent until the overcharge and any penalty are fully recovered. When the amount exceeds $1,000 or the tenant has moved from the apartment, he or she may opt to obtain a judgment from the landlord for the full amount.
Mr. Belkin said that while the two- or four-year limitation on overcharge complaints may seem harsh to tenants, the use of a statute of limitations is basically fair. "Under D.H.C.R.'s interpretation of the law, "the onus is completely on the landlord to prove the legality of the rent," he said. "And if the agency that there has been an overcharge, there is an automatic presumption that the overcharge was willful, so the landlord then has the additional burden of proving that it was not. It's a double whammy."
John Fisher, director of TenantNet, an Internet-based information service at www.tenant.net, said tenants who believe they are being overcharged should file a complaint with the housing division as soon as those suspicions are confirmed. "You need to get as much information as you can, as quickly as you can."
In addition, Mr. Fisher said, tenants should talk to other rent-regulated residents in the building to get some idea of other tenants' rents. 
"Don't be embarrassed," he said. "Even a small overcharge can add up to a lot of money."

When Cameras Roll, So Do Dollars

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS 

DATELINE: CROSS RIVER 

 BODY:
AT Ward Pound Ridge Reservation here, no coyotes or wild turkeys can be spotted, but beneath the trees, on the fields and atop rocks, grips, gaffers, thick-neck wrestlers and baby-faced production assistants are running wild. Battle cries suddenly go up as opposing Revolutionary War armies, the red coats and the blue, charge at each other across an open field. They meet in the middle where, instead of bayoneting one another, the soldiers enter a wrestling ring for headlocks and body slams. Just how did it come to pass that King George's army and Minutemen are charging at each other in the middle of this reservation's 4,700 acres of wilderness. 
 Well, World Wrestling Entertainment was filming a television commercial for its Royal Rumble, a wrestling match that will be held on Jan. 19 at the Fleet Center in Boston and seen on a pay-per-view telecast. The Royal Rumble is one of World Wrestling Entertainment's biggest wrestling matches, said Greg Castronuovo, the company's vice president for marketing. 
 The location of the shoot was arranged with the help of Iris Stevens, who, as the director of the Westchester County Film Office, helps turn everything from county parks to local homes into places that can pass as MGM's backlot. If the land or buildings being used are owned by the county, Mrs. Stevens collects a fee on behalf of the county; if the property is owned by a municipality or a private citizen, Mrs. Stevens may act as liaison. Getting permission to film can cost hundreds of dollars on a downtown street to thousands for use of a private home.
Mrs. Stevens, who works out of a first-floor office in the county office building in White Plains, is a cross between a location scout and a real estate agent, and the reservation, she said, is currently her "poster child location." It is white-hot popular for all of the kinds of shoot that she helps arrange: commercials, films and still photography.
"We wanted something that looked like a majestic, northeast field that we could cheat as being something from 1775," said the Royal Rumble commercials codirector, Kevin Sullivan. "This isn't a set, it's nature. It's perfect."
The spots producer, Rich Krekian, said that because World Wrestling Entertainment is headquartered in Stamford, Conn., the company usually prefers to shoot in Connecticut. But location scouts were hired and Mrs. Stevens was called in. "And we looked at photographs and this was hands down the best," Mr. Krekian said. "And we're paying probably half of what we would at a private location." World Wrestling Entertainment paid $4,000 for the use of Ward Pound Ridge Reservation. 
When production companies contact Mrs. Stevens in search of a field or farm, she can show them the reservation or Muscoot Farms in Somers or any number of other locations.
Part of the reason Westchester has historically been such a popular location for film shooting is its proximity to New York, but another advantage is that it offers such a wide variety of settings: there are urban landscapes in Yonkers, Mount Vernon and New Rochelle, plus plenty of suburban and rural locals, and an airport. There is also the Long Island Sound and the Hudson River, as well as private mansions, thousands of acres of county parkland, as well as odd and original settings, like Playland, which was used in the movie "Big."
O N a recent afternoon, Mrs. Stevens sat in her office answering an inquiry from a producer looking for a medical examiner's office circa 1930.
"We have a medical examiner's office," she said to a caller, "but it's not going to look like the 1930's. It's very spiffy." The producer said something on his end and Mrs. Stevens replied: "I think they're going to have to rewrite it." Then, after the producer presumably said that the rewrite was a no-go, she continued: 'I do have a 1930's building that has a police station in it."
Despite the fact that reservations are still being converted for rumbles and the phone continues to ring in her office, Mrs. Stevens said that the county film business has, despite a slight pick-up recently, fallen off sharply in the past two years.
"Two years ago, it was great, fabulous," Mrs. Stevens said, "but it's probably fallen off 40 percent since last year. It's been a terrible film economy." The reasons, she said, have been a bad national economy, which has limited the number of commercials and independent films produced. 
"It's been a very grim picture," Mrs. Stevens said. "We've been dramatically hit." 
"Everything about this industry is bottom-line driven and now it's more bottom-line driven. My phone still rings, but there's less business and more haggling and negotiating. Bigger jobs are being done for less money."
Less filming means less money for the county, on many levels. In addition to the fee the county or municipality charges for the shoot, there are the dollars thrown off when a film production crew rolls into town for a period of time and spends money locally. Actresses get their nails done and best boy electrics buy sandwiches at the town's delis.
"Unfaithful," for example, starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane, spent 66 days shooting in the county. A spokeswoman for the county executive said that the film industry pumped more than $6 million into the county's economy in 2001, including more than $1 million in fees alone.
"As nice as it is to see our parks and building and airport up on the silver screen, it's even nicer to see all those dollars going to economic development," County Executive Andrew J. Spano said. "Local companies and hospitality-related services are getting business they never would have otherwise."
Not every star who comes through town gets beauty treatments, however. Kurt Angle, the W.W.E. wrestler and a 1996 Olympic wrestling gold medalist, was the featured actor in the Royal Rumble shoot but was not about to get his nails done locally -- or probably anywhere else.
Mr. Angle had wrestled in the W.W.E.'s Smackdown! event the night before and had flown into La Guardia Airport the morning of the shoot, and driven here in a long black limousine.
After putting two red coats into headlocks and mocking them for losing the war, Mr. Angle signed autographs for a scrum of young fans, looked around and said: "It's beautiful. It's just like I imagined battlefields back then, on green earth. Beautiful."

HEADLINE: HEALTH; 
A Loss of Support

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
FOR more than 20 years, social workers employed by the White Plains division of the New York Presbyterian Hospital have visited mentally ill patients regularly at their homes, checking on their health, taking them shopping for groceries, filing benefit applications for them, putting them into psychiatric treatment at times of crises and most often just chatting with them.
 Many of its current patients, mostly single elderly men who suffer from bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, have been abandoned by their families or have lived alone their entire adult lives. 
 The program will stop running next month. New York Presbyterian Hospital cited its financial loss -- about $100,000 annually -- for running this program as the reason to close it when the hospital informed the county government and the social workers of its decision in mid-December. It had clinical reasons as well. 
"It is better for patients to receive social support services from the providers of their psychiatric care," said Philip Wilner, the hospital's medical director of behavioral health and a vice president.
New York Presbyterian receives about $850,000 in state aid and Medicaid reimbursement for the program. The patients themselves do not pay.
The hospital treats 35 patients from this group, but roughly a quarter of the 250 patients do not receive any psychiatric treatment, their social workers said.
The 19 social workers will most likely be laid off, although the hospital has said it will relocate them if similar positions come up in the New York Presbyterian system.
The patients in the program might be picked up by a different hospital or another nonprofit organization, said Jennifer Schaffer, Westchester's commissioner of mental health, who is seeking out organizations that might be willing to take over the contract for the program. Myrna Manners, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said the hospital was examining all its programs in Westchester but did not have plans to cut any others.
Vincent Suppa, 61, who suffers from bipolar disorder, is stunned by the prospect that his social worker, Patricia Duran, will stop visiting him. A former computer technician, he lost his job eight years ago because of his mental illness. Since then, his wife has left him, and he was institutionalized more than three years ago. He now lives at an adult home, Lincoln Rest, in Ardsley, and his two children, who are 30 and 28, rarely visit him.
"Terrible, terrible," he mumbled in a husky low voice about losing Ms. Duran, who has visited him once a week for the last two and a half years ago. She has brought him warmth, laughter, pizza and prescription drugs, he said. Around the holidays, she has taken him shopping for clothes and gadgets. Her visits have become one of the few things he looks forward to.
"I don't feel any good," he said, his voice trembling. "I hope Patricia gets her job back with another hospital and can keep coming."
A woman who lives in a group home and suffers from schizophrenia, a social worker said, experienced a severe relapse when she learned that the program is ending. She has been crying and more depressed than usual, refusing to get up in the mornings, to shower or to follow any of her other daily routines.
Although a number of the social workers agreed to be interviewed, they all asked to withhold their names, hoping New York Presbyterian would transfer them to other locations. They are also counting on severance packages from the hospital (a week's pay for every year worked). 
Government financing for New York Presbyterian to run the program comes through the county's Community Support Services. Other participants in the Community Support programs include St. Joseph's Medical Center in Yonkers and Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Sleepy Hollow. 
New York Presbyterian has always lost money providing social services to mentally ill patients in Westchester. Phelps, which also loses some money providing similar services, said it has absorbed the losses and views its participation in the program as a community service, said Mary Sernatinger, a hospital spokeswoman.
Dr. Schaffer is seeking another group to take over New York Presbyterian's contract, but it is uncertain whether the new contractor will hire the program's social workers. She said she has received several inquiries from other hospitals and nonprofit groups and is hopeful that she will find a new provider soon.
Studies have shown that support for mentally ill patients once they leave hospitals reduces relapses, homelessness and suicide rates.
Although New York Presbyterianhad a $2.2 million profit in 2001, the most recent figures available, like many other major hospitals in the region, it has been squeezed economically because of lower payments from Medicare and other government programs and low reimbursement rates from health-maintenance organizations and other managed companies, which pay hospitals 50 to 70 percent of the retail rate. 
"It's very hard for hospitals right now, particularly in psychiatric care," Dr. Wilner said. "There is not enough behavioral money out there. The hospital is trying to expand programs whose revenues and costs match more closely.
"We are committed to these patients," he added. "We are not abandoning them."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Garment District; 
Amid Offices and Factories, Space for Arts Groups

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
UNTIL about three years ago, all 25 floors of the 750,000-square-foot building at 520 Eighth Avenue, between West 36th and 37th Streets in the garment district, were filled with manufacturers, almost all of them involved in the garment trade. Since then, 500,000 square feet have been converted to offices and rented to such tenants as the Mason Tenders Welfare Fund, with 50,000 square feet; several real estate agencies; and a number of nonprofit organizations, including Chess in the Schools, a program that uses chess to teach learning skills to pupils from kindergarten through high school.
 But the most unusual tenant at 520 Eighth Avenue may be the Alliance of Resident Theaters, better known as A.R.T./New York. As a service and advocacy organization for more than 400 not-for-profit theaters and related arts groups, A.R.T./New York was familiar with the need of its constituents for office and space at affordable rents. Last May, it took action to meet that need when, with the promise of $3 million in city and foundation financing, it signed a 20-year lease for the entire third floors of 520 Eighth Avenue and the adjoining building at 261 West 36th Street. 
 Last August tenants began moving into the 32,000-square-foot space, in which passageways were made through the walls to join the spaces in the two buildings. There are now 24 tenants, all are connected with the arts and related organizations. They pay $21 a square foot annually to A.R.T./New York for their space, a dollar more than the alliance pays its landlord, Jeffrey R. Gural, chairman of Newmark & Company, the owner of the two buildings. 
If Virginia P. Louloudes, the alliance's executive director, had her way, those companies would not have to pay even that extra dollar. "We're just trying to break even, not make a profit," she said, adding that the additional dollar helps offset operational costs. 
Most of the financing to renovate the third floor was provided by the Bloomberg administration, which gave $1.5 million (honoring a pledge by the Giuliani administration). The City Council provided $1 million and the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, gave $250,000. City agencies also hope to give additional funds in future years so that A.R.T./New York can lease and renovate additional floors in the building, Ms. Louloudes said, but whether the hopes will reach fruition will depend on the economy.
OTHER donors included J. P. Morgan Chase, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Hyde and Watson Foundation and Bruce and Carol Mitchell. In addition, the LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust gave a $1.2 million recoverable grant, essentially an interest-free loan, to provide bridge financing while A.R.T./New York awaited funds from the city.
A number of people directly involved in the projects also made donations. Mr. Gural, the landlord, donated $250,000, and before A.R.T/New York took possession of the floor, he demolished what was there and put in new windows. In addition, according to Paul G. Wolf, a partner in DenhamWolf Real Estate Services, the company that found the space, negotiated the lease and oversaw the work, when A.R.T./New York made known its interest in renting the space, Mr. Gural agreed to hold it off the market until the alliance received the promised money from the city. 
Mr. Gural realized that the vicissitudes of fund-raising faced by nonprofit groups, in the theater and other areas, made the eventual success of the idea less than a sure thing. "I happen to like theater," he said, "but honestly I never thought the lease for the floor would get done, so I decided we'd renovate that floor for offices last." And if his pessimism turned out to be warranted, he recalled thinking, "we'd just get on with our lives." 
Martin Kapell, the architect for the interior renovation, donated his services -- a gift that Ms. Louloudes valued about $75,000. 
The renovation was complex and challenging for everyone involved, according to Jonathan Denham, another partner in DenhamWolf Real Estate Services. "It was essential from the beginning," he said, "that we centralize the process with the architect and the construction company." He added that Ms. Louloudes made it clear to tenants that A.R.T/New York's mission is to serve the community and the only way it could succeed was to maintain the same design criteria and decision-making schedule for all the subtenants. She also promised that tenants would receive proportionate shares of the construction dollars and equal access to the architectural team.
The offices on the third floor at 520 Eighth Avenue come in various sizes, ranging from a handful that are between 100 and 200 square feet; the most recent tenant is the People's Theater Company, with 100 square feet. About a half-dozen offices range from 1,300 to 2,500 square feet, and the biggest office is the 5,000-square-foot space occupied by the Arts Connection, a nonprofit arts-in-education program. 
During the previous 10 years, the Arts Connection occupied 3,000 square feet in the basement and first floor of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School for International Business (formerly the High School for the Performing Arts) on West 46th Street between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. When executives at the Arts Connection, which has a staff of 28, learned of A.R.T./New York's plans for 520 Eighth Avenue, they could not wait to move in. 
"We were in three separate offices in the school," said Steve Tennen, the Arts Connection's executive director. "So it was almost impossible to get everybody for meetings, and one of the spaces was near the boiler, so in summer we had to turn on the air-conditioning." 
The Arts Connection moved into its current offices last August, and even today, Mr. Tennen said, employees relish the increased space and light. 
THE floor at 520 Eighth Avenue also includes two rehearsal studios, as well as a room that can be used for meetings, conferences or rehearsals. 
While most offices are without frills except for those added by tenants, they are not cookie-cutter spaces. Indeed, before signing a lease, the SITI Company, an ensemble-based theater company, which has a rehearsal hall for actors, had its own architect, Mary O'Connor, create a model of a piece of the floor to demonstrate the soundproofing they would build into their floors to show that it could absorb the shock of the actors' stomping. Ms. Louloudes said that they took the model to Mr. Gural and his son, Eric, senior managing director of Newmark & Company, "and they were comfortable with it." 
This project is not the alliance's first venture in connecting arts groups with modestly priced space. Three years ago this month, A.R.T./New York bought a 19,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts building at 138 South Oxford Street in Brooklyn. Today, it is the home of 20 small companies that rent offices for $12 a square foot, A.R.T./New York supplies a subsidy of about $100,000 a year.

HEADLINE: Chinatown Journey: From Protesters To Developers 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
DOWN from the ramparts, fists unclenched, their protest signs long ago set aside, Asian Americans for Equality -- leaders among a cadre of community groups that brought thousands of demonstrators into the streets of Chinatown and to the steps of City Hall in the mid-1970's -- is now a major landlord and residential developer.
 Over the last 15 years, the organization has built or rehabilitated 43 buildings in Chinatown and on the Lower East Side, housing more than 500 low- to moderate-income families. It has renovated 36 one- to four-family homes for new buyers in Queens. Within six months, it expects to complete construction of three six-story buildings in Chinatown, providing 52 rental apartments for poor people. 
 Asian Americans for Equality says it has helped more than 1,500 immigrant families, not just from Asia, gain access to low-cost down payments and mortgages. And since last summer, it has served as the designated agency assisting thousands of Chinatown residents in applying for federal grants intended to stabilize housing occupancy in Lower Manhattan after the World Trade Center attacks. 
A far cry from the days when one scholar researching radical groups in the United States labeled some of the group's leaders as Maoist.
Christopher Kui, the executive director of Asian Americans for Equality since 1993, attests to its evolution from radical roots into a nuts-and-bolts builder that has not only cooperated with government housing programs but pioneered them in tandem with major banks and nonprofit housing syndicators.
"They've been willing to take risks with us on new program models," said Jerilyn Perine, the city's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, "and it has sometimes made their work much tougher because they went first."
"The fact that they've been willing to do that has been really helpful," Commissioner Perine said. "It goes beyond just the buildings."
It was a natural progression, said Mr. Kui (pronounced koy), from street protests against job discrimination in the construction industry and against police brutality to community organizing and local politics to counseling people living in squalid buildings and, eventually, to creating housing. Along the way there have been critics, particularly when the group ventured into politics.
Many Chinatown residents live in "horrible conditions," said Mr. Kui, in part -- but only in part -- because much of the community's housing stock dates to the 19th century and because its population density is the highest of any neighborhood in the city. "The density of Manhattan is 82 people per acre," he said. "For Chinatown, it's 189."
The group's housing work started, simply enough, with the notion of informing people of their rights. "In the early 80's, a lot of people came to us seeking housing assistance, complaining, for example, that they have no heat or hot water," Mr. Kui said. "They would ask, 'Can you help me apply for public housing?' And when they started applying, they were placed on waiting lists of 150,000 people."
"We visited their apartments and saw the conditions," Mr. Kui continued. "We decided we needed to build some affordable housing ourselves."
But it was a fire, on Jan. 21, 1985 -- sparked by a faulty electric heater in a building without heat or hot water at 54 Eldridge Street -- that immediately spurred Asian Americans for Equality into concrete housing work. "Two people were burned to death, and 125 people were displaced," Mr. Kui said. "We worked with the city to place people in shelters throughout the city, but a lot of folks wouldn't go because the shelters were in terrible condition, or they couldn't communicate and didn't want to leave Chinatown."
Initially, the organization planned to create a transitional shelter. But in the end, two vacant buildings held by the city for tax arrears, 176 and 180 Eldridge Street, two blocks from the fire site, would be renovated into a total of 60 apartments -- one building for low-income families, the other for homeless individuals and families.
It was at that time, as part of an overhaul of the nation's tax code, that Congress passed the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit -- providing a write-off of about 90 percent of the construction costs for investors willing to provide financing to develop housing for families with incomes 60 percent below the median income in a given metropolitan area.
Total renovation costs for what would be called Equality House -- the first Federal Low-Income Tax Credit project in New York City -- came to $5.2 million.
The Enterprise Foundation, a pioneer in creating housing for poor people throughout the country, assumed the role of syndicator on the project, bringing in Fannie Mae, the federally chartered mortgage purchase corporation, as the primary investor.
"Half of the funding came from the low-income tax credit," Mr. Kui said. "The other half was $1 million from the New York State Department of Social Services, the rest from the New York State Housing Trust Fund. And H.P.D. gave us the buildings for $1 each."
The senior vice president of the Enterprise Foundation, Bill Frey, called Equality House a breakthrough project. "It became the model that really has provided the initial way for us to do this around the city with 85 other nonprofits, creating about 13,000 units," he said.
Rents for a one-bedroom at Equality House when it opened in 1988 were between $329 and $356, and are currently $459 to $509; initial rents for two-bedrooms were $400 to $445, and are now $485 to $570. To be eligible for an apartment, if any were currently available, a family of four could have an income of no more than $37,000.
For 81-year-old Luk Ng and his wife, Choi Ngor Ng, 65, Equality House is a godsend. "Where I was before," said Mr. Ng, sitting in his kitchen, potted plants all about, "it was very bad, dangerous."
Danger accompanied Mr. Ng to this country. In 1943, he left Canton Province as a merchant seaman on an oil tanker. "During the Second World War," he said through an interpreter, "the German planes bombed the tanker, hit the rear. It was sinking and the British saved us, brought us to Alaska."
Soon after, "on another oil tanker," Mr. Ng continued, "I came to New Jersey -- I don't know where -- and jumped ship. I paid someone like $100 to drive me to Chinatown. There were daily raids by the immigration people; for some reason, I never got picked up." In 1959, Mr. Ng became a citizen. For decades, he worked as a waiter.
"We were living at 147 Elizabeth," Mr. Ng said, paying $200 a month for part of a one-bedroom apartment that shared a bathroom in the hallway with people living in the next apartment. "One of the reasons I was looking for something else was that the roofs were leaking, falling down, but the owner refused to fix it," he said. "No heat, hot water. My wife was very unhappy about those conditions."
Mr. Ng said he "heard about AAFE" (an acronym for Asian Americans for Equality that rhymes with taffy) "in a Chinese daily newspaper, that they were having a lottery for Equality House. Somehow I got selected; I guess I'm lucky."
Their one-bedroom apartment rented for $303 when the Ngs moved in in the late 80's; the rent is now $440. But with senior-citizen rental assistance, the Ngs pay only $220 a month. "I'm very happy here in my golden days," Mr. Ng said.
As a gateway to America, Chinatown has long harbored a stream of immigrants fleeing economic or political repression; many are poor, uneducated, unknowing of their new rights, forced into below-minimum-wage, 12-hour-a-day labor and resigned to living under code-scorning conditions.
Thousands are crammed into tenement buildings -- 10, 12 or more individuals, or several families, sharing a single apartment in which the rooms have been divided by plywood partitions and raw-board bunk beds. The single kitchen is used by all; and the only bathroom is in the hallway outside the apartment, for use by all the tenants on the floor. Rents are usually about $200 a month per person.
"There are bad landlords taking advantage of these very vulnerable, scared immigrants," Mr. Kui said. "Also, it's not uncommon that families renting a one- or two-bedroom apartment in a tenement building have to pay $7,000 to $10,000 in 'key money,' cash to the landlord, in order to just get an option to rent, because the competition for housing is so high in the community."
And so, often, families double or triple up. "These are unrelated families, a common occurrence," Mr. Kui said.
Muit San Sing, 71, his wife and adult daughter live on bunk beds behind plywood walls in a six-floor walk-up on Kenmare Street. They pay $260 a month -- their share of the total of $1,097 paid by four families for the four-room apartment (there is no living room). They have lived there since 1993.
The apartment's filth-encrusted walls are peeling in sheaths; roaches scurry.
MR. SING was a farmer in China, on "government-issued land," he said. For 10 years, he was an elevator operator in Chinatown. "I am old, can't work any more," he said. He went to AAFE for legal counseling after the landlord, citing overcrowding and the apartment's illegal partitions, began eviction proceedings.
Shellen Wu, a housing counselor with the group, said a settlement had been reached under which the Sings and one of the other families can stay. The organization is helping to relocate the two other families. Saying the landlord had agreed to fix up the apartment, Ms. Wu said, "We'll see."
With a broad grin, Mr. Sing said: "I think America is great, the best. Freedom! You can do everything. I have a Medicare card. In China, how would you get that?" 
Asked about his dire living conditions, he said: "I just need a place to live. It would be better if I could get government housing."
Chinatown -- with hard to define borders edging, here and there, into Little Italy and the Lower East Side -- has a population of approximately 85,000, of whom about 55,000 are Asian, according to AAFE's estimations.
In recent years, it has felt the squeeze of gentrification, with trendy bars and restaurants sprinkling among its Chinese-lettered dumpling shops, souvenir shops and groceries. And while most substandard housing in the community falls under rent regulation, increased demand for market-rate housing has sent unregulated prices soaring.
Arthur Strickler, the district manager of Community Board 2, said new buildings in Chinatown command rents at least four times higher than regulated apartments, with studios going for as much as $1,600 a month. According to Scott Durkin, chief operating officer of the Corcoran Group brokerage firm, the average price for a condominium in the area shot up about 28 percent in 2002 over 2001, with two-bedroom apartments selling for $700,000 to $900,000.
"Clever landlords," Mr. Strickler said, "empty out units, do expensive renovations and rent out at market rates."
Asian Americans for Equality has tried to relieve some of the squeeze. Two years ago, it constructed 48 condominiums in 12 town house buildings on what had been a vacant lot between 138 and 152 Suffolk Street. "We saw an opportunity to put together a homeownership project that is affordable to more moderate-income residents of the community," Mr. Kui said. Of the 48 apartments, eight are three-bedrooms that sold for $145,000 each, 40 are two-bedrooms that sold for between $119,000 and $129,000. 
"There are so many sons and daughters of immigrants who grew up in the community and want to stay," Mr. Kui said, "folks who are civil service, police, teachers, who want to keep their roots in the community."
Police Officer Pedro Velazquez, 40, wanted to plant roots in the community. A native of Puerto Rico and a member of the force since 1985 -- with a salary of about $50,000 -- Officer Velazquez had been paying rent of $600 a month in the Bronx.
He hates to say it, but he was tired of street fights, burglaries and car break-ins in his old neighborhood, particularly several incidents in which he had to flash his badge or give chase while on his way to or from the subway he used to ride to the Ninth Precinct on the Lower East Side. 
Officer Velazquez was online apartment searching when he came across AAFE's announcement of a lottery for apartments on Suffolk Street. "I think 2,000 people applied," he said. "I was No. 38."
Clapping his hands, Officer Velazquez said he paid $145,000 for the three-bedroom, two-bath duplex at Suffolk Houses. "There's a lot of need for places like this," he said. "You know how much an apartment like this would cost around here? -- $500,000!"
"Now I walk to work," he said -- not unlike many longer-term residents of Chinatown who live, work and shop in the neighborhood. That insularity, especially after the events of Sept. 11, has heightened the community's vulnerability.
There are two main industries in Chinatown -- garment manufacturing and tourist-related stores and restaurants. After the terrorist attacks, approximately 65 of the community's 300 garment factories shut down, eliminating jobs for about 5,000 people, mostly women. "That happened because Chinatown was caught behind a frozen zone," said Robert Weber, the group's director of policy, "meaning that the police limited traffic access and parking in Chinatown for months following the disaster. This had an immediate negative impact on the garment industry, which depends on being able to quickly turn around clothing orders."
With most of those workers living and shopping in the community, other businesses immediately felt the impact. Approximately 3,000 more jobs were eventually lost, Mr. Weber said. And as unemployment benefits began expiring last summer, he said, more and more residents could not meet their rent obligations.
"What makes the situation worse is that if this loss of jobs and loss of revenues by businesses occurred somewhere else in the city," he said, "you probably would see a drop in rents and real estate prices. But that has not happened here because of the pressures of gentrification. It's a big squeeze."
In June, Asian Americans for Equality, which, with governmental and corporate support, now has 62 full-time staff members, was chosen by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to administer the process by which Chinatown residents facing rent troubles can apply for federal grants intended to stabilize housing occupancy after Sept. 11. "The grants provide a much needed tourniquet to the hemorrhaging incomes of people who lost their jobs," Mr. Weber said.
Still, some controversy has surrounded the program, largely because the grants offer the most aid to those living closest to the Trade Center site. Families in Battery Park City and parts of TriBeCa, where the median household income is $125,000, are eligible for up to $14,500. Those in Chinatown, where the median income is a third of that in TriBeCa, can receive a maximum of $7,750.
The participation of Asian Americans for Equality in the grant program has resuscitated hints of the criticism it received in the early 1990's -- that it was losing touch with its roots and constituency -- particularly after it proposed redrawing the local City Council district away from the Lower East Side toward more affluent environs downtown.
"I think AAFE has aligned itself with business interests and political interests at the expense of Chinatown's residential and low-wage workers," said Margaret Fung, executive director of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. "They want to acquire properties or city-owned buildings so that they can be the developers, instead of some other group. They favor themselves."
Former City Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, now out of office because of term limits, was challenged by an AAFE official, Margaret Chin, in the 1990 election. Still, she said recently: "My attitude as a councilmember was that I wasn't going to cut them off because we were not friends. I never got complaints from people in their buildings. I think they've done good work for the community; it doesn't mean they didn't get their piece of the pie." 
THE housing efforts of Asian Americans for Equality continue -- not just in Chinatown.
In parts of Queens, including Flushing, Corona and College Point, the organization has purchased -- for about $40,000 each -- 36 one- to four-family private homes that had been seized by the city because of unpaid taxes. And, after providing homeownership counseling and access to low-cost mortgages and down-payment and closing-cost assistance, it has sold the homes to existing tenants -- often the former owners.
On Norfolk Street in Chinatown, AAFE is constructing three six-story buildings for poor people.
"The new project is called Norfolk Apartments II" said Mr. Kui. "It's 52 units on three separate sites along two blocks on Norfolk Street" -- one of them across from the already occupied 24-unit Norfolk I.
The new buildings, with total construction costs of $9.13 million -- "again, a combination of the New York State Housing Trust Fund and the Federal Low-income Housing Tax Credit, syndicated by the Enterprise Foundation," Mr. Kui said -- will provide rental apartments for low- and very-low-income residents. 
A low-income family of four, defined as earning no more than $37,680, will pay $715 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. A very-low-income family of four, earning no more than $31,400, will pay $600 for a two-bedroom. Construction should be completed in six months.
"We have received over 11,000 requests for applications for those 52 units," Mr. Kui said.

HEADLINE: HOME FRONT; 
From All Walks, Reeling From 9/11

BYLINE:  By Anthony DePalma 

 BODY:
THE crowded old streets of the Lower East Side have been a cultural mishmash for centuries, a landing place for people from all over the world who come to New York to find freedom and to find independence, but mostly to find jobs.
 Since 1893, untold numbers of needy people on the Lower East Side have looked to the Henry Street Settlement for help. The Settlement, and other social welfare organizations like it, have over time become employment agencies of next-to-last resort, just a step or two before the welfare office. 
 For most of the last few decades, say the people who run Henry Street, the typical person who came looking for a job was fairly easy to profile: he was a high school dropout with passable English who could work in a company mailroom or, if lucky, delivering packages for United Parcel Service. 
But no more.
"Since Sept. 11 we've been seeing people from both ends of the spectrum, either with no skills and no English, or highly trained people with degrees who work in high tech," said Christine A. Koenig, chief administrator of the Workforce Development Center at the Henry Street Settlement.
The extent to which the terror attack has disrupted life in New York was clear one recent morning when Rodolfo Padilla, Habte Selassie and Lei Ken Lee, along with about two dozen other jobless people, were at the organization's 1829 town house on East Broadway, one of several buildings the group owns. The three had little in common except that they had lost their jobs in December 2001. Mr. Padilla worked in the downtown document processing center of J.P. Morgan. Mr. Selassie was a sound engineer for WBAI radio, whose studios are downtown. Mrs. Lee, who has lived in Chinatown for 12 years, was a seamstress at a local garment factory.
When it seemed all good jobs had vanished, Mr. Padilla thought about going back to school for more training, even though he holds a bachelor's degree in communications. But he couldn't afford it. 
Then in December he attended an educational forum at which Judith Rubenstein, community liaison of the Henry Street Settlement's Emergency Employment Clearinghouse, described a range of post-9/11 assistance programs, including tuition aid.
Mr. Padilla, 38, said he was unaware that he was eligible for such aid, because he had not been directly affected by the attack. He was also surprised that even though he lives in Queens, he might qualify for the Emergency Mortgage and Rental Assistance program that is available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Ms. Rubenstein said the eligibility requirements for the program are rather broad. "You didn't have to have the towers come down on your head to be eligible for this," she said.
Manhattan residents who lost a job after Sept. 11 and can show they had trouble making rent or mortgage payments may qualify. But people who live in other boroughs and the suburbs who lost Manhattan jobs after the attack also may qualify for FEMA housing assistance if they can prove hardship. The deadline for applications is Jan. 31. The best way to register is to call, toll-free, (800) 462-9029.
While Mr. Padilla waits to see if he qualifies for assistance, he works part time as a bilingual employment counselor at Henry Street, where he helps others, including Mr. Selassie, find the help they need.
Mr. Selassie, 54, said he also hoped to get assistance for the rent on his Brooklyn apartment. And he is applying for advanced training on computers or other areas that take advantage of his experience.
"I'm wanting to do something I'm capable of doing as opposed to flipping burgers," he said.
Mrs. Lee, on the other hand, is willing to do any kind of steady work -- so long as she doesn't have to say much more than "hello" in English. Through a translator, Mrs. Lee said she went to the Henry Street Settlement seeking help to pay the tuition at a Chinese language school that provides training in computers and cooking. She said that at 50, she is too old to learn computers but that she thinks she would like being a sushi chef.
Seated at the table in the Henry Street Settlement's ornate first floor, with its carved ceiling and marble mantle from long ago, Mrs. Lee said work transforms her life. It is a process that affirms the Henry Street Settlement's mission to help the needy help themselves.
"I felt very lost when I couldn't find a job," said Mrs. Lee, a poor woman sitting in what once was a rich man's parlor. "But today I feel very confident."

Tax Plan Throws a Bone to the 'Dogs of the Dow'

BYLINE:  By RICHARD TEITELBAUM 

 BODY:
TAX-FREE stock dividends? Sure, Wall Street likes the idea, but the prospect has one breed of stock pickers virtually yelping for joy. 
 That group, the followers of the "Dogs of the Dow" strategy, stands to reap handsomely if the Bush administration's proposal to eliminate taxes on most dividend income becomes law. That is because the strategy leads investors to high-yielding stocks: payouts would be worth more if they escaped the government's tithe, and the dividend-paying shares themselves would likely receive a boost if investors flocked to them. 
 "We have here a possible change in taxes that will lead to a sea change in investor thinking," said Francis D. Gannon, manager of the SunAmerica Focused Dividend Strategy Portfolio, which uses the strategy to pick about one-third of its holdings. "I think there's an enormous opportunity." 
Popularized by Michael B. O'Higgins in "Beating the Dow" (HarperBusiness, 1991), the strategy in its classic form calls for buying the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, called Dogs, because their prices tend to be beaten down. The shares are bought in equal dollar amounts on Jan. 1 and held through year-end. Then the process repeats, with the investor rebalancing the portfolio among an updated roster of the 10 top-yielding Dow stocks. The strategy was the rage for much of the 1990's, but fell out of favor in the technology bubble as investors flocked to growth stocks that paid no dividends, and has yet to regain its popularity.
Dogsofthedow.com, a Web site that tracks the strategy, identifies the Dogs this year as Philip Morris, J. P. Morgan Chase, General Motors, Eastman Kodak, SBC Communications, DuPont, Honeywell International, General Electric, Caterpillar and AT&T. They were yielding an average of 4.20 percent on Dec. 31, versus 2.47 percent for the Dow industrials. (There are different ways to calculate yield, so the roster may vary.)
Whatever the impact of rescinding the dividend tax on the overall market, some portfolio managers say the move would prompt a substantially bigger gain in the Dogs. Christopher N. Orndorff, a managing principal at Payden & Rygel, a money management firm, estimated that even a 50 percent reduction in the tax would send the Dogs up 10 to 15 percent in just a few months and 20 percent or more over 12 months. "This thing has happened rather quickly," Mr. Orndorff said of the proposed dividend tax elimination. "I don't think they have fully priced it in yet."
Of course, he added, other factors could quickly reduce potential gains. "If we have a fall-off in corporate earnings, the dividend tax cut won't matter much at all," said Mr. Orndorff, who uses the Dogs strategy in helping to manage the Payden Growth and Income fund. 
Still, proponents contend that the Dog stocks are benefiting from a variety of factors and are a good bet regardless of the final disposition of the dividend tax. Given that 10-year Treasury notes yield just 4 percent or so, investors have the luxury of earning bond market yields on their stock holdings even without a tax advantage, said Neil J. Hennessy, president of the Hennessy Funds, which runs two small portfolios, Balanced and Total Return, that use the strategy. That kind of yield parity, he said, does not occur often.
Mr. Hennessy said the Dogs could lead the market based on their own merits. "Investor confidence is growing with these companies, since they have the money to pay their dividends," he said. "They've taken their write-offs, they've laid off people, they're lean now, and earnings are going to surprise people over the next 12 to 18 months."
High-yielding stocks are likely to become more popular, he added, as baby boomers enter retirement and begin searching for income-producing investments.
The strategy generally outperforms down markets or those that tilt toward value stocks, because it directs investors to some of the most downtrodden stocks in the index. So Charles B. Carlson, chief executive of Horizon Investment Services, a money management firm in Hammond, Ind., said it would be unlikely to win in a rollicking growth market. 
The Dogs have indeed been on a run, at least when compared with the broader market. According to dogsofthedow.com, the Dogs beat the Dow average in each of the last three years. In 2000, the Dogs returned 6.4 percent, versus a loss of 4.7 percent for the index. In 2001, the Dogs lost 4.9 percent, still better than the 5.4 percent loss for the benchmark. And last year, the Dogs were down 8.9 percent, versus a decline of 15 percent for the index. 
(For the 10-year period ended Dec. 31, the Dogs underperformed, returning 12.8 percent, annualized, versus 13.3 percent for the broader index.)
The Dogs of the Dow is not the only stock-picking strategy that could benefit from the elimination of the dividend tax. Mr. Gannon said investors could seek out companies that currently do not pay dividends but may change their policies; such shifts would likely cause those stocks to climb. Characteristics to look for are generous cash flows, large amounts of cash on the balance sheet and low debt. Mr. Gannon cites Microsoft (the only stock in the Dow industrials not to pay a dividend), Cisco Systems and Dell Computer as three likely candidates. Last year, Cisco shareholders rejected a proposal to institute a dividend.
Playing the Dogs requires making some choices. Diversification requirements prohibit mutual funds from investing more than 5 percent of their total assets in a single stock, so funds that use the strategy generally marry it to another investing discipline. Some unit investment trusts -- fixed, unmanaged pools of securities with a set life span -- are pure plays on the Dogs and are sold by many brokerage firms. Even with loads and expenses, these can be cheaper for many investors than buying individual stocks. 
Mr. O'Higgins, meanwhile, who runs a money management firm in Miami Beach, said he still believed the Dogs strategy would beat the Dow index over the long term. But he has turned bearish with a vengeance, and his firm now holds gold and Treasury securities and is short the Dow, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq 100.
Despite the bursting of the technology bubble and the subsequent bear market, Mr. O'Higgins said he believed investors were still wildly overoptimistic. "People haven't sold, mutual fund managers haven't raised cash, and the brokerage firms haven't reduced their equity allocations," he said. "It was the greatest mania of all time and will be followed by the greatest depression of all time."

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
A Poor Woman's Work Is Never Fun

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
THERE are many tempting reasons to pick up "Global Woman: Nannies, Maids and Sex Workers in the New Economy" (Metropolitan Books, $26) besides the obvious ones in the subtitle.
 The editors are Barbara Ehrenreich, who wrote "Nickel and Dimed," the extraordinary look at minimum-wage life in America, and Arlie Russell Hochschild, whose best-selling book on housework, "The Second Shift," added a new phrase to the feminist vocabulary. The contributors include Susan Cheever, the author of several moving memoirs including "Home Before Dark," and Bridget Anderson, a labor activist and the author of "Doing the Dirty Work? The Global Politics of Domestic Labor." 
 Some of the issues the book promises to tackle -- child care, housework, tending to an aging population at a time of declining birth rates --are central to lives of working women. The overarching theme, the causes and consequences of a gender tilt in global migration patterns, is important and provocative. And some problems discussed, like sexual slavery in Thailand, are violations of human dignity that cry out for global redress. 
It is disappointing, then, to find that such a worthy effort has been so badly disfigured by anger, polemics, sloppy logic and paper-thin research stretched well beyond its tensile strength.
A few of the essays must be immediately exempted from that assessment. Although he deals with a horror that has been widely described elsewhere, Kevin Bales, a sociology professor at the University of Surrey Roehampton in London, provides a stirring, solid picture of the economic forces and personal catastrophes that constitute the prostitution industry in Thailand. And Hung Cam Thai, who is earning his Ph.D. in sociology at the University of California at Berkeley, blends sturdy demographic evidence and sensitive interviews to produce a thoughtful look at the marriage and migration patterns among Vietnamese living outside their native country. 
Elsewhere in the volume, however, one finds cosmic generalizations based on "evidence" that even a sympathetic reader finds unconvincing. A cardinal rule of social research is that the plural of anecdote is not "data." But without anecdote -- no doubt carefully collected, but nevertheless glaringly limited to the personal circumstances described -- this volume would offer almost no original data. 
The personal anecdotes that spill off every page of "Global Woman" are heartbreaking, infuriating, dramatic and occasionally hilarious. Some could provide years' worth of fodder for the writers of thrillers, soap operas and sitcoms.
For example, Denise Brennan, assistant anthropology professor at Georgetown University, examines the impact of "sex tourism" on the lives of young women in the Dominican Republic. What do we learn? That prostitution is a very poor way of finding a good husband. We learn this largely by following the adventures of Carmen, Elena and Nanci, who coach one another in love-letter techniques, ply the local fax machine in their efforts to turn previous customers into future spouses and dream of getting visas that will lift them off their home island into a life of secure married luxury in Europe.
"The exits from poverty are rarely as permanent as the sex workers hope; relationships sour, and subsequently, an extended family's only lifeline from poverty disintegrates," Ms. Brennan concludes. "For every promise of marriage a tourist keeps, there are many more stories of disappointment." Then she writes, "Dominican women's attempts to take advantage of these 'walking visas' call attention, however, to the savviness and resourcefulness of the so-called powerless."
In another essay that examines the impact of female migration from Sri Lanka on the lives of the men left at home, Michele Gamburd, assistant anthropology professor at Portland State University in Oregon, offers us another trio of individuals who are, well, highly individual. One man whose wife works abroad as a domestic servant drinks up most of her repatriated profits, ostensibly because he feels emasculated by his wife's breadwinner role but possibly because the wife and the ambient society tolerate rampant alcohol abuse. Another man was more dutiful; while his wife worked for a family in Qatar, he worked as a security guard at a local hotel. Together, over a dozen years, they raised their family's standard of living.
But for child care and housekeeping help, they relied heavily on a whimsical, witty uncle named Lal, who "was the source of some astonishment and amusement in the village," Ms. Gamburd tells us. "When villagers mocked his feminine behavior, Lal regaled them with humorous stories about his finicky taste in groceries; those who attempted to laugh at him found themselves instead laughing with him." Watch for the movie at a theater near you, with Robin Williams in the starring role.
But fascinating as these personal anecdotes are, they do not persuasively support the book's organizing thesis, outlined with blast-furnace ferocity in the introduction. That thesis is that first-world lifestyles "are made possible by a global transfer of the services associated with a wife's traditional role -- child care, homemaking and sex -- from poor countries to rich ones."
"To generalize and perhaps oversimplify: in an earlier phase of imperialism, northern countries extracted natural resources and agricultural products -- rubber, metals and sugar, for example -- from lands they conquered and colonized," the authors continue. "Today, while still relying on third-world countries for agricultural and industrial labor, the wealthy countries also seek to extract something harder to measure and quantify, something that can look very much like love."
Well, there's no "perhaps" about the oversimplification, at least.
Somehow, though never convincingly explained, the process of globalization and the emergence of a new economy are supposed to be responsible for this transfer of tender loving care from poor countries to rich. But explicitly or by suggestion, most essays actually place the blame for the problems of the world's women elsewhere: on the arrogance, sexual appetites and general laziness of the world's men. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Ms. Ehrenreich's contribution, an essay called "Maid to Order."
HER hostility toward women who hire other women to clean their homes is rooted in her membership in what she calls the "post-Friedan cohort" of feminists. "When we talked about housework, we were really talking, yet again, about power," she recalls. "To make a mess that another person will have to deal with -- the dropped socks, the toothpaste sprayed on the bathroom mirror, the dirty dishes left from a late-night snack -- is to exert domination in one of its more silent and intimate forms." When women lost the battle to have men share equally in the work of sustaining a home, she asserts, this "microdefeat of feminism in the household opened a new door for women, only this time it was the servants' entrance."
Unfortunately, much of this angry blame game ignores complexities that surround the need for and the supply of domestic labor. Also largely ignored is the long history of labor migration and the role of domestic service in social mobility. The whole effort needs more of the subtlety and compassion found in Ms. Cheever's essay, "The Nanny Dilemma."
Nannies who leave their families and native countries to go to work, and the women who hire them to care for their own children, are acting on the same impulse, Ms. Cheever observes. "They have chosen to give their children less mothering so that they can make more money, and so have we." That sort of reasoning could prompt constructive conversations about the cost of these personal decisions for families and societies; too often, the other essays seem capable of provoking only strident arguments and futile finger-pointing.
Women work, and they have always worked. Society and public policy could address the consequences of that reality, but the possibilities are barely mentioned. And for all the professed feminism scattered throughout, the assumption underlying much of this argumentation seems to be that the world would be a better place if women would simply stay home and care for their own children, do their own housework and tend to their own aging parents without relying on less fortunate women to help.
Even if one amends that to include enlightened men in the domestic do-it-yourself team, one nevertheless walks away from this book muttering, "Right -- one more thing for working women to feel guilty about." Forget about "having it all." Now we're supposed to do it all, too -- with a working husband's help, if possible, but if not, alone.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for PETER HAKIM; 
How Free Trade Will Alter a Hemisphere

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

 BODY:
 LAST week, the Bush administration opened negotiations to create a free-trade agreement similar to Nafta with five Central American countries, a large step in the administration's plans for a free-trade zone throughout the Western Hemisphere. An agreement with those countries -- El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua -- could be completed within a year and cause a rush of American investment to Central America, which only a few years ago was still reeling from effects of protracted civil wars. Peter Hakim, the president of Inter-American Dialogue, a research group in Washington, spoke last Thursday about an agreement's effects. ELIZABETH BECKER

Q. Who would the winners be under such an agreement?

A. There are two sorts of winners. The first are investors who see new opportunities in Central America: Intel putting a factory in Costa Rica, for example. It opens up a whole new perspective for investors. They these countries seem to have a greater stability, a secure access to the United States, so U.S. companies looking to locate abroad, looking for the advantages of lower-cost labor, looking for a variety of other opportunities like being close to suppliers of raw materials, will benefit a good deal.
 The second sort of winners are people who import the products that Central America produces. Central America exports a lot of textiles. The apparel industry in the United States could benefit a great deal.

Q. Just last month, the United States reached a free-trade accord with Chile. Why the expansion to Central America now?

A. The U.S. made a commitment to Chile back in 1994 at the Miami summit where the United States and 32 Latin American countries pledged to create a free-trade area larger than Nafta by 2006 . The Chileans say the promise goes back to 1990. It was very hard to move on any other country before making good on that promise. Indeed, it would have been hard to move without Congress giving trade promotion authority last summer . Once negotiations began with Chile, it opened up the process for others.

Q. Why is the administration negotiating with the Central American countries before negotiating with Brazil, which dominates Latin American trade?

A. In some ways, we already have a longstanding trade relationship with Central America. We had a whole set of trade preferences -- the Caribbean Basin Initiative -- approved back in 1985 and 1986 to help those countries involved in those horrible wars.
When Mexico got Nafta, suddenly the preferences under the Caribbean Basin Initiative were worth less. It was followed by what was called Nafta parity so the Central American countries wouldn't fall behind. Around 1998 it passed as part of the African Trade Act.
The other reason is there are countries very well prepared to move forward, particularly El Salvador and Costa Rica. The fact is, these countries are really tied to the United States, economically, demographically. If one really wanted to talk about a North American Free Trade Agreement, in terms of flows of investment, people, trade, these countries look an awful lot like Mexico.

Q. Are trade-agreement critics justified in saying such agreements -- Nafta, for example -- have caused a net drain in American jobs?

A. When you look at the numbers, the numbers are just so small -- the impact of a Nafta on the U.S. economy compared to technological changes, or the value of the U.S. dollar. Mexico's economy is about the size of Florida's. The impact that Mexico can have on the U.S. is very small. Now there are certain regions and factories that were impacted. The countries of Central America would have an even smaller impact. Finally, U.S. companies are always looking for countries to invest in with lower wages, cost of living. If it wasn't Mexico, it would be China. It's hard to avoid the fact.

Q. Will a free-trade agreement hurt Central America in some ways?

A. Almost certainly, you'll have people moving out of less profitable into more profitable areas. I hope the governments will supply some kind of retraining and a safety net for those who are affected. If they don't, that's tragic. There's no question small farmers will be forced off the land. Mexico should have been preparing for this and they haven't, and that's wrong. Maybe the best way to break that cycle of poverty is that they do move off the land. There should have been more measures built into Nafta to cushion those impacts -- enormous and unhappy effects for families and communities. But over all, countries that have opened up to trade have done better.

HEADLINE: Mighty S.U.V.'s Don't Hog This Show 

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
BEYOND "what if?" dream cars with 1,000 horsepower and silk carpets like the Cadillac Sixteen, the North American International Auto Show serves as a launching pad for vehicles more firmly anchored in reality that will soon show up in dealer showrooms. And this year, there was a hole in the 2004 lineup large enough to drive a hulking S.U.V. through.
 Indeed, after several years in which big truck-based utility vehicles cast their shadows over the Detroit show, new versions were conspicuously absent. 
 It is not that Americans aren't buying trucks. Light trucks, which include pickups, minivans and S.U.V.'s, accounted for 52 percent of the vehicle sales last year, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, which tracks auto sales. Yet the Big 3 automakers are turning some attention back to cars, a market they had largely ceded to foreign competitors, and to car-truck combos that have come to be called crossovers. 
While automakers showed several new utility wagons, they tended to be gentler and less massive. Absent were the brute utes with truck frames. Even two fashionably late arrivals to the S.U.V. party -- the Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg (pronounced TOUR-egg) -- used carlike unibodies.
Still, carmakers offered new temptations to feed America's love affair with pickups, and showed minivans stylishly redesigned to allay reservations about driving them.
Despite a sluggish economy, three European companies are aiming cars at the very wealthy. Bentley introduced its sleek Continental GT coupe, with all-wheel drive and a 500-horsepower engine. It goes on sale in November for about $160,000. For around $350,000, Mercedes-Benz will offer the 543-horsepower Maybach 62 ultraluxury sedan in late spring. Rolls-Royce showed the Phantom, the first car developed under the direction of its new owner, BMW.
Here is a look at some of the production vehicles that will go on sale this year; not all have been priced:

ACURA TSX -- This new sport sedan fills the price gap between the RSX coupe and the TL midsize sedan. It will have front-wheel drive and a choice of six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmissions when it goes on sale in April for $25,000 to $30,000.

CADILLAC SRX -- This luxury utility vehicle arrives midyear with crisp lines borrowed from the CTS sedan. It will come with either V-6 or V-8 engines and optional third-row seats.

CHEVROLET COLORADO -- This midsize pickup is bigger than the S-10 that it replaces. It will be available with either two- or four-wheel drive and three cab styles when it comes to market in the fall along with its sibling, the GMC Canyon.

CHEVROLET MALIBU -- A new version of the midsize sedan arrives in September with either a 140-horsepower four-cylinder or 200-horsepower V-6.

FORD F-150 -- The pickup goes on sale this summer with a revised but familiar look, stronger body and new suspension. Five grades of interior trim will be offered.

LEXUS RX 330 -- The successor to the RX 300 goes on sale in the spring with follow-the-road headlamps. Prices will start around $35,000.

MAZDA RX-8 -- This four-seat sports car with a rotary engine goes on sale in June, starting at $25,180.

MITSUBISHI ENDEAVOR -- Despite its aggressive, trucklike styling, this midsize utility vehicle is car-based. Prices range from $25,597 to $33,497.

NISSAN MAXIMA -- The model arriving in March moves upscale, with more room, more power and a glass-paneled roof. An Elite package includes a large center console and two rear bucket seats in place of the bench.

NISSAN QUEST -- The distinctively styled new Quest becomes the longest and widest minivan on the market. The second- and third-row seats fold flat, and there are four glass panels above rear passengers. The van goes on sale this summer.

NISSAN TITAN -- Nissan's first full-size pickup arrives in December with a 300-horsepower V-8 and 9,400-pound towing capacity.

TOYOTA SIENNA -- This redesigned minivan gets a sharper look, a thoughtful interior, including a split third row that folds into the floor, and optional all-wheel drive. It goes on sale in March, with the front-wheel- drive model starting at $23,000.

HEADLINE: Vulnerable Software 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Experts See Vulnerability as Outsiders Code Software" (Business Day, Jan. 6) highlighted potential pitfalls that software engineers have been aware of for quite some time. 
Although as a programmer I recognize that software is susceptible to sabotage, as an American I condemn your article's xenophobic undertone. 
 After all, the recent epidemic of corporate malfeasance has made it all too obvious that loyal Americans are quite capable of wreaking havoc on our nation's economy and undermining our financial security. 
The way to protect our software is not to pull up America's drawbridge. It is to institute sound programming practices and to exercise stronger oversight. Of course, these safeguards could prove expensive. Pointing fingers at foreigners would seem to be so much cheaper, but in the long run it could cost our country dearly.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Jay R. Sekelsky; 
Mosaic Investors Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
MANY portfolio managers estimate how much money they might gain if a particular stock purchase goes well, but Jay R. Sekelsky, who runs the $100 million Mosaic Investors fund, also projects how much he might lose.
 As a rule of thumb, he won't buy a stock unless he believes that its ratio of potential profit to loss over the next 12 to 18 months is at least three to one. That means that even if he thinks a stock is likely to climb 30 percent, he won't buy if he thinks there is also a reasonable risk of losing more than 10 percent of his investment. "Our mantra is 'participate and protect,' " he said from his office in Madison, Wis. "We want to participate fully in rising markets and protect against down markets." 
The fund lost 1.5 percent a year, on average, through Thursday, over the last three years, placing in the top 4 percent of all large blend funds, which own a mix of growth and value stocks. The blend-fund group lost 11.6 percent a year, on average, during that time, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.5 percent, annualized, according to Morningstar Inc.
The fund declined 14.6 percent over the last 12 months, versus losses of 18.9 percent for its group and 18.4 percent for the S.& P. 500.
Mr. Sekelsky, 43, is a managing director of Madison Mosaic L.L.P., the fund's adviser and a subsidiary of Madison Investment Advisors, which manages about $7 billion for institutions and individuals. The name "Mosaic," he said, reflects both Madison's acquisition of two small fund groups in 1996, creating a combined family, and its melding of investment ideas.
He picks the fund's 20 to 35 stocks mostly among high-quality American growth companies with market capitalizations of more than $5 billion. He looks for companies with consistently growing earnings that trade at reasonable valuations but also keeps a sharp eye on risk. "Instead of growth at a reasonable price," he said of his strategy, "we call it growth at a reasonable risk."
His computer screens sift through about 1,000 companies in search of those with good risk profiles. They look for companies with double-digit annualized earnings growth, both in the last five years and projected over the next two years, and a ranking in the top one-fourth of all stocks in predictability of long-term earnings, based on Value Line estimates.
Because strong balance sheets reduce risk, he also prefers companies with returns on equity of at least 15 percent a year, ratios of debt to total capitalization of no more than 40 percent and improving profit margins over the last three years.
He also wants strong free cash flow, which he defines as cash generated by operations minus dividends and capital spending. He buys stocks at the lower end of their historical ratios of price to free cash flow.
Since 1989, Mr. Sekelsky has bought and sold shares of Freddie Mac, the mortgage loan buyer. Freddie Mac is smaller than its cousin, Fannie Mae, and has more growth potential, said Mr. Sekelsky, who decides how much of the stock to own depending on his assessment of consumer credit risk. Over all, he expects growth in earnings per share to average 13 percent a year over the next three to five years.
He paid $5.59 a share, on average, adjusted for splits, for the position. The shares now trade at $63.20, compared with his 12- to 18-month target price in the mid $80's. 
In August, he bought shares of Mohawk Industries, a Calhoun, Ga., maker of residential and commercial flooring products. "It's got a terrific economic backdrop because housing has been a key part of the economy for the last couple of years," he said. "They've been able to gain market share and improve their profit margins over the last five years, and we think that trend will continue."
The biggest risk, he said, would be a sharp falloff in the housing market, but he calls that "remote."
He paid $48.75 for the shares. They closed on Friday at $57.33; his target price is in the mid-$70's.
MR. SEKELSKY expects Costco Wholesale, which operates membership warehouses, to have earnings growth averaging 14 percent a year over the next three to five years. The company, is generating significant free cash flow, he said, and management is using it to expand geographically. The company's same-store sales -- for stores open at least a year -- are also growing. "While consumer spending will be less robust than it was in the late 1990's," he said, "it will be stronger than it's been during the last 12 months."
He took a small position in the stock in November and has since added to his holdings. He paid $30 a share, on average, for the position, and says he will buy more if the price falls. The shares now trade at $30.58, compared with his target price in the mid-$40's.

HEADLINE: Colorado's Fiscal Sense 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Searching for ways to smooth the effects of the economic downturn without raising taxes on working families is the No. 1 job for governors in these challenging times. 
Sadly, Daniel Gross views our efforts in Colorado to achieve this common-sense goal as a negative ("Holding Republican Governors' Feats to the Fire," Week in Review, Jan. 5). 
 By moving the scheduled state pay date up by one day, we can reduce our deficit by $134 million. 
In addition to these savings, my administration has put in place an additional $566 million in cuts. The "gimmicks" that Mr. Gross refers to represent just 19 percent of our budget-balancing efforts.
I'm proud of the top grade that I earned from the Cato Institute for fiscal policy. By balancing Colorado's budget through savings measures and without raising taxes, I'm confident that pro-taxpayer groups will again applaud Colorado's sound fiscal policy.

THE TEA ROSE
By Jennifer Donnelly
Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press
($24.95, hardcover)
 As the hansom cab nosed its way up Tenth Avenue, Fiona and Seamie took in the vast freight yards and factories that lined it and the frenetic activity that attended them. Teams of horses drew huge rolls of paper to printers' shops or bales of cotton and wool to textile mills. 
Men lowered newly woven carpets, crates of twine, china cabinets and pianos from factory loopholes to delivery wagons. They heard them shouting orders to one another in brash American voices. They saw laundries billowing steam into the crisp air, glimpsed red-faced women inside their open doors twisting water out of sheets. They smelled coffee roasting, biscuits baking and less savory odors from soap factories and slaughterhouses.
 New York, Fiona sensed, was nothing like London. It was young, an upstart.A new city whose every street and building spoke of speed and modernity.

DAKOTA GRAND
By Kenji Jasper
Harlem Moon/Broadway Books
($12.95, paperback)
 I'd started out in the game just like everyone else. I'd gotten tired of being the piranha writer in Atlanta's little goldfish pond. So I stacked some loot, packed all that I could carry, and left the rest at the curb in front of my newly vacant efficiency on Cascade Road. Then I raced to catch a student discount flight to La Guardia Airport in Queens, where no one was waiting to greet me.
 I carried two heavy gym bags and a backpack on a crowded M30 bus to Manhattan and saw how the project buildings along the East River seemed almost as tall as the 'scrapers in midtown. The voices around me were loud and abrasive. The black and brown babies in strollers and carriers flailed their arms and legs in struggle, as if they wanted to escape. Everything seemed to be covered in soot.
 But the immediate present didn't matter. I had it all figured out. I gave myself the pen name Dakota Grand and had a portfolio full of clips that vouched for that writer's existence. When you gave yourself a pen name it was like you got to be someone entirely different. It was so easy to understand why rappers did the same thing.

A WELL-KNOWN SECRET
By Jim Fusilli
Putnam
($23.95, hardcover)
 Puerto Ricans had long been the biggest group among the Latin Americans and Caribbeans in the neighborhood, which sprang up after the first world war. 
 When Castro ousted Batista in 1959, Cubans who fled north beyond Miami settled in Union City, a few miles across the Hudson in New Jersey. Today, there were more Cubans in Union City than in Miami or Havana. The city, which intrepid Cubans saved from commercial and social collapse, was their political, economic and cultural base in the U.S.
 But Danny Villa kept his storefront office not in Union City but at 89th and Third, amid the soiled awnings on aluminum skeletons above a nail salon; a locksmith, a one-stop, all-purpose medical center that offered chiropractics, weight loss and footcare; and, not surprisingly, an awning manufacturer. As the obligatory talking head when anything involving Cuba found space in New York Media, Villa needed to be but a brief limo ride to the TV news bureaus in midtown or on the other side of the river in Fort Lee. During the Elian Gonzalez flap, he broke nationwide: Villa was everywhere. I think he might've made his way to "Larry King Live." 
 Seemingly reasonable, always gracious and well trained to issue sound bites rather than ideas, he had made his way into the press-politics cycle, where a kind of twisted synergy reigned. An appearance on TV, in The Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post led to an invitation to address some politically active group, be it a small civic association or guests at a retreat sponsored by a Fortune 100 firm, which led to media coverage. What changed as the cycle spun was the amount a man like Villa could charge per speech.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK OBSERVED; 
Reading, From Branch to Branch

BYLINE:  By MEG WOLITZER; Meg Wolitzer is a novelist whose new book, "The Wife," will be published by Scribner in April.

 BODY:
THE suburban library of my childhood, with its glass atrium, pristine bathrooms, deep easy chairs and smorgasbord of new fiction, spoiled me forever. This, I thought, is what all libraries are like. College did nothing to dispel this notion. I loved the library at Brown University as much as I'd loved the one in Syosset. 
 Those buildings were oases, elegant, cathedral-like spaces where you could sit for hours and hours. You could go to the bathroom and find a fresh roll of toilet paper in the dispenser, and you could go scavenging for the latest novel by Toni Morrison or Robert Stone, and it would actually be there, waiting for you to come and claim it. I loved libraries fiercely. They were gratifying, inviting, intellectual, clean: everything that the rest of the world all too often was not. 
Then, in 1981, I came to New York City. In my first week here, I figured out my new beat: the Gristede's with the wide aisles and good produce, the nicest dry cleaner, the Sichuan takeout with the best kung-pao chicken and, of course, the library. 
 My local branch was called the Webster, a formerly beautiful scuffed old stone building on York Avenue. Once, Yorkville had been a trove of Wiener schnitzel, Sacher tortes and lederhosen, but now most of the German establishments were gone, and the area had less of an identity. Mostly, it was considered out of the way, and this was true of the Webster library, which struck me as an anonymous, inconveniently located place, ignored and unloved except by the same faithful flock who returned again and again.
 Soon I became one of them. This was my new library, after all, my place. These were my people! I needed to make myself at home here. But the Webster, like many branch libraries in the 1980's, felt grungy and sleepy, with the occasional man or woman nodding out over a table. Although my feet never crunched over any vials on the linoleum there, I was certain that some of the library's users were, in fact, users. 
 Still, I went there, again and again. I just wanted to read, and I didn't have the money to buy books often. Day after day I returned to this scraggly building, and day after day I searched for particular books that had been recommended by friends, though I rarely found them.
 The collections on the shelves of many of the branches were, and still are, dismal and incomplete. The only Dickens in stock might be "Martin Chuzzlewit." Maybe, once upon a time, Raymond Carver's minimalist stories had graced those shelves, but if so, no one in charge seemed to know what had become of them. There was thievery to blame, and misshelving and a Bermuda Triangle factor, too. 
 The New York public libraries weren't yet computerized and, as a result, browsing had a real catch-as-catch-can quality. You never knew what you would find there. Occasionally there might be a coveted gem in the new fiction section -- something that you were dying to read -- or an obscure but terrific biography propped up on the shelving cart, and it was such a book that would make me return, armed with a kind of optimism that would almost invariably be dashed. The sleeping people at the tables stretched out more fully and territorially, lounging across entire surfaces meant for splayed-open books and periodicals on their long wooden rods. 
 But still I kept coming. I had a library card, after all, and it entitled me to be there. I felt indignant about the situation. I was determined not to be driven out, even though the quantifiable pleasures of my branch library were hard to come by. Occasionally I would show up and find that the building had suddenly closed for the day, due to a leak or a staffing crisis. The hours were slashed because of budget cuts (and hours are under the gun again, in Mayor Bloomberg's new budget). 
 My images of suburban, bibliophilic splendor were rapidly fading into some sort of fever dream. Had there really been a wonderful, freezing-cold water fountain back in the building in Syosset? Had the children's librarian there, Mrs. Fluckiger, really once called out to me, when I entered, "Hello there, Meg, I put aside a Madeleine L'Engle I thought you might like!"? Had the shelves really been larded with interesting new books and beloved classics, all of them in shockingly good condition, the pages crisp, the covers shining with plastic? (On a sofa, plastic always looks tacky, but on a book, it adds a new dimension of allure.) Or had I possibly made all of this up? 
 The story of the branch libraries in New York is, of course, the story of the city itself. As the economy rises and dips, so do the services offered at the branches, the stepchildren to the more powerful, central lending libraries like the Donnell and the Mid-Manhattan.
 Eventually, the Giuliani years brought in an era of cleaner, more orderly libraries. (No squeegee men would be allowed to wipe the plastic covers of books that people were reading, I decided.) Soon, almost no one slept at the reading tables. They weren't allowed. Once, while sitting in one of the branch libraries drifting off over a copy of The New Republic, I felt the stern hand of a guard on the back of my neck, shaking me awake. I felt ashamed and annoyed; wasn't the point of libraries that they were places in which to read, borrow, think and (figuratively or literally) dream?
 But you can't have it both ways. A city with stricter laws is by nature a city with less imagination. Slowly, almost invisibly, the branch libraries -- there are 85 these days -- became cleaner and more appealing, and I wanted to try different ones. I loved the sounds of their names: Aguilar; Countee Cullen; Muhlenberg; Kips Bay; Hamilton Fish Park; and, most inspiring of all, Epiphany. The Jefferson Market library in the Village became a favorite, notable for its castle-like exterior, deep, cool rooms and excellent video collection. 
 After I gave birth to my first son, Gabriel, I spent a lot of time in the upstairs children's rooms of the 67th Street branch and the Yorkville branch, both of which had extensive juvenile collections and helpful librarians. I brought Gabriel to afternoon story times and movie times, where we sat with other parents and baby sitters and toddlers in a clammy basement room and watched a sweet if somnolent version of "Harold and the Purple Crayon," or "A Snowy Day." I slept freely and guiltlessly in those dark rooms, and no guard dared stop me.
In a recent interview, Jerry Seinfeld lightly mocked a person he saw sitting in a coffee shop reading a library book. When was the last time you saw a library book, Seinfeld wanted to know. Who, in the rarefied universe of zillionaire comics, goes to libraries?
 I do, Jerry. I do. So do lots of other people in this city, and we are the masters of that domain. Sometimes, when I find myself met with disappointment over inadequate collections or sudden, inexplicable closings, I'm not sure exactly why I keep going, but it's a habit begun early in life, and one that I have no intention of breaking. Sometimes, I do in fact use the bigger, stronger, central clearinghouses of the Donnell or the Mid-Manhattan, and when I do I'm more likely to come away satisfied. And a few years ago I became a member of the New York Society Library, where they actually know my name and whose elegant rooms make me feel as though I'm living out a scene in a Henry James novel. But I still value the branch libraries, those struggling, feisty, publicly financed underdogs. 
 The world, it's long been clear to me, has little interest in books. But these libraries, shabby and often bathroomless though they are, do. I'm frustrated by anemic collections, by erratic hours. But I admire their spunk, their hard-working librarians and their persistence, chugging along in a city that has plenty of other things on its mind.
 In May 2001, the Webster Library closed its doors for a renovation scheduled to be completed this year. My first thought was: It's about time. But my second thought was: I'll miss this place, this strange, mixed bag of books and videos and magazines and story times. Sometime soon, the doors will once again open on York Avenue, and I have a feeling I'll be among the first people to walk inside.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 19, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about branch libraries referred incorrectly to the Webster Branch, on York Avenue near 78th Street. The branch had been closed for renovations, but it reopened on Jan. 6.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Reform? Republicans Reconsider

BYLINE:  By RYAN LIZZA; Ryan Lizza covers the White House for The New Republic.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ONE of the first things Republicans did in 1995 after they took control of the House was to adopt tighter ethics rules for House members, in response to what they saw as decades of Democratic arrogance and abuse. 
 On Tuesday, after the new House was sworn in, the Republicans passed their first piece of business for the 108th Congress: House rules that overturned some of their old reforms. 
 Critics quickly focused on the easing of restrictions on lobbyist-paid meals that are sent to Capitol Hill and on the loosening of limits on House member trips paid for by charities. But there were other long-sought changes, harder to understand and ridicule, which provide Republicans help in the tough budget negotiations ahead. 
Critics were up in arms about the new pizza rule, so called because lobbyists can now deliver food and beverages, up to $50 per person, to members of Congress and their staffs. 
"What we are talking about is Chinese food," said Jo Powers, the spokeswoman for David Dreier, the Republican representative from California who leads the rules committee. "It's not like steaks are being delivered." 
Another change allows charities to pick up the tab for travel and lodging for members to attend their events. Critics say this harks back to the days when House members cavorted with special interests on free trips to golf resorts. But, Ms. Powers said, "sometimes a member will be a big draw for charity." "If it will help the charity double their take, it's worth bringing them down," she added. 
Democrats, who were on the losing side of a party-line vote on the new package, cried hypocrisy. "Republicans were the ones agitating for these strict gift rules," Martin Frost, the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, said in an interview. "They've now put back the system of abuses they once complained about."
Remember term limits? Republicans gave up on that cause long ago, and now they've also overturned their 1995 rule limiting a member to four terms as Speaker of the House. J. Dennis Hastert will now be able to serve as House speaker for years to come.
Republicans chalk up the changes to experience, not a loss of principle. "It took us time to learn about the process of governing," Mr. Dreier said last week in defending the package. 
Two other rule changes stand to help Republicans win any public relations war over the budget. Republicans reinstated the so-called Gephardt rule, named after its author, the Missouri Democrat who just stepped down as minority leader. The rule, adopted when Democrats were in the majority, allows the House to evade an unpleasant task: voting on whether to raise the statutory ceiling on the national debt. 
Republicans repealed this rule in 2001, when the budget was in surplus, but now they see the wisdom of the provision, which increases the limit on public debt automatically when the House adopts its annual budget resolution.
This means that a separate, potentially embarrassing floor vote to authorize more debt is no longer required at a time when the budget deficit, projected to be about $150 billion this year, is sure to rise if Congress passes a new round of tax cuts.
Last year, Democrats used a vote on the debt ceiling to dramatize the worsening deficit and attack President Bush's economic policies. 
"It was a very difficult, very political vote," Ms. Powers said, adding that under the Gephardt rule, "it's going to be less of a political football."
The biggest rule change, however, is something that Republicans have long wanted, but thought too controversial to adopt when they first took over the House in 1995. 
The Ways and Means Committee, where every tax law originates, will now be required to use "dynamic scoring," which estimates the cost of a tax change by predicting its impact on economic growth, rather than just calculating how much revenue would be lost or gained. Currently, Congressional economists use "static scoring," which assumes that a tax cut of, say, $100 billion will reduce government revenues by the same amount. 
For years the supply-side economists have insisted that tax cuts stimulate the economy, producing increased government revenue that partially offsets the original cuts. But to their dismay, their own director of the Congressional Budget Office, Dan L. Crippen, rejected dynamic scoring. His term recently ended, and he was not reappointed. Replacing him is Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, the top economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, who conservatives say is a champion of dynamic scoring. Indeed, the council used dynamic scoring to predict that rather than costing $359 billion over the next five years, Mr. Bush's tax cut will reduce government revenues by only $166 billion. 
Republicans argue that all the new rules passed this week will modernize the House. In fact, at least in one respect, Republicans are bringing the House into the 21st century. While cell phones and laptops are still banned, a new rule allows members to use their Palm Pilots, pagers and Blackberries on the House floor. 
Perhaps they can use them to order a pizza.

College Students Are Back, but Dreaming of Florida

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Winter breaks are drawing to a close for many college students -- so it's not too soon to start planning spring-break vacations. 
 The share of students traveling during spring break rose to 39 percent last year from 34 percent in 1998, according to Student Monitor, a research group that publishes data on college students' lifestyles. Not surprisingly, warmweather spots were the most popular. Almost two-thirds of student travelers visited Southern states, California or Mexico. Florida was the No. 1 destination, chosen by 25 percent.
 But not all students are looking for fun in the sun. Twenty-nine percent raised extra cash by working during spring breaks last year. KATHLEEN O'BRIEN

A Surge in Saber-Rattling at the Precipice

BYLINE:  By GEOFFREY NUNBERG; Geoffrey Nunberg, a Stanford linguist, is heard regularly on NPR's "Fresh Air" and wrote "The Way We Talk Now."

 BODY:
"BRINKMANSHIP," unlike mutual assured destruction" and many other phrases from the cold war, never really went out of style. 
 But use of the word has been on the increase in recent years, and its frequency in the press was up 400 percent in the last month, thanks to the "nuclear brinkmanship" of North Korea. (Dictionaries recognize "brinksmanship" as well as "brinkmanship," which is the original form of the word.) 
 The word has bipartisan origins. John Foster Dulles, Dwight D. Eisenhower's secretary of state, used the expression "brink of war" in a January 1956 Life magazine interview, not long after the United States had come close to going to war with Communist China over the offshore islands Quemoy and Matsu. 
"The ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the necessary art," Dulles said. "If you are scared to go to the brink, you are lost. . . We walked to the brink and we looked it in the face."
But it was Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate for president in 1952 and 1956, who completed the term as "brinkmanship." In a speech in Hartford a few weeks after the Life article appeared, he reproached Dulles for "boasting of his brinkmanship -- the art of bringing us to the edge of the abyss." (The coinage has been credited to Stevenson's speechwriter, James C. Thompson.)
In Stevenson's mouth, the word had sardonic connotations. It echoed the words "Gamesmanship" and "One-upmanship," the titles of popular books by the English humorist Stephen Potter, who expounded the techniques of looking good while you gamed the system or, as he put it, "The Art of Getting Away With It Without Being an Absolute Plonk."
Mr. Potter even managed to bend the meaning of the suffix "-manship" itself. It no longer suggested the skills worthy of a role, as in "horsemanship" and "statesmanship," but rather the ploys and artifice that people used to get the upper hand. (A 1962 report by the Senate Security Subcommittee was titled "Wordsmanship; Semantics as a Communist Weapon.")
The success of "gamesmanship" and "oneupmanship" spawned imitations like "queuemanship" and "namesmanship," but "brinkmanship" was one of the few that endured. Within a few years, people were using the word in a straightforward and sometimes approving way, with its sarcastic origins forgotten -- one recent textbook explains it is derived on the model of "statesmanship," an etymology that Stevenson would have found galling.
It's curious that people felt the need for a new word like "brinkmanship" -- after all, wars of nerves were as old as international conflict itself. When Lord Palmerston, the British prime minister, narrowly skirted a war with the Union at the beginning of the Civil War, his political adversary Richard Cobden wrote, "Palmerston likes to drive the wheel close to the edge, and show how dexterously he can avoid falling off the precipice." That could just as easily have been Stevenson on Dulles, except that "precipicemanship" doesn't fall very trippingly from the tongue.
In fact "brinkmanship" wasn't the only new term of this sort that appeared in the 50's. In 1955, the movie "Rebel Without a Cause" popularized the phrase "playing chicken." In the classic chicken game, teenagers drove at one another head on until one of them turned aside. But the director, Nicholas Ray, gave his version a cold war inflection by having his teenagers race jalopies toward the edge of a headland called the bluff, the loser being the one who bailed out first.
The fortunes of both expressions were helped along when they were adopted by policy theorists developing approaches to conflict resolution based on the mathematics of game theory. By the 60's, political science journals were bristling with titles like "Cooperation in N-Person Games of Chicken."
Scholars calculated the efficacy of the ploys whereby leaders could lend credibility to their threats: by ordering costly mobilizations, by working up public opinion to the point where a capitulation would be politically expensive, or by trying to create the impression that they might be too loopy to be entirely rational. The last technique was one that Henry Kissinger and Richard M. Nixon tried to use with the Soviets in 1969. Or you could simply allow the situation to get a little out of control, increasing the fear that war might break out by accident. As the economist Thomas Schelling defined it, brinkmanship is "the threat that leaves something to chance."
WITH the end of the cold war, the notion of brinkmanship had to be scaled down. People began to use the word for just about any situation where parties were willing to risk going down to the wire, whether they were union leaders or lawyers.
A recent story in The Albany Times-Union mentions the Arizona Cardinals' "brinkmanship" after they won six games by a total of 15 points. That's stretching a point -- just because a game is a cliffhanger doesn't mean that any brinkmanship is involved.
The political uses of the word have had to change, too. The crises of the cold war kept taking the world to the brink of the same terrifying catastrophe. Now there seem to be lots of littler brinks and local abysses. The word is still appropriate to describe the India-Pakistan confrontation, which is simply a regional-power variation of those cold war confrontations.
But the ubiquitous references now to North Korea's "nuclear brinkmanship" are more misleading. The phrase is probably irresistible, given its historical resonances, but in this context it's really just a play on words. What North Korea is on the verge of, after all, is acquiring nuclear weapons, not starting a nuclear war. The situation may be serious, but it's a far cry from the Quemoy-Matsu confrontation or the Cuban missile crisis, where war really did seem imminent.
What about Iraq? The Bush administration would no doubt reject the accusations that it was involved in brinkmanship, partly because the word implies a kind of bluff, and partly because it's always in a player's strategic interest to minimize the cost, the uncertainties and the enormity of going to war. That's all in the best tradition of brinkmanship. During the China crisis of 1955, Eisenhower argued that the public was unreasonably squeamish about the use of tactical nuclear weapons, which he described as no different than any other munition.
In the end, good brinkmanship is indistinguishable from belligerence until after the fact. As Lord Palmerston knew, the ultimate test of brinkmanship is how dexterously you can avoid falling off the precipice.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 19, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the popularity of the word "brinkmanship" misspelled the surname of the speechwriter credited with coining the term. He is James C. Thomson Jr., not James C. Thompson.

HEADLINE: Schools Ending Year Early Among Efforts to Cut Costs 

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Linda Pattison, a fourth-grade teacher here, uses her fingers to check off the lessons that she usually teaches but will skip this spring. Her pupils will not study the metric system in arithmetic, nor electricity in science. Nor will they read Oregon history in social studies.
 Ms. Pattison, who has taught for 28 years, looks a bit shattered as she reviews her recent efforts to gut her classes. 
 "I can only compare this to my divorce," she said, and she is not alone in her stress. Teachers across Oregon are queasily checking lesson plans, deciding what not to teach as half the school districts in the state prepare to slash anywhere from a few days to more than a month from the school year to cut costs.
Thousands of America's districts are grappling with extraordinary midyear budget cuts as state governments face deficits that stem from falling tax revenues. Most are laying off bus drivers and cutting art classes and field trips, and educators say the havoc will be worse next year. 
In California, where the law bars districts from laying off teachers after the year begins, schools are planning mass dismissals of janitors, cooks and other support workers to cope with $700 million in budget cuts.
But nowhere except Oregon have so many districts announced plans to severely shorten the academic year. The superintendent here, James R. Scherzinger, has ordered administrators to prepare to cut 15 days from the calendar, and he said that unless voters approve a tax increase in a referendum on Jan. 28, a prospect pollsters say is quite unlikely, he will urge a cut that totals 24 days.
Educational historians said this would be the first time in 70 years that many districts are closing schools far ahead of schedule. In the Depression, millions of workers lost work, government revenues crashed and thousands of districts shut early, the historians said.
"I find it remarkable to see this happening now, because although economic times are hard, this is nothing like the Great Depression," said Jeffrey E. Mirel, a historian and an associate dean of the University of Michigan School of Education. "To see large numbers of districts cutting weeks off the school year in times of mild but not severe recession is just unprecedented."
Oregon law permits districts to apply for waivers from minimum classroom instruction requirements, which are measured in hours and vary by grade level but are equivalent to 175 days. That has led about half the superintendents to propose cutting days from the calendar. 
In most states, laws require a minimum of 180 instructional days. So hard-pressed districts are saving money in other ways.
"They're cutting personnel through attrition, suspending building plans, eliminating sports and other extracurricular activities, not cleaning their buildings," said David Griffith, a spokesman for the National Association of State Boards of Education.
Oklahoma cut school financing $158 million this year, or more than 8 percent. That left 1,000 students in Oklahoma City without bus service and some schools without custodians, said Carolyn Crowder, president of the Oklahoma Education Association, the teachers' union. If authorities do not find new financing by the middle of April, 5,000 of the 44,000 teachers in the state will be laid off before next fall, Ms. Crowder said.
In Alabama, too, a fiscal crisis has forced authorities to lay off school workers and to pare programs this year. Officials expect deeper cuts in September.
"Next year, we're going to see the worst budget for public education in 30 years," said Susan Salter, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Association of School Boards.
In Oregon, the crisis is unfolding now, partly because districts depend on state aid for a higher proportion of their financing, about 70 percent, than in other states. Because Oregon has no sales tax, it relies almost entirely on an income tax whose revenues have plummeted.
Oregon is in the last semester of a two-year budget that had originally allotted $5.2 billion to public schools. But as revenues have fallen, the 198 districts have reduced spending by $418 million. If voters reject the tax increase on Jan. 28, the districts will lose an additional $95 million, said the Legislative Fiscal Office.
Tim Hibbitts, a pollster here, offered little hope for the tax increase, saying surveys last month showed 55 to 60 percent opposed it. "I expect it to lose," Mr. Hibbitts said. "I would be very surprised if it won."
Whatever the outcome on Jan. 28, officials said, they have no choice but to truncate the school year.
"What we're proposing is extraordinary," Mr. Scherzinger said. "I don't agree with it myself. It's very destructive. But we've run out of alternatives." 
He is negotiating the cuts with the union, which is threatening to strike.
Half the 100 districts that responded to a survey last month reported plans to shorten the school year, and 25 said the cuts would run 10 to 20 days. 
In Portland, the school board has adopted other measures, including dismissing the entire force of 330 unionized janitors in the summer and last month canceling a popular outdoor sixth-grade science camp, as well as all spring athletics. 
Damon Stoudamire, a graduate of the Portland schools who is on the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team, stepped in to donate $200,000. Other sports enthusiasts pledged similar amounts, saving spring athletics for this year, at least.
The crisis has called forth a cottage industry of volunteerism, with parents seeking to scrape together money in bake sales and auctions to restore art and music programs.
Michael E. Rosen, an environmental manager whose son Elias is a fourth grader, said he had helped his PTA collect $30,000 to hire an art instructor for Elias's school. But the news that the school year is being cut at least 15 days led to canceling the art classes, Mr. Rosen said.
"How could we take time for art when math classes are being axed?" he asked.
At Benson High School, a magnet school in the city center, Gail Black was trying to decide last week which novel to cut from her senior English class. "Huckleberry Finn" might have to go, Ms. Black said, or perhaps she would skip Hermann Hesse's "Siddhartha." 
"How do you just eliminate several weeks' class work?" she asked. "I've never faced anything like this."
Cutting 15 days from the calendar would mean a pay cut of $5,000 for the most experienced teachers here, the veterans with master's degrees and other advanced credits whose top salary is $56,700, according to the union.
Sitting in her classroom at Llewellyn Elementary School, Ms. Pattison said she was battling bouts of depression as she watched the schools erode around her.
"It's been death by a thousand cuts," she said.

HEADLINE: India Harvests Fruits of a Diaspora 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Sir Shridath Ramphal's grandmother left India in rebellion 150 years ago, after refusing to throw herself on her dead husband's funeral pyre. She ended up in indentured servitude in South America, in what was then the British colony of Guiana. When it became a nation, her grandson, Sir Shridath, became its first foreign minister. 
 Dipak C. Jain left India with optimism, heading for Dallas 20 years ago to work on a doctorate in applied mathematics. He became a professor in marketing, a field he had never heard of before leaving India, and then dean of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. 
 This week both men returned to India as part of what was billed as the largest gathering of the Indian diaspora since independence in 1947. Like most of the nearly 2,000 "nonresident Indians" and "people of Indian origin" who made the journey from 63 countries, they were abundantly successful. Nonetheless, they represented very different strands of one of the world's largest and most productive diasporas. 
The Indian government and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, organized the gathering, which ended today, to determine how the resources and achievements of Indians abroad might be used to uplift India. 
While Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said in his speech opening the conference on Thursday that the government was not seeking the diaspora's riches, but its "richness of experience," the riches could not be ignored. According to a recent report by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, the 20 million Indians living abroad generate an annual income equal to 35 percent of India's gross domestic product. 
Indians are the largest minority group in Britain and have the highest income among its minority groups. Indian-Americans have a median income 50 percent higher than the national average for the United States. Yet foreign direct investment by Indians abroad is only $1 billion, compared with about $60 billion invested by 55 million overseas Chinese. It is a gap the government hopes to close. 
"We want to create an environment for you so that you can excel in India as much as you could anywhere else in the world," Mr. Vajpayee said. 
To deepen the connection between India and its scattered seed, Mr. Vajpayee announced on Thursday that legislation would be introduced to grant dual citizenship to people of Indian origin living in "certain countries," which officials later tentatively identified as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Singapore. 
On Friday, Finance Minister Jaswant Singh announced a series of measures to ease investment overseas. The limit on mutual fund investments in overseas stock exchanges was doubled, to $1 billion. 
Those attending the gathering included the prime minister of Mauritius and the former prime minister of Fiji, and two Nobel laureates -- the economist Amartya Sen and the writer V. S. Naipaul. There were politicians, scholars, industrialists and jurists. 
More than simply celebrating the "global Indian family," the conference put India -- the brilliance of its minds, the querulousness of its characters, its perpetual grappling to define its identity -- on display. 
Mr. Sen encouraged India to remember its long history of interaction with other civilizations and not to retreat into cultural isolationism. Mr. Naipaul -- who with typically tart precision observed that the gathering "has the element of the trade fair" -- told India to "stop blaming the British for everything." 
There seemed to be as many opinions as there were participants about what the conference was for, what the meaning of diaspora was, where loyalties should lie, and what India was and should be. 
"We Indian South Africans have had to struggle hard to claim our South Africanness, and that is something we jealously guard," said Fatima Meer, a South African anti-apartheid activist. "We are not a diaspora of India." 
One divide emerged between affluent professionals prospering in Europe or America and the descendants of indentured servants who had provided plantation labor in British colonies across the globe. 
"We must guard against this conference focusing too much on how India can build a relationship with those in the affluent sector of the diaspora, with little concern for those members of the diaspora who are suffering and whose rights are under assault," said Fiji's former prime minister, Mahendra P. Chaudhry, who is of Indian origin. 
Dhundev Bauhadoor, a Mauritian who heads the Global Organization of People of Indian Origin, criticized India for being slow to comment when Mr. Chaudhry was deposed in a coup and held hostage for 28 days in 2000. "This cannot continue," he said. "If India is to play her role as mother, she must protect her children wherever they are." 
Bharatkumar J. Shah, a Dubai businessman, spoke for the three million to four million Indians who have followed the oil boom since the 1970's to work as laborers in the Persian Gulf. They send more than $300 million annually to India, yet, he said, India has done too little to protect their rights and support their families. 
On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister L. K. Advani said all the delegates were of value to India, but he also said India's influence had widened thanks to the "high socioeconomic profile the Indian community now commands in the United States." More than 400 Indian-Americans attended the conference. 
Mr. Advani also waded into the debate, prompted by Hindu-Muslim riots in the state of Gujarat, that has riven India in recent months over its secular character and that seems to have divided the diaspora as well. 
After Mr. Naipaul's wife, Nadira Naipaul, a Muslim from Pakistan, challenged Mr. Advani to explain the place of Muslims and Christians in India he replied, "Secularism is so embedded in our thinking there can be no departure from that." 
Of the Gujarat riots, which left about 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, dead, he said: "We feel sad, we feel ashamed, we only say it's an aberration, it must not be repeated. I only say let's have it behind us." 
Sixty percent of the Indians in America are from Gujarat. Some at the conference said they were tired of attacks on the state because of the riots. "It's high time Gujarat and even the center stop apologizing for what happened in Gujarat," said Suvas G. Desai, a doctor from Lexington, Ky. 
Beyond politics, many of the attendees seemed interested in giving back and frustrated by how difficult India sometimes made it to do so. 
Dr. K. T. Shah, a Texas doctor, said he was harassed at customs when he tried to bring in medical equipment to donate in India. 
Jagadish Shukla, a professor of climate dynamics at George Mason University in Virginia, said he was starting a school in his village in eastern Uttar Pradesh. "In my village, nothing has changed," he said, noting that it took longer to get the village from New Delhi than it did to get to New Delhi from the District of Columbia. 
"Why didn't I do this 25 years ago?" he said of the school. He speculated that much of the complaining about India at the gathering was motivated by guilt at having left India behind.

HEADLINE: In Family Leave Case, Supreme Court Steps Back Into Federalism Debate 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Eight years into the Rehnquist court's federalism revolution, it is almost routine for the new year to bring a new Supreme Court test of the limits of federal authority over the states. But there is nothing routine about the federalism case the justices will hear on Wednesday, potentially the most important of the half-dozen cases so far in which the court has shielded the states from the full reach of federal law.
 The new case, an appeal by the State of Nevada seeking immunity from suit under the Family and Medical Leave Act, on the surface resembles others in a series of increasingly caustic 5-to-4 rulings. In 2000, for example, the court held that employees could not sue states for violating the federal law against age discrimination. The next year, it ruled that states were immune from employment discrimination suits under the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
 Now the question is whether state employees can sue for damages under the Family and Medical Leave Act's family leave provision, which gives both men and women the right to take up to 12 weeks off without pay to care for a seriously ill family member. A Nevada state worker, William Hibbs, sued the state after being denied the full 12 weeks he requested to care for his ailing wife. 
There is no doubt that Congress meant the 1993 law to apply to state employers. Congress included language that explicitly removed the immunity from private damage suits that the states would otherwise enjoy under the 11th Amendment, which bars suits in federal court against states that have not given their consent to be sued. As in the earlier cases, the constitutional question is whether Congress acted within the scope of its authority when it removed the states' 11th Amendment shield.
The recent precedents have made this a very complex conceptual issue, and a heavily freighted one in terms of the relationship between the court and Congress. Through a series of incremental and highly technical decisions, the court has placed Congress in an increasingly tight vise. 
The question now is whether in the new case, Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, No. 01-1368, the court will put a stranglehold on the ability of Congress to pursue its own constitutional vision.
For that reason, the case has drawn enormous attention not only from civil rights organizations but also from dozens of current and past members of Congress, who signed a brief arguing that Congress acted within the core of its constitutional authority in applying the family leave requirement to the states. In its brief on behalf of Congress, the Bush administration says the implications of a ruling in favor of state immunity would be disturbing for civil rights enforcement generally.
The basis for that assessment lies in the route the court has taken to reach this point. Decisions in the late 1990's held that Congress lacked authority to abrogate the states' immunity when acting within its ordinary power to regulate interstate commerce, the basis for most federal legislation. 
Those cases did not shut the door completely. They left one potential source of Congressional power over the 11th Amendment: Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, which gives Congress authority to "enforce, by appropriate legislation" the amendment's twin guarantees of equal protection and due process.
Both age discrimination and disability discrimination implicate equal protection, and the defense of Congress's application of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act to the states was that Section 5 empowered Congress to act. But in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, the age case, and Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, the disability case, the court rebuffed that argument. 
The 5-to-4 majority in both cases gave several reasons for its disapproval, essentially concluding that Congress had not come up with enough evidence of unconstitutional discrimination by state employers and so could not justify opening the states to lawsuits by their employees. The legislation was not "appropriate" under Section 5, the court held.
But the Family and Medical Leave Act is different, or at least that is the argument of its defenders. It was passed, after eight years of debate and two presidential vetoes, in an effort to combat the lingering effects of sex discrimination in the workplace by creating a level playing field where the duties of providing care at home were no longer "women's work" that made women less reliable, and therefore less desirable, as employees.
As Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson expressed it in the Bush administration's brief, "Congress aimed to transform family leave from its historic genesis as a 'women's issue' into a routinized, across-the-board employment benefit," no longer "a 'problem' attributed to the presence of women in the work force."
Under the Supreme Court's equal protection doctrine, sex discrimination is in a separate category from age and disability discrimination. Official policies that treat people differently on the basis of age, disability, income and -- unless the court says otherwise in a case that is currently pending -- sexual orientation are presumed to be constitutional, as long as the government presents a "rational basis" for their defense. But sex and race discrimination are presumed to be unconstitutional. Further, Congressional measures to prevent or cure these types of discrimination have traditionally received the court's deference, even if the justices would not themselves have defined the problem as Congress did or designed the remedy it chose.
That history of deference, and of constitutional interpretation as an enterprise to be shared between the court and Congress, is now at stake. The implications are both practical and symbolic. 
The practical impact would be felt by the 4.8 million people who work for state governments. If the states win, there would be no direct impact on private-sector workers. Even if the court finds that the Family and Medical Leave Act is not valid under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, the law would remain unquestionably valid as legislation under the Commerce Clause, binding on private employers.
But a ruling that the act was not "appropriate" 14th Amendment legislation would entail the court's rejection of Congress's vision of what equal protection means. It would import into the core constitutional area of civil rights enforcement the muscular approach to judicial review displayed in recent cases: that the Constitution is only what the Supreme Court says it is.
To hold that civil rights laws could be justified only as economic measures under the Commerce Clause, rather than the Equal Protection Clause, "would be a huge symbolic turn in American politics," Prof. Robert C. Post of the University of California at Berkeley said in an interview. 
"Nothing could be more symbolic of this court's hostility to civil rights than to strip these laws of their constitutional resonance," Professor Post said.
The states are of two minds about the case. Fourteen have joined Nevada's brief, while Connecticut and four others have joined a brief filed by New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, in defense of the law.
Nevada maintains that application of the law would be nothing less than a constitutional insult.
"States maintain the dignity of a co-equal in our system of dual sovereignty," Nevada's brief says, "and immunity is central to that dignity."

BYLINE:  By Joseph P. Fried 

 BODY:
The Velvet Rope Meets the U.S. Border
The headlines dubbed him "Club King" and "Mega-Club Mogul." 
 In the 1980's and 90's, Peter Gatien was a leading nightclub owner in Manhattan, whose cavernous, high-decibel, high-energy spots drew packs of young revelers and stacks of publicity. 
 The publicity was not always welcome. In 1996, federal prosecutors charged that Mr. Gatien had turned two of the clubs, Limelight and the Tunnel, into virtual drug supermarkets by authorizing and even financing drug dealing and drug use on the premises, in order to increase patronage and profitability. Mr. Gatien said any drug activity occurred despite his efforts to combat it. A jury acquitted him.
But in 1999 he pleaded guilty to state tax-evasion charges. He served 60 days in jail and agreed to pay $1.88 million in back taxes and fines.
Community groups and the authorities pressed to have the two clubs closed. They said noise and drunken and drugged patrons made Limelight's neighbors in Chelsea miserable, and they attributed violent incidents near the Tunnel to its patrons.
There were also economic problems, and in 2001 Limelight was sold in bankruptcy court to an operator whose club on the site is called called Estate. The Tunnel closed.
These days, Mr. Gatien, 50, is balancing between hopeful ups and one big down. The upside is twofold, he said last week: working with Spike Lee's production company to develop a fictional television series that is set in a nightclub, and working separately on a movie script "largely based on my life."
The downside is the effort by American immigration authorities to deport him to his native Canada. Though he has lived in the United States for 25 years, Mr. Gatien has never sought American citizenship. The authorities say his deportation is required because he is a noncitizen convicted of an "aggravated felony" -- tax evasion.
His lawyers dispute that his crime was an aggravated felony. One lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Mr. Gatien was "desperately hopeful" that he would not be deported. A hearing is scheduled before an immigration judge tomorrow.
Mr. Gatien said he wanted to remain in the United States because his family was rooted here -- his wife and three of his four children are American citizens -- and because "America and New York are the hub of lots of things that interest me."
"I'm anxious," he said. "Scared. There are knots in my stomach."

Next Stop, Trade Center. Yes, You Heard It Right.
The signs on the E trains still say its last stop in Manhattan is the World Trade Center. Conductors often announce that you are boarding the "E to the World Trade Center." At the terminal, "Chambers WTC" signs remain on some platform pillars, though they have been removed from other pillars without any replacement signs.
Sixteen months after the trade center disappeared in the terrorist attack, are we talking here about an oversight, lethargy or a policy decision in favor or the status quo? 
"A policy decision," said a spokesman for New York City Transit, which operates the subway.
"Until a decision is made on what that site will be, it doesn't behoove us to change the name of the destination," the spokesman, Paul Fleuranges, said. "For us to decide unilaterally what to call it would not be working in partnership" with the agencies planning the redevelopment of the trade center site.
About the signs removed from the terminal pillars: "It could have been for maintenance or cleaning" and signifies nothing more, he said.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Seek a Routine in the Capitol Maze 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
As snow dusted the Capitol last Sunday afternoon, Candice Miller, no longer Michigan's secretary of state but not quite an official member of the House of Representatives, arrived at her new suite in the Cannon Building to meet her staff and do a little unpacking. Dressed casually in sweatshirt and khakis, Mrs. Miller strode through the door, stopping as she spotted her new nameplate.
 "Jamie," she said to her chief of staff, Jamie Roe, "my name's on the door." 
 "That's what happens when you win," Mr. Roe replied dryly. 
Next door in the Longworth Building, much the same scene was playing out in the office of Raul M. Grijalva, newly elected from Tucson. "They have to put a little accent mark here," said Mr. Grijalva, gesturing toward the U in his first name. "I'll do that myself, with a little Wite-Out." 
By week's end, Mrs. Miller and Mr. Grijalva had already cast their first votes, on House rules, unemployment benefits, a stopgap spending measure and what seemed like endless procedural concerns. But first, there were pictures to hang, voting cards and identification pins to pick up, swearing-in parties to attend, television interviews to do, lobbyists to meet, kinks to work out. 
The first time Mrs. Miller pulled open the drawer of her standard-issue mahogany desk, she discovered she had no paper or pens. Mr. Grijalva's discovery was even worse: the computers he ordered had not arrived. "They're coming," said his chief of staff, Ana Ma, her frustration with the federal bureaucracy evident behind her frozen smile.
For Mr. Grijalva, a liberal Democrat with deep roots in Tucson's Hispanic community, and Mrs. Miller, who calls herself a "George W. Bush Republican" and represents Macomb County outside Detroit, the months ahead will be filled with discussions of domestic security, Medicare reform, tax cuts and other weighty matters. But in this first week, Mrs. Miller, 48, and Mr. Grijalva (pronounced gree-HAHL-va), 52, were consumed not so much by politics and policy as by the practical realities of their new lives.
From the clocks whose electronic bells alert them to a vote -- "I thought it might be a fire alarm," Mr. Grijalva confessed -- to their House-issued Blackberry pagers, to the underground tunnels that connect their offices to the Capitol, these freshmen had much to learn.
Mrs. Miller, a creature of organization who worried she would be late to the House chamber for votes, insisted that she and her staff make practice runs through the subterranean maze. "The first time, we got lost," she said. She timed the route at 15 minutes, although she said a Michigan colleague, Representative Dave Camp, assured her that she would eventually need only five.
Mr. Grijalva simply gave up on the tunnels, preferring to walk outside with the huge Capitol dome as his guide. "I like the fresh air," he said. 
Being a member of Congress can mean long, unpredictable hours. On Wednesday, as the House voted late into the night, Mr. Grijalva attended a reception for Hispanic leaders and then rushed back to the Capitol to vote, ferried by a taxi driver who dropped him off near the Senate, not the House. Mrs. Miller, afraid to stray too far from the Capitol, found herself eating take-out Chinese food for dinner in the office of Representative Tom DeLay, the majority leader.
It is also physical work. By Thursday, Mrs. Miller -- who races sailboats as a hobby -- said her feet were killing her from rushing around on the Capitol's unforgiving tile and marble floors. "I bought several pair of these Hush Puppies," she said, showing off some very sensible flat shoes.
Mr. Grijalva and Mrs. Miller were eager to set up shop early, so they took advantage of a House rule that permits freshmen to move into their offices a few days before they are officially sworn in. 
To make himself feel at home, Mr. Grijalva brought some artwork, including a picture of the Sonoran Desert (he is an ardent environmentalist), some Yaqui masks (the Yaqui tribe is one of several in his district, which stretches across two-thirds of Arizona's border with Mexico) and a framed sepia-tone photograph of his father, a Mexican immigrant who was once a ranch hand. The picture hangs behind his desk.
Mrs. Miller brought her favorite photograph, of herself and Laura Bush, as well as her favorite award, a bronze statue of a Revolutionary War Minuteman, given by the Michigan National Guard in recognition of her efforts to spare the Selfridge Air National Guard base, in her district, from being closed. Right after the election, Mrs. Miller began lobbying Republican leaders for a seat on the House Armed Services Committee. At the end of the week, she learned she had it.
"Can you believe it?" she exclaimed, beaming. "I am thrilled, absolutely thrilled."
By Tuesday, Opening Day, Mrs. Miller was hosting a pre-swearing-in open house, with coffee, fruit and pastries for whoever cared to drop in. Wearing a brown knit suit that she chose because it was "sort of conservative-looking, Republican-looking," she greeted a steady stream of visitors, among them Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the longest-serving member of the House. A handful of lobbyists, including those representing an anti-abortion group, came by, looking to make new friends. They left lapel pins in the shape of baby footprints on Mrs. Miller's desk.
At Mr. Grijalva's office, the computers had still not arrived, and the staff was making do with a handful of old machines and a couple of borrowed laptops.
As an aide prepared the congressman's first official act, a letter asking Attorney General John Ashcroft to investigate vigilantes who are patrolling the southern Arizona border, Mr. Grijalva paced about. He sifted through his papers, including a letter from Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, urging him to vote against changes to House rules that she said would give Republicans a procedural edge.
"Might as well get off to a good start and vote no on something," Mr. Grijalva said. Later that day, he did.
All House members need an electronic voting card, which resembles a driver's license, and a member's pin that permits them to move swiftly past security. So on Tuesday morning, Mr. Grijalva took a walk to the Speaker's Lobby, the portrait-lined corridor that runs alongside the House chamber, to pick up these essential items. Back at the office, a staff member took a photograph of his wife, Ramona, affixing a blue oval pin to his lapel. But when he arrived on the House floor to take the oath of office, Mr. Grijalva learned he had made a mistake common to freshmen: he put on the spouse's pin. The member's pin is round and white.
For Mrs. Miller and Mr. Grijalva, adding the title "Representative" to their names was a highlight of the week. So, too, was casting their first votes.
Mr. Grijalva was surprised to learn that, despite the image projected by C-Span, very few members actually sit in the House chamber to listen to colleagues debate. Entranced, he stayed put as his fellow Democrat, Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, argued passionately for a more generous unemployment benefits package than the 13-week extension the House ultimately passed. 
"I liked his style," Mr. Grijalva said of Mr. Obey. Although he voted with other Democrats in favor of the 13-week extension, Mr. Grijalva was not particularly happy about it. "Half a loaf," he said with a frown.
Mrs. Miller, reflecting the glow of Republicans' newfound political prowess, said that with 85,000 people unemployed in her home state, she felt terrific about the vote. "I felt," she said, "that I was doing what I came here to do."
Articles in this series will periodically observe two Congressional newcomers as they take on their new roles.

HEADLINE: City Sidewalks, Packed in Holiday Style, Hint at End to a Lingering Slump in Tourism 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
People lined up for hours on the sidewalk in front of the Empire State Building during the holiday season just past. Ground zero was packed. Crowds spilled out the entrance of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and even if the guy holding a yellow cobra had not been standing in front of the Virgin Megastore in Times Square on the Monday afternoon before New Year's Eve, the sidewalks would have been as congested as, well, Times Square on New Year's Eve.
 It is still too early for official figures, but the monumental crowds that clogged Midtown and downtown offer clues to how the city's $25 billion tourism industry did over the holidays. 
 In a sidewalk census during 15 late-afternoon minutes on Dec. 30, 2,432 people shuffled by the Virgin store, a staggering rate of nearly 10,000 people an hour. That exceeds by a good 12 percent the count from the summer season's peak, in late August, according to officials of the local business improvement district, which conducted the count. 
The sheer number of bodies amassing in the cold is no absolute indicator that tourism -- one of the city's most important moneymakers -- has recovered from the disaster of the 2001 holiday season, which took place in the post-Sept. 11 gloom. And lackluster retail sales suggest that most of the tourists did not break their banks while they were here.
But tourism experts and city officials say the sheer size of the crowds on the sidewalks of New York during the holidays is the most visible sign that hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions had a season with visitors and revenues that resembled the banner year of 2000 more than the troubled times of 2001. 
"Being on the streets felt very much like it was the New York of old," said Dr. Lalia Rach, dean of the Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University. Almost a year and a half after the attack on the World Trade Center, much of the fear of coming to New York seems to have been replaced, she said, by a desire to witness the city's recovery firsthand. "There is a tremendous pent-up demand." 
But there are some dark notes: International tourists have not returned to New York in anything like the numbers before Sept. 11, and city tourism officials do not expect them back anytime soon, although there have been some successful efforts to lure back small groups of international travelers. 
Still, hotel occupancy rates were higher than expected during the holidays. Many of those rooms rented for reduced rates, or on special packages; many rooms were filled with visitors from the region and west of the Appalachians, and not the foreign tourists of days past. 
"There were more tourists overall in New York City this season, but they were mostly domestic tourists," said Cristyne L. Nicholas, president of NYC & Company, the city's tourism bureau. While American hotel guests spend only a fraction of what international tourists do during vacation, keeping the hotels close to average occupancy "means a lot to the economy," said Ms. Nicholas, because hotels account for about 40 percent of all tourist dollars.
Occupancy for all New York hotels was 81 percent in December, about 7 percent higher than for the same month in 2001, according to preliminary figures from Smith Travel Research, a company that tracks the national hotel industry. 
Average room rates in New York, though still down substantially from the record highs of 2000, were 15 percent higher than in 2001 during December, according to Smith. The rooms needed to be cleaned, the towels washed, and so there was work for many of those who were jobless last year. The leaders of hotel workers' unions said that during the holidays all their members worked, except for about 1,000 who worked at two downtown hotels until Sept. 11.
City tourism officials believe that many people visited New York for the first time during the holidays. But there also are signs that many tourists had been here before. The number of people who stopped by the information center run by the Times Square Business Improvement District to ask for directions or to find out how to see a Broadway show dropped in December by 20 percent from the previous year. 
But there is evidence that newcomers were here too. Tourists stopped the uniformed safety officers hired by the Times Square district to ask for directions 74,523 times in December, an increase of more than 10 percent over the same month in 2001.
For much of December, every day seemed like matinee day, Wednesday, when theater traffic jams the Times Square theater district. "It really got crazy about the 10th of December and continued right through to the 2nd of January," said Bill O'Connor, a disabled Marine veteran who scoots around Times Square most days on a motorized cart. Mr. O'Connor, 67, said he had to ride in the street because sidewalks were just too jammed, with the crowds the biggest he ad seen since the mid-1980's. 
Mr. O'Connor was not the only person squeezed off the sidewalks. Daniella Eidelberg, a planner with the Times Square improvement district who helped count the crowds in December, said she also did a census of people forced into the street because they couldn't find a way through the crowds. In one 15-minute period, she said, 520 people jumped the curb in front of the Toys "R" Us store in Times Square.
Formidable crowds were not limited to Times Square. "I was downtown the week before Christmas, and I couldn't believe the number of people there," said Fred Kent, who as president of the Project for Public Spaces has been keeping track of sidewalk traffic for more than 20 years. What he saw drove him close to committing blasphemy, in certain urban planning circles. 
"It was almost too crowded," Mr. Kent said.
Lee Armstrong, director of public safety for the Downtown Alliance, which promotes the financial district, said his red-coated public safety officers reported a 49 percent increase in interactions with the public in December compared with the same month last year. 
Many, of course, were looking for ground zero. But they also asked for directions to the Statue of Liberty ferry and a few new museums. Downtown hotels, which had such a devastating season in 2001, did better than expected, in most cases meeting or exceeding the city's 81.3 percent December occupancy.
Kate M. Harth, director of sales and marketing at the Ritz-Carlton New York, which delayed its opening because of Sept. 11, said December was the new hotel's best month of the year, with occupancy just shy of 82 percent. 
Overall, the city's hotels had a mixed season. "It looks like things were pretty strong right up to Christmas, but then they dropped substantially," said John A. Fox, senior vice president of PKF Consulting, which tracks hotels. Mr. Fox said that based on preliminary data, hotel revenues were up 30 percent for the first three weeks of December, despite bargain rates. While revenues for the final week of the month still exceeded the same week in 2001, they were ahead by only about 10 percent. 
Mr. Fox also pointed out that because Thanksgiving came so late it shortened by about a week one of the hotels' most important periods of the year. 
Still, some hotels did very well. The Waldorf-Astoria had more rooms filled in December than for any December in its history, said Eric O. Long, general manager. "It was a record-breaker, and by a good margin," Mr. Long said. The hotel's restaurants recorded their highest revenues on record, perhaps because reduced room rates made visitors feel like splurging on something else.
Whatever the reason, and whatever the rate, rooms at the hotel were full or nearly so from Thanksgiving through the end of the year, and holiday tourists had clearly decided to come back to New York.
"We've got a lot to be thankful for," Mr. Long said.

After a lackluster 2001 holiday season, tourism returned to 2000 levels, though foreign tourists were largely replaced by domestic visitors. (James Estrin/The New York Times)

One of the concrete promises Gov. George E. Pataki made on Wednesday in his annual speech to legislators in Albany was to protect spending on public security from the kind of cuts he is likely to impose on other areas of the state budget.
 His overarching statement signaled politically that he would hold true to his law-and-order priorities -- a 2003 version of the message he sent out in 1995. At that time, with street crime was more pervasive than it is now, he signed a death penalty bill into law, using two pens that belonged to slain New York Police Department officers. 
 But if any local law enforcement officials are seeking a sign that the pledge means they will get more state aid than usual as they try to grapple with their own budget shortfalls, they are likely to be disappointed. Administration officials said the governor's intent was to protect state spending on public security -- and he was silent about any money spent by localities to protect the public.
The governor's promise, though not specific, was of interest to law enforcers of all stripes because, in the post-9/11 world of many threats and a weak economy, security and the money to pay for it are priorities this year across New York.
"The budget plan I will put forward in three weeks will spend less money than we did last year," Mr. Pataki said in his speech. "With the exception of public security, no segment of the budget will be exempt."
Many in and out of state government cautioned that the exact details of how funds will be allocated would not be clear until Mr. Pataki issues his executive budget on Jan. 29. Mr. Pataki said that the budget would reduce spending as the state manages a gap of $2 billion to $2.5 billion this fiscal year and at least $10 billion next year.
But, administration officials said, by "public security," Mr. Pataki was referring narrowly to the state's security operations, core services, and its responsibilities to use the National Guard, for example, to protect various facilities and the state police to protect the borders. It was not a broader reference to local and state police departments, or other agencies throughout the state, they said.
Mr. Pataki "wants to maintain efforts at the state level which protect New Yorkers, such as bolstering security at our borders, combating terror and supporting the state police,"
Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Friday. The governor has already committed to funding for 120 additional state troopers, who will be used to protect the state's borders, the state officials said. He also will not lay off prison guards, they said, or seek to change criminal justice laws to give prisoners emergency early releases, as has been done or considered in other states to reduce huge budget deficits.
In addition, he will continue to lobby in Washington in an effort to secure more federal assistance for the New York Police Department, one aide said. In the current state budget, about $200 million was expected to cover estimated security costs through April 1, including the growing needs identified by the state's new Office of Public Security.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is already facing such a severe budget gap of his own that police officers may be laid off; at least 1,000 officers are now devoted to antiterrorism-related duties. But city officials took comfort in Mr. Pataki's vow to leave public service funds unscathed. Even though money that flows from the state into the Police Department budget is minimal, losing any funds would likely be painful, considering the city's current budget woes. Of the department's $3.48 billion budget this year, the city provides $3.13 billion and the state provides $12 million, only $2.4 million of which comes in the form of grants, the official said. The Police Department is much more reliant on federal funds: this year they comprise $210 million of its budget. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has been trying to persuade Congress and the Bush administration to give New York $261 million of the roughly $3.5 billion originally earmarked for local authorities for domestic security counterterrorism. The city, having been struck twice by international terrorists, has proven vulnerable and, the argument goes, by protecting itself it protects the nation.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, who has met with Mr. Kelly on the issue, said he was sympathetic to the city's plight and confident that some of the homeland security money now being divided up in Washington will make its way to Mr. Kelly's department.
"He is hit from three sides," the senator, who has fought for federal funding, said. "He has the new post-9/11 responsibilities, he has to keep up the war on crime, and he has less city money to do it."

Teams Are Playing Musical Chairs in Bullpens

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Relief pitchers are a breed unto themselves. They are a squad unto themselves, too, stationed apart from their teammates in distant outposts beyond the outfield fences. To pass the time before they are summoned into games, they often create games that they play among themselves. This winter, teams have created a game for the relievers. It is called musical bullpens.
 With teams releasing them, not tendering them contracts or not re-signing them so they become free agents, relievers have moved around the major leagues as teams have made decisions that range from filling a hole to replacing a closer to constructing a new relief corps. 
 The movement has been so rampant that six relievers who led their teams in saves last season are no longer with those teams: Billy Koch, traded from Oakland to the Chicago White Sox; Ugueth Urbina, gone from Boston to Texas as a free agent; Roberto Hernandez, an unsigned free agent; Esteban Yan, signed by Texas after not getting a contract offer from Tampa Bay; Hideki Irabu, released by Texas and gone home to Japan; and Keith Foulke, traded to replace Koch in Oakland. 
The Red Sox, the Rangers and the Chicago Cubs have acted most aggressively in reconfiguring their bullpens. The Red Sox, in fact, not only have new relievers but also a new concept. The Rangers, forever seeking pitchers, have made major bullpen moves for the second successive off-season.
Last year, the Rangers acted as if they were signing the Alex Rodriguez of relievers, giving Jay Powell a three-year, $9 million contract and Todd Van Poppel a three-year, $7.5 million deal. This time around, chastened by the reality of baseball's economics, the Rangers signed Urbina for one year at $4.5 million, Yan for one year at $1.5 million and Aaron Fultz for one year at $600,000.
After last season's poor bullpen performance, the Rangers had to do something. They squandered as many saves as they earned, 33, and they had 38 losses by relievers, the most ever by a major league team. The three newcomers are expected to join Powell, Van Poppel and Francisco Cordero in the bullpen.
The Red Sox did not want to keep Urbina as their closer, despite his 40 saves. They made him an offer he could refuse. 
"We made Urbina a multiyear contract offer, but it was probably less in line with what closers make and more in line with what is made by the pitchers we brought in," Boston General Manager Theo Epstein said. "We chose to bring in several relievers for what it would have cost us to sign one closer. They provide the depth we lacked last year."
Ramiro Mendoza (two years, $6.5 million) and Mike Timlin (one year, $1.85 million) are the primary additions to the relief corps. Chad Fox and Ryan Rupe are also newcomers. The four will join Alan Embree and Bob Howry in a setup that some might call closer by committee.
"That's not my choice of words," Epstein said. Instead, he calls it "a deep, versatile, flexible bullpen with six quality options to attack opposing lineups and game situations."
Teams that win pennants and World Series usually have dominant closers. Mariano Rivera, for example, was instrumental in the Yankees' three consecutive World Series championships from 1998 to 2000. No one in the past few decades has developed a revolutionary way of creating a successful bullpen plan.
"We're trying something that's a little different," Epstein said. "It's about allocating our resources in the bullpen. We want six quality options. We have six guys we're confident will go out and get outs for us. We believe the most critical outs in a game aren't necessarily in the ninth. 
"We want our best pitcher, whoever he is at the time, to get the most critical outs of the game. That may be in the seventh inning with the bases loaded, not in the ninth with a three-run lead. We might have a situation where you need a sinkerball pitcher. Or a left-hander with three left-handed hitters coming up in the eighth. We'd rather make our bullpen fit situations."
The plan is not something the Red Sox concocted on the spur of the moment this off-season. Epstein said club officials spoke with Manager Grady Little about it during the second half of last season.
"The save statistic was invented by a sportswriter fairly recently in baseball history," Epstein said. "It dictated a certain pattern of usage. We decided to try something new." But, he acknowledged, "It's also born out of necessity." 
The Cubs were aggressive early in the signing season, luring Mike Remlinger from Atlanta with a three-year, $10.65 million contract. They also added Dave Veres and last week signed Rod Beck, who in 1998 had 51 saves for the Cubs but who missed all of last season after elbow ligament transplant surgery.
"In 2001 we were in the race most of the year and our bullpen was one of our strengths," General Manager Jim Hendry said. "Last year it became obvious early on that it was a weakness. Our main goal was to strengthen it, even if it meant overloading it. We may not be done yet."
Interestingly, in all of the moves involving relievers, the Braves and the Yankees have lost the most, though in the Yankees' case they let Mendoza and Mike Stanton (Mets) leave as free agents. The Braves had no interest in coming close to what the Cubs gave Remlinger or what the Yankees gave Chris Hammond. They also traded Tim Spooneybarger for Mike Hampton and did not offer Kerry Ligtenberg a contract.

Words Are All They Have
When Larry Lucchino, chief executive of the Red Sox, referred to the Yankees a few weeks ago as the evil empire after their signing of Jose Contreras, he triggered a war of words with George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner. 
The two men have long viewed each other with animosity, but there was a time when Steinbrenner actually spoke kindly of Lucchino. It was in July 1993, a few weeks before the Baltimore Orioles were to be sold at auction, and Steinbrenner was in Baltimore for a luncheon. Lucchino was president of the Orioles, and Steinbrenner said he hoped Lucchino would be involved with one of the groups bidding for the team in bankruptcy court.
"He and I have been on opposite sides of the fence sometimes, but he's a very bright guy and I think it would be nice if he were in the picture because that would give us the continuity," Steinbrenner told The Baltimore Sun. "We need that right now with all the things that are going on."
Peter Angelos won the bidding, and Lucchino remained with the team briefly, then moved on.

Guys Down the Hall
From the results of this year's Hall of Fame voting, it would seem highly unlikely that any of the also-rans will gain election next year. Of the 15 players who were on the ballot last year and did not make it this year, 10 players had their percentage of votes fall. The five whose percentages rose did not make significant gains. No first-timer received 50 percent this year.
Critics were quick to question the voters on some of the players they failed to elect, like Bruce Sutter, Rich Gossage, Andre Dawson, Bert Blyleven, Jim Rice and Ryne Sandberg. Little has been heard in support of Jack Morris, whose percentage rose slightly, from 20.6 to 22.8, but he deserves a closer look.
Morris has most likely suffered in the eyes of many voters because he never won the Cy Young award and three pitchers on the ballot won more games and had lower earned run averages. But his .577 winning percentage (254-186) was significantly better than the percentages of Tommy John, Blyleven and Jim Kaat, who will no longer be on the writers' ballot.
Moreover, Morris led all pitchers in the 1980's in victories, complete games, starts and innings, and he was virtually always his team's No. 1 winner. More intriguing, in the two seasons after his 14-year career with Detroit, 1991 and 1992, he pitched for Minnesota and Toronto, and led both in victories and to World Series championships, giving him a ring with three different teams.
Pitching for the Tigers in 1984, Morris, a take-no-prisoners right-hander, won all three of his postseason starts, against Kansas City and San Diego, completing two and compiling a 1.80 E.R.A. Moving to Minnesota in 1991, he won all four of his postseason decisions, against Toronto and Atlanta, including the classic, unforgettable 10-inning 1-0 defeat of Atlanta in Game 7.
He did not match those performances in the 1992 postseason, but he led the Blue Jays during the regular season with 21 victories.
As a sign of his endurance, Morris held the American League record for successive starts (515) before Roger Clemens surpassed him in 2001.
As for the other also-rans, the Yankees' Don Mattingly suffered the steepest decline in percentage of votes, plunging from 20.3 to 13.7.

Fees for Surfcasters? The State Puts Its Toe In

BYLINE:  By Jeremy Pearce 

 BODY:
While the economy still twitches and flounders, the price of fish in New Jersey just seems to keep rising.
 For the first time, state wildlife officials are considering charging a license fee for saltwater fishermen, a move that could spawn $5 million in revenue. 
At the moment, only anglers on inland lakes and rivers pay to cast -- $22.50 for a basic annual license plus $10.50 for residents who pursue the prized trout. 
 Fishermen are of two minds. There are the weekend warriors who see the end of a tradition: either a day at the shore in search of stripers in the surf or a lazy afternoon spent on a party boat lining for bluefish. They believe a fee will only scare off casual sportsmen.
Others contend that small license fees -- if dedicated solely to fish programs and research -- could pose a boon.
"The money should not go to paving roads, for example," said Capt. Andy Bulakowski, who skippers his 38-foot charter vessel, Mission Bound, out of Cape May. "You are going to lose some people. You are going to disturb a few family vacations. But this could be very good for the fish."
State officials, of course, like to hear that. Bradley M. Campbell, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, has not yet mentioned a cost for saltwater licenses, but he has acknowledged that such a system could be crucial in a time of declining state budgets.
Captain Bulakowski sees another advantage. "It would finally get the number of New Jersey's sport fishermen on paper," he said. "With those numbers comes the politicians' loyalty." Jeremy Pearce

BENEFITS FOR JOBLESS

BYLINE:  By Carl Hulse

 BODY:
 Congress went back to work, and Republican leaders of the House and Senate, eager to take a political weapon away from Democrats, moved quickly to help Americans who have lost their jobs. 
The first bill enacted by the new Republican-controlled Congress extended federal jobless benefits for those who have used up their state assistance. Democrats complained that Republicans ignored about 1 million people who have already exhausted their federal and state aid but are still unemployed. Carl Hulse

Taxonomies of Style: It Takes More Than Scoots and Berries to Be Deck

BYLINE:  By TOM ZELLER 

 BODY:
IT could be argued that classifying the various social subspecies in Western culture used to be a more simple task. Nobles were nobles, serfs were serfs, and even the most well-to-do would go thirsty if they insisted on drinking only microbrewed grog. 
 Times have changed. The birth of the bourgeoisie brought access and pretensions of taste to a much larger swath of humanity. This in turn created demand for documentation of the various emerging types. 
 The most famous recent example of such a field guide was Lisa Birnbach's, "The Official Preppy Handbook" (Workman Publishing, 1980), which codified the pink-and-green habits of Missy, Corkie and Biff. Tack on a couple of decades of Nirvana, CK-1 and a nostalgic (if uninformed) reverence for all things Kerouac, and you've got a new specimen: the Hipster. 
 What follows is a comparison of text and image excerpts from the "Preppy Handbook" and its modern progeny "The Hipster Handbook" (Anchor Books). The latter guide, written by Robert Lanham and illustrated by Bret Nicely and Jeff Bechtel, is scheduled for publication in mid-February, and it proves that behind every goatee, shaggy hairdo and baggy blouse, there's still a lot of preening. TOM ZELLER

COMPARISON OF THE SPECIES
Both groups share a powerful need to belong.

The Preppy
"Preppies inherit from Mummy and Daddy, in addition to loopy handwriting and old furniture, the legacy of Proper Breeding. Preppies soon learn that any deviation from the prescribed style of life is bound to bring disaster. Attending a declasse school, marrying wrong, selecting uncharted neighborhoods, choosing demanding vocations, or simply taking up bowling can unravel the tightly woven social fabric that binds the comfortable Preppy community."

The Hipster
"Hipsters are always very conscious of what they are wearing and distinguish themselves by dressing creatively. . . . They possess an innate contempt for franchises, strip malls and the corporate world in general, . . . believe that irony has more resonance than reason . . . and enjoy declaring random things, like vodka martinis or exercise, passe.
Underneath their apparent individualism, Hipsters conform just like everyone else."

MALE PLUMAGE
The need to attract a suitable mate governs the male grooming regimen in both Preppy and Hipster culture, although the details differ slightly.

The Preppy
"Clean shaven --no sideburns, beard or mustache. The hair should be cut conservatively short, but not freakishly so. Straight hair may be either slicked back in a rakish, 1930's gloss, or deftly windblown in a just-back-from-the-regatta tousle."

The Hipster
CHOPS
"Hipsters who have chops should avoid hanging out together."

NEO-PANTHER
CASABLANCA

CLASSIC DISPLAYS
Although Preppies and Hipsters might seem to be easily identifiable, there is tremendous variation within each species. Here are some of the type variations from each handbook. All Hipster styles below are deck (cool); all Preppy styles are cool (deck).

The Cute Boy
"Pepsodent smile; moderate muscles; early James Franciscus look."

The Maxwell
"Gay . . . Hipsters who . . . purchase the latest Prada and Diesel wear."

The Aesthete
"Tortoise-shell glasses; absence of body hair; abundance of freckles."

The Polit
"Thick-looking skin and a mole or two on their neck or face. . . . Accessorizes with . . . wire-rimmed glasses."

The Cute Girl
"Slim hips, small bust. Pretty but never voluptuous. Quote: 'How many colors does it come in?"'

The UTF
"Unemployed Trust-Funder. . . . Knows the value of a musky armpit."

ALPHA SPECIMENS
Preppies in history abound, as do forebears for every wally (guy) and tassel (girl) among today's Hipsters. A selection from each pantheon:

Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. (Preppy)
"Boston Brahmin. Did not achieve divine status until the age of 60, when he became a Supreme Court justice and sported a mustache that looked swell in portraits."

Marcel Duchamp (Hipster)
"Entered a urinal signed 'R. Mutt' into an exhibition in 1917. It got rejected, but for six bucks (the price it cost Duchamp to submit the piece) he went into the history books as the founder of conceptual art, and Andy Warhol was provided a career. Duchamp was the quintessential Hipster."

F. Scott Fitzgerald (Preppy)
"Chronicled the Jazz Age. Wrote 'The Great Gatsby.' Blew the Prep cover on hopes and disillusion. Said it all."

Sitting Bull (Hipster)
"Loved to chill out. His nickname, Hunkesi, literally means 'slow.' Though he loved to take it easy, he always managed to kick some expletive when he needed to. During one early battle, he walked into enemy fire, sat down, and casually smoked a phatty. He walked away unharmed. He was one deck wally."

Caroline Kennedy (Preppy)
"During four years at Harvard Square, an unnatural fiber never went near her body (except for the shell of her L. L. Bean down vest). Her lacrosse game was ruthless, her brunch technique dazzling (smoked heavily and sat with the descendants of three presidents)."

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (Hipster)
"The tassels would still be dressing like June Cleaver.

Mata Hari (Hipster)
"She started her career as a nude dancer, then worked as a spy against the British, Germans and French during the First World War. She was executed by firing squad and never revealed who she was working for. Plus she was hot."

George Herbert Walker Bush (Preppy)
"Businessman, congressman, U.S. envoy to Peking, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, candidate for vice-president of the U.S. qualified for Prep Pantheon because of impeccable breeding and manners. Described by Ronald Reagan as 'a Preppy, a Yalie, a sissy.' "

HEADLINE: Much Is at Stake In Decision on TV Tower 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 What's really at stake in the proposed Bayonne/Jersey City television broadcast tower (Briefing, Dec. 22) is the restoration of next-generation digital television broadcasting and access to network and local channel HDTV programming that was destroyed by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. 
The New York area is the only large population center without such a broadcast facility (although CBS and Fox broadcast analog and digital from atop the Empire State Building). 
 Digital broadcasting and high-quality widescreen HDTV transmission will spur billions of dollars in retail sales of HDTV's and home theater peripherals. This affects local manufacturing, wholesale distribution and retail. It impacts jobs and a whole host of other economic factors. Clearly the decision that Bradley Campbell, the New Jersey commissioner of environmental protection, will soon make regarding the new tower will affect a great deal more than "700,000 homes without cable access."
