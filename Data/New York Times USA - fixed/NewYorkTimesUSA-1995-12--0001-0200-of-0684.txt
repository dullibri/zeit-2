HEADLINE: On a Day of Peace in Belfast, Faiths Join to Cheer Clinton

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Nov. 30

 BODY:
President Clinton ranged across a remarkably transformed Northern Ireland today, promising the once bitterly hostile Catholic and Protestant communities that if they persevered in their search for peace, "the United States of America will proudly stand with you."
Tens of thousands turned out to cheer Mr. Clinton, the first American President to visit Ulster, where 13 American presidents, from Andrew Jackson to Mr. Clinton himself, can trace their roots. 
 "There will always be those," the President said in his big speech of the day at the Mackie International textile-machinery plant in gritty West Belfast, "who define the worth of their lives not by who they are, but by who they aren't, not by what they're for but by what they are against. They will never escape the dead-end street of violence.
"But you, the vast majority, Protestant and Catholic alike, must not allow the ship of peace to sink on the rocks of old habits and hard grudges."
In the revived center of Belfast, defaced until recently by miles of barbed wire and hundreds of concrete-filled barrels that formed an awful monument to sectarian savagery, Mr. Clinton switched on the lights of a 45-foot-tall Christmas tree that he had brought from Nashville, Tenn., Belfast's twin city.
In the Falls Road and the Shankill Road, whose names became synonyms for murder and mayhem, he hopped from his limousine to chat with onlookers, shake hands and buy apples and oranges. Among those he greeted in the Falls Road and again tonight at a reception at Queens University was Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army.
And in Londonderry, where the "troubles" first flamed out of control in the 1960's, he inaugurated a new chair in Peace Studies at the University of Ulster. The chair is named for the late Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts, who worked in the 1970's and 80's to halt the collection of American money for weapons here. A blur of tiny American flags and shouts of "We want Bill!" greeted him outside the Guildhall in the old walled city.
It was Mr. Clinton's decision to grant a visa to Mr. Adams last year that gave the peace process a needed jolt of energy. From that time forward, the President has been more deeply involved than any of his predecessors in the intractable problems of this island, an involvement that caused him to cast aside the fears of other Presidents that a trip here might fray relations with the British.
Expressing amazement at the changes that have taken place, Mr. Clinton said that crossing the border with the Republic of Ireland to the south, once an ordeal of search and delay, "now is as easy as crossing a speed bump."
John Hume, a Catholic moderate widely revered for his reconciliation efforts, said the President's visit made this "the most historic day ever" for Ulster. He lavished praise on Mr. Clinton for his aid to economic development in Ulster and expressed thanks that "peace in our land has been central to his policy since the day he took office."
Ann Hanna, a Belfast Protestant who heard the President more than once today, said: "I didn't think his presence would do much good, but he was absolutely first class, and after listening to him, I think he will help people come together."
One American President in four traced his roots to Ulster; only England nurtured the families of more. But Mr. Clinton was the first sitting President to set foot in Northern Ireland when he landed this morning after a brief flight from London.
The Ulster leadership hailed his visit as a sign that the truce between the warring factions and the all-party talks that are scheduled for February signaled the approach of an era of peace and prosperity for this 5,267-square-mile enclave of British territory at the northeastern corner of Ireland.
Peace has so far brought modest economic benefits to Northern Ireland. In the last two weeks, 14 companies have announced $1.25 billion in new projects, and both the British Government and the European Union supply major subsidies.
But the overall unemployment rate is 11.5 percent, and in some neighborhoods it reaches 50 percent. The Union Jack and the Irish tricolor still fly in mute combat as symbols of the conflicting sympathies of various neighborhoods. There were police riflemen keeping watch today on the roof of the Mackie plant.
But fruits and vegetables, racks of clothing and other goods now spill onto once-desolate sidewalks in Belfast shopping streets, British Army patrols have all but disappeared and the checkpoints that blocked roads leading from the airport and the Catholic south have been dismantled.
The often-bombed Europa Hotel, where Mr. Clinton stayed tonight, has been refurbished, and the old Crown pub, celebrated by the poet John Betjeman as "the many-colored cavern," is crowded once more.
A new convention center for Belfast, a new Hilton hotel and a new concert hall are under construction on a large site near the River Lagan.
At the hangar-like Mackie plant, jammed with workers in coveralls, supervisors in long white coats and managers in business suits, Mr. Clinton took part in a kind of pageant celebrating the gains in Northern Ireland since the I.R.A. cease-fire on Aug. 31, 1994. The factory is considered a showplace for efforts to end widespread employment discrimination. It sits astride the line dividing Catholic from Protestant neighborhoods.
The company's chairman, Patrick R. Dougan, described it as a place "where men and women of all traditions have come together to work for prosperity, and through prosperity, for peace." A Catholic, he was followed by Ronnie Lewis, the senior shop steward for the Transport and General Workers' Union, a Protestant who seconded his call for sectarian cooperation in the search for lasting peace.
Then a 10-year-old Protestant boy, David Sterrett, and an 8-year-old Catholic girl, Catherine Hamill, jointly introduced the President, holding hands. David commented that peace "means I can play in the park without worrying about getting shot." Catherine said quietly that "my first daddy died in the troubles."
A big delegation of important Irish-Americans had been flown to Belfast from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Wednesday. Among those on hand were Senators Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and Connie Mack, Republican of Florida; the new president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., John Sweeney, and the authors Pat Conroy and William Kennedy.
In his speech, Mr. Clinton pressed all parties for rapid progress in the coming peace talks, asserting that "engaging in honest dialogue is not an act of surrender, it is an act of strength and common sense." He told them, "You must stand firm against terror."
Mr. Clinton also replied, in barely veiled terms, to those in Britain who have suggested that by involving the United States in the peace effort he was meddling in Britain's internal affairs.
Noting that he himself was of Ulster Scots stock as well as Irish stock, the President made this blunt argument:
"Because our greatness flows from the wealth of our diversity as well as the strength of the ideals we share in common, we feel bound to support others around the would who seek to bridge their own divides. This is an important part of our country's mission on the eve of the 21st century, because we know that the chain of peace that protects us grows stronger with every new link that is forged."
Only twice did he hear anything but an enthusiastic response. When he said that "those who do show the courage to break with the past are entitled to their stake in the future," which his audience took to mean that Mr. Adams and Sinn Fein must be rewarded, a 40-ish man in a blue suit in a back row said, "Never!" The same heckler said the same thing at another, similar point in the speech.
He was later identified as Cedric Wilson, a former city councilman in East Belfast, representing the radically anti-Catholic Democratic Unionist Party of the Rev. Ian Paisley. He regularly stages one-man demonstrations in this area.

HEADLINE: Alexander Takes Aim at G.O.P. Congress

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: KEOKUK, Iowa, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Congress has sunk so low in the public's esteem that Lamar Alexander has come full circle and is once again running vigorously against it.
The Republican takeover of the House and Senate a year ago blunted Mr. Alexander's attacks on Congress, once a chief theme of his long campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination. But he is now frequently urging voters to "cut their pay and send them home," trying to draw a bright line between himself and those he sees as his chief rivals for the nomination, Senators Bob Dole of Kansas and Phil Gramm of Texas. 
 "I don't think it helps our country to replace a Democratic arrogant empire with a Republican one," he told a breakfast meeting of the Chamber of Commerce today here on Iowa's southeastern tip, criticizing Republican legislation on welfare and crime.
Mr. Alexander, a former Governor of Tennessee and United States Secretary of Education, has sought all along to portray himself as a Washington outsider. That message, his strategists believe, is gaining heft as public opinion of Congress falls.
"Bill Clinton is just licking his chops at having the chance to run against one of our Republican senators from Washington, D.C.," Mr. Alexander repeatedly told voters in a three-day swing through Iowa, which will hold its caucuses on Feb. 12.
It is too early to tell whether Mr. Alexander's feistier attacks on Congress, combined with harsher criticism of President Clinton, will at last lift his well-financed and well-organized but stubbornly low-flying campaign. Recent polling has shown Mr. Dole with a substantial lead in Iowa. The other candidates are bunched in single digits, locked in what Brian Kennedy, the chairman of the state Republican Party, refers to as "the race for second place."
Still, Mr. Alexander's new message, or the new incarnation of his old one, is getting through to some Republican voters and leaders.
"Originally, I supported Dole," said State Representative Russell J. Eddie, the Republican chairman of the agriculture committee of the Iowa House of Representatives. "But many people are worried that Bob is just a little too old, and there's a question of whether Dole, being a Washington insider, can really beat Clinton."
Mr. Eddie said that Democratic attacks on Republican plans to change Medicare had alarmed elderly voters in Iowa. Voters are less likely to blame Mr. Alexander than Mr. Gramm or Mr. Dole for such changes, he said.
Indeed, Mr. Alexander has found an unlikely, accidental ally in President Clinton. He said in an interview that Mr. Dole would probably emerge weakened after struggling against Mr. Clinton to push through a Republican budget.
"Ironically, the better he does at that, the less likely it may be that he would be our best nominee against Bill Clinton next year," Mr. Alexander said.
Asked why, Mr. Alexander started to talk about the "ratings of the Republican Congress," before halting. "Well, let me put it positively," he said. He said that an outsider was "more likely to be able to carry the fight against Clinton than someone who's battered and bruised in a Congressional fight."
He added that he would "fully support" Mr. Dole in his efforts to balance the budget.
On the stump, Mr. Alexander also tars Mr. Gramm with guilt by association with Congress. And he derides Mr. Gramm's message as "the politics of anger," contrasting it with his vision of a "rising, shining America." Usually speaking without a lectern and in folksy terms, Mr. Alexander highlights his experience as a chief executive and Tennessee's economic growth during his two terms there, from 1979 to 1987.
To support his contention that the Republican race has narrowed to three candidates, Mr. Alexander points to the results of a Florida straw poll 12 days ago, in which he was third with 23 percent. Mr. Gramm was second with 26 percent, and Mr. Dole won with 33 percent.
But in Iowa the pack is more muddled. Mr. Kennedy, the party chairman, said that so far Mr. Alexander "just doesn't seem to stand out from the crowd." But his attacks on Congress could help, Mr. Kennedy said.
"Republican caucus-goers don't have the same level of angst about the Congress as they did before it became Republican," said Mr. Kennedy, who will not endorse a candidate. "But it's a good way for him to say: 'It doesn't matter who's controlling Congress, I won't be co-opted. I'll be the same outsider when I get there.' "
Mr. Alexander has spent more time in Iowa than any other Republican candidate save Morry Taylor, an industrialist from Michigan. But the national news organizations have been paying far less attention to the race here than in past contests, said Hugh Winebrenner, a professor of public administration at Drake University.
As a result, Mr. Alexander is still struggling for recognition, here and nationally.
"I thought I'd probably have a higher profile by now," Mr. Alexander acknowledged.
But he is probably being aided by another peculiarity of the Iowa race this year: Republican operatives say the powerful Christian Coalition is divided among several candidates. That could help Mr. Alexander, who has staked out a more moderate position on abortion rights.
Although he calls himself pro-life, he says the Federal Government should not regulate abortion. States should restrict it, he says, but cannot outlaw it completely because of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade.
Mr. Alexander rarely mentioned his abortion position in the last three days, emphasizing views and credentials that are more popular here. And when the chairman of the Butler County Republicans introduced him at a potluck dinner on Tuesday night as Ronald Reagan's Education Secretary, Mr. Alexander, who served under President George Bush, did not bother to correct him.

PATAKI TO RETAIN NURSING HOME QUOTAS
Governor Pataki announced that his administration would not repeal a regulation that requires hundreds of nursing homes across the state to set aside many of their beds for Medicaid recipients. A senior aide said that Mr. Pataki would not abolish the regulation because he was concerned about "unfair treatment to Medicaid recipients." The State Health Department had been reviewing a proposal to abolish the regulation. [Page A1.]

PARENTS FIGHT PLAN TO MOVE GIFTED PROGRAM
On its surface, the proposal seems barely capable of causing a ripple: Administrators of the community school district on the Upper West Side of Manhattan hope next fall to move a kindergarten class for "gifted and talented" students from an elementary school on West 84th Street to another one five blocks away. But parents at P.S. 9 are deeply suspicious that officials are trying to improve another school at their school's expense. [B3.]
 
HEARING EXAMINES CHILD ABUSE RULES

MAYOR ORDERS AGENCIES TO CUT 7.5%
Facing another looming budget gap, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ordered city agencies to prepare to cut spending by 7.5 percent for the fiscal year that begins in July. The Mayor's order eliminates 4,500 jobs through attrition, and raises the specter of more reductions in services used by millions of New Yorkers. [B4.]

HEADLINE: Aristide Insists He Will Leave Office When Term Ends

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Acting to end the widespread uncertainty over his political plans and the friction it has generated in Haiti's relations with the United States, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide said today that he would step down in February despite calls by his supporters that he remain in office for three more years.
"I kept saying a long time ago that I will be happy to go home on Feb. 7," Mr. Aristide said during an informal early morning meeting with foreign reporters in his office at the National Palace. 
 "I already did it, and I will continue to do it," he added, referring to earlier public statements that he would leave office rather than try to extend his term.
But in a wide-ranging, 75-minute conversation in English, Mr. Aristide also expressed dissatisfaction with the state of Haiti's relationship with the United States and the United Nations peacekeeping force here. He urged both to do more to help him disarm "extremists and professional terrorists," and said the withholding of American and other economic aid has contributed to a sudden resurgence of Haitian "boat people" sailing to Florida.
"It's a contradiction when on one side some friends are urging us to do our best to create jobs, while at the same time on the other side they are holding money which could be used to create jobs and keep the refugees here," Mr. Aristide said.
As President, he added, it is "our responsibility to urge those who say they are our friends to respect their promise" to help rebuild Haiti's economy.
Mr. Aristide has on numerous occasions indicated that he planned to leave office when his term expires, as required by the Constitution.
But he raised doubts about his intentions last week when he told a conference of cheering supporters here that "if you want three years, I will not turn my back on you."
Mr. Aristide said today that his remarks had been misinterpreted and that he had never considered remaining in power in order to recuperate the three years of his five-year term that he spent in exile following his ouster in a military coup on Sept. 30, 1991.
His intention, he said, was merely to calm potentially dangerous political passions and not to be seen as imposing his own will on the people.
To eliminate any lingering doubts about his position, Mr. Aristide's press office distributed a list of a half-dozen occasions on which the Haitian leader had publicly declared his intention to step down.
"When I say something, I do my best to respect my word," he said when asked about his credibility.
Mr. Aristide's remarks appeared to clear the way for Haiti to go ahead with a presidential election scheduled for Dec. 17, which had been in doubt as a result of the confusion over the President's own plans. Rene Preval, the candidate of Mr. Aristide's Lavalas party and a former Prime Minister, is the frontrunner in that race, and the President made his own sympathies obvious.
It is part of his job, he acknowledged, "to support all the candidates in terms of being neutral." But, he added, "Lavalas is Lavalas, so I am around the table," a reference to the party's symbol of four people seated at a table. "I cannot deny it."
Mr. Preval has said he wants to govern "hand in hand" with Mr. Aristide, whose personal relationship with him is so close that, as Mr. Aristide pointed out today, "they used to call us twins." But the Haitian President said he is not willing to serve as Mr. Preval's Prime Minister, and appeared to rule out accepting any formal post in the next administration.
"I don't think it is necessary," he said. "I can still serve without having an official role."
Still, Mr. Aristide gave every indication that he intended to remain a political force and a sort of sounding board for the impoverished masses that form his base of support.
"I will do my best to be a good citizen," he said. "In my mind, it is better for me to be home in a peaceful context -- to read, to write, to listen to the people."
Mr. Aristide also rebuffed suggestions that an impassioned speech of his, delivered at the funeral of a slain relative and political associate earlier this month, was responsible for a subsequent outbreak of political violence. By speaking so emphatically and mobilizing the people, he said, he prevented paramilitary groups from "attacking some priests" and plunging the country into turmoil.
"I will not tolerate this kind of killing," he said, even if it meant incurring criticism from the United States and other allies. "We can't tolerate professional terrorists, extremists. We have to disarm them."
Mr. Aristide indicated that the question of Haitian boat people and how to deal with them is another area where he and Washington differ. Early last year, while still in exile in Washington, he abrogated an agreement that allowed the United States to send Haitians picked up at sea back home, but the full impact of that decision is only being felt now.
Speaking of the Coast Guard's repatriation of more than 1,100 Haitian boat people in the last week, Mr. Aristide said "it is illegal" because of the lack of a treaty and complained that "we are not consulted.
Mr. Aristide said that Haitians have again begun leaving the country in recent weeks "because of the economic situation," which has been worsened by the suspensions of American aid.

HEADLINE: Orders for Durables Fell 1% in October

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Led by plunging demand for aircraft, orders to United States factories for expensive, long-lasting goods fell 1 percent in October, the first drop in three months.
The Commerce Department said today that the decline pushed durable-goods orders down to a seasonally adjusted $167.3 billion. 
 Orders had risen 2.9 percent in September and 5.1 percent in August. The last time they fell was in July, when they were off 1.8 percent.
"The economy, after a very strong summer, seems to be softening again," said David Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill, a forecasting service in Lexington, Mass. "Frankly, it looks like very mediocre Christmas."
Half the October decline was in transportation goods, as falling orders for aircraft and parts led a 10.5 percent plunge in this volatile category. The decrease all but wiped out a 10.6 percent advance for transportation equipment in September.
In another report, the Labor Department said the number of American workers filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 16,000 last week, the largest drop in nine weeks.
Analysts had predicted the October drop in durable goods, although many expected it to be even steeper. The economy over all has been expanding at a modest pace in recent months, they said.
New orders were 8.2 percent higher in October than for the corresponding period a year earlier. In an up-and-down year, orders fell in six of the first 10 months.
The Commerce Department said that excluding transportation durable-goods orders rose 2.3 percent in October, compared with a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent for the previous month.
Orders for military equipment fell 18.4 percent last month. Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft fell 3.7 percent in October. Unfilled orders rose six-tenths of 1 percent last month, to $439.6 billion, the third gain in the last four months.
Shipments in October fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $164.7 billion, following two straight increases.

Usually when families or companies or even governments think about budgets, the main issue is money -- how much is in the till, how much will be spent and how those two figures relate to each other.
But the big budget showdown this year between President Clinton and Congress is much more about principles. Because splitting the difference is impossible, compromise could be more difficult to achieve. 
 Some of the issues involved:
*Should balancing the budget in precisely seven years become a fundamental tenet of governing or merely a goal?
*How much should Federal taxes be lowered, and how much of a tax break should the wealthy get?
*Should the Medicare system be overhauled, and should the elderly have to pay more for their coverage?
*Should the Federal Government continue to guarantee basic assistance to poor people under Medicaid, Aid to Families With Dependent Children and food stamps or should this mostly become the responsibility of the states?
*Should the Federal role in education, training and the development of technology be expanded or contracted?
*Should commercial interests be given greater access to natural resources on public land?
To understand the budget negotiations now under way between the President and Congress, it is essential to grasp this philosophical distinction: The Republicans who control Congress want to shrink the Federal Government and reduce its presence in the lives of Americans; the President, for the most part, is comfortable with the place of the Government in American life and in some instances would like to expand it.
It is also important to understand the basic differences on these issues:
 
A Balanced Budget
 The Republicans have made the vow to balance the budget in exactly seven years -- not six years or eight years -- the most crucial element in their budget plan, the one item they consider nonnegotiable.
In the Contract With America, their campaign manifesto last year, the Republicans promised a constitutional amendment to accomplish a balanced budget by 2002. The amendment failed by one vote to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate. So the Republicans set about accomplishing the task legislatively.
At a breakfast with reporters two weeks ago, Speaker Newt Gingrich was asked why seven years was so important. He replied, "Seven is the longest period in which you can maintain the discipline to insist on it happening."
And what is the basis for that view?
"Intuition," Mr. Gingrich answered.
Last June, Mr. Clinton offered a revised budget plan that he said would lead to a balanced budget in 10 years. Later, the White House said the economy had improved enough that the President's plan would reach the goal in nine years.
To prepare such long-term budgets, both sides were forced to make predictions, by their nature exercises in uncertainty, about the state of the economy years in advance.
The economic outlook the Administration relied on to write the President's program is slightly more optimistic than the one used by Congress. Because of compounding, the small differences in predictions about such matters as how fast the economy will grow each year mean that hundreds of billions of dollars of additional spending cuts would eventually be necessary to meet the seven-year target using the Republican forecasts. The Congressional Budget Office is in the process of reviewing its economic assumptions. The prevailing view is that its new forecasts will be more favorable than the ones Congress initially used but not so optimistic as the ones used by the White House.
In the agreement the President and Republican leaders signed last week to end the partial shutdown of the Government, Mr. Clinton accepted the notion of a balanced budget in seven years as long as it was consistent with what he called his values and principles. But from what Mr. Clinton and his assistants have said since the agreement was signed, it is clear that they regard a balanced budget in seven years as a goal, not a commitment in concrete.
 
A Tax Break
 This is an area where compromise may be reachable. Congress would cut taxes by $245 billion over seven years, $140 billion more than the President proposed. But Republican leaders have suggested that they might be willing to trim their sights.
Both would give a tax break to middle-income families with children. Both would expand eligibility for tax-favored individual retirement accounts.
The main difference is that Republicans would reduce the tax on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments, to 19.8 percent from 28 percent, a step that would make the capital gains rate the lowest in more than 40 years. Most of the direct benefit from that change would be received by affluent taxpayers because they hold most stocks, bonds and other financial assets.
 
Medicaid and Medicare
 Congress would restrain the growth of spending for Medicare by $270 billion and for Medicaid by $163 billion. The President maintains that savings that large are impossible without destroying the programs. His savings would be $124 billion for Medicare, the program for the elderly and disabled, and $54 billion for Medicaid, the program for the poor and for two-thirds of all people in nursing homes.
But as in other areas, the dispute is about more than money.
The President would not make fundamental changes in either program. In a letter to Congressional leaders last week, the White House insisted that Medicare beneficiaries, who are mostly retirees, be protected from any additional out-of-pocket costs, that resources available to them keep pace with the growth in private health care costs and that Medicaid remain a Federal program guaranteeing coverage for poor families with children and residents of nursing homes.
By contrast, the legislation approved by Congress would place a ceiling on how much could be spent each year under Medicare. So the elderly would no longer be assured of having all the treatment and services they wanted.
Medicare beneficiaries would be encouraged to enroll in managed care programs and to invest in a new form of savings account that would keep them protected against catastrophic illness but might require them to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars for ordinary medical expenses. The elderly would also be required to pay higher premiums for insurance covering doctor bills and other outpatient expenses.
For Medicaid, Congress would have the Federal Government pay the states an annual lump sum, called a block grant, and the states would then decide who was eligible for which benefits. No longer would families with incomes below a certain level be guaranteed medical care or nursing home residents be assured that the Government would pay the bill if they ran out of their own money.
 
Redefining Welfare
 Congress would end the 60-year-old Federal guarantee of cash assistance for poor children through Aid to Families With Dependent Children. This program would be turned over to the states. The Federal contribution through block grants would be limited. Strict time limits would be placed on how long families could remain on welfare. Assistance would be withheld from children born to poor, unmarried women under 18 and in some instances to children born to women already on welfare.
Spending on food stamps would be 15 percent below what would be expected without changes in the law, and benefits would no longer be adjusted annually for inflation or be allowed to rise as much as necessary to cover all poor people fully during recessions. Restrictions would also be placed on school lunches and other nutrition programs for children.
President Clinton's position on welfare has fluctuated. But his current view is that the Republican plan bites too deeply into cash assistance, child nutrition, child care and food stamps. He has accepted the principle of allowing states to set eligibility requirements and benefit levels. But he would substitute measures that would have the effect of continuing the programs as Federal entitlements for the poor.
Republicans are so sure they are on the right side of this issue politically that they plan to break out the welfare portion from the big budget legislation and pass it separately. They believe they will gain an advantage if President Clinton vetoes welfare legislation specifically and not just as part of the overall budget.
 
The Cost of an Education
 This is an area where Republicans want to limit the Federal role, and President Clinton wants to expand it. Congress would cut education spending by about 15 percent in the next seven years. President Clinton would like to increase spending by 18 percent.
The biggest difference arises in programs like Head Start for preschool children, aid to elementary and secondary schools with large numbers of poor children, student loans and scholarship grants to low-income college students.
 
The Environmental Debate
 Republicans hope to give loggers, miners, ranchers and oil and gas drillers freer access to develop natural resources on public lands. They would also cut financing for enforcement of laws against air and water pollution. President Clinton opposes these measures. He finds especially objectionable the Republican plans to increase logging in Alaska's Tongass National Forest and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.

HEADLINE: Councilman to Take New Post

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Charles Millard, a Republican City Councilman from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, has been selected by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to be president of the Economic Development Corporation. The Mayor is scheduled to make the announcement today at City Hall.
The corporation tries to encourage business growth in the city and attract and retain private-sector jobs. Mr. Millard, 38, will replace Clay B. Lifflander, who resigned in August to become president of Millbrook Management, an investment company with holdings in wineries owned by John S. Dyson, Mr. Giuliani's Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development. 
 Mr. Millard's resignation will open up a battle for the seat. A Councilman since 1991, he ran for Congress last year against Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat.
Since Mr. Lifflander's resignation last summer, Mr. Millard has been said by administration officials to have lobbied fiercely for the position. But, the officials said, there had been strong resistance from Mr. Dyson, who is said to have wanted someone with a broad background in investment banking and experience in economic development deals.
But Mr. Millard, who is closely allied with State Senator Roy M. Goodman and the Liberal Party leader Raymond B. Harding, both confidants of the Mayor, ultimately prevailed. The position has an annual salary of $110,000.
A graduate of College of the Holy Cross and Columbia Law School, Mr. Millard was a lawyer with Davis Polk & Wardwell in Manhattan for five years. This year, he became managing director at Cambridge Partners, an investment banking firm.
The opening created by Mr. Millard's resignation from the Council has already attracted several candidates to fill the $55,000-a-year seat in a district that includes the neighborhoods of Yorkville and Sutton Place as well as Roosevelt Island.
The candidates include Mr. Millard's director of constituent services, Judith G. Marcus, and A. Gifford Miller, who is New York chief of staff for Ms. Maloney. Others are George N. Spitz, a longtime political gadfly, and Jack Lester, a lawyer specializing in community issues.
The City Charter calls for a special election within 45 days of a vacancy on the Council.

HEADLINE: Rough-Edged Russian Liberal Rides High

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Democracy seems imperiled in Russia. Communists and nationalists are on the rise, the battered and increasingly corrupt presidency of Boris N. Yeltsin is backing away from economic reform. The spirit of Andrei D. Sakharov, the late physicist and dissident who is a Gandhi-like figure in Russia, has dimmed.
There is a leading candidate in the December parliamentary elections who is running as Russian democracy's last hope. The candidate, Grigory A. Yavlinsky, 43, a Harvard-trained economist, says he can reverse the mistakes of the Yeltsin Government and put the country back on the path to democracy and economic reform. 
 He frequently names Dr. Sakharov as his role model. Asked in a recent interview if he really meant to liken himself to the man known as Russia's conscience, Mr. Yavlinsky shrugged impatiently. "Well," he said. "I'm not a physicist."
Mr. Yavlinsky is famous for his energy, his intelligence and his outsized ego.
His party, Yabloko, is likely to win the greatest number of liberal seats in Parliament, and Mr. Yavlinsky is treating the December elections as a springboard for a presidential race in 1996. For now, he is the only democratic opposition candidate with a passing chance: he stands for free-market reform while still remaining untainted by the unpopular policies of the Yeltsin administration.
Mr. Yavlinsky is campaigning on a platform of radical economic reform that is sugarcoated with populist promises, and his ratings in public opinion polls are as high as those of any of his rivals.
"You have to assure voters that reforms will improve their lives," he said. "Do you like the tax system? Then we have to reform it. Do you like not being paid, do you like crime on the streets? What we have now is not reform -- we have liberated the Soviet system instead of liberating society from the Soviet system."
Mr. Yavlinsky, who in 1989 co-wrote a blueprint for radical economic reform that Mikhail S. Gorbachev never carried out, was not offered a prominent role in the early Yeltsin Government, and he turned down lesser jobs. He kept a distance from the Government's policies, and as the election approaches, he is increasingly critical of them and their architect, Yegor T. Gaidar, a liberal economist who was Mr. Yeltsin's Acting Prime Minister at the height of the reforms.
A frequent visitor to the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, Mr. Yavlinsky, who speaks English fluently, is admired by politicians, academics and opinion-makers in Cambridge and Washington.
At home, his image is more complex. "Grigory is fascinating, he's a character straight out of Dostoyevsky," said Alla Gerber, a member of Parliament from Mr. Gaidar's party, Russia's Choice. "He isn't driven to kill an old woman, like Raskolnikov," she added with a laugh, "but to become President."
Mr. Yavlinsky's uncloaked ambition -- and particularly his determination to leave Mr. Gaidar in his wake -- bedevils his natural constituency of intellectuals, teachers and white-collar professionals who still feel loyal to Mr. Gaidar, the foremost post-Soviet radical economic reformer.
Mr. Gaidar, who is widely blamed for the drop in living standards and deepening inequities that followed economic policies begun in 1992, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, is the favorite scapegoat of Communists, but he has become a kind of Adlai Stevenson figure to Moscow liberals.
At times, the relationship of Yabloko and Russia's Choice has resembled that of an unhappy couple. The needy Mr. Gaidar keeps struggling to make peace with a stern, hypercritical Mr. Yavlinsky. Whenever reconciliation seem imminent, as it did when the two appeared to strike a deal on a television program last May, Mr. Yavlinsky abruptly pulls out the rug. The next morning, he issued a terse statement that he had changed his mind.
Mr. Yavlinsky has a short answer for why he is refuses to join forces with the only other major liberal party. "The easiest explanation," he said, "is that the polls say that if I join Mr. Gaidar I will lose 46 percent of my voters."
But at times, he can seem more preoccupied with measuring himself against Mr. Gaidar than battling more fearsome competitors, like the Communist leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov or the nationalist Gen. Aleksandr I. Lebed.
"I can't just campaign for intellectuals sitting around the kitchen table in Moscow," he lamented. "I listen to them, but I don't always take their advice, so they call me arrogant."
He painted his relationship with Russia's intellectual elite as a painful family drama. "It's like they are my parents -- I say 'I'd cut off my right hand for you, but I cannot always do what you want me to do.' "
Yelena G. Bonner, Dr. Sakharov's widow, seems to view Mr. Yavlinsky more as a wayward nephew than a son. "What worries me is that Yavlinsky seems to be moving from serious economics at a rather drastic speed to populism," she said, referring to Mr. Yavlinsky's vows to raise pensions and wages without increasing inflation. Mr. Yavlinsky says he will raise the money painlessly by closing tax loopholes on Government monopolies.
Miss Bonner said she will support Mr. Gaidar's party in the December elections because he took the plunge and made bold, difficult economic choices at a critical moment in Russian history and stood by them. Mr. Yavlinsky, she said, "has not been tested."
That has mostly worked in his favor until now. One of Yabloko's political advertisements carries a message that is not that different from that of Communists or nationalists.
A handsome young man in a construction hard hat looks soberly into the camera and says, "Paying pensions on time is not a matter of politics, it's a matter of conscience." He pauses grimly, then adds, "We shall hold the powers that be accountable."
Mr. Yavlinsky has detractors, but even his harshest critics concede that he may be the strongest candidate liberals have. One of the only nationally known candidates willing to engage in public debates, Mr. Yavlinsky went one-on-one with Mr. Zyuganov last week, and by common consensus deftly ripped the Communist's arguments to shreds.
These days, Mr. Yavlinsky is more of a politician than an economic purist, and it has cost him support within his own party.
Yuri Y. Boldyrev, a founder of Yabloko, recently quit over policy disputes with Mr. Yavlinsky. Mr. Boldyrev, an economist who is a member of the upper house of Parliament, the Federation Council, is particularly upset about Mr. Yavlinsky's support of a proposed law that would make it easier for the Government to sell off natural resources to domestic and foreign investors.
Yabloko, the Yeltsin administration and even foreign financial institutions like the World Bank support the measure as a way of quickly increasing state revenues. Mr. Boldyrev complains that some of the law's provisions would also encourage the kind of Government corruption and sweetheart deals that are already rampant in Russia.
Without Mr. Boldyrev, Yabloko is more than ever a one-man show, and can sometimes mirror Mr. Yavlinsky's restless, overconfident personality. Yabloko was almost knocked off the ballot this year after the Central Election Committee disqualified it for failing to turn in minor registration paperwork.
An uproar followed, as most political parties denounced it as a conspiracy, and Mr. Gaidar said he would not run if Mr. Yavlinsky could not. The issue was forced into the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Mr. Yavlinsky.
The flap won Mr. Yavlinsky plenty of free air time and press attention, but it was also underlined the disarray within his political organization.
There are other issues simmering beneath the surface that could cost him votes. Mr. Yavlinsky is half-Jewish in a country where there is still a strong strain of anti-Semitism. He has been more open about it than many other public officials, and caused a stir when he candidly discussed his Jewish roots on a highly rated national television talk show last February.
But there is tension between Mr. Yavlinsky's desire to be honest and his understanding of the political undercurrents in his country.
When asked during a recent appearance at a military base why a Jew should be elected to high office in Russia, Mr. Yavlinsky deflected the question. If people think that Jews have done so much to destroy Russia, he replied, "maybe it will take a Jew to rebuild it."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 1996, Friday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about Russian politics referred imprecisely to the academic background of Grigory A. Yavlinsky, liberal economist and candidate for the Russian presidency. Two readers have pointed out that although he has worked with Harvard professors, he did not attend Harvard University and should not have been described as Harvard-trained. (A profile on Dec. 1, 1995, which served as a source for the latest article, included the same error.)

HEADLINE: Billionaire's Gift Helps Columbia to Exceed Its Fund-Raising Goal

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
Alfred Lerner is one of America's wealthiest men, with a net worth of $1 billion gained in real estate and banking. But he started life in the back of a Queens candy store run by his parents. Looking back, he credits his four years as an undergraduate at Columbia University with setting him on a path toward many of life's riches.
"Whatever good fortune I have, Columbia was part of that, so I owe them something," said Mr. Lerner, 62, the chairman and chief executive of the MBNA Corporation, one of the nation's largest credit-card issuing companies. 
 Mr. Lerner, in fact, decided he owed Columbia about $25 million. And with a gift in that amount, as well as tens of thousands of others from grateful alumni, Columbia will announce today that it has surpassed its five-year goal of raising $1.15 billion. Rather than taking a breather as most universities do, it plans to exploit momentum and buttonhole enough moguls and dial enough alumni to raise another billion before the century is through.
The robust flavor of the announcement seemed to broadcast the university's belief that it has worked its way out of the troubles that culminated roughly five years ago, when several unbalanced budgets forced it to bite into its endowment and close a few departments. Its drawing power, some national experts say, seemed to slip sometime after the student demonstrations of the late 1960's as more students tended to spurn urban universities, some of its alumni left the New York City area -- the base of 35 percent of Columbia's student body -- and colleges like Stanford, Duke and Rice gained new appeal.
But in the last two years, officials said, the school has a 29 percent surge in applications and has balanced its budget.
"Columbia College is becoming one of the hot schools in America," said Dr. George Rupp, the university's president, in an address he plans to deliver tonight to benefactors. "Many of the best students increasingly want to be here. They want to be in the world's media center; they want to be near the financial markets; they want the exciting arts and cultural richness; they want to live in a diverse community that is at the heart of a profoundly dynamic global economy."
The $1.15 billion will be put to a multitude of uses, though almost half of it is to go to operate the university and help avoid increases in tuition, room and board, which now total $27,126 a year for Columbia College. And Dr. Rupp disclosed that the college, the smallest of the Ivy League schools with 3,400 undergraduate students, is contemplating expanding its enrollment by roughly 10 percent.
Butler Library, among the world's largest collections of books, will be spruced up at a cost of $160 million and carried further into the digital age.
The School of Arts will be renovated with a $6 million gift from artist LeRoy Neiman. More than a hundred professorships will be given stable endowments that officials said would help hold down tuition.
And Ferris Booth Hall will be torn down and replaced with a sunnier, more spacious student center named after, yes, Mr. Lerner.
The new $2.2 billion goal stretched over the 10 years of the 1990's is the largest fund-raising target any American college has ever projected, though Harvard's $2.1 billion goal would be achieved in half the time.
Columbia University, which was founded in 1754 as Kings College, has a $2.2 billion endowment, the nation's seventh largest, though still one-third the size of the leader, Harvard. It has 20,200 graduate and undergraduate students and 2,350 full-time faculty members and remains one of the nation's most competitive institutions. Its college admitted 23.4 percent of the 8,714 students who applied last year, and 43 percent of those chose to attend.
The $1.15 billion raised since the campaign was begun in the fall of 1990 by Michael I. Sovern, then the Columbia president, was made up of 300,000 donations. They ranged from a dollar to such gifts as $85 million contributed by John W. Kluge, chairman of the Metromedia Company, for minority scholarships and faculty development, and $10 million donations each by two leading trustees, Jerry Speyer, president and chief executive officer of Tishman Speyer Properties, and Lionel I. Pincus, chairman and chief executive of E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company.
Amassing this money required a mixture of tact, stamina and plain audacity. Dr. Rupp traveled to Asia and Europe to meet with prosperous alumni identified by the college's development office. He schmoozed with alumni, trying to determine some university function that they favored, like gene-therapy research or the library.
"Giving is highly personal," Dr. Rupp said. "People go back to first principles. We ask what are our deepest values. What do we hold most dear, what are we grateful for."
The trustees themselves made rounds of telephone calls and burnished chairs at many a dinner party.
"I have no compunction to ask on behalf of the university," said Mr. Speyer, who is chairman of its board of trustees.
Mr. Speyer, in fact, was on the receiving end of a full-court press by the college president, looking for a sizable gift.
"I had something else in mind, and George made the case that it was important for the trustees and the other people involved in the university to show their support in a major way," Mr. Speyer said.
Columbia, after all, was the place where Mr. Speyer met three of his lifelong friends as well as an art professor who helped him acquire the sensibility to gather his impressive art collection.
"My family's first, my business is second, but the third interest I have is art, and I was first exposed to art at Columbia and I've been collecting for 30 years," Mr. Speyer said.
Although gifts would have come in annually in any case, colleges like to create campaigns with specific deadlines, said Henry King, former chairman of the board of trustees, because they "generate a certain amount of excitement."
"Alumni are mobilized to reach a target and strive for it," he said.
Spending the money also involved some hard choices. The college decided not to renovate Ferris Booth because it would still end up with an inadequate center for a growing student body and because it did not reflect the rest of the campus's architectural style. But tearing Ferris Booth down will now mean that for three years students will have to use temporary prefabricated buildings for many activities.
In debating what to do about Butler Library, Dr. Rupp recalled, some trustees argued that in the computer age, it was a white elephant and a "monument to past scholarly habits."
Still, he said he found the whole fund-raising process exhilarating.
"People express what they care about even more than money because, after all, they're giving money away," he said.

HEADLINE: Castro All Hugs and Kisses On First Visit to Old Ally

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Fidel Castro began a visit to China today to embrace fellow leaders of one of the world's last Communist-run nations, and to find a willing ally in his defiance of the United States.
The Cuban President, a belated convert to market reforms since aid from the Soviet Union dried up, and perhaps eager for a new source of handouts, enthusiastically praised China's economic miracle. 
 But the timing of his visit, with China's relations with the United States strained, suggested that it was welcomed by the Chinese as a way to assert diplomatic independence from America, increasingly seen by some Chinese leaders as its nemesis because of disputes over trade, Taiwan and human rights.
Mr. Castro, wearing his trademark olive military uniform, embraced the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, complete with three kisses, for television cameras, apparently trying to convince the world that they are old friends.
It is Mr. Castro's first visit to China. Despite decades of proclaiming Communist solidarity, the Cuban's close alliance with Moscow prevented him from becoming too friendly with China.
At a signing ceremony for a small increase in Chinese economic aid to Cuba, Mr. Castro seemed to charm his hosts by gracefully uttering two Chinese words "Xie xie" -- "thank you" -- in response to Mr. Jiang's "gracias."
Chinese-Cuban trade hovers around a relatively small $500 million, and the new economic aid that was announced today includes just a $3 million economic grant and the increase in a science and technology grant from $5 million to $8 million.
A state-run Chinese newspaper praised Cuba for its defiance of the United States today.
"China and Cuba both are socialist countries and both have experience facing 'blockades' and 'sanctions,' " the Jingji Ribao, or Economic Daily, said today. "But the two countries do not fear blockades or strangleholds."
Mr. Castro went out of his way to flatter his hosts with a nod to Deng Xiaoping's statement about building "socialism with Chinese characteristics" to justify market reforms and private ownership in a Communist-run nation.
"Cuba is carrying out steady reform and opening, with a view toward building socialism with Cuban characteristics," Mr. Castro said at a three-hour meeting with Mr. Jiang, according to the official New China News Agency. "We'll continue to march forward along such a road."

HEADLINE: Iraq Sanctions Kill Children, U.N. Reports

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 30

 BODY:
As many as 576,000 Iraqi children may have died since the end of the Persian Gulf war because of economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council, according to two scientists who surveyed the country for the Food and Agriculture Organization.
The study also found steeply rising malnutrition among the young, suggesting that more children will be at risk in the coming years. The results of the survey will appear on Friday in The Lancet, the journal of the British Medical Association. 
 "I had a sense that the situation had gotten worse, but I didn't think that there would be such a dramatic difference," said Mary Smith Fawzi, a researcher at the Harvard University School of Public Health, who conducted the survey for the Food and Agriculture Organization. The co-author is Sarah Zaidi, science director of the Center for Social and Economic Rights in New York.
Dr. Fawzi, who surveyed 2,120 children under 10 years of age in 25 neighborhoods in Baghdad in August, said 28 percent were stunted in growth, up from 12 percent in 1991.
In 1991, she said in an interview, rates of malnutrition in Iraq were similar to those in Kuwait. In the paper for The Lancet, she says Iraq has now sunk to the levels of poor developing countries, with underweight rates among children comparable to those in Ghana or Mali.
The percentage of Iraqi children affected by "wasting," or emaciation requiring urgent attention, rose to 12 percent in 1995, from 3 percent in 1991, Dr. Fawzi reported, adding that these figures are extraordinarily high, similar to those found in Malagasy and Myanmar.
Several United Nations agencies, including F.A.O. and Unicef, have expressed concern about the damage being done to Iraqis, especially children, by United Nations economic sanctions. Two years ago, F.A.O. warned that Iraq risked widespread starvation.
The Security Council responded to these concerns earlier this year when it offer Iraq the opportunity to sell $2 billion worth of oil to purchase food and medicines under United Nations supervision, the second such offer in four years. Iraq rejected both as infringements of its sovereignty and has continued to demand an unconditional end to sanctions.
The sanctions were imposed by the Security Council after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Led by the United States, the Council has rejected many Iraqi appeals to lift the restrictions, which have crippled the economy, until Iraq accounts for all its weapons of mass destruction and United Nations inspectors can certify that they have been destroyed in accordance with several Council resolutions.
Recent revelations about significant secret biological and chemical weapons programs have set back any chances of an early end of sanctions.
In 1991, after the war ended, Dr. Fawzi and other researchers found that mortality rates for children under five had tripled during the war and its immediate aftermath. By this year, the rate had increased fivefold.
Deaths related to diarrheal diseases have tripled in an increasingly unhealthy environment, the study says. Water and sanitation systems have deteriorated, hospitals are functioning at 40 percent of capacity, food prices are high and many people are living on Government rations that provide only 1,000 calories a day.
Infant deaths, which had doubled during the gulf war, continue at a high rate, Dr. Fawzi wrote.
"These findings illustrate a strong association between economic sanctions and increase in child mortality and malnutrition rates," the study says.
"The United Nations humanitarian arm offers palliatives for the alleviation of suffering while the U.N. Security Council is intent on continuing the sanctions," the authors write, adding that the situation poses a challenge to "the moral, financial and political standing of the international community."

HEADLINE: Cleaning Up Carting Together

 BODY:
Garbage removal has been a scandal in New York almost since the city "privatized" commercial carting more than four decades ago. Costs are wildly out of line -- perhaps three times as steep as in Chicago or Los Angeles. The owners of 23 carting companies and their trade organizations are under indictment for extortion and restraint of trade.
Yesterday the city's political and law enforcement leaders joined to call for a new commission that would regulate and license the city's carters. It was a good and rare day for New York, in which Mayor Rudolph Giuliani showed an unusual willingness to share the podium with political rivals like Public Advocate Mark Green and City Council Speaker Peter Vallone. Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau was another welcome participant, expressing an uncharacteristic willingness to share some of his turf. 
 The proposal that drew all those normally fractious officials to City Hall would create an agency with unprecedented authority over the carters. It would have the power to audit the carting companies' records, investigate the backgrounds of their employees and set standards for service. It could set maximum fees and run pilot programs in which the agency itself would choose one or more carters to do business in an entire district.
The idea of letting the city award district carting rights to one or more companies is the most controversial part of the bill. Ideally, it will be used only as a tool to lure more companies into bidding for carting work, and to embolden businesses to award their contracts to reputable low bidders. Clean and open competition should be the ultimate goal, not legalized monopolies.
The bill will almost certainly pass early next year, and then face a series of court challenges from the carting industry. The city's task in defending its plan is made much easier by Mr. Morgenthau, whose investigators spent five years infiltrating the carting industry, spending $800,000 on extortion payments themselves along the way.
Mr. Green deserves special praise for his long fight to clean up commercial carting. There was a danger the Mayor would torpedo the Public Advocate's crusade solely because of its source. Speaker Vallone and the City Council member Kenneth Fisher of Brooklyn played important roles in brokering an agreement.
The city's new commission will have about 80 employees, drawn from existing agencies like Consumer Affairs, Sanitation and police. Mayor Giuliani says this new initiative will not cost the city any extra money. But if it does, it would still be worth it. City businesses spend $1.5 billion a year for garbage removal, and Mr. Morgenthau has charged that about 40 percent of that is due to the existence of a Mafia-run cartel that sets prices and drives off competition. When it comes to improving the economic climate in New York, cleaning up the carting industry would be worth more than a hefty tax cut.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Germany Doesn't Change Rates, But Dollar Still Gains vs. Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose to a two-month high against the German mark yesterday, holding on to gains even after the Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged.
While a number of currency traders were expecting a rate cut after the German central bank's policy meeting today, many still hold out hopes of a rate cut soon, given Germany's flagging economic growth and moderate inflation. 
 "My general outlook for the dollar is bullish, particularly on dollar-mark," said Charles Spence, director of currency sales at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. "Even though the Bundesbank didn't change rates today, prospects are that it will happen soon."
The dollar initially dipped after the Bundesbank left its discount rate, which acts as the floor for German money market rates, unchanged at 3.5 percent. The slump proved short-lived, though, as investors wagered a rate cut merely had been deferred. The Bundesbank's policy-setting council will hold its next meeting, the last of this year, on Dec. 14.
The dollar also benefited because "U.S. stock and bond markets are doing so well," said Bob Gruber, senior currency salesman at the Chemical Bank.
The dollar rose as high as 1.4507 marks, its strongest since Sept. 21, when it reached 1.4637 marks. In New York late yesterday, it settled at 1.4470 marks, up from 1.4366 marks on Wednesday. The dollar rose to 102.15 Japanese yen from 101.58 yen. The British pound slipped to $1.5325 from $1.5336.
In other trading, the French franc slumped against the dollar and the mark as a series of strikes threatened to worsen the economic slowdown in France.
"There is a fundamental conflict" between the Government trying to cut the budget deficit, reduce unemployment and buoy the franc, said Graham Broyd, manager of currency sales at the National Westminster Bank in New York. "Those don't go together. As a result, the market keeps going back to haunting the French franc."
The weakness in the franc apparently helped persuade the Bank of France to leave two important interest rates unchanged. The central bank left the intervention rate, the floor to French money-market rates, at 4.8 percent, and the securities-repurchase rate, the ceiling to money-market rates, at 6.10 percent.
The dollar was last at 4.9970 French francs, up from 4.9445 francs on Wednesday. The mark was at 3.4553 francs, up from 3.4370 francs. Earlier, the dollar rose to 5.0049 francs, its highest level since Sept. 21.

Going Nowhere Fast

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
A two-year study of fast-food-restaurant employees in Harlem and Oakland, Calif., has found that young people from the inner city benefit substantially from the work, despite the low wages, but there usually is no "next tier" of employment to which they can climb by using the skills they have learned or honed in the restaurants.
This absence of employment at the next step up, according to two professors of anthropology who conducted the study, makes it extremely difficult for the inner-city youngsters, who are not well educated, to work their way out of poverty. 
 "The kids have mixed feelings," said Prof. Katherine Newman of Columbia University, who studied the Harlem workers. "They feel that if they work hard at this it will lead somewhere. But their experience is that it doesn't."
The point of the study was to look closely at the lives of the working poor at a time when much of the attention of government and the media is focused on poor people who are not working. Professor Newman and her colleague, Prof. Carol Stack of the University of California at Berkeley, who did the Oakland study, said the fast-food workers were representative of the majority of the urban poor -- men and women who are working at jobs that even on a full-time basis do not pay enough to adequately support a family.
What they found is that the competition for even minimum-wage jobs is intense. At the restaurants studied in Harlem, 14 applicants are turned away for every person who is hired.
In contrast to the persistent canard that poor people do not want to work, Professors Newman and Stack have shown that people are fighting for jobs that, full time, pay only $8,840 a year.
Most of the 400 workers studied were in their 20's. Most were members of families that would have trouble remaining intact without the workers' financial contributions. Many belonged to families in which there were serious and sometimes disabling illnesses. Many had endured the loss of close relatives to premature death.
The professors found that the fast-food jobs for these young people were helpful on a number of fronts. They provided a meager but crucial income. They imposed an additional level of structure and order on their lives. And they gave them the sense of dignity and accomplishment and independence that usually results from being employed.
The workers may not be thrilled about putting on hamburger uniforms and toiling at jobs disdained by many, but they know they are doing better than those who are without work, and they nurture the slender hope that more rewarding days are ahead.
The rest of the picture is bleak. Despite their training and experience in such areas as food preparation, inventory control and customer relations, there is no demand for the services of inner-city youngsters who are too often seen merely as hamburger flippers.
And because the job market in general is so tight, the younger workers are facing heightened competition for the fast-food jobs from older, better-educated men and women who once held better jobs.
"In Oakland," said Professor Stack, "many of the young people are actually competing for the same jobs with elders in their own families."
When Professor Newman tracked job applicants who were not hired by the Harlem restaurants, she found that a year later 73 percent still had not found work.
The study by Professors Newman and Stack was supported by a number of organizations, including the Russell Sage, Rockefeller and Ford foundations. A final report will be completed next spring.
Despite the obvious need for increased employment opportunities in the inner city, both researchers said in interviews this week that they expected the problem to get substantially worse. Government and the health-care industry, which have traditionally provided work for inner-city residents, are shedding workers, and are likely to shed many more.
At the same time, the welfare policy trend is to push as many recipients onto the job market as possible, whether there are jobs available for them or not.
If this generation is the first to get stuck at the entry level, said Professor Stack, the next may be the first that is unable to "get its foot in the door at all."

Economic Data and Dollar Aid Rally in Bond Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The bond rally built a head of steam yesterday, aided by weak economic data and a firm dollar that helped to push the rate of the 30-year Treasury bond to its lowest level in more than two years.
A sharp drop in the Chicago Association of Purchasing Agent's report for November yesterday raised expectations for a subdued report by the National Association of Purchasing Managements which is scheduled for release today. That, in turn, helped to stoke anticipation of another interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the better to stimulate what some perceive is a slowing economy. 
 In trading yesterday against the German mark, the dollar rose as high as 1.4505 marks, before trading late in the day at 1.4470 marks. The dollar was also changing hands in New York at 102.15 Japanese yen, up from 101.58 on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its yield, increased 29/32, to 110 3/32 for a yield of 6.13 percent, down from 6.19 percent on Wednesday and the lowest yield since Feb. 3, 1993, when it was 6.10 percent.
Other factors accounting for yesterday's strong market, traders said, included an underlying optimism about progress in Federal budget negotiations. This, they said, allowed the market to disregard some stronger economic numbers and focus on the weak data instead.
Traders also noted that the market continued to price in an expected easing of monetary policy at the Dec. 19 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-setting arm.
Adding some momentum to the rally was a report by Market News Service that the Fed's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, said that the central bank has a "window of opportunity" to cut rates now to head off an economic decline in 1997.
The market opened higher yesterday, only to have early gains shaved briefly by the Government's report on October orders for durable goods. The decline in orders was not as steep as economists had been expecting after a big increase in September.
But prices headed higher again after the Chicago purchasing index slipped to 49.9 in November from 53.4 in October. A reading of more than 50 generally indicates a growing economy, while less than 50 means some contraction.
Carl Palash, chief economist for MCM Moneywatch in New York, a market research and analysis firm, saw the market remaining positive, despite the mixed data. But Mr. Palash does not see the picture to be as rosy as the market appears to. "A case can be made that the data is telling us that the economy is better than many think," he said.
Orders for durable goods, after excluding the volatile transportation component, were up 2.3 percent, well above the third-quarter average, Mr. Palash noted, "which suggests that the demand for manufactured goods is still robust."
Another economic indicator, the weekly number of initial jobless claims, fell yesterday by 16,000, to 363,000, presumably another sign of economic strength. Mr. Palash considers that a high level, but over all, he said, it was likely a figure that had been depressed by the close of state offices for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago, found some of the Chicago purchasing numbers weaker than the October data, suggesting that the economy was softening.
Mr. Davis noted that it had been a tendency of the bond market to trade up in the last few days of a month as portfolio managers extended the maturities of the securities in those portfolios.
"That, coupled with the very successful two- and five-year note auctions this week and the weaker-than-expected Chicago N.A.P.M. report, was enough to propel the market," he said. "Technically, the bond market put in a good performance today, closing so close to its highs it is encouraging traders that the bull market would continue."
Another reason people were positive, Mr. Davis said, was the fact that the Fed executed a "coupon pass" -- that is, buying Treasury securities to add currency to the economy to adjust for seasonal demand -- using a new procedure.
"Before, when the Fed did a coupon pass," he said, "dealers submitted offerings across all maturities. Under the new procedure, the Fed specifies the maturity sectors in which it will be active. So traders think that because the Fed came in today buying in the one-to-two-year range, there is a likelihood that they will come to market again looking for longer maturities."
Analysts said that when the Fed came in the market for a coupon pass, the market saw it as a ready buyer.
"My only concern," Mr. Davissaid, "is that everyone I talk to is positive on the market because the last shorts have thrown in the towels, but the market needs the fuel the shorts provide."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 13-day and 27-day cash management bills, which the Government often sells to meet cash flow shortages when it needs to meet interest and principal payments:

The Blockades Of Taiwan

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
They come almost every day now the military threats to this island country from the Communist Government in Beijing.
Chinese Army commanders order repeated amphibious landings at the mainland coast nearest the island -- the precise kind of operation that would be needed to invade Taiwan -- and "tests" of missiles in the straits dividing China and the island. In recent days there has been a series of leaked reports that Beijing is considering a naval blockade of Taiwan. 
 Nobody knows whether the threats are meant only to frighten all Taiwanese into abandoning any thought of independence, however distant, or whether Beijing is readying its people and the world for an attack. If it does take place it is likely to be in the spring of 1996 before or after Taiwan holds its first direct presidential election.
But the evidence is that the military command is beginning to operate and plan independently of the civilian leadership in the Politburo.
This much seems clear from here: The West is operating on the assumption that if it says and does nothing, why, any dangers will vanish in a merciful blip.
The studious silence arises from the fundamental China policy of the West: Rock no Chinese boat lest Beijing throw easy Western access to the Chinese market overboard.
The West manages to maintain its silence because a Chinese blockade of Taiwan already exists: the political and diplomatic blockade created by Beijing after it took over the China seat in the U.N. in 1971.
The government on Taiwan was not only ousted from the U.N. but from the international community. Taiwan, one of the largest trading nations in the world, has been cut off from normal diplomatic and political relations with almost the whole world.
The U.S. maintains an "institute" in Taipei headed by a "director." But no flag is flown outdoors to save Beijing a fit. In Washington, representatives of Taiwan cannot sully the State department or White House by their presence. So far, separate drinking fountains for Taiwanese representatives have not been set up.
Taiwan is not only barred from the U.N. but from all its many specialized agencies, including those supposed to deal with such universal subjects as health and agriculture -- say, AIDS or starvation.
The blockade is so obsessively enforced that it even excludes aid to refugees. Last year the U.N. appealed for funds for Rwandan refugees, among the most suffering of God's human creatures. Taiwan offered $2 million; refused. The Taiwanese did manage to get their gift accepted -- by channeling it through an American committee for Unicef.
Correspondents from Taiwan are not permitted to enter the U.N. As a former reporter at the U.N., in its early days, I have thought of slipping my pass to a correspondent from Taiwan, to annoy U.N. authorities, but I decided it wouldn't work.
Before Beijing commanded the U.N., correspondents from non-member peoples were allowed in. I learned more about North Africa and Indonesia from independence-movement reporters than I ever did from the colonial French or Dutch.
North Korea and South Korea are members and so were East and West Germany. The Palestine Liberation Organization was given representation at the General Assembly with only a vote lacking.
But when China decided that any dreams of independence, sovereignty or even dignity that Taiwan might harbor were too dangerous to tolerate, this special apartheid was created for the island. The U.S. and most other U.N. members meekly kissed Beijing's iron slipper.
That means Taiwan cannot use the U.N. or any normal diplomatic channel to raise an alarm that had to be officially heard about the open military threats from Beijing. If any other country had threatened another so blatantly the case would immediately have been on the U.N. agenda.
Now of course most U.N. members, including the U.S., would be paralyzed with economic terror at the very idea of proposing that Taiwan as well as China be represented at the U.N. But perhaps Washington, London, Paris and Tokyo will dredge up enough courage to increase their own diplomatic contacts with Taiwan as a warning to China. Perhaps.
Until now the Chinese diplomatic blockade and Western submission to it have been merely disgusting. Now they are getting dangerous.

HEADLINE: Retailers Had Weak Sales In November

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Retailers found more reason to weep yesterday as they posted weak November sales, following the worst October in four years.
Salomon Brothers said its same-store growth index rose only 2.9 percent in November from the month a year earlier. 
 By comparison, sales were up four-tenths of 1 percent in October and 4.2 percent in November 1994. Mild weather at the end of last month, price deflation and a slowing economy all played a role, analysts said.
"The fact is, consumers basically had little wage growth in general," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, vice president of retail research at Salomon Brothers. "Those who were spending were at the upper end of the income spectrum because they are the ones who have gained from the over $1 trillion created by the stock market increase in the last 12 to 18 months.
"The Guccis and the Tiffanys of the world seem to continue doing well," he said. "Everyone else is slugging along."
Not surprisingly, apparel again took the worst beating. Ann Taylor reported a stunning 15.9 percent decrease in same-store sales, which are considered the best measure of a retailer's performance, though it had a banner year in 1994 that was difficult to compete against. Sales at the Limited Inc. fell 3 percent, Charming Shoppes Inc. was down 13 percent and the Catherine Stores Corporation declined 1 percent. The Gap Inc. gained a mere 1 percent.
Department stores reported weak results. A lone winner was Sears, Roebuck & Company, which enjoyed a 5.1 percent increase in same-store sales, a better performance than competitors like J. C. Penney Inc., which reported a 1.8 percent increase, and the Dayton Hudson Corporation, whose same-store sales grew 1.7 percent. Sales at May Department Stores were up 1 percent; Carson Pirie Scott & Company reported a 3.6 percent increase.
"The trends you have been seeing for 1995 in retailing continued in November," Mr. Feiner said. "Department stores continue to take shares of the market from specialty retailers."
Discounters and electronics merchants did somewhat better, although many sales required heavy promotions. The Best Buy Company, for example, saw a 15 percent increase, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. had increased sales of 3 percent.
"All that was achieved through deep markdowns," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. "The rest is the pits, which confirms that American households are in a deep economic squeeze."
But luxury stores seem to be moving their merchandise. Richard N. Baum, vice president of investment research at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said that jewelry merchants all reported between mid-single to double-digit same-store increases. "We think that is significant that jewelry retailers are doing phenomenally when specialty retailers are doing so poorly," Mr. Baum said.
The Goldman, Sachs composite index, which measures big retailers' sales at stores open at least one year, was up 2.94 points for November, compared with November 1994, when the index rose 4.11 points.
Because Christmas shoppers increasingly wait until the 11th hour to shop, these November numbers do not necessarily translate into a terrible Christmas, but neither are they a harbinger of good cheer.
"The start of the season being sluggish is not an accurate four days to extrapolate from," Mr. Feiner said, in reference to the post-Thanksgiving holiday rush that wasn't.
Retailers posted disappointing holiday weekend sales after shoppers filled the malls but mostly window-shopped, holding out for last-minute price slashing that has become as much a part of Christmas as gift wrap and mistletoe.
These price cuts directly reduce profit margins and bring a great deal of added woe to retailers in already-tough times, because most stores count on the fourth quarter for roughly 40 percent of their profits.
The International Council of Shopping Centers said that specialty-store sales from Friday through Sunday were unchanged from the corresponding period last year, based on a survey of 80 malls that last year reported a 4.5 percent sales gain.
"Investors have to look at November and December together," Mr. Baum said, "Because historically, it is quite unusual to have a disconnected relationship between the two."

HEADLINE: In Russia, Change Must Take a Little Longer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is not surprising that Jeffrey D. Sachs (Op-Ed, Nov. 29), one of the architects of economic shock therapy in the former Soviet Union, should claim that the corruption, inflation and privatization now rampant in Russia is a result of the failure of Western governments to provide adequate financial support. 
 The most successful capitalist societies have learned by bitter experience over a long period that the law of the jungle must be restrained by reasonable regulation, carefully administered, to prevent the kind of situation prevailing in many of the former Communist countries. Despite our efforts, there is still a good deal of poverty, inadequate access to education and medical care, and a striking disparity of opportunity.
Given this background, where did the idea come from that it was possible to shift the economic systems of Eastern Europe from a state-directed economy to a capitalist system nearly overnight?
On what evidence did anyone conclude that this remarkable transformation could be successfully accomplished by "young, inexperienced and lagely honest reformers," advised by Western experts equally short of experience in instant transformation of societies?
Should it not have been obvious that without strong control from the top the fruits of shock therapy would largely go to society's most aggressive and unprincipled?
As for the role of funding, the experience of West Germany in effecting a similar transformation in East Germany is instructive. With virtually unlimited funds and a common language and starting with one of the West's most economically and technically advanced countries, the problem has turned out much more difficult than once thought. It will take generations, not years, to finish a job that is surely much easier than the task facing Russia.
A certain amount of humility is required when one tries to reform human society. No matter how lofty our goals and how transparent our good intentions, we ought to realize that such transformations are very difficult, take a long time and often don't end up the way we expected.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Imagining Race Relations With Roles Reversed

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Watching "White Man's Burden," you can almost hear the sound of feet treading lightly on eggshells. This didactic political fable, which imagines an America in which the roles of blacks and whites are reversed, approaches its subject with such nervous self-consciousness that the arguments in its debate about racial injustice are measured out in quarter-teaspoons. Were it not for John Travolta's big-hearted portrayal of an unemployed white factory worker driven to commit a desperate act, the movie would be an emotionally frozen exercise in cautious high-mindedness.
As Louis Pinnock, a hard-working family man who loses his job and eventually his home through a minor misunderstanding at work, Mr. Travolta creates a sympathetic portrait of a man who comes unstrung. Until disaster strikes, Louis lives with his tight-lipped wife, Marsha (Kelly Lynch), and their two children in a poor white neighborhood of chain-link fences and decomposing auto parts that resembles south central Los Angeles. 
 Borderline poverty has strained the marriage, and the couple are behind in their mortgage payments. The film's most harrowing scene depicts the family's humiliating eviction, in which they are given 15 minutes to pack a few belongings and vacate the premises.
The Pinnocks' economic plight is pointedly contrasted with the opulent world of Thaddeus Thomas (Harry Belafonte), the well-heeled businessman who inadvertently caused Louis to be fired. The pet project of Thaddeus's elegant wife, Megan (Margaret Avery), happens to be a glitzy fashion show benefiting underprivileged white children. In a film that often pulls its punches, the scenes depicting the self-congratulatory condescension attending such events carry a satirical bite.
"White Man's Burden," which was written and directed by Desmond Nakano, changes from a what-if fable into a dull but well-meaning essay on race relations once Louis kidnaps Thaddeus in his rickety pickup truck and gives him a tour of his shabby world. At a fast-food stand, the pair are menaced by white skinheads, and guns are drawn. Later, Louis picks up his 6-year-old son and takes him to a toy store where, over the father's objections, the little boy chooses a doll of a black super-hero as a birthday present.
But as bold as it is, the premise of the film remains frustratingly undeveloped. In imagining America run by a black ruling class, the movie skirts any questions of what the dominant culture might be like. Beyond imagining white skinheads as inner-city gangsters, the movie is just as reluctant to flesh out the texture of a white ghetto culture.
This leaves the actors in a stylistic limbo. The black actors adopt similar masks of stiff upper-class gentility. With the exception of Mr. Travolta, the white actors exude the same attitude of clenched, suppressed bitterness.
The movie's timidity is especially apparent in a scene in which Louis, who is stopped on the street and questioned as a suspected robber, is beaten senseless by black policemen while a small crowd gathers to protest. Both the beating and the reaction to it are so perfunctory and low-key that the movie's caution becomes duplicitous. It wants to portray incendiary events, but in a way that avoids stirring up anger, and that's impossible.
 
 "White Man's Burden" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some violence and mildly vulgar language.

Wrong Galleries
The Metropolitan Museum of Art and Chuck Close have collided over a retrospective of Mr. Close's work scheduled for April 1997. Last week, the artist backed out of the show, which had been in the works for two years. The cancellation wipes out the only exhibition of a living artist scheduled at the Met for the rest of the century. 
 The conflict was over where the show would be. Mr. Close said he was promised the B galleries, the skylit spaces at the top of the museum's grand staircase; the Met insists it made no such promise and instead offered the artist the Cantor galleries, where the John Singleton Copley show is and the Velazquez show was. The Cantor galleries are considerably smaller than the B galleries and have no natural light.
"The space wasn't adequate to properly give an overview of my work in all media," Mr. Close said in a telephone interview. "There wouldn't be room for enough large-scale paintings to represent the changes and permutations my work has undergone over the last 30 years. I felt strongly that I wanted to do it right or not at all."
Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director, was out of the country and unreachable, said Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the Met. But Mr. Holzer said: "It is unfortunate that there has been a misunderstanding about the space. And there seems to be no way to adjudicate it." Mr. Holzer added that the galleries Mr. Close wanted for his show had already been committed to "a major medieval show."
The Museum of Modern Art had also offered Mr. Close a retrospective, but he chose the Met. Will the Modern rekindle its interest?
An official at the Modern declined to answer, saying, "It is completely inappropriate for us to comment on another museum's relations to an artist."
Meanwhile, Mr. Close's work is not out of the public eye. Tomorrow, a show of his recent paintings opens at Pace Wildenstein's SoHo gallery at 142 Greene Street. It will be on view until Jan. 6.
 
 
 
Education Building
 The Mortimer D. Sackler Family Foundation has given the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum a gift to establish the Sackler Center for Arts Education and create a related endowment. The museum declined to say how large the donation was, but insiders say they think it was over $5 million. The gift will enable the museum to build an arts education center next to its Frank Lloyd Wright theater, which is being restored with part of a $10 million gift from Peter B. Lewis, a trustee, in October.
"This is an important first step toward establishing an educational endowment for the museum," Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director, said. "We established a new education department early this year, and this gift will provide us with a physical location for all our educational activities."
The project includes the construction of classrooms, a multimedia center and conference rooms. It is expected to be open by the fall of 1996.
Downtown, there's news from the Guggenheim's SoHo branch: contrary to what everybody's been saying, the museum is not permanently closing its doors. But in January it will close for two months, during which time some long overdue renovations are to be completed. The Guggenheim's agenda includes opening the building's Mercer Street entrance and improving the gallery space on the first floor. The museum plans to reopen in March with "Jeff Koons: Celebration."
 
 
 
Formaldehyde Artist
 Damien Hirst, the 30-year-old sculptor best known for his shocking pieces with dead animals suspended in formaldehyde, has won this year's Turner Prize. The prestigious $30,970 award was established in 1984 to "promote public discussion of new developments in contemporary British art." It is given annually to a British artist by the Tate Gallery in London. Mr. Hirst, who is prominent among the generation of young artists who have revived the London art world, was short-listed for the prize in 1992, when the surprise winner turned out to be the sculptor Grenville Davey. This year, the sure money was on Mr. Hirst (although the Palestinian sculptor Mona Hatoum was thought to have a good chance with a 12-minute video she made of her body, both inside and out).
 
 
 
Quiet London Sales
 London's important sales of Impressionist and modern art were this week, but neither Sotheby's nor Christie's had the kind of blockbuster paintings each offered in New York in November.
Persuading sellers to put big-ticket works up for sale in London is hard these days. The perception in Europe, and especially in London, is that New York is where all the money is. Sellers with something truly valuable therefore generally insist that their art be sold in New York.
"It's got a lot to do with economics," said Melanie Clore, who heads Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department in London. "Everyone here believes there's a lot of money in the United States, especially on Wall Street."
Ms. Clore described the sale she put together as of more European taste. "It was sophisticated and less flamboyant," she said. "These are the kinds of sales I like because they bring out the interesting collectors."
But as was true in New York in November, when works were well priced and fresh to the market, there was a lot of competition from bidders all over the world. Both at Sotheby's and Christie's, buyers were split nearly equally between Americans and Europeans. Of the two houses, Sotheby's took in more money. Its sale on Monday evening totaled $26.1 million, above its $24.3 million low estimate. Christie's sale on Tuesday made $20.6 million, below its $24.6 million low estimate.
The star of the sales was Gauguin's "Women at the Edge of the Water" (1892), which was bought at Sotheby's by an unidentified American for nearly $5 million, way above its $2.3 million to $3.1 million estimate.
At Christie's, a 1924 Brancusi, "The Beginning of the World," a bronze in the form of an egg, was one of two casts, and it sold for $1.9 million, slightly above the low estimate. The other was given to the Pompidou Center in Paris by the artist in 1957. While Christie's would not say who bought it, word from experts in London is that the buyer was a European museum.
 
 
 
Paula Cooper to Chelsea
 Paula Cooper has always been a pioneer. In 1968, she opened the first gallery in SoHo. Now she's in the first group of SoHo dealers to relocate to Chelsea. Ms. Cooper just bought a 5,000-square-foot, one-story garage on 21st Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues.
"I'm hoping to be open by fall," she said. "But there's a lot of work to do." Ms. Cooper added that she has grown tired of SoHo. "It's changed so much," she said. "It's just too crowded with dress and furniture shops."

AIDS After Randy Shilts: Still Blame Enough for All

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

THE GRAVEST SHOW ON EARTH
America in the Age of AIDS
By Elinor Burkett
399 pages. Houghton Mifflin Company. $24.95
Elinor Burkett's impassioned new book, "The Gravest Show on Earth: America in the Age of AIDS," takes up where Randy Shilts's 1987 study, "And the Band Played On," left off. Mr. Shilts argued that "AIDS did not just happen to America -- it was allowed to happen" by the initial failure of doctors, scientists, government bureaucrats and leaders of gay groups to mobilize "the way they should in a time of threat." 
 Ms. Burkett, a former reporter for The Miami Herald, similarly argues in her book that the AIDS problem has been made worse by human failure: by "politics, greed and utter stupidity" and by society's "failure to treat AIDS as a disease, pure and simple."
"I began to see AIDS as a lens through which the flaws of the nation were magnified," she writes. "It revealed America's need to blame someone rather than to accept tragedy and cope with the truth of our relative powerlessness against nature. It shone a light on Americans' need to define themselves by membership in victim groups, competing for most-victimized status and the financial and psychic benefits that carried. AIDS provided a glimpse of a society more comfortable with fairy-tale villains -- human or viral -- than the reality of sluggish scientific progress and the complex interaction between behavior and infectious agents."
Although Ms. Burkett rehashes the life stories of Kimberly Bergalis, a college student, and the MTV star Pedro Zamora, she devotes relatively little space in this volume to case studies. For the most part, she focuses instead on the politics and economy of AIDS: on the infighting between AIDS action groups, on intramural debates about the direction AIDS research should take and on the cozy relationship between large pharmaceutical companies and Government bureaucrats.
Writing in quick, feisty prose, Ms. Burkett makes her own positions crystal clear, and in some cases they are positions that are bound to provoke heated debate. She accuses both the Christian right and leaders of gay groups of "waging competing jihads," of claiming the moral high ground while "slinging blame and attempting to legislate their own versions of political correctness." She contends that African-American leaders "acted like ostriches" during much of the 80's, instead of working on AIDS prevention and education. And she argues that the AIDS lobby has received "a level of Federal attention, support and services that were the envy of people with cancer, multiple sclerosis and heart disease."
Because AIDS is "the most politicized disease in human history," Ms. Burkett observes, health-care agendas and plain common sense often get caught in the political crossfire. When Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, a former New York City Health Commissioner, announced plans to distribute a million condoms, he was assailed for endorsing promiscuity by a spokesman for John Cardinal O'Connor; and when he suggested implementing some sort of system for partner notification (a standard public health procedure used to help contain tuberculosis, syphilis and hepatitis), he was assailed by people intent on preserving the principle of confidentiality.
A member of the New York State Assembly, Nettie Mayersohn of Queens, Ms. Burkett reports, similarly found herself condemned by both the left and the right when she introduced a bill requiring that all newborn infants be tested for H.I.V. and that all parents of H.I.V.-positive infants be notified of the results. Routine testing of pregnant women for H.I.V., after all, is opposed not only by women's groups like NOW (not to mention most AIDS lobbyists) but also by abortion opponents who worry that infected women might decide to terminate their pregnancies.
As local, state and Federal agencies dispense more and more money to fight the epidemic, political infighting has begun to afflict the very groups organized to help AIDS patients. "States fought with states over who was the hardest hit by the disaster," Ms. Burkett writes. "Cities argued with states over control of the funds. Municipal officials battled community organizations over how to divide up the spoils. Blacks and gays traded charges of homophobia and racism. Amid the court battles and screaming matches, everyone complained that the Federal Government wasn't handing out enough."
Money, in fact, plays a large role in this book, for Ms. Burkett argues that AIDS has become "a multi-billion-dollar growth industry," offering scientists a chance to make their name and drug companies and entrepreneurs an opportunity to make a fortune. This is more than simply a matter of competing for the millions of dollars the Federal Government annually spends for AIDS research; it's also about scientific reports bolstering the stock prices of multinational drug companies, an expanding job market for bereavement counselors and benefits coordinators, and the proliferation of new businesses catering to the needs of the ill and the fears of the healthy.
Condom makers, mail-order drug companies, home health-care services, vitamin and health-food stores have all benefited from the AIDS epidemic, Ms. Burkett says, as have a host of more unsavory enterprises, including trading card manufacturers (selling cards emblazoned with the likenesses of Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe and Rock Hudson, among others) and plain old charlatans selling phony cures and false hopes.
"Even in the midst of recessions," Ms. Burkett writes, "there are few cutbacks in the industry that is AIDS. No layoffs are expected for those who make their living off the imminent demise of 40 million citizens of the planet."
Although Ms. Burkett writes with enormous energy and genuine outrage on behalf of AIDS patients who have been caught up in the AIDS bureaucracy, she displays a tendency to make broad -- and sometimes distorting -- generalizations that undermine her many valid points. In one chapter, she writes that "shooting galleries had become to black Americans what bathhouses had become to gay Americans."
In another chapter, she suggests that had the AIDS epidemic perhaps surfaced at another time in American history when the country "still maintained its innocence, its belief in its ability to solve all the great problems, the history of the epidemic would have been different," as though the fact that the disease first appeared to be an affliction of gay men did not have something to do with the slow response of mainstream scientists and physicians, as though sheer will and faith could have affected the course of a disease.
In fact, Ms. Burkett's main point in this book remains important: "AIDS is not caused by avarice, indifference, opportunism, careerism or homophobia," she writes. "As best we know, it is caused by a virus (from the Latin for 'poison'), an exquisitely primitive form of life that does not care about politics, money or the Nobel Prize. A virus is programmed to care about only one thing: survival."

HEADLINE: U.S. Reopens Trade Dispute, Saying China Ignores Piracy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Reopening a major trade dispute with China, the United States has told Beijing that it has 90 days to enforce an agreement struck with Washington earlier this year to end the pirating of computer software, music and movies, or once again risk the imposition of large trade sanctions.
The public warning comes after numerous private admonitions during meetings with top Chinese leaders, Clinton Administration officials said. 
 While the renewed threat of sanctions risks a new breach in relations, American trade officials said today that China's continued foot-dragging in closing the 29 factories that churn out millions of illegal copies of American films and software had already cost United States corporations more than $800 million this year. In fact, there is evidence that some factories that halted making illegal copies of compact disks had resumed production, this time producing far more expensive CD-ROM's containing pirated copies of just-released computer software.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said today that while he had been encouraged by China's "spirit of cooperation" on a range of other economic issues, "we will not wait forever as the Chinese Government attempts to implement these agreements."
Mr. Kantor would not elaborate on the kind of action the United States would take unless the accord was enforced. But Mr. Kantor has previously said that Washington had simply "suspended" the imposition of $1 billion in sanctions against Chinese imports that were averted at the last minute by the agreement in February.
That means the Government would not have to go through a lengthy investigation of the harm done to American industry before imposing the 100 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.
The State Department has been laboring for months to rebuild the Administration's rocky diplomatic relations with China. But recently, Washington's growing commercial troubles with China, including a trade deficit that is ballooning to Japan-sized proportions, have become an increasingly hot subject on Capitol Hill, eclipsing in political importance Beijing's continued repression of dissidents. Administration officials are clearly concerned that unless they take a tough line, Republican candidates for President will portray President Clinton's major trade agreements in Asia as hollow victories that have done little to protect American jobs.
As a result, Mr. Clinton's top economic aides have gradually warned China to fulfill its commitments, making clear that the country's admission to the World Trade Organization, which the United States has blocked, depends on it.
The strongest warning came on Wednesday during testimony before a Senate committee, when the deputy United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said that the United States would take "decisive action" if China did not carry out the anti-pirating agreement struck in February.
Ms. Barshefsky's warning drew an immediate response from Beijing. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Shen Guofang, said that any punitive action would be "unacceptable," and would "harm the trade ties between the two countries."
China has taken some steps to comply with parts of the accord. By its own count, it has conducted 3,200 raids on retailers who sell the pirated products on virtually every street corner of Beijing, Shanghai and other major Chinese cities. But the campaign has been akin to arresting drug dealers without touching their suppliers. With a few symbolic exceptions, the offending factories have escaped the attention of the Chinese authorities.
It is widely rumored that some of the authorities or their families hold financial stakes in many of the factories. In other cases, instructions from Beijing to stop the production of pirated goods are ignored by provincial governments.
The piracy issues have been a consistent source of concern to Hollywood, which makes much of its profits on the foreign distribution of films, and to the software industry. In Congress, those complaints have merged with another set of concerns: that China is becoming what many trade experts now refer to as "the next Japan," with a trade deficit to match.
In the first three quarters of the year, according to the most recent Commerce Department figures, the United States imported $33.83 billion in goods from China, but exported only $8.37 billion. The resulting trade deficit, $25.46 billion, is more than half the deficit with Japan for the same period. But Mr. Kantor, who headed President Clinton's election campaign in 1992 and is acutely attuned to the politics of trade issues, has noted several times recently that American exports to China have doubled in the last year, increasing far faster than imports.
"All the changes are in the right direction," he said today. "That doesn't mean we don't have a number of problems; obviously we do."

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo;
2 Sides in Budget Talks Take the Road to Nowhere

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The budget negotiations this week between Congress and the White House were a complete bust.
For three days in a row, lawmakers and Administration officials met around a table in a conference room in the Capitol, closed the doors, accomplished absolutely nothing and came out and accused each other of refusing to negotiate in good faith. Then, on Thursday afternoon, they adjourned until next week. 
 No one savvy about Washington politics was surprised.
Making a budget is not like building a house, where one brick is laid after another until the structure is complete. It is more like the creation of the universe, where one moment there was a mass of swirling gases and then there was a big bang and a Sun and nine planets.
"I told my clients last week not to expect anything the first week but finger pointing," said Stanley E. Collender, director of Federal budget policy at Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm.
"It's still too early for anything to happen," Mr. Collender said. "We're two weeks away from Dec. 15 and three weeks from Christmas."
Dec. 15 is the expiration date of the Government's temporary authority to spend money, which was signed last month to end the six-day partial shutdown of the bureaucracy. Unless all 13 appropriation bills are enacted by then, a highly unlikely eventuality, another accord will be needed or the parts of the Government that have not had their spending approved will again have to close down. As matters stand now, that would include agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Despite the high stakes involved, no politician wants to take responsibility for putting hundreds of thousands of Government workers on furlough the week just before Christmas. That suggests they will be reaching out for an accommodation.
But resolution of the impasse will be impossible until both parties decide that a compromise is in their best interest. So far, neither side has shown the slightest desire to strike a deal on anything but its own terms.
Republicans hold that balancing the budget over the next seven years should be the overriding concern of the Government. The President and his Democratic allies insist that the Republican plan will do irrevocable damage to Medicare, education, the environment and programs for the poor.
The dispute is over two kinds of legislation.
The first kind is the 13 annual spending bills, which provide money for the operations of Government departments and agencies. Only seven of these measures, called appropriation bills, have become law so far.
The second is the omnibus budget bill, known as a reconciliation bill, which is the Republicans' main vehicle for balancing the budget in seven years. It would cut taxes and make big changes in Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, food stamps and other benefit programs. These are called entitlements because money is paid automatically to everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. They are not subject to annual approval by Congress.
President Clinton seems willing to make big concessions on the spending bills. He might have to give up much of what he wants in the areas of education, training and environmental protection, for example. His desire to get through the appropriation process is one explanation of why he allowed the $243 billion military spending bill to become law this week, even though it would allow about $7 billion more to be spent than he and the Pentagon believe is needed.
If these spending measures become law, the Republicans will no longer be able to wield the threat of a Government shutdown. Mr. Clinton could go into legislative hibernation and refuse to deal with the reconciliation bill. Then, taxes and Medicare and all the rest would continue without change.
His problem is that the Republicans are not political patsies. They are insisting that the appropriation bills and the big budget measure be negotiated as one package. "We're not going to buy the car without the windshield and the tires and the bumper," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee.
Speculation abounds over how all this will work out.
Ted Van Dyk, a Washington consultant for businesses and Wall Street concerns, suggested this week in his newsletter that by splitting the difference here and cutting a deal there, a rather painless compromise could be struck.
"This is an 'everyone wins, no one loses' outcome which could get done on the back of an envelope in a few minutes of negotiation," Mr. Van Dyk told his clients. "It would prove to voters that Democrats and Republicans could work together. It would provide a responsible path to a seven-year balanced budget. It would reduce debt, foster economic growth, facilitate lower interest rates and more greatly protect vulnerable Americans."
Maybe so.
But Mr. Van Dyk's prescription may underestimate the bitter feelings that abound. If the negotiators do not hate each other -- and some clearly do -- they absolutely hate what their opponents stand for. And personalities aside, negotiators on both sides find themselves in ideological straitjackets.
Perhaps the climate will improve as the winter solstice approaches. But as of this weekend, the prospects seemed bleak. Even Mr. Van Dyk, more optimistic than most, told his clients that there was a 30 percent chance that the President and Congress would still be at odds over the budget at Christmas.

HEADLINE: Key Bosnia Question: Where Are Exits?

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The Administration has spent a lot of time this week explaining how and why American troops should go to Bosnia, but the question still on many lawmakers' minds is under what conditions the troops will leave.
Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, has lent his support to President Clinton's plan to send troops to Bosnia, even though his main concern is that the Administration has not specified how the United States and its allies will know when their peacekeeping mission has succeeded and what happens if it has not. 
 The reason, Administration officials and Western diplomats say, is that the United States is still struggling to resolve many of the biggest questions about the so-called exit strategy, which depends on a vast civilian effort to rebuild a country torn by over three and a half years of civil war.
In hearings before House and Senate committees this week, President Clinton's senior military and foreign policy advisers insisted that the Administration would bring American troops home in about a year, saying the military could achieve within that time its limited goals of insuring that the combatants pull back from the front lines and that a cease-fire is enforced.
That narrow mission is intended to provide a 12-month breathing space that will enable an array of other organizations to resettle refugees, deliver aid, train new police forces and build the political structure for elections.
The Administration has also promised not to leave until a separate force equips and trains the Bosnian Army to defend itself. But Mr. Dole said today that the Administration's plan to do this is "vague." A resolution that Mr. Dole and Senator John S. McCain, Republican of Arizona, are drafting would require the United States to lead an "immediate" effort to "to provide equipment, arms, training and related logistics assistance of the highest possible quality" to Bosnia.
But the testimony of Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, begged the question: Would all the troops come home if the long-term rebuilding goals, outside the military's scope, were failing?
The contrast between the military's precision and the vagueness of the civilian operation was captured in an exchange on Thursday between Mr. Perry and Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican on the House International Relations Committee. Mr. Leach said he was impressed by the peace agreement but skeptical about some of the nonmilitary issues.
"Where there is apparently an exit date," he said, "there has not been a well-articulated exit policy."
Mr. Perry acknowledged that limiting the mission to a year was based on a judgment, not hard facts. "How long that breathing space is necessary, no one can estimate," he said. "A year of breathing space is a pretty good breathing space."
Over the last two days, lawmakers peppered the three Administration officials with a volley of questions that underscored how many important parts of the overall Bosnia mission are still works in progress.
Who will oversee the civilian tasks, like insuring the safety of thousands of returning refugees and rebuilding the shattered Bosnian economy?
Who will arm and train the Bosnian Government if a Balkan arms control policy alone does not level the military playing field before NATO troops withdraw?
How will the United States remain impartial if it helps train the Bosnian Army?
The Pentagon is particularly concerned over the stark asymmetry between NATO's detailed 1,100-page military plan and the parallel civilian program that does not even have a leader or a budget yet.
International relief officials acknowledge that planning for the civilian tasks lags behind the military's forward march into Bosnia, but they promise their efforts will pick up steam in the next week, culminating in a conference in London on Dec. 8. President Clinton will meet with relief and human rights organizations on Monday at the White House to discuss the Bosnia mission.
To distance the new civilian effort from the United Nations operations it succeeds, which many lawmakers have criticized, the United Nations is turning over some of its tasks to other international organizations. For example, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will assume responsibility for organizing elections in Bosnia.
But dozens of relief agencies have been operating in Bosnia under the United Nations since 1991, and will pick up with the new civilian authority where they left off with the United Nations. "We've been there four years, so to hear that we're not ready is a little bit strange," said Soren Jessen-Petersen, the envoy to the Balkans for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Caring for and resettling as many as 2.1 million refugees in the former Yugoslavia and another 700,000 people who fled mainly to Europe will be a monumental task.
Refugee officials say that for the first time in four years, winter will be on their side. Most refugees are not expected to travel until the spring thaw, when they will also have a better opportunity to judge if peace is holding.
To insure the safety of refugees and other citizens, the United Nations will lead efforts to bring about 2,000 police monitors and trainers from around the world into Bosnia. But the United Nations learned only last week that it would lead the operation, so many details about which countries will provide the trainers and who will pay for the operation must still be worked out.
Nor is it clear yet which countries or international organizations will pick up the $6 billion tab for the civilian reconstruction effort.
Mr. Christopher said in testimony that the European allies will pay for "most" of the civilian effort. But President Jacques Chirac of France said Washington will pay for one-third, just like the Europeans. Mr. Christopher, however, said the United States will spend $600 million over the next three years, including $200 million this year.
As the civilian effort takes root, the United States has promised to leave only after insuring that the Bosnian Army can defend itself. Under the peace accord, a total arms embargo will continue for three months after the treaty is signed on Dec. 14. A ban on the sale of heavy weapons, including artillery, will continue for six months.
During this six-month period, NATO hopes the Serbs, Croats and Muslims will negotiate fair levels of arms. But most analysts expect that effort to fall short. "It's unquestionable we'll have to provide some equipment to the Bosnian Government," Mr. Christopher said today.
But European leaders strongly oppose arming and training the Bosnian Army, fearing it will trigger a new Balkans arms race. And many lawmakers here fear the United States will lose its neutrality if it helps the Government rearm.
But Mr. Perry said neither NATO nor American troops will be involved. Private contractors would probably train the Government troops, who would then buy Eastern European weapons once the ban was lifted. An international consortium, including the United States and Islamic countries, would pay for the training.

HEADLINE: Pataki Cuts Off Money for Projects Cuomo Approved, Saying They Don't Meet Rules

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The Pataki administration announced today that it has pulled back financing from 177 economic development projects costing $24 million that had been approved under the Cuomo administration.
Several of the projects were favored programs of Democratic legislators. 
 State economic development officials said that the projects were rejected because they did not meet strict new standards drawn up in the last few months for creating jobs and stimulating the economy. They said the organizations and companies on the list could reapply for grants and low-interest loans under the new criteria.
"I insisted on this review," said Charles A. Gargano, the commissioner for economic development. "We wanted to scrutinize projects so they meet the test, so there is no political favoritism involved."
But Democratic legislators said political favoritism was at the heart of Mr. Gargano's selection process. They said that in many cases, projects that were rejected were similar to projects that were financed. They charged that Mr. Gargano's only real criteria was whether the projects were in Republican or Democratic districts.
"With Charlie Gargano at the head, you can't exclude political or fund-raising considerations for their reasons," said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat. "They have a history of geographical patronage when it comes to jobs."
Mr. Gargano replied, "There's no way they can demonstrate that. We checked and cross-checked that. We were being fair."
Mr. Silver said that 11 of the rejected projects were in the lower Manhattan area that he and Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, also a Democrat, represent. Of the 177 rejected projects, 94 were in New York City and were worth $5.4 million.
Today's announcement is the latest salvo in what has been a yearlong battle between the Pataki administration and Assembly Democrats over economic development money. During last year's campaign, Mr. Pataki accused Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of trying to "buy the election" by overspending state economic development money in politically sensitive areas.
In October, Mr. Gargano held a news conference to attack the Cuomo administration for mismanaging economic stimulus programs -- an apparent prelude to today's announcement of cutbacks.
The Democrats in turn have accused Mr. Gargano of holding back grants for Democratic districts. They even threatened to use their subpoena powers to force him to release the list of rejected projects that he made public today.
The money for the development projects was to be used for a variety of purposes, ranging from buying equipment to fixing up storefronts to studying new business ventures.
Mr. Gargano said his agency reviewed more than 300 state-financed projects costing $89 million. Of that total, $38.6 million in projects will still receive grants. The remainder will either be canceled or pushed off into future budget years.
Citing a typical example of a project that was rejected, state officials mentioned the case of a $25,000 plan to study establishing a fish farm in an abandoned reservoir in Brooklyn. "Can you see the marketing: fresh from central Brooklyn?" Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gargano, said.
Other projects were rejected because they never got off the ground or repeatedly misspent their money, she said.
But Assembly Democrats said there was no clear criteria for rejecting some projects. They cited the case of two programs to improve storefronts. One, a $355,000 project for North Amityville in Suffolk County, a largely Republican district, received financing. The second, a $166,000 project for Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn, an overwhelmingly Democratic area, did not.
"What was their criteria?" said a Democratic official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The 1994 election returns?"

HEADLINE: British Court Supports Bankers Trust in Derivatives Case

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Providing a measure of vindication to the beleaguered Bankers Trust New York Corporation, a British judge yesterday ordered an Indonesian company to pay $69 million it owed the bank from interest rate bets gone awry.
The company, PT Dharmala Sakti Sejahtera, argued that it should not have had to make good on its losses because Bankers Trust did not properly disclose the risk of the transactions. 
 A number of corporations have lost money from speculative transactions with Bankers Trust, most notably the Procter & Gamble Company, which is suing the bank to nullify its $150 million loss. These transactions used instruments known as derivatives, so named because their value is derived from the value of stock, commodity or interest rate markets.
Bankers Trust officials said they were pleased by the 95-page decision handed down yesterday in London and argued that it was a positive precedent.
"This is the first time that a court has had an opportunity to look at both sides of the issues raised in these controversies," Melvin A. Yellin, chief legal officer of Bankers Trust, said. "The Dharmala case and Procter & Gamble case have many issues in common."
Legal experts agreed that the British decision could well influence the case that Proctor & Gamble has brought in a Federal court in Detroit.
"The issue in both cases is to what extent a dealer has a fiduciary duty to make sure that the transactions of its clients are suitable and appropriate," said Henry Hu, a derivatives law professor at the University of Texas. "This will influence judges in the United States, even though it is from a British court, because there is so little precedent in this area."
Moreover, he said, a court in the United States might be reluctant to impose much tougher restrictions than British courts for fear of driving business overseas. London is a center of derivatives activity, and it is easy for international dealers to write contracts -- even with American companies -- so that British law applies, he said.
Working in Procter & Gamble's favor is the fact that the company's case could be heard by a jury, which could be more sympathetic, particularly in light of audiotapes in which Bankers Trust traders, using rude and callous language, discuss how much risk Procter & Gamble had taken on and how much money the traders were earning from the deals.
The court decision does not assure Bankers Trust of reclaiming the $69 million from Dharmala. For one, the Indonesian concern will probably file an appeal in the British courts, Bankers Trust officials said. Moreover, Dharmala has a separate suit in Indonesia to invalidate the bank's claim. And even if Bankers Trust wins all of these cases, derivatives executives say that it may find collecting its debt difficult.
At least half a dozen international banks and brokerage firms have lost money on similar dealings with Indonesian companies, executives said. Like many investors, these Indonesian concerns made speculative bets in 1993 that interest rates would continue to fall. They turned out to be wrong. But many of the Indonesian companies have refused to cover their losses, and the Indonesian courts have not been amenable to the efforts of the banks and brokerage firms to collect, financial executives said.
Dharmala, a conglomerate with interests in farm commodities, electronics and banking, is controlled by Suyanto Gondokusumo, one of a number of ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs working in Indonesia. The company's London lawyers did not return calls seeking comment.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed as Dow Is Up; Technology Issues Weaken

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday, as the blue chips resumed their ascent, while technology issues weakened.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.64 points, to 5,087.13, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 1.61 points, to 606.98. But the Nasdaq composite index, rich in technology stocks, declined 3.89 points, to 1,055.31. 
 Blue-chip stocks were bolstered in part by a rally in the bond market.
"The strong bond market seemed to have a more direct impact on blue chips than on secondary issues," said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president of Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. "That makes sense because the blue chips are more conservative stocks."
Bond prices rose after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in November for the sixth time in seven months, fueling hopes that interest rates will be reduced soon. The rally drove the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.08 percent -- its lowest level since Nov. 2, 1993 -- from 6.13 percent on Thursday. The prospect of lower interest rates helps stocks because it means lower borrowing costs for companies.
"The economic data released this week by the Government and private sources showed an economy in which consumer spending is growing moderately -- not too fast, not too slow," said Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company. "There is no inflation threat, no chance of the economy overheating."
Advances far exceeded declines on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,434 to 944. Volume on the Big Board fell to 393.3 million shares, from 440.1 million shares on Thursday.
Financial stocks, the most interest-rate-sensitive group, continued to push ahead. J. P. Morgan increased 1 1/2, to 80; Nationsbank rose 1/4, to 71 3/4; BankAmerica added 1 3/4, to 65 3/8; First Fidelity advanced 1 5/8, to 75, and Wells Fargo climbed 2 3/4, to 213.
Some of the cyclical companies, which perform well when the economy advances, also gained. Du Pont closed at 67 5/8, up 1 1/8; United Technologies ended at a record 95 1/8, up 1 3/8; General Electric closed at 68 5/8, up 1 1/2, and Goodyear finished trading at 42 7/8, up 1/2.
Semiconductor stocks were lower on concerns that consumer purchases of computers would be curbed during the Christmas season. Texas Instruments declined 2 5/8, to 55 1/4, and Micron Technology dropped 2 3/8, to 51 7/8.
Software issues wound up on the down side as well. Microsoft closed at 86 1/4, off 7/8, and Oracle ended at 44 5/8, off 3/4.
But shares of Macromedia surged 16 percent after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company had an edge over its competitors in providing interactive animation for World Wide Web sites. The stock advanced 7 1/4, to 53 3/4.
Magma Copper soared 6 1/4, to 27 5/8, after Broken Hill of Australia said that it would acquire Magma for $28 a share. The American depository receipts of Broken Hill inched up 1/4, to 54 5/8.
Westell Technologies gained 10 1/4, to 23 1/4, on its first day of trading. Another initial public offering, Meta Group, increased 7 1/2, to 25 1/2. And Objective Systems, which also went public and said that Cisco Systems had bought a 4.4 percent stake, surged 22 1/4, to 41 1/4. But Cisco Systems slipped 2 1/8, to 82.
Earlier yesterday, stocks in Japan ended higher. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 88.68 points, or half of 1 percent, at 18,833.10, the index's highest finish since 18,840.22 last Jan. 20. The Nikkei climbed as high as 18,985.85 just before the close.

HEADLINE: Global Warming Trends Should Spur Us to Act, Not Delay

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your otherwise admirable Nov. 28 front-page article on how the United States is failing to meet its stated goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2000 downplays the extent of scientific concern about the threats posed by unchecked global warming. 
 You rightly note that "scientists around the world are more convinced than ever" that emissions of greenhouse gases pose a serious threat. But you speak of "scientists' uncertainty about how serious the climate problem is." It would be more accurate to say that scientific uncertainty about how Earth's climate system will respond to increasing emissions of greenhouse gases is itself reason for the most serious concern.
For instance, the atmospheric scientist Wallace Broecker, writing in the November Scientific American, reviews evidence that the climate has been subject to far more rapid shifts than have been thought possible.
These shifts, involving a sudden cooling of Europe's climate, are occasioned by a sudden alteration of Atlantic Ocean currents, which themselves depend on particular patterns of rainfall and salinity.
How ironic it would be if global heating were to lead to catastrophic cold in parts of the Northern Hemisphere, and sundry unpleasant changes elsewhere. Mr. Broecker worries that this could perhaps occur within a century, when our overcrowded planet will be more vulnerable than ever before. "It behooves us," he concludes, to better understand the climate system.
It also behooves us to quit hesitating and change our social and economic behavior in ways that may seem "costly" and "Draconian" (your words) to some. For Earth's climate does not hesitate when making its own costly, Draconian changes.

Gates Goes Public

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
If you're Bill Gates, the wealthiest man in America, you don't have to settle for merely one publicity blitz a year like every other mogul -- you can help yourself to two.
Though it seems like only yesterday that the logo for Windows 95, the latest software product from Microsoft, was as ubiquitous as O. J., now Mr. Gates's face itself is everywhere -- in an Annie Leibovitz photograph on his new book, "The Road Ahead," which is elbowing Colin Powell and Howard Stern out of prime superstore display space, and on "Nightline," "Today" and the David Letterman show, where Mr. Gates, wearing a lab jacket, served as stooge in a sketch about a Rube Goldbergesque "quiz machine." 
 What does Bill Gates want this time? Well, certainly not to make more money; he's giving his royalties away in any event. Is it to transform his image for marketing advantage -- from that of an elusive, nerdy and megalomaniacal tycoon to a chirpy digital evangelist? Maybe a bit. A centerpiece of "The Road Ahead" and its accompanying CD-ROM is a tour of the zillion-dollar manse Mr. Gates is building near Seattle. With its video reproductions of great art and eco-architecture, this narcissistic exercise in Futurama is already as much of a promotional tool for its owner as San Simeon was for Hearst newspapers and the Playboy Mansion was for bunny clubs.
Nonetheless, after reading "The Road Ahead," and hearing Mr. Gates flog it in a 92d Street Y lecture on Monday, I'm inclined to believe he may have written his book for the exact reason he says -- to provoke a national debate about the future.
But is anyone listening?
I wonder. This week the biggest headline in the computer industry was the ascent of a new billionaire, Steven Jobs, whose current venture, Pixar, is now a media obsession to rival Netscape, the creator of the year's previous instant billionaire. Like Mr. Gates's house, such tales of Silicon Valley windfalls are what most seize the popular imagination -- even if many people reading about them know little about what Pixar, Netscape or, for that matter, Microsoft do.
"There isn't anyone here who knows the difference between a computer and a hot tub," said a man to me on Monday night as a group of somebodies gathered for a private reception honoring Mr. Gates before his speech. With the exception of some twentysomethings, he seemed to be right. More people wanted to talk to Mr. Gates about what he calls the "gold rush" atmosphere of his business than about the business itself.
Meanwhile, the technological revolution roars ahead -- personal computer sales have now passed those of TV's, Mr. Gates says -- with social and economic consequences scarcely examined by those Americans who are computer illiterate. "The Road Ahead" tries to get the unwired to join the wired to contemplate the many dislocations sure to occur as the information highway grows from a cliche to reality over the next two decades. Once the country is equipped with high-speed fiber-optic cables, computers will be able to retrieve so many kinds of media so quickly that many present-day trips to the office, library, bank, department store and Blockbuster will become obsolete.
In such a society, Mr. Gates says, there will be less need for cities, less assurance of one's electronic privacy and fewer jobs ("lots of companies will eventually be far smaller"). That society may also compound our current social divisions, given that men, whites, the young and the affluent so far tend to be the information "haves" while women, blacks, the old and the poor are the have-nots.
Bill Gates doesn't offer solutions for these troubling issues. He merely raises them, professes optimism, and invites the rest of us to cope as he returns to making money. Who will lead the debate? Most politicians think about computers only when it's time to grandstand against pornography. Most mass-media reportage on computers is turned over to specialists, whose assignment is to chart the changing fortunes of technology corporations and products rather than look at their long-term impact. Even David Letterman boasted to Mr. Gates this week of how little he knows about computers. If he and the millions of Americans like him were to actually read "The Road Ahead," they would discover that digital ignorance offers no protection from a future that will arrive whether we want it to or not.

HEADLINE: Court Rejects Sculptors' Case

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
Three New York artists seem to have lost their battle to prevent the dismantling and removal of their sculpture from a former Macy's warehouse in Long Island City. Yesterday, in a unanimous decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed a lower court and ruled that the sculpture is not protected by the Visual Artists' Rights Act because it is a work made for hire.
The case is the first legal test of the artists' rights law, which took effect in June 1991. An amendment to Federal copyright law, the act is intended to protect certain categories of visual art commissioned or completed after June 1991 from intentional "distortion, mutilation or other modification" that would harm an artist's honor or reputation and to prevent the destruction of works "of recognized stature." 
 The court ruled on narrow, factual grounds, rather than constitutional questions of artists' rights versus property rights. In a decision written by Judge Richard J. Cardamone, the court found that the three artists, John Carter, John Swing and John Veronis, were employees of the company that held a lease on the warehouse, not independent contractors fulfilling a commission, and that the sculpture is therefore a work made for hire.
The sculpture takes up large portions of the lobby floor, walls and ceiling of a warehouse owned by Helmsley-Spear. Because parts of it are mosaics embedded in the concrete floor, it cannot be dismantled and removed without being at least partly destroyed.
"We felt all along that this is a work-for-hire case that took the matter outside the scope of the Visual Artists' Rights Act," said Adrian Zuckerman, of Davidoff & Malito, which represented Helmsley-Spear.
Mr. Zuckerman declined to comment on what might happen to the sculpture. "My clients are still reviewing the decision," he said.
Daniel H. Weiner of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, which represents the artists, said: "This is a sad day for the artists, and a sad day for art in New York. We will be urging people to get in touch with the Municipal Art Society, which has been conducting tours of the work, so they can see it before Helmsley-Spear swings the wrecking ball."
Mr. Weiner said that he and the artists had not decided whether to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. The case would be extremely difficult to appeal, he said, because yesterday's ruling dealt with specific facts rather than constitutional issues.
"It's sad, almost as though a family member has died," Mr. Carter said. "Either the law or the process turns out to be very weak, since it wouldn't have protected the Sistine Chapel. You have to wonder what is being protected."
In the summer of 1994, Richard A. Altman, representing the artists, argued in Federal District Court in Manhattan that the untitled work met the definition of an artwork of stature and that the artists, because they had artistic control over the work and used their own materials and tools, were not employees.
Under the artists' rights law, he said, the work could not be removed or altered by Helmsley-Spear during the lifetime of any of the three artists. On Aug. 31, 1994, Judge David N. Edelstein ruled in favor of the artists. Mr. Altman ceased representing the artists soon after the trial, when he and they disagreed about legal tactics.
The Appeals Court, in its decision, pointed out that the artists received a weekly salary, took paid vacations, had payroll taxes and Social Security withheld and carried out additional projects elsewhere in the building at the request of the leaseholder. Two of the artists, after the project was halted by Helmsley-Spear in May 1994, filed for unemployment insurance. The court ruled that these circumstances added up to an employer-employee relationship.
The court sidestepped an additional argument by Mr. Altman that the artists could not be employees because the leaseholder, in a written agreement, granted them the copyright to their work. Judge Cardamone wrote that the court was uncertain on this point, and that any decision on the argument would have to be "put off for another day."
Mr. Altman said that he found the court vague on this point. "There is something very wrong here," he said. "If this is your artwork and you have the copyright, how can I have the right to destroy it? It creates the weird situation in which the artist has the copyright but the copyright is worthless, because it doesn't protect the artwork from being destroyed."

HEADLINE: Rally Takes Long Bond's Yield to 2-Year Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday for the third consecutive session as expectations grew that the Federal Reserve would soon reduce short-term interest rates. The current rally has lowered the yield of the 30-year bond to a two-year low.
Among the factors behind yesterday's spurt of buying was a report of weak manufacturing activity last month, released by the National Association of Purchasing Management, and comments by a Federal Reserve official who sees the economy slowing. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 12/32 , to 11019/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.08 percent, from 6.13 percent on Thursday. The yield is at its lowest since Nov. 2, 1993, when it was 6.05 percent.
Prices were firm before the purchasing management group released its monthly report. The group's index fell to 46.5 in November, from 46.8 in October, with the employment component down for the ninth consecutive month.
The weaker manufacturing number was expected, and analysts said it pointed to a slowdown in the industrial economy.
The main message of the report, said Bruce Steinberg, manager of macroeconomic analysis at Merrill Lynch & Company, "is that the industrial sector is not going anywhere fast and that inflation pressures continue to abate."
"This is another in a string of economic reports suggesting that interest rates should decline further," he said.
The market's view of a slowing economy was bolstered by comments late Thursday by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Robert T. Parry.
After speaking before executives in San Francisco, Mr. Parry told reporters that the growth rate of gross domestic product for the fourth quarter would be "significantly below" the rate of the third quarter.
His comments were interpreted to mean that the Fed saw room to cut short-term interest rates, even though Mr. Parry is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting panel. The committee next meets on Dec. 19.
Mr. Parry's comments came on the heels of statements by the vice chairman of the Fed, Alan S. Blinder. Mr. Blinder told the Market News Service on Thursday that the central bank had a "window of opportunity" to cut rates now to head off an economic decline in 1997.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and a senior portfolio manager at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, said the market was getting somewhat ahead of itself after a string of reports showing a slowing economy and moderate inflation.
"There are signs of weakness in the economy," Mr. Donne said. "I think the two issues facing the market are: one, how or will those be corroborated with the employment numbers next week, and secondly, and more significantly, are we going to get a real budget-deficit-reduction program or a lot of quilt patchwork?"

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls vs. Mark and Yen, But Gains on Franc and Pound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar retreated against the German mark and Japanese yen yesterday but strengthened vs. other European currencies in slow foreign-exchange dealings.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 101.25 Japanese yen, down from 102.15 on Thursday, and at 1.4460 German marks, down from 1.4470. 
 For the week, the dollar was up more than 2.5 pfennigs against the mark and lost only 0.16 yen against the yen.
The prospect of a drop in interest rates in Britain helped the dollar against the pound. In New York, the pound fell to $1.5310 from $1.5325.
A selloff in French francs and purchase of marks in Europe helped the dollar against the franc. France has been partly paralyzed by the worst strikes in a decade. The dollar rose to 4.9981 French francs, from 4.9970 francs on Thursday.
"The market is quite bearish on the French franc," said Laura Jean McCarthy, a senior trader at the New York branch of the Union Bank of Switzerland. "You always get a sale like that when you get turmoil."
The dollar retained most of the gains it accrued during the week, when traders were buying the currency in anticipation of a German interest rate cut that could have diminished the value of the mark. The dollar held those gains even when Germany's central bank left rates unchanged on Thursday.
"In general the dollar is holding up very well," said Al Pugliesi, a trader at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer & Company. "That maybe shows the market is looking at the dollar in a different way as we get toward the end of the year."
Demand for dollars usually rises as the year draws to a close, partly because many American multinationals repatriate profits and exchange local currencies for dollars. The dollar's allure has also been enhanced by strength in the United States stock and bond markets, which raises demand for the currency needed to buy them.
Traders said the dollar initially weakened in early trading in New York after the National Association of Purchasing Management's widely followed monthly survey showed American manufacturing slowed for the fourth consecutive month in November to its lowest rate since June.
The retreat was unexpectedly sharp, suggesting that it could prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to stimulate growth. Lower rates tend to diminish a currency's value.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY

BYLINE: By Andy Grundberg; Andy Grundberg is the director of the Friends of Photography in San Francisco.

 BODY:
IN years past, the publication of a book devoted to a major photographer was a singular event, often a cause for rejoicing. Now these events seem to come in threes, one of them invariably being a biography, the latest step on the path to enshrining photographers within the pantheon of 20th-century art. This season the honors go to Walker Evans ("Walker Evans: Incognito," "Walker Evans: The Getty Museum Collection" and "Walker Evans: A Biography," by Belinda Rathbone) and Alfred Stieglitz ("Alfred Stieglitz at Lake George," Richard Whelan's "Alfred Stieglitz: A Biography" and the Getty Museum's chapbook-style "In Focus: Alfred Stieglitz").
While these titles fit into the category of safe bets, there are publishers who are willing to take chances on photography titles with less predictable appeal. For example, documentary grit is momentarily back in fashion, with three strong contenders: "Dirty Windows," by Merry Alpern, "Raised by Wolves," by Jim Goldberg, and "Tokyo, Love," by Nan Goldin and Nobuyoshi Araki (all published by Scalo/Distributed Art Publishers). None offers much in the way of holiday cheer, but they all carry other emotional charges. So do many of the titles discussed below, some of which are interesting precisely because they are off the beaten track of photography publishing. 
 Sadly, some prospective mainstream hits this year turn out to be near misses, including three from Abrams (the first two, to be sure, simply purchased from European publishers). "Edward Weston: Forms of Passion" is marred by inferior reproductions; "Man Ray 1890-1976" is done in by its design; "Tina Modotti: Photographs," by Sarah M. Lowe, is a disappointment because the photographs do not live up to expectations. For those who are on a tight budget, one alternative is to look for titles that are part of the Smithsonian Institution's "Photographers at Work" series, a recent addition to which is "A Camera in a Room: Photographs by Abelardo Morell." Other series of note are the National Museum of American Art's "American Scene" books and the Getty Museum's "In Focus" titles, which in addition to Stieglitz include Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Andre Kertesz. But here are the highlights of the season:
SECRETS OF THE DARK CHAMBER: The Art of the American Daguerreotype. By Merry A. Foresta and John Wood. (National Museum of American Art/Smithsonian Institution, $55.) Any doubts about the importance of the daguerreotype to visual life in the United States in the 19th century are thoroughly laid to rest with this collection of some of the most beautiful, powerful and mysterious images ever made with a camera. No matter whether the genre was portraiture, landscape or still life, American daguerreotypists in the 1840's and 50's produced remarkable pictures that almost literally made the world stand still. "Daguerreotypomania" led to the establishment of hundreds of daguerreotype studios in New York City alone, as portraiture for the first time became economically available to everyone.
"Secrets of the Dark Chamber" brings this often overlooked chapter in the development of modern camera culture to center stage, and its claims for the importance of the daguerreotype are by no means modest. Merry A. Foresta -- who, with John Wood, a historian of the daguerreotype, organized the exhibition that this book accompanies -- writes: "Quite simply, the daguerreotype process changed the way we see and represent the world." After looking at the more than 100 exquisite life-size reproductions in this book, one can find little reason to disagree. Here, in evanescent miniature, are mirrored some of the 19th century's major preoccupations: dignifying the individual, conquering nature, inventing new machines, inventorying possessions, preserving family memory by photographing the dead.
There are historical pictures that need no elaboration, like a portrait of an imperious Daniel Webster, taken about 1850 by Albert Sands Southworth and Josiah Johnson Hawes, perhaps the medium's finest practitioners. A view of the Capitol under construction in Washington, taken in 1846 by John Plumbe Jr., also speaks for itself. In many cases, however, the fascinating quality of daguerreotypes is due to their mystery. One man poses with his finger held in front of his eye; a woman holds a letter sealed with wax tinted red; a portrait of a man wearing a hat is paired with an image of a crushed hat on a chair. That these were taken by unidentified makers, in undefined years, only adds to their fascinating ambiguity. At a time when we seem to be returning to viewing images individually and in private -- only now on the shiny surfaces of computer screens -- reconsidering the daguerreotype experience is especially apt.
ALFRED STIEGLITZ AT LAKE GEORGE. By John Szarkowski. (Museum of Modern Art/Abrams, $35.) This unpretentious catalogue, documenting an exhibition organized by the Museum of Modern Art that will travel to Bonn and San Francisco, would be worth having merely for its eloquent, poetic and well-reasoned essay by John Szarkowski, the former director of the museum's department of photography. But its enduring value may rest in the case it makes for Stieglitz as a photographer who responded more to everyday experience than to his deep-seated desire to demonstrate photography's status as an art. By judicious selection of images from Stieglitz's previously restricted archive (restricted, one might note, by the wishes of Georgia O'Keeffe), Mr. Szarkowski rescues one of this century's most important photographers from the bonds of received scholarship and thus revives him as a living, curious and interesting artist.
The pictures reproduced here, in sizes that often approximate the originals, range from portraits of Stieglitz's relatives to long landscape views extending from the Stieglitz farmhouse to the far shore of Lake George. Some are so patently ordinary that their charms come as major surprises. Among the most extraordinary are a suite of erotically charged images from 1916 of a vivacious young woman in a clinging bathing costume and two nudes of Rebecca Strand, the wife of the photographer Paul Strand, taken in 1923. The intensity and spontaneity of these two photographs suggest convincingly that Stieglitz was at his best when he worked from his heart as well as from his head. The same, clearly, could be said of Mr. Szarkowski, the book's author.
WALKER EVANS: INCOGNITO. (Eakins Press Foundation, 15 West 67th Street, New York, N.Y. 10023, $75.) Based on a 1971 article published in Art in America, this slim deluxe volume reproduces eight Walker Evans photographs together with explanatory texts he wrote for them and an interview with Evans by Leslie George Katz. The texts, far from being captions, slide from descriptive to self-analytical to proscriptive with remarkable ease. Of his classic "Penny Picture Display, Savannah, 1936," Evans says: "The only reason this photograph has any value is, an instinct is touched in it. 'This is for me.' It's like the meaning of a person. The singular importance of this spoke to me that way." Of a much later and less well-known picture of debris, from 1960, he writes: "While removed from nature, this picture of a gutter is in a sense very human. It is Baudelairean. I wish Baudelaire was alive to see it. The secret of photography is, the camera takes on the character and personality of the handler. The mind works on the machine."
WALKER EVANS: The Getty Museum Collection. By Judith Keller. (J. Paul Getty Museum, $95.) More than 1,000 examples of Walker Evans's art, culled from the J. Paul Getty Museum's prime collection of his work, have been ably selected and sorted by Judith Keller, a photography curator at the Getty. Ms. Keller provides the facts about each print and also discusses the import of various chapters of Evans's career, from his early Cubist-inspired views of New York City to the color Polaroids he made in the 1970's. While the reproductions are intended as reference rather than as approximations of the originals, everything else a scholar or connoisseur would want to learn can be found here. This scholarly portrait is a kind companion to the distinctly unpleasant view of Evans presented by Belinda Rathbone in her recent "Walker Evans: A Biography" (Houghton Mifflin).
AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY 1890-1965 FROM THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, NEW YORK. By Peter Galassi. With an essay by Luc Sante. (Museum of Modern Art/Abrams, $60.) Peter Galassi, who succeeded John Szarkowski as the director of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art, has used his knowledge of the museum's collection to create a simultaneously seductive and contentious history of the evolution of photography in the United States. Starting with George Eastman's introduction of snapshot photography and the perfection of halftone reproduction in the late 19th century, he traces the intertwined strands of "professional" commercial practices, "amateur" vernacular practices and self-consciously artistic practices in this country, arguing that their apparently conflicting aims were first resolved by Walker Evans in the 1930's.
For evidence, "American Photography" starts with such 19th-century images as William H. Rau's views of the Pennsylvania countryside, taken in 1891 and 1892, and ends with Lee Friedlander's 1962 interior of a hotel in Galax, Va., illuminated by a television set. In between, one finds a provocative and enticing combination of high-art and non-art images that trace not only the pulse of American photography over the years but also the vicissitudes of esthetic positions within the museum's department of photography over the years since its stormy founding in 1940. This means that "American Photography" serves as both an example of the museum's taste and a history of it.
UNTITLED. By Diane Arbus. Afterword by Doon Arbus. (Aperture, $50.) For two years before she took her life in 1971, Diane Arbus photographed residents of institutions for the mentally retarded. So obsessively did she pursue this self-imposed assignment that the resulting pictures, many of which are published here for the first time, seem to come from one unbroken "take," to use the parlance of photojournalism. Her female subjects -- in Halloween costumes, dressed up as if for Sunday school, at play in empty fields -- seem to enjoy her attentions, but their faces are inscribed with an infantile lack of comprehension of their own status as subjects. Their participation in Arbus's theater of the human grotesque is simultaneously emotionally touching and ethically disturbing, which gives this long-awaited, elegantly designed book a relevance Arbus herself could not have imagined. Whether the images represent a radical shift in the photographer's style and technique, as Doon Arbus, her daughter, suggests in her afterword, is left to the reader's imagination.
THE ROUGE: PHOTOGRAPHS BY MICHAEL KENNA. (Ram Publications, Bergamot Station, 2525 Michigan Avenue, Santa Monica, Calif. 90404, $45.) Published on the occasion of an exhibition at the Detroit Institute of Arts from Dec. 1 through Feb. 11, "The Rouge" is testimony both to our growing nostalgia for the industrial age and to Michael Kenna's increasingly convincing artistic powers. The beautifully reproduced photographs are precise black-and-white views of the structures of Henry Ford's steel making and automobile manufacturing complex on the Rouge River in Dearborn, Mich. They give mythic proportion to the legacy of American enterprise and industrial might. By working at dawn, at dusk and often through the night, Mr. Kenna has managed to still the din and bustle of the place while imbuing it with a romantic, smoky atmosphere worthy of a Turner landscape painting. Captions by Lee R. Kollins, a former Ford executive, describe the physical structures seen in the images and tell how steel is made, but they come across as prosaic compared with the penumbral industrial utopia evoked by Mr. Kenna's photographs.
STRANGE RITUAL: Pictures and Words by David Byrne. (Chronicle, $24.95.) In his second book of photographs, David Byrne, the leader of the rock band Talking Heads, proves that his talents lie not only in music. "Strange Ritual" is a compendium of vernacular, peripheral and ephemeral objects and sights that Mr. Byrne has collected over the past 10 years, seen in a distinctive and offbeat manner that could readily be compared to the artist's surrealistic song lyrics. In one sequence, for example, he shows us a stuffed chair, upholstered in motel-modern style, turned on its side, upside down and on its back. Empty rooms, an empty parking garage and posters of Indian film stars also fall within Mr. Byrne's quirky sights. The ambiguity of the resulting visual narrative is made slightly less puzzling by the accompanying short texts, which ponder contemporary culture; unfortunately, Mr. Byrne's writing, divorced from its musical basis, proves less sure than his eye.
WEST FROM THE COLUMBIA: Views at the River Mouth. By Robert Adams. (Aperture, $50.) Magisterial and meditative, Robert Adams's most recent images look beyond the American West that has been his lifelong subject, and into the vastness of the Pacific Ocean. True, there are pictures here of the jetties, sand beaches, shorelines and skies found at the mouth of the mighty Columbia River, but the best are of nothing but the sea itself. And while ocean waters have lately become a popular subject throughout contemporary art, Mr. Adams's are grounded in his struggle to accommodate his need for an untrammeled, undisturbed natural world to the incursions of modern life. His uncompromisingly idealist vision might be taken for nostalgic sentimentality by some, but his Pacific is beyond reproach: unbounded, fathomless, roiled at the surface and calm below.

GRAPHIC: Photos: "Georgia O'Keeffe," 1931, a photograph from "Alfred Stieglitz at Lake George."; Indian movie star posters photographed by David Byrne for his book "Strange Ritual." (pg. 56); "Subway Portrait," 1938-41, a photograph by Walker Evans. (FROM "WALKER EVANS: THE GETTY MUSEUM COLLECTION") (pg. 58)

HEADLINE: EDITORS' CHOICE

 BODY:
FOUR novels, a collection of stories, three biographies, a memoir, a freelance report on Eastern European politics and a volume of essays are the best books of 1995. They were chosen by the nine editors of the Book Review from among 37 books originally nominated, during nine weeks of deliberation.
Three of the five authors of fiction here are veterans of the best books lists, having appeared several times during the last 27 years. All the nonfiction writers are first-timers. And two of them, an ambassador and a judge, are the first of their professions to be chosen. Very odd, that, since judges and ambassadors spend so much of their lives writing. 
 Diaries and letters are not eligible. It was not a great year for them anyway, although Edouard Daladier's "Prison Journal, 1940-1945" is an affecting record of the onetime French Prime Minister's years in Nazi prisons and "A World of My Own: A Dream Diary," by Graham Greene, is as funny as any diary known. The only big-name caches of letters reviewed this year were "The Republic of Letters: The Correspondence Between Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, 1776-1826" and "Jack Kerouac: Selected Letters, 1940-1956." If Jefferson and Kerouac had been pen pals, we might have changed the rules, but it did not happen.
Comments made below about the best books are drawn largely from the reviews that appeared here. Best books are not included in the roster of Notable Books of the Year, which begins on page 64.
 
THE HAUNTED LAND
Facing Europe's Ghosts After Communism.
By Tina Rosenberg.
Random House.
 Tina Rosenberg thinks efforts by Eastern Europeans to establish a new order may be doomed unless they face up to what they all did under the collapsed Communist regimes. She writes about East Germany, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic in personal terms, focusing each account on an individual to point up the moral uncertainties nagging people at all social levels: How much of the past should be revealed? Who should be punished? Who can judge? Should everyone who thrived in the old order be shorn of all gains? Who should see the files? What constituted collaboration? The portraits drawn by this compassionate reporter make one feel the fear weighing on people as they try to rebuild, along with the treacherous sense of comfort that entices many to evade personal responsibility for letting tyranny succeed as long as it did.
 
IN CONFIDENCE
By Anatoly Dobrynin.
Times Books/Random House.
No other ambassador in modern times has played such a long and crucial role in international affairs as Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet envoy in Washington from 1962 to 1986, and none has written about his experience with fewer inhibitions. His is the most revealing account of the cold war to have come out of Russia so far; it opens up a great seam in hitherto impenetrable Soviet history. His revelations of how some great crises were resolved through secret channels of negotiation are fascinating. But what truly astonishes one is his frank exposure of 40 years of blunders by the leaders in Moscow and the energy with which he condemns some of them -- especially Mikhail Gorbachev, whom Mr. Dobrynin blames for the collapse of the Soviet empire. At first, readers may wonder whether he tells the truth; by the end of the book they will have no doubt.
 
INDEPENDENCE DAY
By Richard Ford.
Knopf.
Frank Bascombe, the antihero of "The Sportswriter" (1986), is back -- no longer a writer but a real estate salesman, 44, divorced ("I wanted somebody with a true heart," his ex-wife says; "that wasn't you"). Personal relationships, especially with women, puzzle him more than ever; it is not, he says, as if he doesn't exist, just that he doesn't "exist as much" as other people. So his attempts to turn his current affair into something deeper fizzle out, and his efforts to help his troubled teen-age son during a Fourth of July weekend trip veer toward tragedy. If the novel's story line is thin, the character sketches are brilliant work by a master of the craft. With wisdom and wry wit, Richard Ford makes Bascombe a man who takes his place alongside Willy Loman and Rabbit Angstrom in our literature.
 
THE INFORMATION
By Martin Amis.
Harmony.
Midlife crisis is something else in Martin Amis's dazzling novel about literary envy in London. Richard, a failed novelist, can't stand the huge success of his best friend, Gwyn, whose stinking-bad novels make him a fortune. Richard, indignant and resentful, tries to redress the cosmic imbalance with the help of some of Mr. Amis's usual menagerie of dangerous netherworlders, who turn Richard's dicey game against him. All the characters become pawns in an accelerating chess match they have no control over. Mr. Amis, the prince of hip, is in top form; his humor is more daring than ever, and his mastery of phrase and metaphor makes his gorgeous, dark invention crackle. He is also smart about being smart: at just the right moments he sinks the blade of his satire into himself.
 
THE ISLAND OF THE DAY BEFORE
By Umberto Eco.
Translated by William Weaver.
Helen and Kurt Wolff/Harcourt Brace.
This grand and deliriously writerly novel is a book of many books that regenerates literary traditions as it unfolds a tale of warfare, romance and shipwreck during the most exciting period of our intellectual history, the mid-17th century. Umberto Eco's narrative surface is sensually alluring, cool and glittery, but for all its lucidity and charm, there is always something else going on: if the plot turns on blood, ambition, intrigue, spying, love, death and damnation, there is a profound agenda here that urgently if playfully makes us aware of the steady continuity of human thought -- the conspiracy of the world to be known. This novel is really a book about telling, reminding us that the only clarity we are capable of reaching is the story we tell to compel time and the universe to take on meaning.
 
THE LIFE OF GRAHAM GREENE
Volume Two: 1939-1955.
By Norman Sherry.
Viking.
Norman Sherry, the biographer as bloodhound, tracks Graham Greene -- who found peace only in drink, drugs, sex and war -- through tangled love affairs, international conflicts and spy capers on four continents. This volume covers the years of his greatest novels and film scripts, and exposes all the intricate connections between the life and the fiction. Mr. Sherry spells out what was a grotesquely complicated life in a compulsively readable, astutely humane story that, in other hands, might have been just salacious. Perhaps most startling is his account of Greene's career in Britain's intelligence services during and after World War II. His boss was the traitor Kim Philby. Greene kept in close touch with Philby all his life; Mr. Sherry produces evidence at least suggesting that Greene in his later years may have turned Philby, once a double agent for Moscow, into a double agent for the West.
 
LINCOLN
By David Herbert Donald.
Simon & Schuster.
There may be 7,000 books about Abraham Lincoln around, but David Herbert Donald's biography is so lucid, richly researched, scrupulous and gritty that one cannot imagine a more satisfying one. In it Lincoln's life is a series of abrupt triumphs and setbacks that constantly threaten to sink him into oblivion. He is no simple hero: he has principles aplenty, but he is wily in pursuit of them, driven by blazing ambition. He knows all there is to know about how to get things done, often by dissimulation; that he learned in the squalid political infighting of Illinois courthouses. And he loves political battles -- never more than when he leads the country in its direst crisis. Mr. Donald's voice is confident, earthy and restrained, and therein lies his book's cumulative power; it comes alive in the mind, and the last page is unforgettable.
 
OVERCOMING LAW
By Richard A. Posner.
Harvard University.
 The Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago -- a Reagan appointee, no less -- has written the sharpest and most thoughtful book on the plight of law in years, one that lashes conservatives and liberals alike. The judge is deliciously sarcastic about most lawyers, judges and law professors, whom he finds a lazy pack dedicated to legal precedents and ignorant of the real world. He insists that law will be reformed only when all of them direct attention to the real-world effects of their arguments and decisions -- and that means they have a lot to learn about their fellow citizens and about other disciplines that might sharpen their thinking: economics, sociology, history and more. Law is "a public good of immense value," he argues, but ordinary people increasingly don't see it that way, and unless they do it will disappear.
 
SABBATH'S THEATER
By Philip Roth.
Houghton Mifflin.
Out of the way, all you afternoon trash-talk television show hosts, and Madonna too -- kids, mere kids. In the great game of sex and outrage, Philip Roth remains unchallenged. To feel tumultuously alive, touch the nasty side of existence, says the protagonist of "Sabbath's Theater," Mr. Roth's richest novel. There is plenty of the nasty in this virtuoso performance by our best literary stand-up comic. But the menacing sense of last things in the story of an aging man leaving his wife, going to a funeral and arranging for his own death gives a depth and resonance to the jokes and rascally fun found in none of his other books. The verbal play is almost tactile, like slaps, as the narrative moves from third-person comic to first-person perverse confession, but there is a polemical energy that lifts it beyond verbal playfulness; at times the message is painful.
 
THE STORIES OF VLADIMIR NABOKOV
Edited by Dmitri Nabokov.
Knopf.
The density and richness of these 65 stories -- including 13 never published before -- make them overwhelming if one tries to read them right through. They have to be explored one by one in many moods. Nabokov wrote nine in English, one in French; 55 were written in Russian between 1920 and 1940, during his European exile. Most deal with a remembered, enchanted Russia or the raffish world of the impoverished diaspora. Nabokov's youthful passions for butterfly collecting, chess and poetry fused to endow his prose with a peculiar intensity and trickiness. In language that strains at the limits of the expressible, he used infinitely precise sensory minutiae to encode the mingled miracles of being and our perception of it. He was the great poet of consciousness, and his stories continue to change a reader's response to the world, no matter how many times one comes back to them.
 
ZOLA
A Life.
By Frederick Brown.
Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
How did Emile Zola -- who always proclaimed that the writer must stand above politics -- become the moral conscience of France during the Dreyfus affair, taking on the establishment so effectively that he may have been murdered for what he did? Frederick Brown, in the best biography of Zola ever, shows how his childhood and early journalism made him hate duplicity; he was determined to force readers to look only at "the facts" in his novels, without romantic or patriotic illusions. In a richly detailed examination of the books and the realities they reflected, Mr. Brown makes clear that it was that resolve that moved Zola to shame the entire political class of France in his last years. For the first time the man, the artist and the firebrand who forced a nation to look its own hypocrisy in the eye can be seen as the same person -- perhaps not an engaging man, but a great one.

HEADLINE: THE HOLY TERROR

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY; John Tierney is a staff writer for the Magazine.

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani, not ONE TO UNDERESTIMATE HIMSELF, FEELS A CERTAIN kinship when he looks at the portrait of Fiorello La Guardia that hangs behind his desk at City Hall. "A really terrific role model," Mayor Giuliani calls him. So far the resemblance has eluded most other New Yorkers. In the public mind Fiorello La Guardia is the Little Flower, the builder of modern New York, the benevolent figure who read the comics to children on the radio; Rudolph Giuliani is the control freak, the slasher of budgets, the taut face denouncing the vile stupidity of his enemies on television every night. But consider a few judgments of these Mayors rendered by journalists and public officials of both eras. (For quiz purposes, telltale past-tense verbs have been changed.) See if you can distinguish which of these statements refer to Mayor La Guardia and which refer to Mayor Giuliani:
 
* He has exhibited a persistent tendency to disparage and humiliate -- often in public -- anyone who disagrees with him. He seems to enjoy governing by fear, relishing his role as the city's chief whipmaster.
* He likes to see people cringe.
* New York has never been nearer a one-man government than today. No one of the Mayor's commissioners dares to decide anything more than a routine matter without consulting him for his O.K.
* He can't stand his commissioners getting the headlines. . . . Reports have to come through his office. . . . We have to be so cautious because if we breathe a single word he'll go into mad tantrums.
* He can be cynical, churlish, hotheaded, petty and just plain wrong. At one time or another, he has antagonized everyone who has ever worked for him.
* To the Mayor, the word advice is like a red flag to a bull.
* When he does not get what he wants he exhibits an ungovernable temper and lets loose an unbridled tongue, seeing red, stirring up trouble, throwing black mud around, bespattering the record or reputation and the family of friend or foe.
All but the first comment were made about La Guardia. The Little Flower was just one of his nicknames; he was also called Little Napoleon, the Great Infallible and Midget Mussolini. At one public hearing he told a Tammany Hall loyalist, "If you try to start anything with me, you'll go out of that window, you bootlicking valet!" When he spotted a bus driver running a red light, Mayor La Guardia not only copied the license-plate number and had the driver summoned to court, he presided as magistrate and personally imposed the fine. He did have charms that Giuliani lacks, but he could be just as self-righteous. He, too, loved Italian opera and its impassioned zealots. His most appropriate nickname, bestowed by a reporter, was an Italian phrase that would fit either Tosca or Scarpia, and that nicely suits Giuliani too: Il Sacro Terrore. The Holy Terror.
"He was the last reformer as Mayor," Giuliani says of La Guardia. "For his time he captured exactly what New York City needed: somebody who can challenge the assumptions and is willing to be controversial." Giuliani read a biography of La Guardia during the 1993 campaign, and one of his first acts as Mayor was to move La Guardia's desk and portrait into his office. It was a presumptuous thing to do, but in his first two years Giuliani has fulfilled at least part of his mission. No Mayor since La Guardia has challenged so many assumptions and created so much controversy.
Why, his critics keep asking, can't Giuliani disagree with people without insulting them? Why must he always be right, always in charge? Was it really necessary to create an international incident by ejecting Yasir Arafat from Lincoln Center? Isn't there something awry in the civic culture on a day when the tabloid front pages proclaim "RUDY'S ONE RUDE DUDE" (an opinion from the State Department) and "GO TO HELL" (a farewell message from Arafat)? Each new fight prompts new analyses of his character flaws, new predictions of doom for him and the city.
 YET SOMEHOW, DESPITE ALL THESE FLAWS, HE has accomplished more in two years than almost anyone imagined possible. Facing one of the worst fiscal crises in city history, he balanced two budgets while cutting taxes. The municipal labor force has shrunk, but the streets and parks are cleaner. Crime has dropped so sharply that New York is now one of America's safest cities, and the Police Department's new tactics are being copied around the country. The city is reducing its welfare rolls and running the nation's largest workfare program. Giuliani hasn't yet reinvented New York's government, but he has begun to reshape it, and he has transformed the city's political debate. He has challenged the assumptions of big-city liberalism, the philosophy that dominated New York for six decades -- ever since that other Italian-American Republican reformer became Mayor.
In 1934 La Guardia took over a city essentially bankrupted by the Depression and Tammany Hall's corruption. He demolished the Democratic machine by firing thousands of Tammany's political hacks. But soon he replaced them with even more employees to issue regulations and run housing projects, hospitals and welfare programs. He created a new establishment, something of a Fiorello Hall, with a progressive faith that was not shaken by rising taxes and worsening deficits. The city already had budget problems by the time La Guardia left office in 1945, but Fiorello Hall's ambitions kept growing in the ensuing decades. The fiscal crisis of 1975 required a retrenchment, but the city's budgets went right back up when the 80's boom brought in new tax revenues.
As a result, Giuliani today faces a political establishment that makes Tammany Hall look like a mom-and-pop operation. During Tammany's heyday the city collected no taxes on income or sales (the first sales tax was a "temporary" measure of La Guardia's), so there was limited revenue available. Giuliani inherited a city with high taxes supporting America's only municipal welfare state: one of every six residents on welfare, one of every five jobs in the public sector. The city is by far the leading landlord and employer, and it finances legions of private workers providing social services -- one of New York's few growth industries the past decade. Unlike Tammany's pols, today's establishment can collect its money without breaking laws. In fact, it commands the moral high ground, at least among a certain intellectual elite in Manhattan. Almost any reform of Fiorello Hall can be denounced as an attack on the poor.
"The biggest and largest special interest group in the city," Giuliani says, "is the intellectual establishment. New York is a great intellectual center that has become one of the most backward parts of America -- unwilling to think a new thought. I absolutely love, and maybe I overdo this a little, to suggest something new and then watch the reaction to it. Sometimes I'm not even sure we should do it, but I love to watch the reaction from the so-called intellectuals. The thinking establishment goes into convulsions over the idea that we could ask people on welfare to work, or that we should fingerprint them to prevent fraud. It's almost as if a secular religion had developed in which these are the things that you must believe to be considered an educated, intelligent and moral person."
Giuliani preaches less government and more self-reliance, not just for individuals but for cities -- what he called, in a speech earlier this year in Washington, a new urban agenda. The speech repudiated a liberal tradition dating to La Guardia and the New Deal. It might have been headlined "RUDY TO FEDS: DROP DEAD," although Giuliani put it more diplomatically: "Set us free." He argued that New York should stop begging to be rescued by the Federal and state governments, whose programs waste money and impose pointless regulations. Instead of going to Washington and Albany with sad stories and a tin cup, New York should keep its tax dollars and solve its own problems. It should adopt the proposals that Giuliani, in his typical workaholic fashion, devised before the 1993 campaign by interviewing hundreds of experts and by studying reinventing-government proposals from the Manhattan Institute. His vision is partly technocratic -- Giuliani loves to recite statistics and three-point plans-- but it is also intensely moralistic.
Giuliani, who once planned to be a priest, shares La Guardia's conviction that there is a true path, that the world is divided into Us and Them, that the city's savior should be guided less by political ideology than by personal virtue. He understands the sentiment that La Guardia expressed to a writer for The New York Times Magazine in 1934, in an article headlined "A Full Day on the Job With the Mayor." As the original Holy Terror denounced the "cancer in the very heart of the city," he had no doubts about his own saintliness. "I am committing political suicide," he said, grandly and inaccurately. "If I succeed in making this city a better place in which to live, I shall feel that the result justified the sacrifice."
 
A FULL DAY ON THE JOB WITH THE MAYOR
 Giuliani's day often begins with a live radio interview at 6:30 or 7, and he is ordinarily at City Hall by 8 to meet with the dozen members of his inner circle. But on this Thursday, Oct. 19, the staff meeting has been canceled so everyone can go to Brooklyn for the monthly meeting of the full cabinet. Giuliani doesn't have to leave Gracie Mansion until 8:15. He and his wife, Donna Hanover Giuliani, see their two children off to school, and the Mayor has a quick cup of coffee in the kitchen before climbing into his white van. Except for a phone call at 4:30 briefing him about reaction to his crusade to rid the Fulton Fish Market of companies suspected of having Mafia connections, Giuliani slept from 1:45 to 6:15. "I like to get four to six hours," he says. "If I get seven hours' sleep, then for two nights I'll only sleep two or three hours, because I'll be very, very wide awake."
 9 A.M. Arriving at Brooklyn Borough Hall, Giuliani stops in for a meeting with Howard Golden, the Borough President, and borrows three paper clips to secure a trouser cuff that has come loose. They go into the grand courtroom for the cabinet meeting, at which several dozen commissioners and officials listen to a list of demands from the Borough President, exhortations from Giuliani and a speech from Randy Mastro, the Mayor's chief of staff. Mastro begins with a reference to a story in the Times about Giuliani's recent penchant for describing his own courage in making decisions.
"I want to tell a story about another example of this Mayor's courage," Mastro says. "That's my word, not The New York Times'." Mastro, who prosecuted organized crimes under Giuliani at the United States Attorney's office, has been up all night dealing with the Fulton Fish Market. Some workers, angry at a new company brought in to unload fish at the wholesale market, had staged a wildcat strike earlier in the week, whereupon Giuliani went before the television cameras and threatened to shut down the entire market. "I was never prouder of this administration than at that moment," Mastro says, reporting that the threat has worked. The market was open all night for the usual wholesale deliveries of fish. "Organized crime has been prevalent in the Fulton Fish Market for 70 years, and it's not going to go away overnight," Mastro concludes. "But this Mayor has the guts and the courage to stay the course."
The commissioners applaud vigorously. Loyalty is vital in this administration. Last year, when newspapers were quoting unnamed commissioners complaining about budget cuts, all the commissioners were summoned to City Hall by Peter Powers, Giuliani's First Deputy Mayor as well as a close friend since high school. "I told the commissioners," Powers would later recall, "how we discovered after the election that David Dinkins had hidden the deficit so it was three times worse than what we'd thought -- but I never heard Rudy once complain that the money ran dry. He took the hand that was dealt. I said to them: 'You can't complain either. You've got to lead by example. You can't go back to your deputy and complain, because then your deputy will complain to his or her deputy, and it will get out in the press. If it's too hard for you to make these cuts, tell me privately and we'll part friends. If you want to stay on board, you can't criticize the Mayor.' I was upset. They all applauded, and after that the complaining stopped."
The result, of course, has been a lot of complaining from other people. Journalists say they've never seen such a secretive administration -- commissioners have become leery of releasing routine information or of even speaking to reporters (especially those deemed enemies) without clearance from the Mayor's office.
"It's an outrage to censor his commissioners that way," says the former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who likes to tell of his own introduction to Giuliani's autocracy. It was shortly after he criticized Giuliani for having police remove candidates' signs from public property during last year's gubernatorial campaign. "Rudy called me and told me I was wrong, that it's illegal to put signs on poles. I started to say, 'I know it's illegal,' and he said, 'Don't interrupt me!' So I took the phone, cradled it on my shoulder and read the newspaper while he talked. When he finished, I said, 'Mayor, I know it's illegal, because I passed that law.' I was trying to tell him that there's another way to enforce it, but he didn't want to listen. It was the first time I realized how thin-skinned Rudy is."
Even a few Giuliani insiders have complained, although almost never on the record, and even then generally not until they've gone elsewhere. "It's a cult of personality around the great leader," one former aide says. "They don't want anyone to question his decision making. All they understand is intimidation. Rudy loves to shut you down, cut you to the quick. If he wants your opinion, he'll beat it out of you."
Members of the inner circle seem genuinely puzzled at such criticism. Most of them will talk about Giuliani for hours, on or off the record, without uttering a discouraging word -- which, of course, helps explain why they're still in the inner circle. They insist he's reasonable and open to other opinions until he makes a decision. "Once a decision is made he won't change it," says Richard Schwartz, the senior adviser to the Mayor. "People call that stubbornness, but it's better than the alternative. You're willing to put in all the work that radical reform requires because you know he won't abandon you when it gets controversial. With a regular politician you wouldn't bother trying. We could never have done welfare reform if the Mayor had been intimidated by screaming advocates and editorial writers." Aides explain their loyalty as both a political necessity -- even a hint of disunity would doom their assault on the Democratic establishment -- and as a personal obligation to him. They like to tell of the small favors he did them and the hours he spent visiting them in the hospital. The word "family" is used a lot.
At this morning's meeting the paterfamilias has good tidings for everyone. Publicly, Giuliani remained neutral on a commission's report that week recommending pay raises for himself and senior officials, but here behind closed doors he announces that he'll come out shortly in favor of salary increases. "You deserve it," he tells his cabinet. This is not going to be easy to explain to the public -- officials with six-figure salaries and city cars getting pay raises while subway riders are getting a 25-cent fare increase. Golden, the veteran Brooklyn Democrat, leans over over to shake Giuliani's hand and announce, "This is a brave man." Everyone applauds again.
 10:40. A.M. After a brief press conference outside the cabinet meeting, Giuliani rides into Manhattan with his communications director, Cristyne Lategano. She feigns disappointment that the news conference didn't deal with a hot topic that week, Giuliani's decision to exclude Fidel Castro and Yasir Arafat from the upcoming dinner and concert for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. "I'm surprised you didn't talk about Castro," Lategano says jokingly. "Your position there -- you haven't enunciated it clearly enough." Giuliani, who has been happily excoriating the Cuban dictator at every public opportunity, laughs and marvels at New Yorkers who like Castro. "Maybe only in New York City can you actually find people who have a romantic fascination with people who hate their country," he reflects. "It's like having a romantic fascination with someone who hates your family."
 11:10 A.M. Reaching City Hall, he ducks into his office, then heads upstairs to give awards and praise to city employees packed into the public hearing chamber. "New York City," he reminds everyone, "is the best city in the world." Then back to the van for a ride to midtown. On the way he reminisces about his father: "He gave me the best definition of courage and bravery that I ever heard. I asked him right before he died if he was ever afraid. He said he was always afraid -- 'If you're not afraid, you're not courageous, you're just crazy.' He said the real test is to overcome it, to not let it stop you from doing the things that you think you should do."
Giuliani's father gave him an exceptional opportunity to learn this skill at an early age. The father, a Manhattanite exiled to his wife's Brooklyn neighborhood, was a Yankee fan. The son had no particular allegiance until the day his father dressed him in a Yankee uniform and sent him out to play in the heart of Dodger territory. "The first thing they did was throw me in the mud," Giuliani recounted during a campaign commercial in 1993 that briefly described his travails as the only Yankee fan in Brooklyn. But the full story is much better: "One day a group of four or five children put a noose around my neck and tried to hang me on a tree. My grandmother saw this and started yelling, and they stopped. But my proudest moment was I didn't renounce the Yankees. I kept telling them: 'I am a Yankee fan. I am a Yankee fan. I'm gonna stay a Yankee fan.' All of our family in that four-block area were Dodger fans, so this was a constant fight for me -- go out and acquire statistics to prove that the Yankees were better than the Dodgers. The most wonderful thing was that the last time they played in the World Series, in 1956, the Yankees won -- which I used for 10 years to totally destroy all my Dodger relatives. To my father, it was a joke. Put a Yankee uniform on the kid and it'll irritate all my friends and relatives and it'll be fun. But to me it was like being a martyr: I'm not gonna give up my religion. You're not gonna change me."
 12:30 P.M. After a speech to maritime union leaders, Giuliani heads downtown to his inevitable lunch on the road -- pizza, today at John's on Bleecker Street. On the way, in between his phone calls to aides, Lategano tells him of a letter in The Times that morning from a restaurant owner supporting the new anti-smoking law. "That's going to pass away within six months," Giuliani says, referring to the controversy about the law. "If you regulate people's behavior somewhat differently, they'll respond to it."
 1:45 P.M. Back in his office, Giuliani poses for photos with six visiting teen-agers from Israel and makes small talk. ("Tel Aviv, that's a teeming city.") Joseph Verner Reed, an under secretary general at the United Nations, comes into lobby him to attend the world leaders' speeches at the United Nations on Sunday.
"I have the two best seats in the house for you," Reed says. "You can listen to President Clinton, and when Castro gets up to speak you can walk out."
"I can bang my shoe," Giuliani says. "I'll bring my spikes."
 2 P.M. Time for the daily ritual in the Blue Room, which is crammed with reporters and 17 television cameras. "It's like going into the arena," Giuliani says. "I look forward to it." Today the reporters want to know once again why he is excluding Castro and Arafat.
"Some people," a reporter says, "think that if the party is financed by public money, then you have no right to exclude people, including Castro."
"Well," Giuliani replies, "some people think that, because you say that, but you're wrong."
"Why?"
"Why? Because you don't bother to check your facts, which is a very irresponsible thing to do."
"I'm asking you the --."
"Get your facts right in the premise of your question."
"I'm asking you to get the facts."
"No, you're not," Giuliani says, glaring at the reporter. "You asked the question, 'Some people think that' -- the fact is, it is not funded by public dollars. The fact is that party is funded by private dollars."
Some of the foreign correspondents here for the celebrations appear startled to see the Mayor lashing out at a mild-mannered reporter, but the regular press corps is nonchalant. It's used to much worse. Giuliani came into office suspicious of the media (particularly stalwarts of the liberal establishment, like The Times and The New Yorker, that had supported Dinkins), and the relationship quickly deteriorated to what reporters call a historic low at City Hall. Many reporters blame the bad relations on his communications director, whom they consider needlessly hostile; others say the real problem is that Lategano is doing exactly what Giuliani wants. There are members of Giuliani's inner circle who complain privately that the 30-year-old Lategano is too inexperienced. One of them says: "Rudy needs someone who can get along with reporters and protect him from his own instinct to retaliate when he's angry. He needs someone to say, 'Don't worry, I'll handle this' -- and then let things blow over. Instead she just agrees with him and even eggs him on."
John Miller, the former spokesman for the Police Department who quit in a huff after the Mayor's office ordered him to reduce the size of his staff, says the Mayor is obsessed with controlling press coverage. "I couldn't figure out where he and Cristyne found the time to get mad about every little detail of the way he was covered," Miller says. "All it did was make the press more hostile and produce worse coverage. Substantively, this Mayor has had one triumph after another, but his public image is suffering because he keeps stabbing himself in the eye with an ice pick."
 5:10 P.M. After two hours of telephone calls and meetings in his office, Giuliani rides to the headquarters of the United Jewish Appeal. He gets a standing ovation and is introduced as the man with courage who "has changed the face of the city in two years." He outlines the three goals he has never stopped talking about since the start of the 1993 campaign: safer streets, more jobs, better schools. He reminds everyone of the disaster he inherited, a city that had lost 400,000 jobs the previous four years.
"Jobs were increasing in the rest of America, and jobs were fleeing New York in numbers that approached the Great Depression," he says. He blames the city's bloated government and its many enterprises: vast real-estate holdings, 500 gas stations, 17 hospitals, even radio and television stations. "The other governments that owned radio and television stations were on the other side of the Iron Curtain. The anomaly of this never occurred to anyone." He tells how the welfare rolls had grown from 850,000 to 1.2 million.
"A city of 7.5 million cannot sustain a million people on welfare," he says. "You can't do it from the point of view of the amount of misery and hopelessness that it creates among a million people, and you can't sustain it because the number of people supporting the people on welfare keeps diminishing."
The numbers have been declining since his administration began verifying applicants' addresses, fingerprinting them and requiring able-bodied single adults to work for the city. Giuliani gets his biggest round of applause when he moralizes about the workfare program. "In exchange for this benefit you have an obligation to give something back," he says. "That should be true for poor people, middle-class people, rich people. That's part of the social contract that we were losing in this city."
 6:20 P.M. Shaking hands as he walks along, Giuliani leads his entourage down Park Avenue, pausing to look at a tie in a store window. "It's ridiculous to pay $80 for a tie. I could find the same thing for $20." At the Waldorf-Astoria he changes into white tie and tails for the Alfred E. Smith political dinner. At the reception Gov. George Pataki greets him with what looks like sincere pleasure. Giuliani sees Koch and asks him how he's doing.
"I'm doing terrific, and so you are you!" Koch replies, eyeing Giuliani playfully. "And you do have courage!"
 11 P.M. After dashing from the dinner to a live interview on the
10 o'clock news at WPIX-TV, Giuliani heads home, sounding unaccountably energetic for a 51-year-old man who has just worked 15 straight hours. He explains that he often likes to write at this time of night. "Today has been a fairly easy day," he says when he gets out at Gracie Mansion. "I'm not tired. I'll be up for another two hours."
 
THE SQUEEGEE WATERSHED
 Midway through La Guardia's first term, a columnist for The New York Sun summed up the Mayor's achievements: "New York has just passed through some 29 months of disorder, violence and chaos." The same might be said of Giuliani's tenure, particularly by the many politicians he has insulted. Giuliani will be remembered as the Mayor most prone to describe a public official as "silly" or "idiotic." But he will also be remembered for leading the city through a historic transition, the Squeegee Watershed.
Just two years ago it was considered routine for a visiting motorist to be greeted by a drug addict wielding a blunt instrument and demanding money. It may have been the world's most intimidating welcome ceremony. (Some travelers argued that New York wasn't as bad Kinshasa, Zaire, where soldiers routinely pulled over tourists' cars and extracted money at rifle point. But at least the soldiers weren't smoking crack.) The squeegee men became a national symbol of New York's mean streets. They starred in a commercial for a car-security system. They even became a metaphor for the problems of New York-style municipal government. Indianapolis's Republican Mayor, Stephen Goldsmith, likes to cite them in his speeches on reinventing government. During the 1993 New York campaign, on his way into Manhattan to meet with Giuliani, he watched a squeegee man smear dirty water on his cab's windshield.
"It occurred to me that traditional city government is a lot like a squeegee guy," Goldsmith says. "It's doing a job you don't want it to do. It's doing it badly. And then it's charging you."
To Giuliani, squeegees epitomized New York's moral decay -- its propensity for "defining deviancy down," as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan put it during a luncheon speech in April of 1993. One of Moynihan's listeners at the luncheon was Mayor Dinkins, who became visibly enraged. Giuliani wasn't there, but he got the speech that night from Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader. "We figured," Giuliani recalls, "that if Dinkins is so insulted by it, we ought to take a look at this speech." Giuliani made "squeegee" a buzz word in his campaign speeches about quality of life. Activists howled -- William Kunstler came forth to represent the squeegee men's rights -- and newspapers published paeans to these hard-working entrepreneurs. Giuliani was called a bully for picking on them and ignoring the city's real problems.
"It was amazing to me that people thought the squeegee problem wasn't important or couldn't be solved," Giuliani says. "A civilized society can't let people go around the streets intimidating other people. But a weird philosophical thinking had emerged about these quality-of-life issues. If somebody was urinating in the street, the reaction would be, oh, we can't do anything about that. And then the idea would start to develop that there must be some inherent human right to urinate on the street. So the police started ignoring all kinds of offenses. They'd even stand by when drug deals were going on. The police became highly skilled observers of crime."
The police stopped observing under Giuliani's Commissioner, William Bratton, and the impact has extended far beyond the squeegee men. In the past two years overall crime has dropped nearly 30 percent, and the rates of robbery and murder have fallen even more sharply, to the lowest level in 25 years. Some of the credit belongs to the Dinkins administration, which hired extra police officers, and some of the decline might be due to social trends linked to falling crime in other cities, too. But New York's decline has been much more dramatic than other cities'--so sudden and so pronounced that it defies traditional thinking about crime.
"Since the 1960's social scientists have been telling police that they can't really prevent crime, because its root causes are beyond their grasp," says Lawrence W. Sherman, a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland. "Giuliani and Bratton have led a revolution against that dogma and proved just the opposite. The result is that a lot of police departments are scrambling to copy New York's tactics." Crime rates started plummeting as soon as the department adopted its new tactics: tracking crime statistics daily with computerized maps, sending extra officers immediately into trouble spots, giving local commanders autonomy and having officers crack down on offenses that used to be ignored, like painting graffiti or drinking in public. One consequence of the aggressive police presence seems to be fewer guns on the street and therefore fewer shootings. Another consequence is that neighborhoods feel safer, less out of control. Banishing squeegees sends a message.
Giuliani's critics argue that the quality of life has declined in other ways, particularly for the poor. Giuliani didn't seriously try to prevent the subway fare from rising. (And the cutback in state aid to the subways was due partly to his disastrous decision last year to endorse Mario Cuomo for Governor.) Because of budget cuts, there are fewer new books in libraries, less new equipment on playgrounds, longer waits at city hospitals, delays in obtaining some social services. But considering the magnitude of the current fiscal problems -- comparable with the 1975 crisis that devastated the city -- it's remarkable that so many services and public spaces have been maintained and sometimes even improved. Thanks to a reorganization of the city's engineering and contracting practices, for the first time in memory the reconstruction of a major street -- Columbus Avenue -- is being finished ahead of schedule. Surveys show that streets and parks are cleaner as well as safer, a fulfillment of Giuliani's first campaign promise to reduce crime and improve the quality of life.
 HE HAS MADE some progress on his second promise, shrinking the government and expanding the private economy. The municipal work force has fallen 8 percent since he took office and is still declining. The radio and television stations are being sold. Three city hospitals are on the market. The city has stopped being the landlord of last resort -- it is letting private owners take over tax-delinquent buildings instead, and it is unloading the 5,000 residential buildings it already owns. Private companies have replaced some city workers who pave roads, maintain parks, clean buildings and run homeless shelters. Now that they're competing against private companies, municipal unions that used to protect their turf at all costs are rewriting work rules and welcoming extra manpower from participants in the city's workfare program, which now has 23,000 welfare recipients employed in 25 agencies. These new workers have doubled the size of the labor force in the Parks Department. While they're getting experience, the city is getting labor that would otherwise cost about $500 million a year.
It's hard to compare New York's reforms with those in other cities, because no city has anything remotely like Fiorello Hall. "Giuliani deserves special credit for overcoming huge political obstacles," says William D. Eggers, an author of "Revolution at the Roots," a new book surveying municipal reform around America. "But he also has huge opportunities because the government is so bloated. After two years he's in the middle of the pack of the reform-minded Mayors -- way ahead of Los Angeles, approaching Philadelphia and Chicago, behind Indianapolis."
Giuliani forced the school custodians and the sanitation workers to rewrite their notoriously lax contracts, and he bullied the transit and housing police into merging with the regular police force -- a goal that had eluded previous Mayors because of union opposition. But he settled for peace during the crucial negotiations this fall with the teachers' and municipal workers' unions. The new contracts are an improvement over the past, but they're not the great leap forward that reformers hoped for. The teachers' union still has mandarin rules that stifle innovation. You could call it a disappointing lapse in Giuliani's moral zeal -- while he may be willing to take on welfare recipients, he'll compromise with middle-class teachers whose support could determine the next election.
You could also call it a bit of political realism. Giuliani could be doing more to reinvent government, but he can't afford to be as visionary as other cities' Mayors. A true conservative revolutionary would be advocating school vouchers, sweeping privatization and tax cuts, an end to rent regulation -- but a true revolutionary wouldn't get far in New York. Giuliani has at least begun to change the city's philosophy. No one anymore dares to suggest raising taxes or expanding government social programs. To preserve existing social programs, liberals are proposing the kind of austerity measures that used to be called union bashing.
New York's economy seems to be recovering under Giuliani, but slowly -- a gain so far of 50,000 private-sector jobs. The tourist, media and computer industries are doing better; tax revenues and retail sales are up. The city is wooing megastores instead of keeping them out, and it's starting to rezone thousands of acres of industrial sites -- vacant for decades as previous administrations dithered -- so that New Yorkers can live and shop there. But the city's taxes, reduced only slightly by Giuliani, continue to drive away businesses, and the budget problems continue. The projected budget deficit for next year is nearly $1 billion, which is encouraging only by comparison with the nearly $5 billion in deficits over the Giuliani administration's first two years.
Giuliani's third promise, better schools, remains unfulfilled. His battles with the Board of Education have only confirmed people's fears about his personality: the Holy Terror unleashed on schoolchildren and their kindly protector, Chancellor Ramon Cortines. Disregarding the school board's autonomy, Giuliani forced Cortines to cut the staff at headquarters and tried ordering him to fire his budget director. When that didn't work, Giuliani hounded Cortines out of office and tried to install a successor whose main qualification was loyalty to the Mayor, all the while denouncing everyone who dared to object as "brain dead." Two-thirds of New Yorkers disapprove of his handling the schools, and the latest showdown with the Board of Education has sent his overall approval ratings to 42 percent, his lowest yet.
The school battles have been Giuliani's greatest public failure, although not for the commonly supposed reasons. The public and the press have blamed him for rudely refusing to cooperate with the school board the way his predecessors did; but what did New York gain by their good manners? The board's enormous bureaucracy absorbed most of the extra funds that were supposed to improve New York's schools during the past decade. Its budget was so opaque that no one even knew how many bureaucrats there were. Its independence had made it irresponsible. Giuliani came to office with sensible proposals endorsed by a wide range of reformers: make the board politically accountable, cut the bureaucracy, draw up a comprehensible budget, send the money directly to each school instead of through headquarters.
Two years later, against all odds, some of these reforms might actually be implemented. It remains to be seen whether the new chancellor, Rudy Crew, will be a more zealous reformer than Cortines, but he seems more aggressive and has already brought in outside executives, rather than making do, as Cortines had, with the existing hierarchy. Meanwhile, leaders of both parties in the state legislature are vowing finally to restructure the board so that it's more politically accountable. By ignoring everyone's advice against throwing public tantrums, Giuliani may end up getting his way.
"The schools could turn out to be big victory for him," says Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "Once again Giuliani has been able to control the agenda, not only among New York's good government types, but among politicians. They're afraid to confront him. He has proven over and over that if you want to make reforms, fear is a great source of power."
It is not, however, a great source of affection, which is important if you want to be re-elected. Giuliani may be right about restructuring the school board, but voters are not yet convinced that he really cares about their children. He has mastered La Guardia's techniques at bullying people, but he still hasn't figured out how La Guardia also managed to get them to like him.
 
AN EVENING IN BED-STUY
 As Giuliani entered the auditorium in Bedford Stuyvesant, the city officials in the first four rows leaped to their feet applauding, but they were no match for the boos. "He's not our Mayor!" someone screamed. A woman waved a sign, "Ghouliani Is a Mark Fuhrman in Mayor's Clothing." This was hardly a random sample of the African-American population in the neighborhood -- the Mayor's monthly town hall meetings attract activists primed for political theater -- but the deafening roar was not wildly unrepresentative of the Mayor's local popularity.
Giuliani persevered. When his lecture attacking the Board of Education's bureaucracy was interrupted by shouts that he was ruining the schools, he snapped, "If you're happy with them, then go ahead and leave them the way they are." When the shouting got worse, he gave a finger-pointing lecture about respect and ignored the person who shouted back: "You have no respect for us! You have no respect for our color of people!" He managed to hold his own except for one moment, just after a woman gave an emotional speech -- which sounded suspiciously prearranged -- thanking him for his personal attention to her son's problems. Giuliani started walking up the aisle toward her. Another female voice rang out, "Don't you go hugging that black woman!"
The crowd loved it. Giuliani ignored the laughter and gave the woman a hug, but it was an awkward sight: the grim-faced white Mayor stiffly embracing a black woman while the crowd jeered. Maybe no one could have pulled it off gracefully. Maybe not even La Guardia could have won over the crowd on this night. But he might have enjoyed the moment more. La Guardia had a flair for the grand gesture, a personal warmth. He happily played to audiences and the camera. Giuliani still flinches when the shutter clicks. He is not television-friendly.
"I've gone through two campaigns trying to make him come across less harsh on TV, but it's not going to change," Peter Powers says. "A lot of politicians can project an image, but not Rudy. You can say to him, 'Let's do it this way because it will show you softer,' and he'll say, 'Let's just do it and not try to stage it.' He's not comfortable with it."
Giuliani's toughness plays well with some New Yorkers, notably the middle-class whites who chant ROO-DEE at the town hall meetings in Queens and Staten Island, but he's had less luck with Hispanic voters and little at all with blacks. "He hasn't picked up on the nuances in the world outside where he's lived," says Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner and one of Giuliani's few prominent black supporters. "Any black leader can point to any white leader and say he's against us, and you have to mount your case in defense. Rudy hasn't done that. In 20 years I've never seen any evidence of bias in him, but he can be accused of insensitivity. A good politician has to have the ability to empathize. People don't want to be told that they're wrong -- they might know they're wrong, but they want a leader to feel their pain."
Even if he had La Guardia's empathy, Giuliani would have a harder time reaching poor voters. Starting social programs is more popular than cutting them back. Giuliani's initiatives, like loans for low-income people to buy homes, don't have the emotional appeal of a new housing project. "I think I have a caring message, but it's very, very hard to convey that," Giuliani says. "I'm trying to get people away from this sort of subsistence politics. Let's try property ownership. Let's try involvement in business. Let's try more personal responsibility. Let's try workfare. These are premised on a lot more history in the development of human beings than the things we have been doing.
"This sounds really strange," he continued, "but I've thought through this a lot, and I think things are going to change very quickly, the way the destruction of Communism occurred in Eastern Europe. It came as a tremendous surprise to many people, particularly to Western intellectuals. Just as in Eastern Europe, there's a building sense in the minority community that the principles enforced by the so-called leadership aren't going anywhere -- the battle over more entitlements and more welfare and more government solutions. When you find the right person who can connect to those feelings, you're going to see a major sea change."
He does not expect to be that person. "I don't think the connection is there. The leaders that presently exist won't allow that to happen. They will try to demonize me. I can make marginal changes in people's thinking, but the major shift has to be done by someone they can identify with on a kind of intuitive level."
Contrary to predictions made during the campaign, Giuliani has presided over two years of uncharacteristically peaceful racial relations in New York. The search for the new schools chancellor proceeded without the traditional ethnic wars. Some community leaders complain that the newly aggressive police are harassing blacks, but there have been no full-blown racial crises memorable enough to merit a name like Crown Heights or Bensonhurst. It may just be Giuliani's luck so far. It may also be because of his tough policing and his refusal to be intimidated by leaders like Al Sharpton. Last year Giuliani resolved a bitter controversy in Harlem (one that David Dinkins had ducked) by evicting a mass of illegal vendors from 125th Street and simply disregarding Sharpton's protests. Giuliani interprets the relative calm as a vindication of his refusal to bend the law or negotiate racial spoils. His critics say that it's a sign that blacks have abandoned hope of any help from City Hall, and that Giuliani will eventually pay for it. As the two last Mayors discovered, one racial crisis in an election year can be fatal.
Giuliani won the last election by barely 50,000 votes, and that was with crucial support from Koch, who is threatening to abandon him if he keeps insulting people. Koch insists he's not running himself, which leaves three likely Democratic challengers: Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President; Mark Green, the Public Advocate, and Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. For now, the conventional wisdom is that Giuliani's record on crime alone will make him hard to beat, especially if his challenger is perceived as a traditional liberal. But it's also conventional wisdom that a Republican can't make any mistake -- Democrats have a 5-to-1 advantage in registered voters -- and that Giuliani is particularly vulnerable because he has no reservoir of good will.
 
A NIGHT AT THE OPERA
 When "Tosca" opened this fall at the Amato Opera Theater, New York City's First Opera Buff was in an aisle seat looking much happier than he ever does on television. It was his first look at this amateur troupe in the basement of a small town house on the Bowery. The lights dimmed and a couple of rickety light fixtures hanging from the ceiling began moving upward, parodying that signature moment at the Metropolitan Opera when its great crystal chandeliers ascend to the gilded ceiling. Guiliani watched the old brass fixtures with the wide-eyed joy of a 6-year-old following his first kite.
"That's adorable!" he said. "I love it! "That's great!"
Adorable is not necessarily a word you expect to hear from the Holy Terror. His family and friends insist that this is the real Rudy Giuliani, a genial sentimentalist, and it was easy to believe them on this night. He told how his love for opera had blossomed at age 14, when he had started going alone to standing room at the Met on Friday nights. He had been ashamed to tell his friends about this passion until his senior year -- and then, already the proselytizer, he started an opera club and somehow persuaded several dozen Brooklyn teen-age boys to join it.
This evening he was unfailingly charming with the other operagoers, even those who disputed his taste in sopranos. After watching Tosca stab Baron Scarpia, he did a good impression of a prim lady at the Metropolitan Club who had once asked if he would prosecute Tosca for murder. ("I replied that it would be quite impossible even for me, because she's dead at the end of the opera. However, I believe she would have had a very good argument for self-defense.") During intermission, standing outside on the sidewalk, he chatted with some grunge rockers from the club next door, CBGB. He promised to listen to one's tape, and he nodded amiably when one dazed teen-ager asked, "Are you the guy who was on Letterman?"
There was just one bit of unpleasant business, before the third act, when he phoned an aide negotiating this evening with organizers of the San Gennaro festival. Giuliani, believing the Mafia was profiting from the street fair, had vowed to cancel it unless he could appoint an outside monitor of its finances. Threatening the city's most famous street festival was a controversial move -- his vocal critics ranged from the fair's vendors to Ed Koch -- but Giuliani shrugged nonchalantly when asked if his threat had been a difficult decision.
"It was a calculated decision," he said cheerily. "I can't believe they won't go along, because they can't live for the next year if they don't do the feast. I think they'll have to do it under our conditions."
It brought to mind the aria that had just been sung by Scarpia, the chief of Rome's secret police, in anticipation of his late-night negotiations to extort sex from Tosca: "She'll give in to my desires if only to save her Mario's life. . . . For me, my violent conquests are far more exciting and intriguing than sweet surrender could ever be." Giuliani was justified in challenging the festival, but was he enjoying the fight a little too much?
Later that evening, over a bottle of wine at his favorite restaurant, Jim McMullen's, on the Upper East Side, Giuliani was asked why he was so relentlessly combative. Why not show people his kinder, gentler side?
"I don't know that I have a choice," he said. "The only way I could be less combative would be if I would compromise more. If I compromised more I would achieve less."
But why the prosecutorial style? Why the hostile language? Wouldn't a simple "I disagree" work as well as "You're wrong"?
"Well, maybe sometimes I do it wrong. Sometimes you don't intuitively or rationally figure out exactly the right way to approach it." He did not want to dwell on that possibility for long.
"I'm not a politician by profession, which has its pluses and its minuses. I think the pluses outweigh the minuses for New York City right now. I have a theory that you should not get involved in politics until after you've done something else with your life. If you get involved in politics at a young age, you lose any sense of substance and can't accomplish anything except public relations. The city is used to politicians who submit to whatever is the safest thing to do or the safest way to say it. I think the city needs to be broken of that."
The city must be broken -- there he went again, sounding like Scarpia dealing with Rome's heretics. It's always frightening to see someone who thinks himself above politics. La Guardia's moral passion eventually prevented him from seeing his errors -- the well-intentioned public hospitals that provided terrible care, the projects the city couldn't afford. He ended up resorting to budgetary scams much like Tammany Hall's, convinced that it was for the city's good because his intentions were pure. Giuliani is prone to the same self-delusion, and he seems to be even more rigid -- La Guardia could occasionally admit good-naturedly that he'd made a mistake.
But Giuliani is an improvement over La Guardia in one crucial respect. He's not trying to rebuild the city himself. When La Guardia was riding around with a writer for this Magazine in 1934, he marveled at the discovery that a well-managed open-air market was privately owned -- and then suggested that government could run it even better. When Giuliani rides through neighborhoods, he talks about encouraging more small businesses, about getting poor people out of housing projects and into their own homes. "The ownership of property," he preaches, "is what motivates people to think greater and do greater things." La Guardia envisioned the government building the City of Tomorrow; Giuliani envisions the classic New York of entrepreneurs building it themselves.
"This city was failing because it was governed by the wrong ideas," he said as midnight approached at McMullen's. The amazing thing is, the minute you open it up, the city has an enormous capacity to do everything better than any place else. It's got more talent than any other place in the country. It just needs the freedom to think new ways to do things."
It would be refreshing if Giuliani himself were more receptive to new thoughts, even all those "idiotic" ones of his enemies. It would be comforting to have a leader with more self-doubt and less moral passion. But until now no such leader has been willing to stand up to Fiorello Hall, and maybe no such leader could do what Giuliani has done. Moral passion is useful in certain situations. Giuliani may have Scarpia's prosecutorial style, but when you consider the establishment he has taken on, he has a lot more in common with Tosca.
"The most moving moment for me," he said, when asked about the evening's performance, "was the duet at the end." He sang its key word, "trionfal" -- triumphant, the feeling of Tosca and her lover in their "ecstasy of passionate love" as they stand on the castle platform preparing to flee. "What moves me about opera is that you can express emotions in a way that you can't when you just speak. When the orchestral accompaniment stopped and they stood there singing, it connected you to the feelings of these two who have gone through torture, political oppression, contemplating death -- and now they're going to triumph. He is so in awe of her, because she did the unthinkable. She killed Scarpia, who controlled Rome."
A moment later Tosca would be leaping to her death, the victim of an unforeseen political backlash -- an inconvenience, of course, but beside the point. She had done the right thing. The city was a better place, and she had the conviction not to bother negotiating with the silly soldiers who arrived for revenge. "It was an excellent jump tonight," Giuliani said. "Firm, strong, befitting the character of Floria Tosca. No indecision at all."

Dysfunction Wears Out Its Welcome

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
JUST LIKE JUNE CLEAVER OR Jim Anderson, today's sitcom moms and dads know what's best for their families. Of course, they may not know where their families came from. John Hemingway, the hero of "The John Larroquette Show," is a recovering alcoholic who has a teen-age son he abandoned as a baby and a grown daughter (by a different mother) who he didn't know existed until last year. The children know nothing about each other, so one day Tony asks Rachel out for coffee and Dad exclaims in sitcom horror, "Oh, my God, my son has a date -- with my daughter!" Sure, the old son-dating-daughter gag; that was always the part where Danny Thomas would spit out his coffee, right?
Meanwhile, behind the white picket fences of "Roseanne" and "Grace Under Fire" live two of the most popular families on television, reflecting what the typical American household is all about: alcoholism, spousal abuse, unemployment, abortion, abandoned children, children put up for adoption, drug abuse, impotence, clinical depression, infidelity, divorce and single parenthood. And that's just in the family, never mind the neighbors. There is something strange going on when the Simpsons are the best-adjusted family around. 
 In their quest to be realistic and relevant, family sitcoms have piled on the social issues, from everyday problems like day care to serious disorders like physical violence. Any one or two or even three of these issues might concern an average family; all of them at once might strike Job.
Lisa Simpson, the smart middle child of the cartoon family, defined the situation best when her long-lost grandmother reappeared two weeks ago. As a boy, Homer Simpson had been told his mother was dead; it turned out she was merely on the run from the F.B.I. "This is so weird," Lisa said. "It's like something out of Dickens. Or 'Melrose Place.' " As sitcoms approach dysfunction overload, they have come to resemble melodrama and soap opera more than they reflect comic versions of real life.
These warped-family sitcoms have created a dark mirror of the classic good-family series of 30 years ago, and they may be nearing the end of a cycle. Both trends began with a genuine connection to reality, then wildly exaggerated it. It was true that in the 50's and early 60's, the norm was a two-parent household like the Cleavers', in which the father went to the office and the mother stayed home. Television took those facts and went crazy, to the point where Beaver's mom is now famous for dusting while wearing high heels, a full skirt and pearls.
The Cleavers of "Leave It to Beaver" and the Nelsons of "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" (Was there ever a less adventurous household? The boys didn't leave home till they were 30) eventually overdosed on sweetness and clean living. They were swept away partly by old age and partly by the social changes of the mid-60's, but they also imploded on the strength of their own unbelievable goodness.
Similarly, sitcoms from the late 80's and early 90's began with the fact that there were many single-parent households (a third of all families with children, by a recent census count) and a greater, healthier awareness of social and psychological disorders. As they have developed, though, shows like "Roseanne" and "Grace Under Fire" can hardly bear the weight of their characters' troubles. The series present these families as typical, and the shows win praise for their supposed realism. But as their problems pile up, these proud-to-be dysfunctional families seem ever less attached to reality.
When "Roseanne" first appeared in 1988, the Conners were refreshingly realistic; the two working parents worried about money, and everyone yelled all the time. With its loud, crass, blue-collar chic, the show was the television daughter of "All in the Family." More important, Roseanne rode into town as the anti-Cosby. The Conners were the rejoinder to the well-bred, well-educated, upwardly mobile Huxtables of "The Cosby Show," which then ruled sitcom land.
"Roseanne" deserved praise for tackling touchy issues like abortion and for avoiding the moralistic posture that presents sitcom families as flawless role models. But seven years involves a lot of plots, and the once-ordinary Conner family has become more socially troubled than all the characters on "E.R" and "N.Y.P.D. Blue" put together.
IN THE LAST FEW SEASONS ALONE, Roseanne's mother was arrested for driving while drunk and sent to Alcoholics Anonymous, and Roseanne's sister, Jackie, lived with a man who beat her, then left him, quickly got pregnant by a man she hardly knew, had the baby and married the child's father. And last year, Roseanne's grandmother turned up at Thanksgiving dinner with a new husband and revealed that she had had two illegal abortions when she was young. "Gee, I wonder who told the abortion stories at the very first Thanksgiving," Roseanne said with a redeeming, acerbic twist increasingly rare for her. (Roseanne has said this season will be the show's last, probably a good move.)
"Grace Under Fire," with Brett Butler as a working-class mother, began two years ago with Grace, a recovering alcoholic, just divorced from an alcoholic who beat her. Last season, a son she had given up for adoption 19 years before re-entered her life. This season she has been dating her boss, and recently she was taken hostage at gunpoint by a former co-worker laid off from the oil refinery where she works. Where can she go from here?
Not every popular show relies on social tragedy. "Home Improvement," one of the top sitcoms, is in the "Cosby" mold. When one adolescent son steals a tool from a hardware store (that's as hairy as the show usually gets), he learns his lesson by the end of the half-hour.
And there is no correlation between the level of dysfunction and the comic strengths of a series. "Larroquette" has weaker writing than "Grace" and "Roseanne," and lower ratings to match. In general, the shows work best when they assume a leavening attitude toward weighty problems. When Grace is annoyed at her newly found son, Matthew, she tells him, "If I wanted you to grow up to be an idiot, I would have raised you myself."
But there is a definite connection between dysfunction overload and the characters' social class. The working class is the setting for most of the serious social problems in comedies. John Hemingway manages a bus station; Roseanne, having worked in a factory and then at a restaurant, now owns part of a diner; Grace Kelly (her name is one of the show's first jokes) was recently demoted because of cutbacks at the oil refinery.
There is an upper-middle-class version of sitcom dysfunction, too. It probably started with "Murphy Brown." At the start of the series seven years ago, Candice Bergen's wealthy journalist character was just out of the Betty Ford clinic. The show's most famous and best plot, of course, was a perfect example of a sitcom reflecting not dysfunction but a new social reality. Murphy accidentally got pregnant, decided to have the child on her own and, in a happy ending, told Dan Quayle where to get off.
Life is more dysfunctional on "Cybill," in which Cybill Shepherd plays an actress with two ex-husbands. This season, her first husband's second ex-wife was impregnated with his frozen sperm, without his knowledge (the setup for a maladjusted spinoff?). Cybill's best friend, Maryann, is perpetually and agreeably drunk, and eagerly planning revenge on her cheating former husband.
All these people can afford therapy. The hero of "Frasier," of course, has a broken marriage, a snappish but improving relationship with his father, and an about-to-be-divorced brother, Niles, who lusts after the housekeeper. In fact, both Frasier and his brother are psychiatrists. Therapy doesn't do them much good, but then it's not really meant to. Dysfunction seems more innocuous in this comfortable economic sphere, where the characters and the writing are far more sophisticated than in the blue-collar-chic series.
The working class heroes face their problems with Oprah-like intensity; the world-weary characters of "Cybill" and "Frasier" tacitly assume that dysfunction is here to stay, providing fodder for pithy one-liners. When Niles substitutes on Frasier's radio call-in show, he announces that he is a Jungian, Frasier a Freudian and "there will be no blaming Mother today."
It is fair, though, to attribute much of television's dysfunction overload to the genre's founder and matriarch, Roseanne herself, whose off-screen behavior makes the Conners' problems seem petty. Behind the scenes, "Roseanne" has been known from the start for its periodic turbulence, with firings, star behavior and family feuds a way of life. As recently as a month ago, both Roseanne and her co-star, John Goodman, threatened to walk off the show.
And when Roseanne discusses her real life, it sounds like a catalogue of social problems. She has said that she was abused by her parents and has multiple personalities. She had a child she gave up for adoption and is on her third marriage.
Roseanne's success has been extraordinary, and so have her personal misfortunes. One thing she has never been is average. Yet she still holds herself up as the most ordinary of role models. Take a look at this season's opening credits for "Roseanne," which morph all the characters to show how they've changed from the show's first years to the present. Roseanne's transformation is the most chilling case of excessive plastic surgery since Michael Jackson. This is the typical mom, working-class and addicted to expensive cosmetic surgery?
The fact that sitcoms these days sometimes mirror the stars' real lives doesn't necessarily make the fiction more believable. Brett Butler has talked about her own abusive situation, but that doesn't make Grace seem typical. When she tells Matthew, now a college student, about her hard-luck past, he says, "You've gone through what people I know only read about." That is meant to be a comment about class; it accidentally calls attention to the melodramatic aspect of one person having such a load of problems.
WHAT'S ESPECIALLY Eerie about such major family maladjustment is the way television helps shape reality. In the vicious circle that flows between television and society, a show takes that kernel of real life, exaggerates it, then beams it back in its most outrageous form, still posing as ordinary. Experience to the contrary, viewers may begin to wonder if what they are watching is normal everywhere else in the country. The most powerful subterranean message sent by television, after all, is: if it's on TV, it must be true.
There may be a hint that this dysfunctional cycle is ending with shows like "Cybill." Beyond the class difference, that series is so jokingly aware of its characters' maladjustments that it gives a new twist to the genre -- just the way that "The Brady Bunch," when it came along in 1969, was a semi-parody of the Cleavers and of the Andersons on "Father Knows Best."
Oddly, the shows that seem to have the most outrageous families, "Married . . . With Children" and "The Simpsons," are the least involved in dysfunction overload because they were designed as caricatures to begin with. When Al Bundy on "Married . . . With Children" walks into his living room singing a theme from his favorite television show, "Psychodad," he's already far from reality.
And "The Simpsons" has managed to maintain its status as one of the funniest shows on the air, offering a satiric version of the typically dysfunctional sitcom family. Recently, child-welfare authorities temporarily took the children away from Marge and Homer. (It was all a misunderstanding: Bart got lice when a monkey sat on his head.) The kids were sent to stay with their holier-than-thou neighbors, the Flanderses, a fate worse than anything in Dickens. "It seems like our house, but everything has this creepy, Pat Boone-ish quality about it," says Lisa, suspiciously looking around a household where, Ned Flanders admits, "My Three Sons" is too strong for his children to watch before bedtime.
Compare this clever "Simpsons" episode with "That's Our Rosey!," the recent "Roseanne" parody of 50's sitcoms, and the difference between a knowing satire and a self-congratulatory message becomes obvious. "Roseanne" turned its parody into a heavy-handed statement about women, with Rosey, in pearls and a lacy apron, remarking that it would be so silly to try to have a job and a family at the same time.
The Simpsons were once actually tossed out of family therapy, with double their money back. "The sad truth is," said that model of satiric wit Lisa Simpson, "all families are like us." The earnest, dysfunctional sitcoms would have us believe this is true.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY VIEW;
All-Conquering Hungarians, Empire or No

BYLINE: By Vicki Goldberg 

 BODY:
Hungarian culture is best known for music -- Franz Liszt, of course, and Bela Bartok and Zoltan Kodaly -- but it spawned an even greater number of important and influential photographers. Photography between the two world wars would be sorely diminished without the Hungarians. Significantly, those who became best known emigrated, and then they conquered the world.
Brassai went to Paris and pictured its demimonde as more vivid, more complex, more quintessentially French than anyone had since Toulouse-Lautrec. Martin Munkasci, a sports photographer and photojournalist, came to America in the early 1930's and transformed fashion photography with an injection of natural movement. Andre Kertesz moved to Paris and then New York, transplanting to America a European appreciation of split seconds, incongruities and spatial surprises. 
 In Berlin in the 20's, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy helped fashion the Bauhaus curriculum; then, when the Nazis closed the Bauhaus, he transported its credo to Chicago. Robert Capa's pictures of war in Spain and China earned him the accolade "greatest war photographer in the world." His younger brother, Cornell, founded the International Center of Photography in New York.
How could so much much talent emerge from so small a place? Why did they all leave, and what happened when they did? "The Hungarian Circle," an exhibition of 49 images taken between the wars, plus an anonymous album of collages, at the Howard Greenberg Gallery and Gallery 292 in SoHo through Dec. 30, offers a preliminary answer to the question of what happened back in Hungary. A catalogue essay by Michael Simon, a scholar of Hungarian photography, hints that there were national and economic reasons for the richness of that country's photography and the fact that its prodigal sons left home.
A few of the prints are by names like Kertesz and Moholy, but even scholars will not recognize most of these photographers, which says something about the study of Eastern Europe. Many members of "The Hungarian Circle" traveled and worked throughout Europe and were well known in their time. Though this show is not likely to change photographic history in any substantial way, it does suggest that rather than wasting away in the 20's and 30's when its great men left, photography in Hungary flourished on home soil.
Three styles, sometimes overlapping, mark the territory: a kind of picturesque-romantic look at native villages; an elegant late Pictorialism (the soft-focus style that originated around the turn of the century) and the international modernist style that is the period's signature. Many of the stay-at-homes were apparently committed to the first of these, a lovely but occasionally tedious and sentimental view of village and peasant life, pictures that ricochet between real charm and the Hallmark card variety.
Kertesz in his early years was indebted to this concentration on unspoiled villages, peasants (either quaint or dignified) and peaceful, rural landscapes. Karoly Escher and Kalman Boronkay both knew how to find quietly effective moments in this genre. It was, in fact, a style consciously adopted in the second decade of the century by a country bent on finding its true national character in the people and landscapes regarded as most purely Hungarian.
The defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I left Hungary shriveled, split up and decimated: its population had fallen from almost 21 million people to 7.5 million, and its territory had shrunk from 125,000 square miles to 36,000. The country was united, however, in its yearning to restore some pride in Hungarian identity and some part of its former glory. Thus the ethnographic romanticism in these photographs was not merely an esthetic choice but the expression of an idealized and wishful nationalism.
Severe political and economic tensions drove away those who became so famous elsewhere. A revolt shortly after the end of the war brought in a republic, which was soon displaced by a Communist dictatorship; that, too, was overthrown by a second revolution. The economy was a shambles and employment a mirage. After a few months, the second revolution failed, and the right-wing Adm. Miklos Horthy stepped in as regent; he lasted 25 years.
Eager to revive the lost sense of empire, the admiral suppressed all manner of criticism. Moholy, a left winger, emigrated first. Others followed, in search of work and artistic freedom. When the economy improved in the mid-20's, art grew temporarily freer, but those who practiced social commentary and montage were often under threat of arrest, and the police got on-the-job training closing art exhibitions. The album of inventive and lively collages in "The Hungarian Circle" was apparently never exhibited, possibly because some of the subjects are so overtly political. Economics and politics change the map of culture as surely as they change the outlines of history.
It is not surprising that a Pictorialist strain continued to thrive in Hungary through the 30's. Though such work was snubbed by the early historians of photography, who tended to be adherents of sharp-focus modernism, Pictorialism was a style with staying power; it can be found almost everywhere before World War II. A photographer like Emery Revesz-Biro in Hungary preserved the warm and beautiful print techniques that earlier photographers had favored. Pictorialism was already a conservative approach by the second decade of the century, but conservatives are notoriously stubborn and hang on.
In 1927, a large international exposition introduced the Hungarian photographic community to the hard-focus dispassion of the German "new objectivity." And though many continued on the path they were on, some were subsequently poised between the Old World and the New. Pal Funk Angelo shrouded the diagonal geometries of the industrial environment in a photographic fog thicker than London pea soup. Imre Kinszki turned a view of city houses into an unusual combination of romantic nocturne and architectural cubism.
Sharply focused modernism, bold in form and semi-abstract, also made a strong showing within Hungary's borders. The style was truly international, its spread insured by the rapid growth of photographically illustrated journals and travel. Kinszki transformed a stairway and the shadows of its railing into vertical, paper-thin planes written over by pattern. Olga Mate's tilted image of a dock and its reflections in the water becomes a kind of Mondrian with intimations of depth.
So, when the photographic pioneers moved to new frontiers, those left behind polished their lenses and wielded an influence of their own at home and abroad. The mystery is not so much why that was as why this small country produced such a wealth of fine photographers. (It might be noted that about the same time, Hungary reaped a brilliant crop of scientists -- the physicist Leo Szilard, the nuclear physicist Edward Teller, the mathematician John von Neumann and two Nobel laureates, the biochemist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi and the physicist Eugene Wigner. Some of the most famous also emigrated.)
The catalogue essay notes that at the turn of the century the country enjoyed great affluence, the middle class expended effort and money on educating its children, and photography was a popular activity for aristocrat and bourgeois alike. In fact, Hungary was exceptionally hospitable to photography during the first two decades.
IN 1908, A NATIONAL EXHIBITION OF scientific and artistic photography that occupied 15 halls was opened by the Grand Duke and Duchess in the company of several cabinet ministers. (Think of Alfred Stieglitz's struggle to get a museum to exhibit a photograph or two in America at this time.) During World War I, one Hungarian paper ran four photographic competitions for soldiers at the front; the pictures were so exceptional that they were published in journals across Europe.
Combine this sense of status with the nationalistic pride coded in so many photographs, plus whatever trick of fate favored Hungary with a particular talent -- perhaps some whimsical god, knowing no one could speak their language, decided that Hungarians deserved a vision -- and you get a Kertesz, a Moholy, a Brassai and a second rank that need not hang its head.

TWO RUSSIAN AIRLINES TO BEGIN U.S. SERVICE

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
FOR Americans wanting to fly directly to Moscow from anywhere but New York, which is served by Delta, there has been only Aeroflot-Russian International Airlines to consider.
Soon, however, it will be possible to fly directly from Chicago or Los Angeles to Moscow (and back) on two Russian airlines that have just received approval to fly in the United States. 
 Based in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, Krasair, a semiprivatized offshoot of the old Aeroflot regional system, was scheduled to begin the Moscow-Los Angeles route (and twice a week from Moscow to New York) last week. Krasair flies two McDonnell Douglas DC-10's with 40 seats in business class and 243 in economy.
The other airline, Transaero, is one of the great aviation successes in the new Russia, providing Western-style service on Western-style planes within the former Soviet Union and building an enviable reputation compared with domestic Aeroflot. Transaero flies to international destinations like London and Tel Aviv, and beginning in June it will fly the Chicago-Moscow route three times a week with a Boeing 767.
Both airlines say that their prices will becompetitive, and that their real price competition will be with international Aeroflot, which is normally the cheapest way to fly between the two countries. The airlines have spotless safety records, at least so far.
Krasair is 51 percent owned by the Russian Government, while 44 percent is owned by its employees, with the rest belonging to two Russian investment companies, according to its marketing director, Andrei U. Yegorov. Its pilots have been trained by Douglas Aircraft Company and its service staff by British Airways, which sent representatives to Krasnoyarsk to train Russian crew. Its food will come from Western companies. This is a big departure for Krasair, a large regional Siberian airline that flies to some 50 cities within the former Soviet Union, Mr. Yegorov said, and can provide reasonably convenient connections for Americans traveling onward from Moscow, especially into Siberia, but the service is likely to be different domestically.
Transaero was started in 1990 with $5,000 by Aleksandr Pleshakov, now only 30, whose mother happened to be the head of the Inter-State Aviation Committee, a job she retains. Russians and foreigners here can only be grateful. Mr. Pleshakov refused to hire any Aeroflot employees. He leased Boeing airplanes, put an Israeli company in charge of servicing and had Air France train his staff. Now Transaero trains the staff of other airlines and has introduced a frequent-flier program.
Transaero also provides a good, reasonably priced service from Moscow to other international destinations, including London, Berlin, Frankfurt, Tel Aviv and Eilat, important cities for Russia's businessmen and burgeoning middle class.
And Transaero is without question the carrier of choice for internal flights to long-distance destinations in Siberia, the Far North and the Far East, like Vladivostok, Norilsk, Nizhnevartovsk and Novosibirsk; the Urals, like Yekaterinburg; the Black Sea, like Sochi, and major cities of the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, including Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Almaty, Kazakhstan; Kiev and Odessa, in Ukraine; and Riga, Latvia. It also flies to St. Petersburg, which is a short flight on a route served by another good carrier, an Aeroflot offshoot called Pulkovo.
Domestic Aeroflot, which has been broken up into many companies, some good and some not, preserves the old idea of a "trolleybus of the air." One class fits all. Seats are often dirty or broken; leg room is a cruel joke; seat belts are often missing; life preservers are nearly always missing (though many flights are only over land), and service is grudging, sparse and truculent. After providing mineral water of questionable quality in unsanitary plastic cups, flight attendants normally disappear until it's time to roll a cart down the aisles in an effort to sell passengers newspapers, beer, soft drinks, candy and pistachios.
On long flights, one may be fortunate enough to miss the infamous scrawny, pale "Aeroflot chicken." The same plastic cups that contained the mineral water then appear with lukewarm water, in which one may float a harsh tea bag.
Transaero, which does not always get the best takeoff times in what was once an Aeroflot monopoly, does provide adequate food and Western-style service to go with its Western planes. Normally, there is a business class. On flying Transaero for the first time, most Russians are left speechless when a pleasant voice on the working loudspeaker system thanks them for choosing to fly Transaero and wishes them a comfortable flight.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Its Name Restored, a Hotel Rides the Tourism Wave

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
TIME seems to bring change to hotels more regularly than to most forms of commercial property. To maintain quality, renovation work has to be undertaken constantly. But the ownership of the property, and the character of its use, often changes as well.
In the case of what is now formally known as the Hotel Pennsylvania, in Manhattan, the changes extend also to the name. It was built in 1919 as the Hotel Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Railroad, whose late-lamented station faced it across Seventh Avenue between 32d and 33d Streets. It became the Statler in 1949 when the Statler Company bought it. Five years later, Conrad Hilton bought all 17 Statler hotels, and renamed it the Statler Hilton. 
 In 1984 it became the New York Penta Hotel when Penta Hotels, run by a consortium of European airlines, became the operating partner in the ownership group, Ascot Associates, headed by Abraham Hirschfeld, the real-estate investor and sometime mayoral candidate. Penta completed a $35 million renovation program, but Mr. Hirschfeld said he acquired Penta's interest in 1991 when the hotel was operating at a loss.
Then Hampton Hotels Corporation, headed by Simon Elias, a 38-year-old Israeli investor, and Mary Diem, an experienced hotel manager, took over as manager. The debt was restructured and a long-term $15 million upgrading begun. Hampton became the operating partner two years ago.
The Pennslyvania's saga shows how hotel properties change their character in different times under different management, and also how the city's tourist hotels are benefiting at present from the increase in foreign travelers seeking moderate-priced rooms in New York City. Many of these hotels are currently charging individual travelers $90 to $130 a night, hotel consultants say. Tour groups, or airlines that book rooms wholesale for their crews, usually pay about 30 percent below that.
As the Penta, the hotel had aspired to the deluxe category of hotels, an attempt that failed there and elsewhere in the recession of the late 80's and early 90's. It is reasserting itself at a time when tourist hotels in general are enjoying their best year of the 90's. It The Pennsylvania has 1,705 rooms, making it the third largest in the city after the New York Hilton (2,041 rooms) and the Sheraton New York (1,746 rooms).
Hotels are benefiting from an upsurge in foreign travelers to New York City, particularly, this year, from Latin America, and also from the fact that the commercial-oriented hotels have cut back on discounted rates aimed at economy-minded tour groups. The discount to tour groups is said to have declined in the last year or so.
"The first-class commercial hotels no longer have to concentrate on the tour and travel and contract segments of the market, like the airlines, which get significant discounts," said Frank Dougherty, a consultant with Hospitality Valuation Services in Mineola, L.I. That has tightened the market for tour groups.
Citywide, occupancy has been rising gradually since its low of 67.6 percent in 1991, according to PKF Consulting, in Manhattan. The firm projects 1995 occupancy at 76.5 percent, the highest since 1988. In October, occupancy reached 91.9 percent, the highest figure for a single month since October 1979, said John A. Fox, senior vice president.
The improved occupancy has led to new investment at a number of hotels, including the Roosevelt, on Madison Avenue between 45th and 46th Streets. Its owner, PIA Investments Ltd., an arm of Pakistan International Airline, closed the 1,070-room hotel in July and launched a $55 million reconstruction. It will be completed in 1997 but a partial reopening is scheduled for next June. Its name will be the Radisson Roosevelt.
 ANOTHER large hotel headed for a major renovation is the 654-room Doral Inn, on Lexington Avenue and 49th Street, where Starwood Lodging Trust, a real estate investment trust that focuses on hotels, took a long-term lease in September from Carol Management, parent company of Doral Hotels and Resorts, the operator. The hotel is planning a renovation that will cost $10 million to $15 million, said Bruce Blum, chief executive of Doral Hotels.
And at the Milford Plaza, on Eighth Avenue between 44th and 45th Streets, the general manager, Russ Smith, said the hotel would finish the year with an occupancy figure of 84 percent, "better than we've ever done since we opened in 1980." Business from Latin America -- Argentina and Brazil, in particular -- has picked up tremendously, he said. The Milford Plaza has 1,300 rooms.
The Pennsylvania story is one of slow recovery from deep trouble. The Penta, not alone among hotel operators in the West 30's during the mid-80's, tried to make the location a destination for corporate travelers. Once Penta withdrew, the leaderless hotel experienced a deep drop in tour bookings.
It's a big building: 1.5 million gross square feet of space on 20 floors, including 300,000 square feet of commercial space and 70,000 square feet of banquet and ballroom space. The Diem-Elias partnership brought in The Sports Authority as a 50,000-square-foot tenant on the second floor and MTI Studios, which leases out space for television productions, 60,000 square feet mainly at the mezzanine level.
A week ago Ms. Diem (pronounced DEEM), the hotel's manager, was elated to report that a month earlier she was able to buy 800 rooms of furniture from the Palace Hotel, on Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, which is undergoing a top-to-bottom redecoration itself. The furniture will be used in 1,000 rooms at the Pennsylvania, where most rooms are 14 by 16 feet or 12 by 20 feet.
The total number of rooms is also a building characteristic that changes over the years in hotels. The Pennsylvania was designed by McKim Mead & White with 2,200 guest rooms, more than any other Manhattan hotel at the time. Over the years more space has gone into nonresidential use, and some rooms have been enlarged, to bring the current count to 1,705.
 UNDER the new management, the decor has become less contemporary and more traditional, Ms. Diem said. New carpeting has been installed on most hallways, which are 10 feet wide and run the length of four bowling lanes from Seventh Avenue toward Avenue of the Americas.
"We've redone 13 floors over four years," said Ms. Diem, "mostly using the cash flow from the building. We've got three floors left to go, and one will be finished in December."
The renovation has made the Pennsylvania competitive again for the tour-and-travel groups and the airline-crew business. Ms. Diem said that an average of 500 rooms a night are leased to airline crews and 400 to travel groups. The rest of the rooms are leased at "rack" rates to the public at prices that change according to occupancy conditions. The typical rate is $109 for a single and $129 for a double.
What has helped most of all at the Pennsylvania and other moderate-priced hotels is the pick-up in foreign tourism. The beneficiaries are also the tour operators.
"Our business grew 50 percent this year," said Carlos Lahuerta, who runs American Way Tours, which books tours mainly from Spain, Portugal, Italy and South America. Forty percent of the growth was from Brazil, largely because the value of its currency rose in relation to the dollar.
The occupancy picture has also assisted, according to hotel people, because New York City has become more competitive for tour and convention business. A key reason is the reduction of state and city taxes on hotel rooms. The taxes are now pegged at 13 1/4 percent, plus a flat $2 charge per room per night. The tax consists of an 8 1/4 percent city-state sales tax and a 5 percent city occupancy tax. Before the reduction, rooms renting for more than $100 a night paid 19 1/4 percent in state and city taxes, plus the $2 flat tax.

HEADLINE: West Side Story: Three Partners And an Idea

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
THE next century may be several years away, but for Broadway between 66th and 68th Streets, the Millennium has already arrived -- and brought with it startling changes.
The Millennium in question is Millennium Partners, developers who have spent $500 million on those blocks for the construction of three new high-rise buildings -- two of them complete and the third in progress -- with 740 new rental and condominium apartments and about 540,000 square feet of commercial space that includes the Sony Lincoln Square multiplex, a Gap, an Eddie Bauer, a Coconuts music store, a 60,000-square-foot, five-level Barnes & Noble superstore and the $55 million, six-story, 140,000-square-foot Reebok Sports Club. 
 Still to come, at the base of the third building, are a 50,000-square-foot Tower Records and a 30,000-square-foot Pottery Barn. Millennium has also acquired, in a deal that is essentially a swap, the Chinese Mission to the United Nations, a 10-story former hotel on 66th Street just west of Broadway. The mission is next door to the Tower Records site, and Millennium has used zoning bonuses and the mission's air rights to add 100,000 square feet to the 31-story building, now called Lincoln West, that is to be its neighbor.
The 500,000-square-foot Lincoln West is going up on the west side of Broadway between 66th and 67th Streets, where the five-story General Media building, a much smaller Tower Records and Video and an NBO store used to be. Millennium has stripped the skin from the building, is reinforcing the skeleton and is using it for the base of the tower that is to rise above.
The lower floors of Lincoln West will be a hotel for extended stays, with between 120 and 150 furnished one-bedroom suites for visits of seven days or more. Above the hotel will be about 175 rental units, and the top five or six floors will hold luxury condominium units. The building is expected to be completed by the end of next year, with Tower Records and Pottery Barn moving in by next Christmas.
The Chinese Mission will be moving to 34th Street and First Avenue, on the site of the old Evyan Perfume factory, in two buildings that Millennium is renovating and constructing. In a year or two, after the Chinese diplomats and their aides have departed, the 66th Street building will come down and be replaced by a smaller building whose lower floors will probably hold the Ansonia Post Office.
(The post office had been on the undeveloped site of the first building, Lincoln Square, on the east side of Broadway between 67th and 68th Streets. It moved temporarily to 66th Street east of Columbus Avenue and had originally been scheduled to move back to Lincoln Square.)
Plans for the rest of the new building on the Chinese Mission site are indefinite, but among the possibilities are a luxury hotel or -- if Lincoln Center decides to go ahead and can raise the $40 million said to be needed for the project -- a new opera house, a "mini-Metropolitan Opera House" with 800 to 1,000 seats.
All of which is a major turnaround for what had long been an oasis of underdevelopment between the liveliness of Lincoln Center to the south and the crowded intersection of Broadway and 72d Street above. Until the beginning of the 1990's, the two streets had held a small bank branch, the Cinema Studio 1 and 2 -- two tiny art-movie houses -- an old, low-rise office building with a rundown luncheonette on street level, a vacant former La Crepe restaurant, the low-rise post office adjacent to the headquarters of the Transport Workers Union and, around the corner at Columbus, a small ABC television studio that had been used for the taping of soap operas.
Then along came Millennium Partners, a partnership of Philip E. Aarons, Christopher Jeffries and Philip Lovett. Mr. Aarons and Mr. Jeffries had first met when Mr. Aarons was head of the New York City Public Development Corporation -- a quasipublic nonprofit agency involved in the city's redevelopment efforts -- and worked with Mr. Jeffries on a project Mr. Jeffries was developing in Staten Island. They had actually been undergraduates at Columbia University together -- Mr. Aarons is Class of '73, Mr. Jeffries Class of '72 -- but had not known each other at Columbia.
Mr. Jeffries, a Michigan native, returned to his home state to attend the University of Michigan Law School before coming back to New York. Mr. Aarons, who grew up in the Boston suburbs, went on to graduate from Columbia University Law School.
AFTER Mr. Aarons left government, the two men got together and in 1984, with their General Atlantic Realty Corporation, began converting a former nursing home at Fifth Avenue and 107th Street into market-rate apartments. They spent much of the rest of the 1980's constructing subsidized low-income housing (including Spring Creek Gardens in the East New York section of Brooklyn, which they developed in partnership with the Related Companies) and later building in Manhattan under the city's inclusionary zoning program, which gave bonus space for market-rate housing when low-income units were put up.
(Mr. Lovett, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Business School, joined General Atlantic five years ago.)
Then they came upon the Broadway blocks. The property on the east side of Broadway was owned by Capital Cities/ ABC, whose offices were across the street, on 66th and 67th between Columbus and Central Park West and which was finishing a spate of development on those blocks. It was in the middle of the real-estate recession of the late 80's and early 90's; property values had plummeted, and it was difficult if not impossible to get financing for almost any kind of construction.
But Millennium had an idea. The partners envisioned an urban entertainment, retail and residential complex, a complement to ABC and Lincoln Center. And they thought they had a novel way to finance it.
"We had an unusual opportunity," Mr. Aarons said. "There were two largely vacant contiguous full-block sites that had been held off the market by a corporate owner for a much longer time than was traditional. For the first building, there was more than 55,000 square feet on the street, which was unusual in a congested environment like New York. So we could plan a development that could take advantage of such a site and its flexible zoning, and we had the ability to do something that would be different."
Mr. Aarons is sitting in Millennium's offices in the Jamaica Savings Bank building at Broadway and 68th, next to large windows that look out at his new structures. Perhaps because of his government experience he is the more public of the partners, the designated spokesman. Mr. Jeffries appears more the dedicated businessman, the number-cruncher, the detail man, at first a little reticent. But after a brief warm-up period, he does not hesitate to expand on his partner's comments.
"The opportunity Millennium Partners had is based on a collapsing real estate market," he said, "where no one had access to construction financing or equity and where everyone was looking at the problems of the past instead of the opportunities of the future. It was a situation in which certain fantastic assets, such as these three blocks, could be acquired for prices that were less than half of what they could have been acquired for three or four years earlier."
Mr. Aarons agreed. "The challenge we faced was finding a way to get financing for the first building," he said. "And that really happened by building partnerships with major retailers."
The idea, he said, was to work with the chief executives of Sony, Reebok, the Gap, Coconuts, Barnes & Noble (which opted for the second building, Lincoln Triangle) and others to custom-build spaces in exchange for financial commitments and a piece of the action -- or, as Mr. Jeffries put it, "a chance to participate in the success of those businesses."
"We tell people," Mr. Aarons added, "that if they're thinking of doing something different in an urban environment, we can design a building that suits their needs. We can give you ceiling heights you don't have when you find yourself at the bottom of a residential building on Third Avenue. We can give you floor plates, column locations, whatever you need. If you get people to commit to a little bit more rent and more space, you can build the fundamentals of the financing."
THEY used a similar technique for the residential part of the Lincoln Square building -- preselling space. They worked out a deal with J. P. Morgan & Company, the project's financial adviser, and Morgan took six floors of apartments for use by senior executives and trainees. In exchange, Millennium received a Morgan-owned building on the East Side, Hampton House at Madison Avenue and 70th Street (where they are now marketing floor-through condominiums for upwards of $3 million each).
To further structure the financing, Mr. Jeffries said, they decided to sell off, for condominiums, "the best part of the building, which most developers will try to keep to make the profit in the transaction."
"We didn't want to be in the condo business," he said, "but in addition, doing this allowed this project to be financed at a time when no other projects could be financed." The top 12 floors, 100,000 square feet of apartments with their own lobby and elevator bank, were sold to a partnership that included Goldman, Sachs, the Zeckendorf Company and Sumitomo Realty and Development.
Millennium obtained a $142.5 million construction loan from the Bayerische Hypotheken-und-Wechsel-Bank of Munich and the Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Stuttgart. They secured a completion guarantee from the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company of London, the parent of Lehrer McGovern Bovis, construction manager for all three buildings.
And so they created Lincoln Square, a 56-story tower on Broadway and Columbus Avenue between 67th and 68th Streets that engendered much controversy and protest after it was announced in 1992.
The first problem was size. The 545-foot-tall building was in the Special Lincoln Square Zoning District set up north of Columbus Circle in the late 1960's to encourage development with the idea that the area remain a mixed-use residential, retail and entertainment-oriented neighborhood. It was constructed as of right, meaning no zoning variances were required. But community protests over the building's height led the city to adopt new zoning rules for the district, rules that in effect limit the height of future projects to 30 or 31 stories by requiring that 60 percent of their interior space be below 150 feet.
The second problem was design: Neighborhood residents felt that the building, with its somewhat garish orange-and-rust brick facing, was ugly. The third was density: Many people declared that the new apartments, and especially the Sony multiplex, would bring hordes of pedestrians and cars to an area already crowded by theater- and concertgoers at Lincoln Center.
AS anyone who lives on or visits the West Side can attest, the crowds have descended. A walk on Broadway between 66th and 72d Streets, especially after a film has let out, can be a shoulder-to-shoulder experience. But the protests seem essentially to have, if not died out, at least become minimal -- in large part, residents say, because of the building's success. The concern about density has not vanished, but the neighborhood and the neighbors, as well as visitors, seem to appreciate the amenities.
"The Sony theaters are now acknowledged publicly to be the highest grossing movie theaters in the country," Mr. Jeffries said. "About 3 million people will go through their doors this year." The Reebok Sports Club has more than 4,500 members, and the membership list grows daily.
Millennium Tower, the upper-floors condominium -- which was put on the market when condominiums were becoming hot items in Manhattan -- commands prices that average $675 a square foot, and that go as high as $890 a square foot -- over $1 million for a two-bedroom apartment. More than 90 percent of the 93 apartments have been sold.
Rents at Lincoln Square and Lincoln Triangle (between 66th and 67th Streets) are among the highest in Manhattan, Mr. Jeffries said: about $3,000 a month for a one-bedroom, and about $11,000 a month for a four-bedroom.
Mr. Aarons unapologetically defends the neighborhood's increased density. "I believe cities are about density," he said.
Others' feelings are more complex. Nathan Leventhal, who as the president of Lincoln Center is a major neighbor, said he believed that what Millennium has done is "in the main very exciting."
"It reaffirms the area of Broadway north of Lincoln Center as the entertainment center of New York City," Mr. Leventhal said. "I'm thinking of moving here. Then I could never leave. I could go to concerts and movies and buy records and books. But it hasn't come without a price. There are legitimate concerns as to how much development the area can take, how much it translates into infrastructure issues."
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, also gives the developers mixed reviews for their work, but also with an emphasis on the positive.
"They're bringing a lot of additional commercial services to the neighborhood," Ms. Messinger said, "but they're bringing them to a neighborhood that was tremendously alive and tremendously crowded already. The services are a big plus, but they can also cause severe congestion problems. They're also creating housing, which the city needs, and that's worthy of positive note. But I wish they would turn some of their creative talents to affordable and middle-income housing, which is an area in which they have a track record."
The Lincoln Triangle building attracted none of the controversy of its older brother. At 30 stories it is much smaller, having been built under the new zoning rules. Its quieter, off-white brick has also been found by most observers to be more esthetically pleasing. Its apartments are almost all rental, with only the penthouse units being marketed as condominiums -- this time, with the market so positive, by Millennium itself. The partners will also market the condominiums they are planning for Lincoln West.
THE third site was purchased from Bob Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine and chairman and chief executive officer of General Media, whose offices were in what had earlier been an Equitable Life Assurance building. It will, Mr. Aarons said, "be smaller than Lincoln Square but bigger than Lincoln Triangle." In April, Millennium reached an agreement in Beijing with the Chinese Government to obtain the Chinese Mission next door. In exchange, Millennium is to construct a new residence building for the mission at 34th Street and First Avenue and renovate an adjacent building at First Avenue and 35th Street for use as office space for the mission. The First Avenue properties were bought from the estate of Evyan's founder and owner, Baron Walter Langer von Langendorff.
At the time of the agreement, Kening Zhang, the first secretary and legal adviser to the Chinese Mission, explained that the current mission building was "too far away from the U.N."
Mr. Aarons said he and his partners had been "intrigued" by the mission site but had always assumed "that a real-estate transaction with China would be impossible to do." But several years ago, he said, they were approached by the Chinese for help with a tax issue. "When we asked why the tax issue was relevant, since I assumed China wasn't paying taxes, they said it was not important now but would be important if they were to sell the building," he said. "So that gave us the first inkling that the building might be available."
Two years of talks led to the agreement. But State Department approval was acquired, and getting that approval, at a time of difficult relations between the Chinese and United States Government, took several months. Mr. Jeffries said the deal had a "value in excess of $30 million," in that "each site is worth $30 million or more."
The deal was especially good news for them in terms of the Lincoln West building. "It allows us to design a bigger building for Lincoln West," Mr. Aarons said. "Also, since we anticipate having possession of the mission building, we know what's going to be there, so we can design the Lincoln West building knowing what's going to be next door, where the views in Lincoln West are going to be."
Millennium used air rights from the mission, and an inclusionary-zoning bonus it had obtained five years earlier from low-income units it built on 107th Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, to add 100,000 square feet to the building.
(Neighborhood residents may remember that Lincoln West was the original name of the development proposed for the old rail yards between 59th and 72d Streets near the West Side Highway, the plan now known as Riverside South.)
 ONE result of the anticipated swap is the likelihood that a full-service Ansonia Post Office -- customer-service windows, mail sorting and loading docks for mail delivery -- will move into the first and basement levels of the new building to be constructed on the mission site.
Mr. Aarons said the Postal Service was "in the approval process to move forward on the mission site."
The location of the post office, which has had a temporary retail site on 66th Street east of Columbus, has been a guessing game for neighborhood residents since its old Broadway home was torn down to make way for Lincoln Square. The original plan was for the post office to move into Lincoln Square, in a now vacant 46,000-square-foot storefront site on 68th near Columbus that was purchased by the Postal Service as a condominium for $10 million.
But Andrew Sozzi, a spokesman for the Postal Service in New York, said that several changes in the neighborhood had made the site "no longer desirable for us."
"The mere fact that the Lincoln Square building was constructed, and other high-rise buildings went up in the neighborhood, has increased the volume of mail coming into the Ansonia station, making the space we bought in the building no longer adequate," Mr. Sozzi said. Another problem, he said, was that "the Sony theaters had created much more pedestrian and vehicular traffic on 68th Street, where the loading bays would have to be."
The Chinese Mission space, he said, "offers the two things we were looking for: more space to process our mail, and a street where there is a lot less traffic, making that site a lot safer for us." He added that the plan for the site was awaiting final approvals in Washington.
There is also, Mr. Jeffries said, another important factor: The retail space in the Lincoln Square building "is now worth certainly more than double what the Postal Service paid us for it three years ago."
Leasing it for retail, therefore, would provide a potential bonanza for the owners. Both Mr. Sozzi and Mr. Jeffries said it was not clear what the Postal Service would do with the space, whether it would lease it on its own or sell it back to Millennium.
Possibilities for the upper floors at Lincoln West, Mr. Jeffries said, include a 200-room "high-end" hotel or a new building for Lincoln Center -- a small opera house.
Mr. Leventhal of Lincoln Center said he was "working with Millennium on the possibility of that site as a future theatrical facility."
"It's a dream we have always had: a mini-Met building at Lincoln Center," he said. "But the idea is very speculative and would require an enormous amount of money. It's still more a dream than anything, but it's one that might well happen."
NOT everything in Millennium Partners' existence has been successful. A bid to develop the former Gulf and Western Building at Columbus Circle as a luxury apartment tower lost out to Donald Trump's proposal for what is now called the Trump International Hotel and Tower, a mixed-use luxury hotel and condominium building.
But their success has brought praise and admiration from many of their colleagues. Even Mr. Trump, not known for lavishing praise on his competitors, called the partners "fine people who have done a very, very solid job."
"I think their performance has been excellent, and their theaters are really beautiful," Mr. Trump said. "And they accomplished it at a time when a lot of people were very skeptical about many of aspects of real estate. I take my hat off to them."
Millennium is also expanding outside of New York City. In downtown San Francisco near the Moscone Center, the partners are building a 400,000-square-foot urban entertainment center that has been entirely leased to Sony and will contain a major movie complex, retailing and restaurants.
They have also been selected to develop another 750,000-square-foot site adjacent to the Sony one, Mr. Jeffries said. "So we're going to try to replicate in San Francisco what we're doing here," he said.
Mr. Aarons said that as far as the West Side is concerned, the Chinese Mission will be the final piece of the puzzle. But he and his partners say that they want to continue to find ways to improve the neighborhood and alleviate the density situation. They are taking an active part, with Lincoln Center, Capital Cities/ABC and other neighborhood companies in creating a Lincoln Center business improvement district.
"We believe in our buildings," Mr. Aarons said. "I live in Lincoln Square; Chris lives in Lincoln Triangle."
Mr. Jeffries asked the remaining critics to give them time. "Don't judge what it is until it's all over," he said, "whether it's the color of the brick, the height of the building or the way in which the base of the building relates to the tower. Wait two years."

Stores Direct Their Feet to the Sunny Side Street

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
TWO years ago, with great trepidation, Hilary Lloyd, a Kinko's franchisee, opened his first Kinko's copying service store at 16 East 52d Street. Every instinct told him he should be on a major thoroughfare. Problem was, he was priced out of the market on Avenue of the Americas, upper Third Avenue and other heavily trafficked streets.
He needn't have worried. The store, which gets huge orders from surrounding office towers, is among the most successful in the national Kinko's chain. 
 Mr. Lloyd has since opened stores at 78th Street near Lexington and on 47th Street between Sixth and Seventh. He will soon open stores on 54th Street, between Eighth Avenue and Broadway, and on 46th Street between First and Second Avenues.
"Sure, I'd still prefer avenue stores, but I'm getting a big bang for my buck on the side streets," he said.
Mr. Lloyd is not alone. Duane Reade, once an avenue mainstay, is dotting side streets with drugstores. A Staples office supplies store is thriving on 49th Street east of Fifth Avenue. Maud Frizon's, a woman's shoe store, moved a few years ago from 57th Street and Madison Avenue when the rent jumped to $800,000 a year, and is said to be doing fine in an East 69th Street store, where the rent is an eighth the amount.
"The idea that side-street retailers are poor relations to avenue retailers is just wrong," said Benjamin Fox, a partner in the New Spectrum brokerage.
So much for the idea that retailers operating off the beaten track should write an epitaph for their stores. Yes, some people, particuoarly outside of Manhattan, still believe that. "It is simply bad business to go on a side street," stated Michael D. Friedman, vice president of Clay-Daniel Associates, a Queens brokerage. But others say that is no longer a hard and fast rule.
"If a store has a well-known label, and puts money into advertising and direct mail, it can do fine on a side street," said Faith H. Consolo, senior managing director of the Garrick-Aug brokerage.
Lately, few but the most deep-pocketed national chains have much choice. Rents on avenues like Third and Madison, and on major cross streets like 57th Street and Prince Street, have soared. And even at high rents, small stores are hard to find, as many landlords, hoping to attract chains, combine their small spaces into larger ones. So, numerous stores are being forced onto streets they would not touch before.
Few are happy about it; but many say that it is not as bad as they had feared.
"I was devastated when we had to move, and we would be doing better business on Madison," said Wallis Mayers, owner of Wallis Mayers Needlework, which was forced by rising rents to leave 780 Madison Avenue, near 67th Street, for a bigger but cheaper store at 30 East 68th. "But our customers are finding us again."
Some retailers are even reaping mini-boons from the major bane of soaring avenue rents. In July, Broadway Panhandler moved from 520 Broadway, near Spring Street, to much quieter Broome Street. It got a much larger store at a much lower rent, which enabled it to pour money into fixtures, design and advertising.
"I was nervous about moving off Broadway, but it turns out that the rising rents were a blessing in disguise," said Norman Kornbleuth, the cookware store's owner.
Maurice Idy, co-owner of the Brooklyn men's store Kings Row, used that same phrase to describe his recent rent-driven move from 86th Street, Bensonhurst's main shopping street, to Sheepshead Bay Road, a quieter, narrower road three miles away. He doubled his space and slashed his rent, which allowed him to broaden his inventory (he now sells boys' and oversized men's clothes) and lower prices.
"We would have loved to stay put, but I really believe we will do better business here," said Mr. Idy, who opened his new store two months ago.
None of these stores are side-street pioneers. Whenever avenue rents have heated up, shoemakers, dry cleaners and other local service stores have moved to side streets, "creating new service shopping corridors around the corner," said Peter Botsaris, Garrick-Aug's president.
What is new is the flow of non-service retailers into those corridors. "Clothing stores are recognizing that they can get as much traffic next to a dry cleaner as they can next to a shoe store," said Rob Nager, director of retail leasing at Colliers ABR.
Few side-street stores leave traffic flow to chance, though. Most step up their advertising and direct-mail budgets, and put up huge awnings and lavish window displays.
Carole Greene, a New Spectrum vice president, says that her client, Hallmark Cards, gambled -- successfully, it turned out -- on a store at 31 West 52d Street because it had 50 feet of windows. "They have a store that makes people blink when they walk by," she said.
This new willingness to gamble on off-avenue locations has been a bonanza for landlords. "We're negotiating numerous leases for side-street space that our clients could not rent in the past," said Rosina K. Abramson, a real estate attorney.
Examples abound. A few months ago, Pisa de Torre, a white-tablecloth restaurant, opened at 19 West 44th Street, in space that had been vacant almost two years. "The kind of space they wanted was neither available nor affordable on the avenues," said Gerard Nocera, executive vice president of S.L. Green Real Estate, which manages the building.
Similarly, W&M Properties is getting a lot of nibbles for the off-avenue stores at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, at 47th Street. It expects to soon have a permanent tenant for a store just west of the avenue that is currently under month-to-month lease to financially troubled Herman's. And it is close to a deal with a restaurant for a vacant spot in the plaza behind the building.
"The retailers know that, in a big building, you get sales from the people above you, not just from people walking by," said Anthony E. Malkin, W&M's president.
Indeed, some skyscraper-rich side streets may be turning into seller's markets. David M. Wess, a retail associate at Williams Real Estate, is seeking a sublet tenant for a Chemical Bank branch on 43d Street, west of Fifth Avenue. "Food stores are offering above asking rents, but Chemical is holding out for a non-food use," he said.
Some side streets have even turned into first-choice locations for certain types of stores. Sewing machine stores now congregate on 25th Street west of Seventh Avenue. Electronics stores are rife on 31st Street west of Sixth and on 45th Street east of Sixth. And 60th Street east of Third Avenue is to antiques what west 47th Street has long been to diamonds.
"The antiques stores that left Third Avenue because of rents wound up creating their own antiques district," said Alan Victor, an executive vice president of the Lansco brokerage.
Conversely, some retailers see side streets as a way to differentiate themselves from what they view as increasingly homogenized thoroughfares. "As Eighth Street has gotten more commercial and honky tonk, East Ninth Street has evolved by choice into a carriage trade street," said Mr. Fox of New Spectrum.
Susan Penzner, an independent broker, sees a similar phenomenon happening in SoHo. "Lower Broadway has come to look so much like a regional mall that the high-fashion stores really prefer the side streets," she said.
Still, most side-street stores are there from economic necessity, not choice. Thoroughfare rents are just too high.
IN SoHo, for example, stores on major shopping streets like Prince and Spring that used to go for annual rents of $50 a square foot now command double that amount; stores on secondary streets like Greene and Wooster can be had for $55, while Mercer Street rents hover around $40.
On Third Avenue, stores between 72d and 80th Street -- north of the real bastion of mall stores -- get annual rents of as much as $160 a square foot, while on Second Avenue they command $100; annual rents on the streets connecting the two avenues rarely top $75 on busy streets like 77th, and can be as low as $35 on quieter streets.
Rents on Madison Avenue in the 60's are up to $250; side streets can be had for $100.
But side-street rents are inching up, too, particularly in newly developing areas. As Ladies Mile -- that stretch of Avenue of the Americas from 14th Street to 23d Street -- has metamorphosed from a strip of vacant former department stores to a bustling discount haven, the side streets surrounding it have blossomed with restaurants and other stores looking to capitalize on the increased pedestrian traffic. The area's side-street rents are now between $28 and $35; a year ago they did not top $25.
Still, as fast as side-street rents go up, avenue rents seem to go up faster. "Side streets are no longer cheap," said Ms. Consolo. "But they will always be cheaper."

Will a No-Tax Policy Go Up in Smoke?

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Each of two million New Jerseyans smoke 4.8 packs of cigarettes on average per week. They are arguably not the most health-conscious people around, and given what we know about smokers, they are probably also not the richest. Are they to be the ones who pay for Governor Whitman's first new tax?
The possibility comes up because of the way Christine Todd Whitman has structured her administration. She cut government income (by reducing income taxes) before she figured out where to cut the government to match. Among other consequences, this back-to-front approach (Ronald Reagan also favored it, but he had a credit card called the national debt) has left the Governor sailing ever closer to the wind, fiscally speaking, and with less and less room to maneuver when the sudden need for ready cash comes up. 
 We are now in one of those scrambles for money, in this case over ways to pay for a program that reimburses hospitals that care for people without health insurance.
New Jersey does not have any public hospitals to care for the working poor who account for most charity care. Instead, the state pays about $450 million a year to reimburse hospitals that do the job, and the hospitals in turn are glad to have such a dependable source of income.
But the fund to pay for this care is empty, and for the past three years the state has raided the surplus in the Unemployment Insurance Fund, paid for by employers and workers, to cover the cost. Meanwhile, authorization to raid the Unemployment Insurance Fund expires on Dec. 31. And the Legislature is not going to extend it.
So Len Fishman, the Governor's Health Commissioner, floated a trial balloon for her: a 20- or 25-cent tax on each pack of cigarettes to pay part of the charity-care bill. The idea has symmetry: cigarettes are bad for the health; discouraging people from smoking them is good; nothing discourages consumption like higher prices, and the added money, about $125 million a year at 25 cents a pack, would go to health care.
That covers the public policy side of the debate. Now for the politics.
Mrs. Whitman has promised not to raise taxes. She did not literally say "read my lips," but the "no new taxes" part is understood, and her aversion to new taxes was underscored in the debate this spring over renewing the Transportation Trust Fund, whose bonds were falling due. Some in the Legislature thought a 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline-tax increase to pay for the new bonds would make sense, since out-of-staters buy a lot of cheap New Jersey gas and thus would help bear the burden for the locals. In addition, taxes on fuel tend to depress consumption as much as they do on cigarettes, and lower consumption tends in turn to depress prices. A result of recent Federal gasoline tax increases has therefore been to take the extra money, in effect, out of the pockets of the producers, not the consumers.
But Mrs. Whitman dismissed these arguments, and chose instead to pay for the transportation bonds by extending an expiring auto registration surcharge that began life under former Gov. Jim Florio as a way to pay for bad-driver insurance, and which falls on New Jerseyans alone. The message, lest anyone missed the point, was surcharge, yes; new tax, no.
Now the charity-care issue has put the Governor in the same corner but without the same options, because the labor and business groups whose members pay into the Unemployment Insurance Fund have organized a powerful bloc against continuing the raid.
To no one's surprise, the Governor said she "could be comfortable" with a tax on cigarettes. It would discourage smoking, she said, and the cause of maintaining the health of the working poor is certainly a worthy goal.
But it will not be that easy. Several important Republicans oppose a tax even on cigarettes, and the Democrats are certainly not going to help the Governor get one through he Legislature. Moreover, the men and women who sell cigarettes, and that means a lot of convenience stores, family delis and restaurants, are still angry over the 15-cent tax Governor Florio added to the existing 25 cents the state already collected on cigarettes in 1990.
The talk around here is of a three-way compromise: the cigarette tax, a second tax on hospital income of about 1.5 percent and a continuing but declining resort to the Unemployment Insurance Fund. It will not be easy, because the Legislature will make the Governor go first in calling for the taxes and the minority Democrats will sit on their hands as long as they can. At the same time, the Republicans will hint that charity care, after all, goes mostly to hospitals in urban, therefore Democratic, districts.
At the end of the day the poor will be protected, the charity hospitals will get the money they depend upon, and in 1997, when Mrs. Whitman runs for re-election, the Democrats will utter the words she had hoped would never be spoken of her: she raised taxes.

Changing Health Insurance?

 BODY:
This month, many employers are asking employees if they would like to change their medical insurance. Are you thinking about switching?
 
Pay Your Own Way
Most of us have given up our rights to purchase direct health care under the mistaken belief that we can't afford it. We have gotten the Government involved, which has insured a non-competitive system, and now we moan and groan about it.
The solution is simple. Take the money your employer pays for medical care. Pay for your selected doctor yourself. Determine with your doctor and any specialist referred by your doctor if you need the particular medical procedure. Then, work out a price. In the long run, competition will solve the problem of medical costs' rising above inflation.
Oh, one more thing. Control your Government's monolithic position in the health care market. It spends more in the health care market than any other user. Remember, you let them create Medicare and Medicaid. Someone has to pay for it. Who might that be?
 
RALPH D. CORSI
Riverton
 
Traditional Choice
As a nurse, I will continue to stick with the traditional style of health insurance. I have seen many people having problems getting authorization to see a specialist. The H.M.O.'s deem it unnecessary. I am for health care reform, but there has to be a better way.
 
ALICE M. INNES
Harrison
 
Disappearing Coverage
I was talked into changing my health coverage to an H.M.O. The H.M.O. gave a sales pitch that sounded great. My doctor had just signed on as a physician to the plan. She ended my skepticism with her pitch of $3 appointments. Wow, no choice. She was never paid; it turns out my primary physician did not approve of her.
 
CLAIRE GIBBONS
Greene, N.Y.
 
A Luxury Item?
I've been forced to choose between a $200 deductible and a $2,500 deductible, which will give me a savings in premiums of $235 per month, as long as I do not have to file a major claim. I feel that that insurance is moving in the category of a luxury for the rich. I was paying almost as much in health insurance as my mortgage.
 
STEPHEN T. BRODI
Plattsburgh, N.Y.
 
Care With Choice
Most of what I have read is negative, but there are carriers that provide the option of using a managed-care network or selecting an out-of-network physician. The goal of this dual option is to shift the patient into a network by offering significantly higher benefits. However, an individual can select his or her own physician.
 
ROBERT WOLFF
Bridgewater
 
Check Fine Print
One question to ask is whether an insurance carrier's new and renewal premiums are the same that year. Carriers lowball new entrants, then send them substantial increases at the end of the guaranteed rate period.

HEADLINE: Suiting Up for America's High-Tech Future

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: RIO RANCHO, N.M.

 BODY:
ABOUT the only sound inside Intel's new factory here is a robotic whir, high overhead, made by the tiny white cars of a miniature monorail. They ferry a precious cargo of eight-inch silicon wafers. Each is covered with a grid of nearly 300 thumbnail-sized semiconductor chips, and each chip is microscopically packed with millions of electronic gateways, or transistors.
Producing a state-of-the-art microprocessor is the Everest of modern manufacturing, and the Intel Corporation's new plant stands at the summit. The futuristic factory, opened in September, makes the most sophisticated microprocessors that run today's personal computers: the Pentium chip, packed with 3.3 million transistors, and Intel's next-generation Pentium Pro, with 5.5 million transistors. 
 The Intel plant is leading a surge of investment in semiconductor manufacturing by American companies. The current spending spree carries risks, but it also speaks of how far the nation's high-technology manufacturing prowess has come from a decade ago, when many experts predicted that the domestic chip industry was locked in a cycle of decline and its demise threatened to reduce the United States to an economic also-ran in the information age.
"Companies like Intel have done a lot of the things that we all said American companies weren't doing -- investing heavily for the long term and buckling down to really take manufacturing seriously," said Richard K. Lester, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Industrial Performance Center, a business research group.
No one who has seen Intel's new plant here could question the company's commitment to leading-edge manufacturing. The factory, called Fab 11, is a vast, five-story building with floor space that equals more than two dozen football fields. Intel has already invested $1.8 billion it. As output increases, the price tag is expected to rise to $2.5 billion.
Intel's microchips are designed with circuitry measured in the thickness of atoms and light waves. The manufacturing environment is thousands of times more pristine than a hospital operating room; the tiniest speck of dust is a chip killer. And much depends on getting it right. Botch one wafer, and $250,000 or so goes out with the garbage.
The 140-step manufacturing process -- cleaning, planing, etching, baking and chemically coating the wafers -- occurs in laboratory-like alcoves off seemingly endless hallways. Before entering the production area, known as the clean room, the plant's 1,300 technicians suit up like astronauts -- in white Gore-Tex suits with hoods, goggles, boots and yellow latex gloves. Workers must then take a series of "air showers" to remove any dust particles. Makeup must be removed at "wipe-down stations." The plant's floor is raised and perforated for filtering the air, which whisks by at 100 feet per minute.
"All this is to protect the wafers," Bruce Sohn, a manufacturing manager, explained as he escorted two reporters last month, the first journalists inside the factory since it opened. "And it's part of what makes this the most advanced semiconductor facility in the world."
Indeed, this chip plant on a high desert mesa in New Mexico is probably the most productive factory in the world, in terms of the value of goods it makes. By industry estimates, it has the potential to generate revenue of more than $5 billion a year -- more than all but the 200 or so largest companies in America.
The Intel plant heads an armada of $1 billion-plus chip plants under construction around the world. About 40 semiconductor fabrication plants earmarked for $1 billion or more are going up or are on the drawing boards, said George Burns of Strategic Marketing Associates, a technology consulting firm in Santa Cruz, Calif. The pace, if anything, seems to be accelerating. In the month of October alone, there were eight announcements of $1 billion-plus plants.
Japanese, South Korean and Taiwanese companies are spending heavily on semiconductor plants. Yet the investment wave is being led by American companies -- not just Intel but also Motorola, Micron Technology, I.B.M., Advanced Micro Devices and others, building mammoth chip factories in the United States and abroad. Eighteen of the giant plants are being built by American companies, while the Japanese are next, with 10.
Producing in the United States with American workers is an attractive proposition these days for American companies and for East Asian chip makers as well. Thirteen of the $1 billion-plus factories are going up in the United States; nine of those are being built by American companies.
The aggressive investment strategy of the American companies reflects their confidence not only in the prospects for their industry but also in their manufacturing abilities -- an extraordinary reversal from the 1980's. Back then, it seemed, semiconductors were another high-technology industry, pioneered by America, that was being lost to Japan.
The plight of the semiconductor business, more than any other industry, pointed to manufacturing as the Achilles' heel of the American economy. The United States companies were at the forefront of semiconductor research and design, but stumbled badly on the factory floor in production quality and efficiency. A decade ago at American plants, die yields, the share of usable chips among the few hundred etched onto each silicon wafer, were often less than 50 percent, far below Japanese levels.
Today, things could scarcely be more different at leading American plants. Die yields, for example, are now routinely 80 to 90 percent. Once, the semiconductor industry was unable to produce new generations of chips of high quality in high volumes. But today, the factory floor at a company like Intel is confidently described as a competitive weapon, alongside design know-how and financial muscle.
"Manufacturing is no longer an obstacle to anything the company wants to do," said David B. Marsing, the plant manager in Rio Rancho. "That change is fairly recent at Intel, something we've really seen only in the last few years."
Admittedly, there are caveats for the chip makers. Their optimism about the steadily rising demand for all manner of semiconductors -- from Intel's sophisticated microprocessors to simple microcontrollers, found in appliances like hair dryers -- could be off target. The optimism is based on the belief that more semiconductors will be used in more and more products. In fact, the semiconductor share of the total cost of electronics goods has doubled in the last decade, rising to 16 percent, and some analysts predict it will reach 25 percent by the year 2000.
But if demand eases, then the traditional boom-and-bust cycle of the semiconductor industry could return -- and turn some of the huge chip plants being built today into the white elephants of tomorrow. In short, the American semiconductor industry could be pursuing the wrong strategy.
Concerns about the future certainly color Wall Street's view of the chip makers, even Intel, whose microprocessors run 80 percent of the world's personal computers. Its domination of that lucrative market has made Intel a profit machine. Daniel Klesken, an analyst for Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco, expects that given its growth rate, Intel will have $11 billion in profits around the year 2000 -- more than any other American company, likely surpassing the current profit leaders like Ford, Exxon and General Motors.
But many investors are apparently skeptical that Intel can keep it up, and the stock market often reacts nervously to any bad news. Last week, for example, Intel shares dropped sharply when the company announced that a large customer was having trouble paying its bills. Intel did not name the company, but most industry analysts said it was Packard Bell Electronics Inc., a leading marketer of personal computers to home users. Later, Packard Bell, a privately held company, said it was not in financial trouble. Intel shares closed Friday at $61, down 3 percent for the week.
The episode illustrates Wall Street's skittishness about Intel because the company's high-profit franchise is so dependent on a single industry, personal computers. Anything that stalls the rapid growth of the PC industry would hit Intel hard. So investors are willing to pay only a modest 15 times current earnings for Intel shares.
DESPITE Wall Street's qualms, the resurgence of America's high-technology manufacturing capability is still a triumph -- and a turnaround with consequences well beyond the semiconductor industry. The worried analysts of the 1980's were correct in pointing out the crucial role of semiconductors as a basic building block of information technology, and the growing importance of that technology to the economy. For example, investment in information technology, which excludes software, now accounts for 52 percent of all business capital equipment spending, up from 31 percent a decade ago.
"In terms of size, growth and importance to our economic future, information technology is now clearly the basic industry of America," said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist of Morgan Stanley & Company.
There is no single cause that explains how the American semiconductor industry regained the lead in the 1990's, after seeing its share of the world market slide to 37 percent from 57 percent in the 1980's. A weaker dollar and the 1986 semiconductor trade agreement with Japan helped lift American sales. The recession of the early 1990's in Japan slowed down that nation's semiconductor makers. Finally, the demand for chips shifted from consumer electronics products, which Japan dominated, toward the fast-growing markets for personal computers and telecommunications equipment, in which American companies were strong.
Yet, by all accounts, much of the credit for the comeback belongs to the American companies. An instinct for corporate survival, recalls Steven Appleton, the chief executive of Micron Technology Inc., proved a powerful incentive for his company. Micron was, and is, a specialist in DRAM, or dynamic random access memory, semiconductors, the chips that serve as a PC's temporary memory, where data for current tasks are stored. The DRAM business was the market in which the Japanese producers were strongest. Unlike Intel, which dropped out of DRAM's to focus on high-end microprocessors, Micron had few options.
"We either kept making DRAM's and got competitive or went out of business," Mr. Appleton said.
Throughout the industry, and on every rung of the corporate ladder, manufacturing expertise was suddenly recognized as a valued asset. The 35-year-old Mr. Appleton, for example, started working for Micron on the factory floor in a clean room in Boise, Idaho, for $4.46 an hour. Craig R. Barrett, the chief operating officer of Intel, is a former associate professor of materials sciences at Stanford University. At Intel, he rose to the top as a manufacturing expert.
"In the mid-1980's," Mr. Barrett said, "the U.S. semiconductor industry got a big bucket of cold water thrown in its face. It became brutally apparent that all the smart technologists in the world would not make this industry a success. We had to get down and vastly improve our manufacturing efficiency."
After sojourns to Japan, studying chip making there firsthand, Mr. Barrett decided that Intel needed greater cooperation among its design, development and manufacturing teams. Specifically, the designers and developers of each new generation of chip must now shepherd their creation through the early stages of production.
One result: chip designs that are easier to produce. Mr. Barrett explains the benefits with a hiking analogy. "You put fewer stones in the backpack if you're the one who has to carry it," he said.
Today, the Intel factories also make extensive use of computer simulations to predict production problems before they occur. "The emphasis has really moved away from defect detection and toward defect prevention," noted David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School who is also a director of Intel.
Back at the plant in Rio Rancho, the 34-year-old Mr. Sohn, who is an M.I.T. graduate, marvels at how much chip manufacturing has changed since he joined Intel 12 years ago. He stands in one of the factory's control centers -- a bank of 20 personal computers monitored by a few technicians, who track production data, run simulations and order minute adjustments in the manufacturing process.
"In the old days, we used to do our best, wait at the end of the line and pray that things came out," Mr. Sohn recalled. "As you can see, we're worlds beyond that now."
If factory-floor practices have changed beyond recognition from the days when workers baked pizzas in the chip ovens, so has the composition of the work force. A decade ago, workers typically had high school diplomas and no specialized training. Today, two-year degrees from technical schools or electrical engineering degrees are the norm.
For the Rio Rancho factory, Intel recruits students from Albuquerque Technical-Vocational Institute and other nearby technical schools. Starting salaries for newly hired technicians are in the high $20,000's. Within three or four years, salaries can rise to $50,000 or more a year. In some cases, with overtime, pay can reach $90,000 for these skilled factory technicians. That kind of money buys a measure of affluence, especially in the Albuquerque area, where the average one-bedroom apartment rents for about $500 a month.
The more skilled work force and increased automation have helped to make the chip-producing process far more disciplined than it once was, said Mr. Marsing, the plant manager. The technicians work with 1,000 personal computers in the factory, searching for what Mr. Marsing calls "a plethora of small continuous improvements" intended to hasten production and improve chip yields.
THE manufacturing discipline extends beyond the Intel factories. Equipment suppliers vying for orders from Intel are subject to painstaking scrutiny. Producers of chip-etching machines or furnaces, for example, will be put through runoffs judged by Intel that last months. One equipment maker will be chosen to supply Intel factories worldwide, reducing the chances of variation from one factory to the next. Because chip making is so precise, any variation is anathema, potentially reducing yields.
Once selected, the supplier will be subject to even closer monitoring from Intel. It demands to know whether equipment makers want to use different subcontractors, even for screws and bolts, because any change could affect the manufacturing process slightly.
And unlike in the making of cars or airplanes, manufacturing technology in the chip industry changes almost with each generation of chip. Every two or three years, the level of miniaturization increases and production equipment changes, meaning that the plants' owners have to make their money back on all the equipment in that short span of time.
"What you have here is a frightening pace of change in manufacturing improvement," said Mr. Marsing. "At least, we certainly hope it's frightening to our competitors."
 
 
 
The Plants of Tomorrow
 Three semiconductor plants costing $1 billion or more are already up and running in this country, and 10 more have been announced. Nonetheless, the building boom has done little for investors lately. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, consisting of 16 chip makers, has fallen 17 percent since September, and some companies are down more than 40 percent.
 Investors may be anticipating a replay of the mid-1980's, when a sharp spike in manufacturing capacity led to a glut of chips and depressed stock prices.
But some industry insiders say the historical analogy is flawed. James C. Morgan, chairman of Applied Materials, the world's biggest supplier of chip-making machinery, called demand for memory chips in particular "almost insatiable."
His stock is only down about 22 percent from its midsummer highs. So investors either buy his argument or they feel that they have less downside betting on the company that is equipping many of the new plants. EDWARD WYATT

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH: SHERRY LANSING;
Under a Mattress Will Be Fine, Thanks

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
AN attractive, well-dressed man drives along a Beverly Hills street in a white Rolls-Royce, a glamorous blonde by his side. They see a tattered homeless woman sitting forlornly in the street, and the man seems to recognize her.
"You know her?" the blonde asks disdainfully. 
 "Just someone I used to know," he replies.
It's only a dream, but it is a recurring nightmare for Sherry Lansing, the 51-year-old chairman of Paramount Pictures. For in it she is the homeless woman, and the man in the Rolls is her ex-husband, a successful plastic surgeon from whom she has long been divorced.
Even today, having accumulated an ostrich-sized nest egg of tens of millions of dollars from producing hits like "Fatal Attraction," "Black Rain," "Indecent Proposal," "The Accused" and "School Ties," Ms. Lansing is still leery about her financial future.
Her film credits may reflect a passion for high-voltage drama, but when it comes to investing, the last thing she wants is a thriller.
Given Ms. Lansing's nightmares, that suits her just fine.
In fact, it would be hard to imagine a stodgier approach to managing money, short of putting cash under the mattress. She is a financial adviser's nightmare, as Michael Gordon, her business manager, would surely attest. "He was so embarrassed by my portfolio that he didn't want me to show it to anyone," Ms. Lansing recalled, giggling. "His sole purpose is to watch my T-bills and CD's," she said during a recent interview in New York.
By her own definition, Sherry Lansing is a control freak. She is compulsive about trying to return every telephone call within 24 hours, about reviewing every detail in every script. Indeed, her New York stopover was one leg of a trip to Thailand, where she was visiting the set of "Phantom," a coming release from Paramount, partly to make sure she knew what was going on during production.
She has nothing against investing; she just won't do it unless she knows all about what the money is being invested in, and she believes that is generally impossible. Film she knows. "If I take a risk with a film," she said, "I know every in and out."
 But outside the movie business, "I don't know enough," she said. "I worked hard for my money. The idea of turning it over to someone else to manage and putting my fate in their hands is inconceivable. I know my business, but I never thought I knew anyone else's business. And I am not a person who likes to abdicate control of my financial interests."
The only exception to her Treasury bills and CD's is a big wad of stock in Viacom Inc., the owner of Paramount, where she has been since 1992. "I want to sleep well at night," she said over breakfast at the St. Regis. Her Hollywood uniform hinted at both her success and her caution: a conservative brown Armani pants suit, with a black turtleneck and high heels. "I have enough money, and I don't want to worry about it."
 That may seem peculiar coming from Hollywood's most powerful female executive, a woman who not only understands every financial angle in the tangled business of movie making but has served on a variety of corporate boards, from Primerica's to Leslie Fay's.
"I know people think it's odd, but I think it is about the way we were raised," Ms. Lansing said.
"We were raised to get married and have at least two children," she continued. "But the thing I wanted most in life was to be independent." And to be that, "you have to be not only emotionally independent," she said, but "able to take care of yourself economically. In my mother's world, the man always took care of you."
 For Ms. Lansing, investing carries the perilous risk of losing the independence that a nest egg provides. As a result, she won't invest in companies when she doesn't have firsthand knowledge of them. Unless she has been a board member or worked for a company, she will not buy its stock. She would not buy, say, I.B.M. shares, because "they weren't going to invite me to an I.B.M. board meeting. So then I would be relying on things I had read or what people told me, rather than my own knowledge."
It is a disciplined strategy, but it can be expensive -- especially this year, when one could have thrown darts at the stock tables and made 30 percent. Of course, "there was a time when T-bills were 18 percent," she said, and she did well. Impeccable timing? Hardly. "I didn't know they were 18 percent. I don't have time to pay attention." She did serve on the board of Cetus and bought its stock, but that was a disappointment.
"Cetus did not get approval on Interleukin 2, a cancer drug. Because of that, the company was forced to be sold under pressure. My options were worthless," she recalled, though she said she had no regrets. "I believed in it. It was an intelligent, educated guess. I thought it was the greatest company in the world."
THOUGH Ms. Lansing is far from an avid stock buyer, she has made an exception with Viacom. Not only is she holding onto options that are valued at about $6.5 million, but she has bought Viacom stock on the open market. Though she refused to comment on these holdings, a close associate said that Ms. Lansing had not held onto options she received at Fox or at Paramount, before it was bought by Viacom, but that she believed strongly in Viacom's chairman, Sumner M. Redstone.
What made Ms. Lansing such a wary investor? No trial and error was involved. She set her course when she made her first killing in Hollywood, back in 1980, when she was already president of production at 20th Century Fox. When the investor Marvin Davis bought the company in 1981, "We had stock options and he bought everybody out in one fell swoop," Ms. Lansing recalled. She won't say how much she made, but associates put the figure at several million dollars. "I remember thinking, 'What should I do with it?' " Ms. Lansing recalled.
 Soon afterward, she was at dinner at Elaine's restaurant, a New York favorite for media moguls, with Mo Rothman, a veteran film executive who owned the rights to Charlie Chaplin's film library. Mr. Rothman, a gruff, outspoken man who has known Ms. Lansing for years, told her: "Why don't you pretend you've made half of it, because the rest is what you pass on in taxes. Put it in CD's and you will sleep very well at night, knowing your money is safe."
 At that time Mr. Davis, who had made a fortune in the oil business, "was putting lots of people into oil deals," Ms. Lansing said. But she ignored such high-flying ideas, instead following the advice of Mr. Rothman and other friends. It was a seminal decision, she said.
 In a telephone interview from London last week, Mr. Rothman recalled: "She has always been worried about money. She was a girl alone, a single girl. She didn't know if she would be fired or get another deal -- all the preoccupations that women are worried about when they are alone in the world."
Sherry Lansing's caution comes from her background as well as her experience. She spent her Chicago childhood ensconced in movie theaters, and once out of school she wanted to get into the movie business. She had no idea how, though, so instead she took a job teaching in the Watts area of Los Angeles.
During a brief stint as an actress in the soap opera "Loving," she started offering suggestions on the script to Ray Wagner, the producer. That led to a job reading scripts for him for $5 a hour. From there she worked for a talent agency. She moved on to MGM, where she ultimately became president for creative affairs, and to Columbia, where she was senior vice president for production.
BUT even as her salary soared, Ms. Lansing worried. "I had been in the business and I had watched the ups and downs," she said. "I had seen people who were big-salary people. They lived high on the hog, and they did not prepare for the future. And one day it stops for everybody. This is a very tough business, tough and cruel. When I was a reader and story editor, I watched what happened to people. I watched how cruel people were to them when they couldn't get jobs.
"I can give you 20 examples of people who did not prepare for the future, and then one day the salary stops, the hit movies stop. They lose everything, including their self-esteem."
For Ms. Lansing, money was freedom. "From the time I started making money at Fox -- I was 35 -- I always wanted to save to have enough so that I didn't have to worry," Ms. Lansing said. "If you ever need a job, you will always do the safe thing because you will be scared. The only way you can perform in a job is if you don't need it. Then you can make pure decisions that are not based on fear."
Her peace of mind would not come so easily if Ms. Lansing were a world-class spender for whom there was never enough money. But to hear Ms. Lansing's friends tell it, she's hardly that. When Stanley Jaffe, the man with whom she produced the hit "Fatal Attraction," asked whether she had spent much of what she had made from the movie, Mr. Jaffe laughed. "I don't think Sherry has spent the money she made when she graduated from college," he said. And Mr. Gordon added: "She has a greater sense of what she wants than most people. When I ask clients about risk tolerance, usually they talk out of both sides of their mouth." So when Mr. Gordon was raising money to open a restaurant in Hollywood, where a new one opens every 10 minutes, he didn't even ask Ms. Lansing to invest.
MS. LANSING'S family background clearly played a role. Her mother's affluent childhood in Nazi Germany ended when "she put on an armband and she and her family escaped with nothing," Ms. Lansing recalled. Ms. Lansing's father died when she was 9. Though she was close to her stepfather, who owned a successful furniture company in Chicago, her parents were "very conservative," Ms. Lansing recalled.
"My stepfather paid for everything with cash," she added. "There was a Depression-era mentality."
Indeed, when she bought her first home, she had to be talked out of paying for it in cash. But even a small mortgage didn't sit well. "I slept better after I paid it off," she said.
 Ms. Lansing recalled once bringing her stepfather to visit 20th Century Fox and showing him an executive's large corner office. "My father asked me if something was wrong. He figured that if the guy had such a big office, he was about to be fired," Ms. Lansing recalled. "In the Midwest it was so pretentious to have a big office that he figured the guy was doing it for show."
It made a big impression on her, she said, that as her stepfather's furniture company grew, "and they started knocking out walls so everyone had a big office, he continued to keep his desk on the floor near the salesmen."
Not only was her family conservative about money, they wanted their daughter to have a conservative life style. "They cut me off when I graduated from college," she said. "They thought it would build character."
Just after college, she got married to the aspiring plastic surgeon, and they drove to California. "My stepfather had this theory that if they gave me money I would be spoiled, wouldn't learn the value of hard work or have ambition. When I asked to borrow money, he said he would lend it to me, but he would charge me interest."
As she began to grow successful, though, her family changed their strategy, offering, after her divorce, to give her money if she would come back to Chicago, meet a nice guy and get married. She declined.
Even today, though she owns a home in Beverly Hills, "she doesn't own a condo in every city," Mr. Gordon said.
Friends say that when Ms. Lansing turned 50, she began to believe that she ought to be able to live it up more. After all, she had the money. Because Hollywood is hardly the home of low-key living, she wondered whether she had a problem about spending.
She even consulted a psychiatrist about becoming a chic shopper. He asked her what she liked to own and, presumably, was reassured when she told him she liked abstract art -- an expensive choice. He urged her to go out and buy something she liked so they could study her reaction.
 Ms. Lansing took herself to the Knoedler Gallery in New York. As one friend recalled it, "she zoomed through the gallery, said she wanted a particular painting by Helen Frankenthaler and bought it in 16 seconds. They had probably never seen anything like it."
 But Ms. Lansing soon discovered that she didn't care much about collecting expensive art. Looking at it in other people's homes was good enough. "All I could think was that the money would be better used if I gave it to charity," she said. Finally the therapist dismissed her. Regardless of whether she was normal by Hollywood standards, he concluded that she was happy nonetheless.
 To be sure, she does live well. "Don't get me wrong," she said. "I live in a house, not a garret. I'm not a bag lady. I am sitting in a beautiful hotel room. I have a beautiful suit on. Of course I like making money very much. But there is a limit to the things I think are worth buying. There is nothing that I want to buy that I don't have."
CLEARLY she has grappled with the inevitable question of whether people in the film industry ought to make so much. "I wanted to make money because I wanted to be successful," Ms. Lansing recalled. "I wanted people to see my movies, so I deserved the money that came from the movies."
Just as Ms. Lansing had to come to terms with her success, so did her parents. While she was working her way up the ladder in Hollywood, her mother was so unhappy about it that she didn't tell friends where her daughter was working until Ms. Lansing got the headline-catching job at 20th Century Fox.
Surely her family was also happy two years ago when, without even going back to Chicago, she found her second husband, the film director William Friedkin. His most recent credit is "Jade," but he built his reputation with films like "The Exorcist" and "The French Connection."
Ms. Lansing said she had already had an influence on her husband's spending habits, if not his approach to investing. They do have his-and-hers business managers and do not discuss specific investments with each other, but their disparate life styles are coming together.
 When they married, Mr. Friedkin had five homes: a house in Aspen, an apartment in New York, a house in Big Bear, Calif., one in Los Angeles and a second that he was building.
"I said, 'What do you need an apartment in New York for? That is the stupidest thing. I don't want to live in that apartment that you lived in with your other wives, and I don't want to do it over. Wouldn't you rather have the money? We can stay at the St. Regis or the Peninsula.' "
He bought the life style script. They now own just one house, the one in Beverly Hills, which they bought together. "He was the exact opposite of me," Ms. Lansing explained, but now, she says, he is coming around to her way of thinking.
 "Billy's attitude toward money is much different from mine. He is an artist. He takes no responsibility. Because he takes no interest in money, he spends it. If you tell him not to spend it, he doesn't."
Presumably, now they are both putting their money in the bank and sleeping well -- at whatever hotel around the world they choose to stay in.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
How to Get a Job, Even One That Suits Your Psyche

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
THE reason adults are always asking children what they want to be when they grow up, the comedian Paula Poundstone says, is that they're looking for ideas.
Of course, most of us don't have what it takes to become, say, a really great dentist-queen (to cite the dual-career plan of a 5-year-old I once knew). But in a survey conducted a few years ago, about 45 percent of American employees said they would change jobs if they could. 
 Soon they may have to: Economists tell us that with today's market shifts, college graduates can expect to work at 12 to 15 jobs in at least three different fields. (Those of us who have already done this out of sheer aimlessness can now pretend there was a method to our meanderings).
So how do we reconcile those childhood dreams with the demands of the labor market? The question looms as large as the Jobs & Careers section at my local bookstore, where shelf after shelf is jammed with guides on job searches, salaries and self-discovery. Here are a few that might help.
"The 1996 What Color Is Your Parachute?" by Richard Nelson Bolles (Paperback, Ten Speed Press, $14.95) has just swooped down, and this edition, like other "Parachutes," buoyantly and reliably covers lots of terrain.
The content of this perennial best seller hasn't changed much (the career-resource pages have been updated); it's an organized hodgepodge -- a cheerful collection of grids, diagrams, exercises, pep talks and statistics that somehow add up to a systematic approach to the world of work.
Mr. Bolles doesn't skimp on psychology. He writes plenty about self-fulfillment, the "rejection shock" that makes us hate job-hunting and the depression that is unemployment's frequent companion. This expansive, detailed book points the entrepreneurial toward entrepreneurship, explains the five best and five worst ways to hunt for a job, practically dresses you for an interview and even takes you inside the interviewer's mind (for six smart and funny pages). It's what the author promises in the subtitle: "a practical manual."
People who need a deeper dive into the psyche to locate their career desires may find what they are looking for in "I Could Do Anything If I Only Knew What It Was," by Barbara Sher with Barbara Smith (Dell Trade Paperback, $11.95). Despite the somewhat dopey self-help title, this book, which recently came out in paperback, offers a strategy for grappling with the demons of indecision and apathy.
There are two reasons that some of us shrug helplessly when we're asked what work we'd like, the author says: We have lots of choices, and we're pretty neurotic. So, using a kind of common-sense psychology, "I Could Do Anything" takes aim at the internal conflicts that bury our desires.
Without ignoring the economic realities of life, the book offers solid insights into what may be going on with people who would rather complain than make a career commitment, who feel glued to impressive jobs they hate, who always stop short of success, or who -- this is the big one -- are waiting to be rescued by someone else (the phone call that changes your life because finally someone has noticed what a talented person you are).
But readers aren't asked to navel-gaze. This is a workbook of conversations, essay exercises and games -- some corny, some creative. At the same time, the author gently reminds readers that not even the perfect job leads to perfect happiness all the time. The goal here is to get in touch with your inner dentist-queen and to muster the courage and maturity to find her some grown-up work she'll enjoy.
Finally, if your career obstacles are external ones, try "101 Great Answers to the Toughest Job Search Problems," by Ollie Stevenson (Career Press, $11.99). Its subtitle conveys its useful content: "What to do if you're too old, too young, too inexperienced, female, minority, physically challenged or otherwise blocked from landing the job you want."
Ms. Stevenson guides readers skillfully through their insecurities and gives good tips for navigating some of the narrow-minded, unspoken requirements of the job club. This includes creative responses to impertinent, discriminatory or illegal interview questions. And honest ways to de-emphasize dates of birth and other details that might prejudice some employers.
My only disagreement is with the book's emphasis on those "functional resumes" you see these days -- the ones that start with a "Summary" and "Selected Achievements" and relegate actual work histories to a footnote. But this is a quibble, maybe even old-fashioned resistance. (So much for de-emphasizing my own date of birth.) Here is an author who wants us to keep our integrity, but also get the job.
"The Road Ahead," by Bill Gates, with Nathan Myhrvold and Peter Rinearson (Viking, $29.95), has sped onto the best-seller list this month with, naturally, a CD-ROM version tucked inside for those who would rather interact with the electronic age than read about it.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Who Pays Capital Gains Taxes?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Investors are hoping that President Clinton and the Congress will agree to lower the capital gains tax rate. But many rich investors couldn't care less. They have found perfectly legal ways to take their profits without paying a nickel in capital gains taxes.
No one knows just how much money is saved through such tax strategies. But it almost certainly is huge and growing. In 1993, the last year for which figures were available, taxpayers reported less in capital gains than they had in 1985, when stock prices were far lower. Why? Chances are that there are not fewer gains being taken, just more taxes being avoided. 
 Congressional leaders will sit down with Administration officials this week to try to hammer out a tax and budget package. One thing that isn't on the table, but should be, is closing the capital gains loophole.
Here's how it works. Let's say you have $1 million of stock in a company, for which you paid next to nothing years ago. If you sell your shares, Uncle Sam will take 28 percent of your profits. But if you instead borrow an equivalent number of shares, and sell them, the tax law figures you still own the original shares, so no tax is due. Your broker will be happy to "lend" you almost all the money you got, for a fee of 1 or 2 percent a year, letting you invest in other stocks or just spend the money.
That vigorish for Wall Street adds up to a lot of money, especially considering the brokerage firm has no risk at all, just an income stream. "In return for not paying taxes, you pay an annual toll fee," says an investment banker who has made plenty by arranging such deals. "It is a categorical abuse." He laughed at the idea he might want to say that publicly, explaining he didn't want to lose all his friends.
It used to be that such tricks were used mainly to postpone taxes on a sale late in one year until the next. That still is what small investors do. But big ones, who can afford the fees, sometimes keep the offsetting positions until death, when capital gains taxes no longer matter. That is a major reason that published figures for the number of shares sold short keep soaring.
When the Estee Lauder Companies went public, both Estee and her son Ron sold a lot of stock. But not their own shares. They "borrowed" shares from other family members, and will evidently claim that they no owe no tax. Similarly, the William Dart family made a brilliant move by buying a large stake in Salomon Inc., the brokerage firm, when it was mired in the Treasury bond scandal, and then selling last year as the shares peaked. But they used the shorting trick, and so delayed paying taxes on their huge gain. Others have accomplished much the same thing with equity swaps, which differ in details.
This raises issues beyond the tax code. Swaps in particular are often designed so that corporate insiders keep the voting power even after they get rid of the economic risks and benefits of owning stock. In a tight fight for corporate control, a boss might keep his job using votes from shares in which he no longer has an economic stake.
None of this is a secret on Wall Street. Bankers Trust ran an ad last year urging you to call them "if your stock is worth at least $2 million" and you'd like to get out without paying taxes. But it has not alarmed Washington even as some say it is unfair to cut the capital gains tax rate. Wouldn't it be fairer to give smaller investors a break while making sure those customers of Bankers Trust also pay their share?

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
The Political Dance of Calvin Butts

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
BACK in October, when most of New York was turning its back on President Fidel Castro during the United Nations' 50th anniversary festivities, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d opened the doors of his Abyssinian Baptist Church to the Cuban revolutionary, giving him a rare platform and an enthusiastic audience of 1,300 people.
But perhaps far more revealing of the minister's political leanings was a moment a few months before, when the church's economic arm, the Abyssinian Development Corporation, hosted a "Day of Commitment" to generate corporate funds for Harlem. The guest list read like that of a Republican fund-raiser: Gov. George E. Pataki; Mayor Giuliani; the Economic Development Commissioner, Charles A. Gargano, Time Warner's president, Richard Parsons. 
 Harlem has come to expect such political unpredictability from Mr. Butts, and he has been criticized in the past, even by some of his own congregants, for endorsing Ross Perot in 1992 and inviting Mr. Pataki to speak at his church during the last gubernatorial election.
But these days, the criticism, at least the public kind, is notably muted. In fact, with the community hungry for economic development and Republicans ensconced in City Hall and Albany, even some of Harlem's most vocal Democrats are adopting a similar flexibility.
"I don't care if it's Republican money or Democratic money, as long as it rebuilds our community," said Councilman Adam Clayton Powell 4th.
Few believe that Mr. Butts's spirit of cooperation portends a black exodus from the Democrats. But, in Harlem, the first black community in the nation to break the Republican stranglehold over the black vote earlier in the century, there is growing talk of a new pragmatism, a byproduct of the defeat of Mayor David N. Dinkins, disappointment with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and a sense of urgency about Harlem's economy.
"The key word is independent thinking," said J. Phillip Thompson, a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation. "That's what I think you're beginning to see -- not a shift to Republicanism, but a critical eye toward both parties."
Mr. Butts's flexibility has paid off. Governor Pataki recently appointed him to two influential state development boards: the Empire State Development Corporation, formerly the Urban Development Corporation, and the New York State Science and Technology Foundation. Both boards control loans and grants to businesses.
Sensing that economic hard times may have created a chink in Harlem's political armor, the Republicans are moving to offer alternatives. The recently reconfigured Harlem Urban Development Corporation, once run by Harlem old-timers like Donald J. Coggsville, is now called the Harlem Community Development Corporation, and is dominated by Pataki appointees.
Like Representative Floyd H. Flake, a Democrat who has leveraged his political power with Republicans to gain economic clout for his church in Southeast Queens, Mr. Butts has a stake in the economic development of Harlem. His church's development corporation was incorporated in 1989 to build affordable housing, improve the delivery of social services and stimulate the local economy. Among its projects are the controversial Pathmark in East Harlem and rental apartment units like the Hattie Dodson Houses.
Heretical as it may sound, coming from a Democrat who has championed the concerns of the poor, Mr. Butts argues that promoting economic growth is more important than preserving social services.
"I think the Republicans are in an excellent position to make the argument and demonstrate that you can do as much through economic development as you can through social welfare programs -- in fact more," he said. "Because you break a dependency cycle, you increase responsibility, people have a greater sense of ownership and you create jobs."
Mr. Butts says he is also prepared to see the Republicans succeed where Democrats have failed, and suspects they may earn some converts in the process. "I think that the Republicans have an opportunity to make tremendous headway," he said. "All the Republicans have to do is get something done and you know what? I think they will."
Nevertheless, working closely with the Republicans makes some ill at ease. "Am I unnerved? Yes, absolutely, because this is going to be a departure from tradition," said State Senator David A. Paterson. "But the reason I'm anxious to work with them is because I need Pataki to succeed. I need Giuliani to succeed. Our communities can't take much more disaffection."
Representative Charles B. Rangel, too, says the moment calls for putting common economic goals ahead of political differences and that his main concern is the Empowerment Zone, in which the city, state and Federal governments have each pledged $100 million to Harlem and the South Bronx. "You might ask, 'Aren't they the same forces that crippled your community, closed the hospitals, cut the schools?' " he said. "I am talking about getting development into Harlem. How can I not work with them?"
To some extent, Democrats have no choice but to work with the Republican leadership. But some say such teamwork strengthens the hand of a party whose larger ideological agenda can offset any incremental economic benefits to the community.
"You're talking about people who want to cut social services that people of color need," said Assemblyman Keith L. Wright of Harlem. "There is no getting around the horrific and tyrannical policies of the Republican Party.".
But Mr. Butts, who says he is considering running for mayor, insists that protest and collaboration are not incompatible. "We're still as outspoken as ever," he said. "But I think it's good not to make people angry, because you never know who you will have to pick up the phone and call."
 
IN HIS OWN WORDS
 
The Quotable Butts
 
ON BLACKS AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY: "I hope it will set a fire under the electorate to begin to think more clearly about what they're getting for their 'loyalty.' We've been so loyal to Democrats, what are we getting for it?"
 
ON SENATOR ALFONSE M. D'AMATO: "Do I agree with Aflonse D'Amato? Absolutely not. He said some things that absolutely infuriated me. But when it came time to saving some people's money at Freedom Bank, Alfonse D'Amato did it."
 
ON HIS OWN ACTIVISM: "There is room for the uncompromising, belligerent, nasty, guerilla activist. But you change when you are responsible for an institution. I got folks I got to pay. I got families."

HEADLINE: Defending Harlem: Residents Weigh In

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As an African-American who has lived in Harlem for 10 years (I moved to New York from Ohio to attend business school at Columbia University), I read Lisa Anderson's report of her year in Harlem with interest, dismay and anger ("Harlem on Her Mind," Nov. 19). Not until the last three paragraphs of a page-and-a-half story does she concede that some of her negative reactions could be due to herself rather than the community. 
 In Harlem I have found a church where I have been welcomed, an apartment at a reasonable price, a job I can walk to from home and friends I am anxious to return to when I am away.
I work in the field of community development, and therefore I am as familiar as anyone with the problems of poverty, unemployment and drugs that face Harlem. But there are people who have moved in, or never left, who are living their lives in a community where they feel comfortable while trying to make positive contributions toward improving it.

Monday
 
The Indian state government of Maharashtra is expected to make its final decision on whether to let the Enron Corporation build a much-disputed multibillion power plant. An approval is probable, but not certain.
 
Tuesday
 
A House subcommittee on financial institutions is to hold another hearing on Daiwa Bank. The chairmen of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are to testify, along with the Comptroller of the Currency.
 
Ford will release its sales for November. Chrysler had a strong month, but General Motors' sales fell. Both reported on Friday.
 
Wednesday
 
Three important reports come out on the economy in October, with a mixed view expected. The index of leading indicators fell three-tenths of 1 percent, according to a consensus estimate, after falling one-tenth of a point in September. Construction spending was expected to have risen six-tenths of a point, for its fifth straight rise. Spending was up 1.2 percent in September. And factory orders were probably flat for the month, after rising 1.5 percent.
 
Thursday
 
The Fed will report consumer credit for October. Consumers added an estimated $6.3 billion to their debt, after piling on $5.4 billion in September.
 
Venezuelan oil workers, who have been threatening a strike in a pay dispute, could begin their walkout today. It would affect oil deliveries to the United States, and a shortage could drive up prices.
 
Friday
 
The Labor Department will report November employment figures. The overall jobless rate is expected to edge up one-tenth of a point, to 5.6 percent. But the number of nonfarm jobs created in the month is expected to rise by 192,000, after gaining 116,000 during October.

HEADLINE: Bridgeport's Dog Track: Other Views

 BODY:
In the article "A Dog Track to Help Revive Bridgeport," Shoreline Star manager James F. Gartland asserts that the "activists are disseminating information from 20 years ago" and that accusations of mistreatment of greyhounds are "not accurate now."
The dog racing industry stands to gain the most from a public kept ignorant of the issues. We continue to support the belief that it is in the public's best interest to know the facts.
The facts include very real, very recent documented cases of abuse and neglect compiled by the Greyhound Protection League since the group's inception in the late 1980's.
The greyhound racing industry contributes to this carnage because it fosters overbreeding at greyhound farms in an attempt to produce the next champion.
Julia Barnes, a member of the greyhound racing industry herself and the author of "The Complete Book of Greyhounds" (Howell Books, 1994) states that 30,000 to 40,000 greyhounds a year are destroyed. The industry does not make "every effort to find these dogs homes."
The dogs that are not profitable make up these huge numbers. Unprofitable greyhounds include those not fast enough to win money, dogs with a low chase drive or dogs who have raced (average racing career length: 2.5 years, tops) and are now retired at the ripe old age of 4.
Every greyhound one day will eventually fall into at least one of these categories. Though they make wonderful pets, only 13,000 to 15,000 greyhounds a year are able to find homes in an increasingly saturated adoption market. The overbreeding cycle continues year after year.
The public has a right to judge for itself. Is it acceptable in this day and age that tens of thousands of greyhounds die every year for amusement? If gambling is Bridgeport's only perceived economic strategy for growth then let it be in a more humane form.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Outsiders Gone, Cambodia Unravels

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia

 BODY:
THE offices of a struggling independent newspaper are ransacked by ax-wielding villagers, and the Prime Minister applauds. A new opposition party is declared illegal before it is formally launched. Grenades explode at the office of an independent-minded senior politician, and in the courtyard of a Buddhist temple that has been sheltering his supporters.
This is newly democratic Cambodia. 
 Barely alive after decades of civil war, genocide and foreign occupation, Cambodia is inching toward the precipice again. But this time, the stakes are not limited to the future of this land alone. The reputation and judgment of the United Nations will also be on the line if the world's good intentions come to grief again in a small place where old habits and hatreds are stronger than new constitutions adopted to foster peace, and where the world intervened with its alarm clock already set to the moment when it would withdraw.
So Cambodia's experience offers a cautionary tale about the setting of clockwork deadlines by outsiders for the achievement of their good intentions -- a tale worth considering as NATO ventures onto the ground in Bosnia, on the basis of President Clinton's prediction that a year's time will be enough before the 20,000 truce-monitoring G.I.'s can be brought home.
It seems particularly worth studying as another deadline approaches -- for the departure of United Nations peacekeepers from Haiti in February, amid ominous signs that home-grown distrust, poverty and demagogy in that country may yet overwhelm the calm instilled little more than a year ago with the arrival of another expedition of 20,000 American troops.
In Cambodia, the deadline came two years ago, when the United Nations Transitional Authority wound up the most ambitious and costly (at about $3 billion) experiment in rebuilding a nation ever attempted by the organization.
The two-year operation was certainly no failure -- it had forestalled a threatened political resurgence of the murderous Khmer Rouge -- and it was hailed as a model for other collapsed countries.
More than 360,000 refugees were returned to their homeland, thousands of development experts and peacekeepers descended from all corners of the world, and Cambodians got a crash course in civics and held a national election in 1993, as had been promised by the U.N. operation's viceroy, Yasushi Akashi.
But, like President Clinton in Bosnia, Mr. Akashi was working under a deadline, and when the peacekeepers went home, it was not by any means the end of the story. Today, there are still more than two years to go before the next national election, the first to be run by Cambodians. And politicians are already engaged in a high-stakes struggle for power to which lives and reputations are being sacrificed.
Political thuggery is on the rise and a precarious economy is swamped in corruption; the economy, in fact, is expanding more on laundered money -- including cash from a flourishing narcotics trade -- than on aboveboard investment. Cambodians and foreign security officers say that drunken soldiers from an undisciplined, underpaid army cause much more violence in the countryside than the remnant bands of Khmer Rouge that are still on the loose.
The situation is such that last week, the Associated Press reported, King Norodom Sihanouk wrote in a letter to a British journalist: "I am very sad that I cannot save either democracy or the monarchy in my country."
Where did the United Nations falter, if the fault lies there? What can the organization, which still maintains a large presence here through its agencies, do now? How long should it be responsible for this country's fate?
Part of the problem was intractable from the start: Cambodia is in a bad neighborhood for democracy, standing almost alone in Southeast Asia as a near-democratic state. One-party dominance is more the rule than the exception in the region, and corrupt business practices and venal politicians are the norm.
But other problems might have been foreseen. For example, the United Nations saw fit not to take over and reform key ministries; instead, it left in place a civil service, police and military dominated by a former Marxist regime with no history of political pluralism, no understanding of judicial independence and no concept of civic administration beyond party rule. Given the time constraints of the deadline for withdrawal, which was set to follow the 1993 election, this seemed reasonable at the time.
But one result is that Cambodia remains largely administered by the often corrupt and autocratic cadres of the Cambodian People's Party, led by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge official who had led the pre-agreement Government installed by the Vietnamese Army. It was Mr. Hun Sen's loyal gang that attacked the newspaper, New Liberty News.
Mr. Hun Sen's party did not win the 1993 election. It was edged out by the royalists, whose Prince Norodom Ranariddh is First Prime Minister and Mr. Hun Sen's senior partner in a coalition. But the large constituency of the popular royalist party is not represented fairly in the administration or the courts. Its secretary general, Prince Norodom Sirivudh, half-brother of King Sihanouk and a former foreign minister, was arrested two weeks ago and accused of plotting to kill Mr. Hun Sen. The arrest was political, Prince Sirivudh said, and diplomats and Amnesty International were quick to agree.
For opposition leaders -- Son Sann, whose Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party was attacked with grenades, and Sam Rainsy, a former finance minister sick of corruption who formed the new Khmer Nation party -- the road to the polls looks hazardous indeed in such an atmosphere. And so, hopes for a true multiparty election in two years are dying.
 
More Cards to Play
 The United Nations still holds a few important cards, and how these are played will be instructive. After the Transitional Authority withdrew in 1993, the United Nations Center for Human Rights in Cambodia was opened in Phnom Penh, with the task of training local officials and compiling reports. "We're not here just because we want to be," said Daniel Premont, the center's director, just after releasing a tough report in November to which the Government took exception. "Cambodia has been absent from the international community for 20 years, and they didn't realize that they needed training on how to abide by their international obligations and meet international standards."
At the province level, the center works with local groups to stiffen the resolve of weak magistrates and judges in the face of police terror. The United Nations, which has learned the importance of involving traditional authority in democratization, also applauds the support the democratic process has had at crucial moments from 73-year-old King Sihanouk, who reclaimed his throne in 1993. At the grassroots level, the center tries to reach out to Cambodia's influential monks, to build understanding of universal rights and to counter criticism that the United Nations is inflicting Western ideas on Asians.
A number of Cambodians say the United Nations may have to defend the center more vigorously and publicly to save it. And many of these advocates of democracy want the U.N. to return in force to run the next election.
All of this has ominous echoes for any certainty that a year from now, Bosnia will be able to stand tranquilly on its own.
Cambodia and Bosnia are very different places, and a polyglot United Nations force has far less power to accomplish its mission in a short time than does a heavily armed NATO force in its own backyard. But in both cases (if for different reasons) the idea of restarting national life according to a fixed schedule has become an end in itself. And in both situations, there has been much fuzziness about how sketchily-drawn political institutions are to operate once the troops withdraw.
Chea Sokha, who became a liaison at a Western embassy after surviving the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror, fleeing the Vietnamese occupation and spending eight years in a refugee camp in Thailand, sums up Cambodia's experience this way: "The United Nations planted the seeds of democracy. But someone has to be here to fertilize and care for it. Cambodian democracy is still a very fragile thing."

HEADLINE: COMPASSION PLAY;
Less Is More: Faith and Facts in Welfare Reform

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE liberals' War on Poverty has been an unmitigated disaster. While the Government has thrown trillions of dollars at the problem, the misery has only grown. The cities are filled with 14-year-old mothers and 30-year-old grandmothers and 45-year-old drug addicts who never held a job. Never have so many suffered so much at the hands of "compassionate" government.
These are the arguments that Republicans are using to drive American social policy toward a historic U-turn. As the House of Representatives voted this fall for unprecedented cuts in the antipoverty budget, its ebullient members claimed the mantle of compassion. "Today, what we have shown is that we are a caring country," said Christopher Shays of Connecticut. "Instead of giving the food, we are going to help people learn to grow the food." 
 Cuts are compassionate; less is more. "We committed to reform welfare because what we are doing to the poor in America is destructive and immoral," House Speaker Newt Gingrich said last week, in railing at what he calls "30 years of absolute failure in Washington." In other words: Things couldn't possibly get worse.
Or could they?
It's true that for two decades the fight against poverty has, at best, looked like a draw, its successes forgotten and its failures on painful display. From housing to Head Start, programs have stagnated, bureaucracies have ossified, and new ideas seem scarce. Liberalism has courted its own loss of credibility, and no program is more discredited than Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the nation's main cash welfare program.
It's also true that the Republican plan to abolish A.F.D.C. rests on a huge -- and risky -- leap of faith. The plan heading for President Clinton's desk would turn over welfare to the states, with less money and strict time limits on benefits. (Most people could receive no more than five years of aid throughout their lives, and most states would probably set limits much lower.) Those changes would be accompanied by significant reductions in food stamps, Medicaid, housing and disability programs.
 
Early Evidence
 While the Republicans promise that the poor will prosper, the evidence does not. Indeed, most suggests the opposite: whether the economy or poor people are ultimately to blame, most will fail to replace their lost benefits. If the past is a guide, less will not mean more. Less will mean less, for those who already have little.
Consider the closest thing the country has to a test case. In 1991, Michigan abruptly cut off aid to 80,000 adults. Gov. John Engler argued that the move would motivate them to find work. But two years later, only 20 percent had steady jobs, according to researchers at the University of Michigan, while another 17 percent had found informal work like raking leaves.
If the bulk of the others skirted catastrophe, that was mostly by turning to other government programs. Some people did advance, says Sandra K. Danziger, the study's lead author. But half lost their health insurance, many doubled up, and "most were worse off two years after welfare ended."
 
Expensive Repairs
 No one likes the current system, which insults taxpayers and poor people alike. But most of the evidence suggests that fixing it for the long term requires more money -- to subsidize jobs and provide child care to those required to take them. The House Republicans' proposals of just a year ago recognized as much, proposing to spend an extra $10 billion to put recipients to work. Then budget-cutting fever took hold, and with it the idea for the largest reduction of public aid in American history.
What follows are four tenets of the abolitionists' faith, and some relevant findings:
The programs don't help much anyway.
From afar it often seems that way. No one on welfare is prospering. But the system, flawed and reviled as it is, may confer unrecognized benefits. Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at Rutgers University, tried to gauge them through extensive interviews with women in high- and low-benefit states.
Women in low-benefit states were nearly twice as likely to become homeless, lose their utilities, go without food or experience one of seven other hardship conditions. "The way the political discourse is being spun, we're forgetting that if you lower benefits, children could go without food," she said.
International comparisons yield similar conclusions. Europe and Canada offer higher payments to low-income families, and they have markedly lower levels of poverty.
But the poor will be better off by working.
Or will they? No one knows how many of the five million women on A.F.D.C. will be able to find and keep work. Many have few skills and lead the kinds of chaotic lives that interfere with full-time work: sick kids, dangerous neighborhoods, abusive boyfriends, broken cars.
Federal law would allow states to exempt 15 percent of the caseload from the five-year limit. Will that be enough?
Last summer, the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation of New York released figures on the most successful welfare-to-work program to date. The program, run in Atlanta, Grand Rapids, Mich., and Riverside, Calif., forced recipients to look for jobs. Two years later their earnings had risen 26 percent -- but to a level still alarmingly low: an average of $285 a month.
That figure includes those not working at all -- more than half of those in the program. Assume a best case: without welfare to fall back on, many more women do find work. How will they fare? Ms. Edin's work is again instructive.
In addition to the welfare recipients, she studied comparable mothers laboring away as cashiers and clerks. Most expressed the psychic satisfactions of making it on their own. But while their incomes went up, so did expenses for child care and transportation. In the end, many had even less than their welfare counterparts. To Ms. Edin's surprise, the working mothers were 45 percent more likely than those on welfare to experience one of her listed hardships.
 
A 6-Cent Raise
 But earnings will improve with time.
So burger flipping doesn't pay. But stay on the job, gain some experience, and a supervisor's job awaits. Or does it? Again, the evidence is not conclusive, but it is discouraging. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, tracked a group of welfare recipients from 1979 to 1990. Their wages rose each year by about six cents an hour, or a little less than one percent, after accounting for inflation.
Not all had stayed on the job continuously -- no such study exists -- but Mr. Burtless says the figures show that most unskilled laborers can expect their earnings to rise "very, very slowly."
Rebecca Blank, an economist at Northwestern University, notes that welfare recipients are sailing into a headwind, since wages of low-skilled workers have been falling for nearly two decades. If anything, competition among millions of former recipients may depress wages further. "There's little evidence that women with few skills can expect to see big wage increases, even if they stay in the labor market long term," Ms. Blank said.
We're really after the next generation.
O.K., adults on welfare may be too far gone, but eliminating welfare will push kids to stay in school, avoid pregnancy, marry and work. Here is where hope is highest -- and evidence on all sides is thinnest.
Maybe the poor will show new depths of resolve, as most Americans have through two centuries of boom, bust, war and peace. Or maybe, lacking welfare, they'll turn to panhandling, drug sales, child neglect or prostitution. No one really knows.
But one way to look at ending welfare is this: it proposes to make the cost of failing so severe that the poor will have no choice but to shape up. It's the social policy equivalent of a gun to the head, and for some, it may just work. But if misery alone were motive enough, wouldn't the failures of the past -- the legacy of neediness and despair that the Republicans rightly criticize -- already have done the trick?

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
In Cuba, a Tax On Capitalism

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
IT was Jan. 1, 1959, when Fidel Castro seized power and initiated Cuba's transformation into a Marxist-Leninist state. But when the 37th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution rolls around next month, it will be accompanied by the restoration of a staple of capitalism -- the personal income tax.
In an official statement of this officially classless nation, the Ministry of Finance and Prices said last week that the tax would "permit a just redistribution of income to finance social programs that benefit all the population, with a greater contribution from those who have a superior economic capability." 
 In blunter terms, the Government is going after newly affluent Cubans who earn money in dollars and other foreign currency, and recognizing that Cuban society is increasingly divided between those who have access to dollars and those who don't.
 
The Greenback Gap
 Until 1993, it was not legal for Cubans to possess, much less earn salaries in, dollars. Now, as part of Mr. Castro's reluctant embrace of some market policies to arrest the decline in living standards that followed the Soviet bloc's collapse, several hundred thousand Cubans do. They range from hotel and restaurant employees in the flourishing tourist sector -- who are prosperous by Cuban standards -- to workers in industries like mining and sugar who receive small hard-currency bonuses on top of peso salaries that amount to as little as $5 a month.
This summer, the Government also made it legal to open small privately run restaurants, known as paladares, that do business in dollars. It sometimes seems that new paladares open daily on every block in Havana, so eager are Cubans to go into business for themselves.
Since the new income tax does not apply to peso salaries, it is likely to affect few Cubans, at least at first. Those who earn up to $2,400 a year in foreign currency will pay 10 percent of their salaries, with the rate rising to 50 percent for the tiny number who earn more than $60,000.
Significantly, the decree does not apply to the dollars sent to Cubans by relatives abroad. Those remittances, most from the United States, are estimated at more than $400 million a year and have become a key support of Cuba's economy. By some calculations, 40 percent of families in Havana and 20 percent in the provinces receive some support from family members overseas.
Cubans, who have not paid income taxes since the truly unequal pre-1959 days, join Russians and Poles, Czechs and Slovaks and other citizens of newly capitalist countries who are now paying income taxes. Even China has adopted an income tax, aimed at the rapidly commercializing coastal areas.
With Mr. Castro traveling this week in China, which has increasingly become Cuba's model of how to open an economy without ceding political control, a search for additional sources of revenue can be expected. The Finance Ministry plans to tax rental income, and a new graduated system of taxes for Cuba's 200,000 self-employed, who now pay a fixed monthly quota regardless of what they make, is in the offing.
Enforcement may prove more complicated, however. The legislation permitting taxation of foreign currency earnings was passed during the summer of 1994, providing ample time for those Cubans fortunate enough to be earning dollars to figure out ways to evade taxes.
"Sure, they can withhold money off the top from the poor suckers who work in the hotels or restaurants," said an architect who earns more in one evening as an unauthorized taxicab driver than he does in an entire month at his official job. "But that's no reason for me to declare every last cent."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Consult Polls. Choose Phrase. Repeat.

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT was sometime in late summer that President Clinton began talking almost incessantly about values.
"We have to think anew about what our basic values are, what kind of people we are," he told an elderly audience in Miami during a cross-country swing in September. 
 Since then there's hardly been a speech by the President that doesn't in some way incorporate the V-word. In one oratorical flight last week, in the very same address, Mr. Clinton said, "I hope we can balance the budget in a way that is true to our fundamental values," and later added, "Peace in Bosnia is important to America, to both our values and our interests."
Yesterday in Germany, he repeated the refrain, telling American troops, "It is in our nation's interest and consistent with our values to see that this peace endures."
Mr. Clinton, of course, is hardly the first person in politics to discover that the word "values" resonates in a Pavlovian way with the American public, causing the same kinds of good feelings as words like patriotism or family.
The Republicans, after all, have been talking about family values for years. When Senator Bob Dole proposed several months ago that English be made the nation's official language, he said, "Language, history and values: these are the strings that bind our hearts to America."
And Ben Wattenberg, the neoconservative author, has just written a book called "Values Matter Most."
But why does Washington sound like an echo chamber? In part, it's because there are now scores of consultants in both parties who test market concepts, mood, and even individual words through polls and focus groups. But it is also because through all these mounds of research Democrats have found that Republicans, who first began talking about values, are onto something. Maybe it's really not the economy, stupid.
It is generally agreed among political professionals that Michael Dukakis lost the Presidential race in 1988 by talking determinedly about programs and policy while George Bush's campaign kept hammering away at the idea that Mr. Dukakis was out of step with American values.
Since then, both parties have found that the public's preoccupation with values, its feeling that something has gone morally wrong in society, has only deepened.
"Something we've seen over many years is that values, the decline of values, is one of the core concerns of the American public," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic political consultant who works for the Democratic leadership in Congress. "There's no question about that. And we Democrats have been at the short end of that stick. We've been unwilling to talk about values and left the playing field to the Republicans."
The longing for a simpler time of old-fashioned values is so pervasive that pollsters say people will respond more positively to complex issues like health care policy or the containment of Medicare spending if they are presented as fundamental questions of values rather than simply as matters of public policy.
"When we talk about education, we make the argument stronger when we talk about the value we put on education," Mr. Mellman said.
Mr. Clinton in 1992 was one of the first Democrats to tread squarely onto Republican turf and start speaking about values, setting out the theme that he would provide a "New Covenant" between Government and its citizens.
 
It Started in '94
 The President's aides say he started refocusing heavily on values and the need to have a Democratic values agenda in the wake of the Republican sweep of the 1994 Congressional elections.
But he didn't immediately start using the word "values" as his core rhetorical device. Instead, Mr. Clinton tried to tap into the public dismay at partisanship and political gridlock that has given rise to the third-party movement.
His phrase of choice from spring through summer was "common ground," with its connotation of centrism, togetherness and community. So when discussing the budget fight with Congress, he said, "I have shown we can't balance the budget without retreating from our common ground on education, health care, on the environment."
Of religion in the schools, Mr. Clinton said, "The First Amendment keeps us all on common ground." Republican proposals to slow the growth in Medicare were to be condemned because they "will break up America's common ground."
To make the contrast between himself and the Republicans, he also took care to brand them as far outside the mainstream. The Republican budget "is too extreme" he said, and of Republican positions on abortion, "This seems to be to be extreme."
The phrase common ground still shows up occasionally in Mr. Clinton's speeches but it stopped striking quite the right tone after Labor Day when the White House began an all-out public campaign against the Republican budget priorities.
And so Mr. Clinton switched to values, and to what amounted to a linguistic war to define the values at work in the budget debate. Americans might think that balancing the budget represents an important value. But the White House wanted them to think that "honoring our obligations to our citizens through Medicare and Medicaid" is also an important value.
Republicans simply dismiss the possibility that Mr. Clinton, who has been haunted by questions of marital infidelity and the impression that he changes positions along with the polls, will really be able to make much headway by talking about values.
 
'A Difficult Sale'
 "President Clinton is a curious choice to address problems with morality," said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who is working for former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican Presidential candidate. "I think it will be a difficult sale for him to make."
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the dean of the Annenberg School for Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, calls values "the cliche of the discourse of the 1996 campaign" and thinks the word has already lost potency.
"When a phrase becomes a common place of political discourse," she said, "it loses its ability to convey meaning. It runs the risk that Kleenex runs when it becomes the generic word for tissues."

HEADLINE: Welcome Mat Is Wearing Thin for G.I.'s in Asia

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Half a century after American troops waded ashore on Japan and liberated Korea, a growing number of people are suggesting that it is time they left.
There appears to be the beginning of a broad debate about whether the United States still needs nearly 100,000 troops based in Japan and South Korea. 
 It is not that college students are marching about chanting "Yankee imperialists go home," as they did in the 1960's. Rather, people are simply asking aloud who the enemy is in the post-cold-war world. And they are chafing at the crimes by American soldiers, the cost of their presence, even the noise of the fighter jets zooming overhead.
Some Japanese, Koreans and Americans alike worry that a far-reaching dynamic is under way that may lead to a dramatic reduction in the United States troop presence in Asia. They fear that this would be a disaster for the region, setting off an arms race and major new wars that might ultimately involve the United States.
The starting point for a growing number of Japanese and South Koreans is that in security relations the United States has too good a deal.
"We've been yes-men, a yes-country," said Lee Chul, a member of the opposition in the National Assembly in South Korea. "It's about time that the U.S. listened to the voices of the South Korean Government and the South Korean people."
In Japan, the irritations were evident in a recent magazine headline that said the recent rape of an Okinawa schoolgirl, in which three American servicemen were charged, proved "Japan Is Still a Colony." The magazine added that "in the face of such humiliation" Japan should not increase its payments for the American troop presence.
American critics of the bases agree that security relations are unfair, but in a different way. They protest that it is unjust that the United States not only provides troops who risk their lives for Japan and South Korea, but also pays tens of billions of dollars for the privilege.
To be sure, most Japanese, South Korean and American officials alike want to keep a presence by American troops. The United States now has 37,000 troops in South Korea and nearly 47,000 in Japan, plus 13,000 sailors whose home port is in Japan.
"The importance to East Asia, to the Asia-Pacific region, and to the entire world of a continued U.S. presence here, and the continuation of the strong security relationship between the United States and Japan, can scarcely be overstated," Vice President Al Gore said during a visit to Japan last month.
Yet a growing self-confidence and nationalism in Asia are leading to demands that the United States adjust its presence in ways that it may find difficult to accept. Some South Koreans are demanding that American military personnel pay Korean taxes. Americans, however, have trouble understanding why they should send their soldiers to Korea, pay most of the bill and then pay again in the form of taxes.
 
Lessons of Manila Haunt Seoul and Tokyo
 In the back of everyone's mind is the memory of what happened in the Philippines a few years ago.
The United States wanted to keep Subic Naval Base and Clark Air Field. But negotiations between the United States and the Philippines broke into bickering over minor matters, and rising nationalism led to a vote in the Philippines' Senate to evict the American bases. So in 1992, the United States closed Subic and Clark.
Very few people expect that to happen in Japan or South Korea, but many will not rule out the possibility either.
"There is a trend, both within Japan and in the United States, with the end of the cold war, with budget cutbacks, with a younger generation of Americans and Japanese, that the necessity of having 47,000 troops stationed in Japan is seeming less and less viable in both countries," said Glen S. Fukushima, a former American trade official who is now a business executive in Tokyo.
Mr. Fukushima said that the most likely scenario is that public support will decline but that elites in both countries will continue to support the Japanese-American security alliance and that most American troops will remain in Japan.
Concerns about criticism of the American bases was one of the reasons that President Clinton planned a state visit to Japan -- now postponed until sometime next year -- to reaffirm the security relationship.
Japanese and South Korean leaders have been reluctant to come out in the same way and build support for American bases, perhaps because they do not want to be seen as being on the wrong side of a delicate nationalistic issue. As a result, the perception among ordinary Japanese and South Koreans is that it is really the United States that is pushing for the military presence.
"Japanese leaders have not really explained things to the people," said Yukio Okamoto, a former diplomat who runs a consulting firm in Tokyo. He noted that President Clinton had urged support for the security alliance in a television interview broadcast to Japan a few days ago, and he added, referring to Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, "President Clinton was doing the job that Murayama should have been doing, and that's a shame."
A recent poll in the Sankei Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, found that only 5 percent of those surveyed said they believed that the American bases are primarily for Japan's benefit. About 46 percent said they are in Japan primarily for the benefit of the United States. Most of the rest say the bases benefit both countries.
<HB >An Old Refrain: Yankees Go Home
 The irritation at the American bases is not ideological as it was in the 1960's, when university students dabbled in Marxism and waved their fists at American troops and their involvement in the Vietnam War. Now the opposition is less deep, but polls suggest it is broader.
The Sankei Shimbun poll suggested that 44 percent of Japanese favored the withdrawal of American troops. Only 31 percent favored a continued American military presence.
A poll by another newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, found that 76 percent of Japanese say they believe that American bases on the island of Okinawa should be reduced gradually.
When the Liberal Democratic Party, Japan's largest party, was choosing a leader in September, one of the two candidates even said in a television debate that American bases were no longer essential. That candidate, Junichiro Koizumi, said the problem was that the United States was asking Japan to pay more of the costs of maintaining the troops.
"Japan has been paying as much as it can," Mr. Koizumi said. "If the United States cannot bear the stationing costs of the U.S. forces in Japan, then we will have to ask them to reduce military personnel and bases."
Mr. Koizumi lost the race, but the winner -- Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Trade Minister and a strong contender to become the next Prime Minister -- also has a reputation as a nationalistic and assertive leader. Mr. Hashimoto has endorsed the American troop presence, but not in ringing terms.
In both South Korea and Japan, part of the yearning for change is the result of a generational shift and a desire for greater national dignity.
"The Korean War generation is dying out, and 70 percent of Koreans were born after the war," said Lee Young Duk, an editor at Chosun Ilbo, a major Seoul newspaper. "We have a more stable economy as well, and so we're talking about matters of pride. There are more voices calling for an increasingly equal relationship with America."
Shin Myung Soon, a professor of political science at Yonsei University in Seoul, said: "Koreans are beginning to think that we can do what we want. People don't see North Korea as such a lethal threat, so they don't feel so dependent on the U.S. presence."
 
Rape Has Become A Foreign Policy Issue
 The demands for adjusting the American military presence take many forms. There are periodic calls to move American bases out of populated areas -- one base is in Seoul, and Naha, the Okinawa capital, is an American military port.
In addition, South Koreans and Japanese complain about crimes by American military personnel. The latest outcry in Japan against the bases was set off by the rape of a 12-year-old girl, in which three American servicemen are charged.
All three servicemen have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to abduct and rape the girl, although only one has admitted to forcibly having sex with her.
Many Japanese and Koreans demand that Americans suspected of crimes be handed over immediately to face local justice. But to Americans, local justice sometimes seems like an oxymoron.
There are no jury trials in either Japan or South Korea, and police interrogators are often accused of using harsh methods of questioning to induce confessions. Nonetheless, the United States agreed recently to consider handing over troops suspected of rape or murder in Japan, and a similar agreement -- with some procedural protections for Americans -- is being negotiated in South Korea.
At present, American military personnel are handed over to local authorities in Japan upon indictment of a crime and in South Korean upon conviction.
 
Resentment at the PX: Cheap Cars and TV's
 Some South Koreans complain that American military people can import duty-free household goods, and that the United States military does not pay rent for the land it uses. But any changes in those policies would add to the American cost of keeping soldiers in South Korea.
By official calculations the United States already pays 88 percent of the costs of the American presence in Korea. As for Japan, Tokyo claims to pay 70 percent of the costs of the American forces in Japan, but that calculation excludes the troops' salaries; when salaries are included, Japan's share drops to half.
The Pentagon justifies the bases in Japan by saying it is cheaper to base troops here than to keep them in the United States. But much depends on how the figures are calculated, and the Cato Institute in Washington figures that the United States pays vast amounts -- about $40 billion a year -- to keep troops in Asia.
Americans sometimes complain that Japan is cutting its own armed forces at the same time that it is asking the United States to keep troops in the region. Just a few days ago, the Japanese Cabinet approved a far-reaching plan calling for a 20 percent cut in the ceiling of troops in the Japanese military.
Congress has supported the cost of maintaining 100,000 American troops in the region. But there are some rumblings of discontent from the United States, based in part on the expense involved.
"The existing U.S.-Japanese security relationship is simply not sustainable in the long term," declares a report issued last month by the Cato Institute.
In the United States, a recent poll found that 7 percent of those surveyed favored an immediate withdrawal from American bases in Japan, while another 49 percent supported a gradual withdrawal.
 
American Troops As Cops of Asia
 Yet the Pentagon and almost all countries in Asia fervently want the American bases to remain. One danger of an American pullout they cite is that North Korea or China might become militarily adventurous -- an invasion by China of Taiwan, for example, would send shock waves through all of Asia.
Walter F. Mondale, the American Ambassador in Tokyo, was anything but hawkish as a politician. But now he argues vigorously for maintaining American bases in Asia.
"Asia does not have a NATO-type security alliance, and none seems to be possible for some time," Mr. Mondale said. "So the real basis for stability in this crucial and historically unstable region is the U.S.-Japan alliance, which provides for the defense of Japan and permits us to forward deploy our forces."
Mr. Mondale says the bases are so widely viewed as essential that ways will be found to maintain them. He sees little chance of a scenario like the one that unfolded in the Philippines, leading to a major cutback.
The other argument often made for the bases is that they not only protect Japan, but also protect against Japan. The idea is that if the United States withdrew its troops, Japan would rearm and perhaps even acquire nuclear weapons.
Such a development would horrify almost everybody in Asia. The former Singapore leader, Lee Kuan Yew, expressed the concern when he warned that allowing Japan to send troops abroad would be "like giving a chocolate liqueur to an alcoholic."

HEADLINE: Rise in Cigarette Tax Planned To Finance Care for the Poor

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Facing a Dec. 31 deadline to replenish a state fund for hospital care of the poor, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and the Legislature's Republican leadership have agreed to raise some of the money by increasing the cigarette tax by as much as 25 cents a pack.
The Republican lawmakers, who control the Legislature, had put off action on the issue during the election season. But while increasing the cigarette tax is not expected to create a public furor, the Republicans hope to limit any political damage by enlisting Democrats with the argument that the hospitals most in need of the state money are in Democratic districts. 
 "This must be a bipartisan solution," said the Assembly Speaker, Chuck Haytaian, a Warren County Republican who did not run for re-election and will be leaving at the end of the 206th Legislative session on Jan. 8. "The revenues are going to urban, inner-city hospitals and therefore, those legislators who have the most to gain or lose are the Democrats because they represent those areas."
But Democratic lawmakers have been reluctant to support any new taxes since they were badly punished by the voters for approving former Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax package in 1990. Republicans used that tax increase to take control of the Legislature and roll back a portion of the tax package.
"It would be a very difficult decision," said Assembly Minority Leader Joseph V. Doria Jr., a Hudson County Democrat, of the proposed cigarette tax increase. "We would not be that supportive, but nobody has given us any of the actual facts of the case."
A 25-cent tax increase would bring the average price of a pack of cigarettes in New Jersey to about $2.50. In the Republican-controlled upper chamber, State Senator Jack G. Sinagra, a Middlesex County Republican who is chairman of the Senate Health Committee, argued that the new source of income was urgent.
"I have no problem with the cigarette tax because there is no question that there is a direct correlation between tobacco and health care costs," he said. "We're talking about health care and jobs in urban areas. The hospitals that receive the most charity care have the most critical cash flow needs. I think the Democrats would be very foolish for them not to participate."
The Republican argument is intended to mute any Democratic criticism of Mrs. Whitman's reversal on the tax cuts for which she has become so famous, though Carl Golden, chief spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, said the Governor had never said she would never raise taxes. "Here you have a program that takes care of the working poor," he said. "The Legislature and the Governor, obviously, want to see the program continue."
Because New Jersey has no public hospitals, care of the indigent in private hospitals is subsidized by the state. Almost $400 million has been distributed this year to 84 hospitals to help pay for treatment for people who are not eligible for Medicaid but who cannot afford to pay. Although state officials insist that the money is badly needed, a Health Department spokesman said the department did not know how many people had been served by the program.
Since 1993, New Jersey has financed the program by diverting almost $1.6 billion from the state's Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund, virtually wiping out much of the fund's surplus. The Governor and Legislative leaders, under pressure from organized labor and business leaders to stop draining the unemployment fund, agreed this year to consider alternatives before the authorization for the present system expires on Dec. 31.
State officials say that about $300 million is needed in the coming year to finance the hospital care program. An additional $100 million to $150 million is needed to pay for Health Access New Jersey, a state-subsidized health insurance program for residents who meet certain income requirements and are not eligible for employer-sponsored health coverage or Medicaid. For example, a family of four with an income up to $37,875 is eligible to buy insurance through the program, which was authorized by the Legislature in 1992 and started this year.
In addition to raising the cigarette tax, expected to bring in between $100 and $125 million in new revenue, the Governor and Legislative leaders are discussing several other options to pay for the two programs. Those options include a smaller diversion from the unemployment fund and possibly up to $75 million from the state's general funds. Legislative leaders have dismissed a Whitman administration proposal outlined to hospital officials last month that would impose a 1.5 percent tax on hospital revenues.
Even though the deal on the tax increase has been fashioned, the newly elected Speaker of the Assembly, Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County, said he is not happy about the increase.
"I believe that there are some people whose only enjoyment in life is a cigarette and a beer," Mr. Collins said. "That is all they can afford. They can't go to Bermuda. They can't go skiing in the Rockies. This is it. We are going to say to them, well, we are going to make you pay more money for your enjoyment, you one select group of people. That just bothers me."

HEADLINE: Showing Europe That U.S. Still Cares

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 2

 BODY:
One goal of President Clinton's trip to Western Europe is to dispel a growing anxiety that America is losing interest in its long-time trading partner and ally.
With the fall of Communism, and vast new markets in Asia and Latin America beckoning, Washington has focused away from Western Europe. Politically, Americans and their lawmakers are looking inward. 
 But on Sunday in Madrid, Mr. Clinton will move to strengthen American relations with Europe. He plans to sign a document specifying more than 120 joint studies, initiatives, projects, proposals, agreements, goals and expectations, with the aim of freshening the American-European alliance and reconciling old friends.
While the agreement should make it easier to sell foreign-made goods in the United States or Europe, it will not do all that much to promote an accord along the lines of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
On the political front, the agreement nearly spans the globe, calling for joint efforts in the Middle East, the former Soviet bloc, Bosnia and Korea. It also calls for closer cooperation on fighting drug trafficking, illegal immigration and organized crime.
In the trade area, it is to create a Trans-Atlantic Marketplace, where tariffs and nontariff barriers between the United States and Europe will be reduced.
"There was real concern in Europe that the United States was downgrading its relationship with its allies, concern the relations were going to atrophy," said Stuart E. Eizenstat, United States Ambassador to the European Union in Brussels. "I think this shows Europe remains our most important market and the region where we have the most common ground."
Mr. Eizenstat said that under the agreement, tariffs on European imports of computer equipment and semiconductors would be cut by as much as half, and both sides would commit themselves to harmonizing testing standards across a host of industries. For example, a pharmaceutical approved and tested in Europe could be sold in the United States without further testing.
But many economists and political analysts are already asking whether the agreement represents a lot of words aimed mainly at soothing hurt feelings, or an initiative that will open up business flow and genuine political cooperation.
One aspect is clear: it is by no means what some initially envisioned. Many leaders called for the creation of a Trans-Atlantic Free Trade Zone. They included Prime Minister John Major of Britain, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada, senior political leaders like Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany and business leaders like Edzard Reuter, former chairman of Daimler-Benz.
The logic seemed impeccable. The United States and Canada created such an accord with Mexico, hoping to extend it to all of Latin America. In Europe, United States business involvement is much higher, tariffs are much lower and business practices so similar that a trans-Atlantic free trade zone, or Tafta, as it came to be called, would be far easier than negotiating Nafta. Even the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said it would support such a deal because wages in the two continents were so similar.
"But it soon became clear that neither side, neither the United States nor Europe, was ready for a free trade area," said Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's trade commissioner. "But that doesn't mean that the agreement does not keep that hope alive."
One reason there was little enthusiasm for a free trade agreement was that after the seven years of recent negotiations to create the World Trade Organization to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, there was little desire to begin another protracted round with Europe.
France, in particular, ruled out any negotiations on changes in its vast agricultural subsidies and continued to insist that broadcast programming include a majority of European shows. Most trade experts agree that a free trade agreement would be meaningless if these two areas were not included.
And business leaders began arguing that lower tariff barriers were not their top priority. The average tariff between the United States and Europe is a meager 3 percent.
"We really don't worry about existing customs duties," said Hanns Glatz, head of European affairs for Daimler-Benz in Brussels. "Currency fluctuations are far greater concerns to us than tariffs. What we really are interested in are identical regulations."
Corporate heads told political leaders on both sides that the end of duplicate testing requirements and cutting through a hodgepodge of regulations were far more important to their competitive needs than reducing tariffs.
For example, to sell cars in the United States, European manufacturers have to install different headlights, as do American makers selling in the European market. Cars that have gone through a set of tests in Europe have to be put through other tests in the United States and adjustments made before they can be sold. Peugeot, for example, has given up selling cars in the United States in large part because of the costs of testing.
Mr. Eizenstat said that under the Trans-Atlantic Marketplace, the two sides planned on trying to open the European market to many biotechnology products now banned here but fully tested, approved and considered safe in the United States. These would include beef hormones that make cattle produce more milk and grow fatter, and a number of bioengineered pharmaceuticals.
In the end, only time will tell whether the trans-Atlantic accord will be as much as the politicians bill it to be.
"Everyone is asking, 'Where's the beef?' " said James Elles, a member of the European Parliament and president of the Trans-Atlantic Policy Network, a Brussels-based association to promote trade. "I think it is there. I don't think this is an empty declaration."

HEADLINE: U.N. Fields Odd Allies As It Wages AIDS Battle

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The director of a new program to coordinate and strengthen the work of the United Nations in battling the spread of AIDS has an odd assortment of allies: a prostitutes' union in Calcutta, the Thai Army and a grass-roots group in Uganda that is teaching women to move beyond their traditional roles and become militant in the name of prevention.
Such pockets of hope are small and scattered, said the director, Peter Piot of Belgium, but they demonstrate the lesson he wants to deliver to the developing world, where more than 90 percent of H.I.V.-infected people live. 
 "We now have very good evidence that prevention brings real results," Dr. Piot said in an interview on Thursday. It works best, he added, when programs fit the needs of people in specific cultures. Dr. Piot was in New York to speak about the program in a United Nations panel discussion on World AIDS Day on Friday.
In Thailand, where discussion of sex is frank and open, business leaders and military officers have successfully promoted AIDS prevention programs in a country that once seemed headed toward a health catastrophe. Now, Dr. Piot said, Thailand has areas where no new infections are occurring in men under 25. But he cautioned that in general Southeast Asia still has one of the world's fastest growing infection rates.
India remains another high-risk area, he said. But in Calcutta, where political and labor militancy is strong, prostitutes enlisted the support of public health officials for their organization by advocating a campaign against unprotected sex.
The intersection of AIDS prevention and women's rights is inevitable, Dr. Piot said, as is the recognition that AIDS prevention cannot be separated from overall development in poor countries.
"It's not enough understood that AIDS is more than a health problem," he said. "All agencies involved in development should have AIDS on their agenda. You have to be blind not to see the connection."
He said United Nations officials are often in as much as a state of denial as governments that say AIDS is a "foreign" disease.
Dr. Piot said one of his primary goals is to introduce AIDS awareness in all the United Nations agencies connected to his program: Unicef, the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Population Fund, Unesco, the World Bank and the World Health Organization. They will be urged to pool resources to avoid what he calls "overlap, gaps and turf fights."
Dr. Piot is to open an office for UNAIDS, as the program is called, in Geneva in January and it plans to station teams of experts in individual countries or regional centers to advise governments and local private organizations as well as to provide technical and financial support.
Thirty-six nations have already established centers for coordinating AIDS efforts, he said.

HEADLINE: Weary of Political Noise, a Senator Sees a Peaceful Farm in Her Future

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The final art of elective politics is to go cold turkey, leave the scene behind and head home to an ordinary life. "To Kansas," says Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, her smile as serene and honest as anything ever is in the Capitol.
"It's important for anybody in politics to be able to go home," the Republican Senator advises in the terse, tidy way that has been her oratorical trademark in the political career she never expected. It will last three terms in Washington and not a minute more. She intends to leave in a year and go live in a small, white farmhouse in the middle of Kansas where there are cows and no C-Span Congressional debates flickering endlessly in life's foreground. 
 "I will get a satellite dish -- to watch the basketball," says the University of Kansas alumna, drawing the line of her tolerance firmly, as she did in 1986 when she bucked President Ronald Reagan and led the fight for economic sanctions on South Africa in the final push to end apartheid.
The political art of walking away from such winning moments will be multiply tested in 1996, with a score of representatives and senators packing in their new ideas and old nostrums. Many may never leave town, opting for second careers in lobbying, lawyering and the sort of spectator-sport commentating that Senator Kassebaum warns is a noisomely discouraging aspect of modern politics. No chance that she will be among those risking spiritual gout at the Beltway's power-lunch trough after she quits next year.
"You know, 'Crossfire' and all that, the higher the decibel level gets, the more it's like a boxing match," she explains. "It's really different from when I came here.
"Today, there's an almost information overload, a bombardment by news, by faxes. Everything is instantaneous," she says, describing the descent of politics to infotainment, shallow and kaleidoscopic.
"Kind of a Roman circus in which people would rather watch politicians go at it," she continues, wary of a new "couch potato" electorate. "Politics as channel surfing. We want a new idea a day, a new person a day. There's no willingness to sustain, even though it may not be as exciting over a period of time to stick with something that needs to be done in a constructive way."
As she leaves, Mrs. Kassebaum is warning about the outsized, ravenous factor of money in politics and piteous Presidential candidates trapped in "the perpetual campaign." "By the time we do focus several months before the election, people are worn out," she says. "Even now there's another great search for who might be 'new.' "
In rather dreamy counterpoint, the 63-year-old Senator declares, "I always wanted that farm." She recalls girlhood days spent minnow fishing in the farm creek outside Burdick, a town as plain and compact in style as Mrs. Kassebaum in a Senate debate. "I never dreamed I would be here."
At the age of 42, in the midst of mothering four college- and high-school-aged children, she ventured hesitantly from Kansas and school board civics, indulging a one-year adventure as a Capitol political intern. She became intoxicated enough to dare to run in a nine-person crapshoot of a Senate primary fight that suddenly developed in 1978.
She won the Senate seat, she admits, on the middle-name recognition of being Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the daughter of Alf. Her father, after winning terms as Governor of Kansas in 1932 and 1934 against the Democratic trend, was the 1936 Republican Presidential nominee. He happily stayed home after losing and taught his daughter at the dinner table about issue-driven, pre-infotainment politics, a world she dearly misses.
"What better coattails than his?" she asks, confident now that she has carved her own respectable record in such specialties as the devolution of block grant powers to the statehouses. She has been a centrist of sometimes contradictory convictions, proposing, for example, that the states have more power over welfare while turning all Medicaid financing over to Washington. She has voted for gun controls. She is in favor of the right to choose abortion while allowing for state restrictions on abortion. She creates consensus, and she is not at all defensive about walking away from the chairmanship of the Labor Committee -- the first major committee chairwoman in 40 years.
The Senator is shocked that, even in Kansas, her successor will expend an estimated $2 million to win next year, five times the cost of her last campaign under self-imposed spending limits. She promises a final year's value, intent on finishing elaborate overhauls of the Federal drug law and workplace regulations.
Mrs. Kassebaum is misleadingly mild-looking and she knows it. Bordering on adopting a refreshing sneer, she notes that near the top of the list of campaign cliches she will not miss is the corny comparison of her to sweet, innocent Dorothy, the farm girl idealist who found herself far from Kansas in Oz.
"And no more of that question, 'What's it like to be a woman in the Senate?' " she says, using a ding-dong parody worthy of someone tired of all the media moves.
"We're here as senators and should be judged on our ability to deal with economic issues, foreign policy," she says with finality. "There are so many women who are running and bringing credentials to campaign debates and winning now that it's no longer a big deal."
It follows that it's not a big deal to go home. "What dad gave me that I always value was that his roots were always in Kansas," the Senator says, recalling the morning she first announced her candidacy 17 years ago. "I heard him on the radio, saying he hoped I wouldn't do it. I saw him later, sitting with the press, and I said, 'Dad, you've had your chance.' "
Now, the Senator notes, she has had her chance, too, and thus does the farm beckon.

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Buchanan Tries to Convince Conservatives That He's Their Man

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: DUBUQUE, Iowa, Dec. 1

 BODY:
It's the tail end of the morning rush hour, and Patrick J. Buchanan, the cultural-values warrior and 1996 Presidential candidate, is in K LIVE 105's FM studio, whooping it up with Dan Tooker, a G-rated, west-of-the-Mississippi version of Don Imus.
Mr. Tooker tweaks Mr. Buchanan for having a bigger campaign Winnebago than other Republican candidates, and Mr. Buchanan retorts that actually his R.V. is nothing compared to the "mobile homes" he says Morry Taylor, another Presidential hopeful, rides on the campaign trail. Then Mr. Buchanan, who traveled in a dark green van this week, raises the ante with this slice of campaign life about Mr. Taylor: 
 "He came up to the Iowa straw poll. He came up. They had these 50 babes -- excuse the terminology. They were on motorcycles. They were on Harley-Davidsons and driving in there. And someone said that is not the Federation of Iowa Republican Women, folks."
That on-the-air repartee may be harmless, but it is certainly not irrelevant when it comes to getting the attention and then trying to win the hearts and minds of the more than 100,000 Iowa Republicans expected to vote in the state's Feb. 12 caucus, the nation's first bona fide test of Republican Presidential candidates.
Mr. Buchanan, now in his second run for the Republican Presidential nomination, is in something of a pickle. Unlike Pat Robertson, who won the support of social conservatives in the 1988 caucus and captured second place, finishing ahead of George Bush, Mr. Buchanan does not have a lock on his natural constituency.
This time out, there are a lot of Republican Presidential candidates running as conservatives, including Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the front-runner; Senator Phil Gramm of Texas; Alan Keyes, the commentator, and Representative Robert K. Dornan of California. Mr. Buchanan is constantly on the lookout for ways to separate himself from the social conservative pack as he campaigns in the cities and hamlets of Iowa.
Whether Mr. Buchanan is on Mr. Tooker's KLYV-FM show displaying a kinder, gentler Pat or down the hall half an hour later on WDBQ-AM arguing against sending American troops to Bosnia and trumpeting his campaign's "800" number, his scrambling could have significance beyond his Presidential aspirations. The reception Mr. Buchanan receives in the coming weeks will tell a lot about what social conservatives outside Washington are thinking: do they want the kind of gradual change symbolized by Mr. Dole or the dramatic shakeup of the system reflected in Mr. Buchanan's candidacy?
Steffen Schmidt, University Professor of American politics and political behavior at Iowa State University, said many of Mr. Buchanan's supporters were "angry people, angry Americans who aren't interested in hearing about incremental changes." But Mr. Schmidt also said it was possible that a certain amount of pragmatism was creeping into Iowa conservatism. "They're angry, but they're not crazy," he said. "That's an advantage for Dole."
When Mr. Buchanan is campaigning person-to-person, he is apt to be enthusiastic but blunt in explaining what he says sets him apart from other conservatives. In caucus-organizing meetings in the homes of Buchanan supporters in Cedar Rapids on Tuesday and Waterloo on Thursday, Mr. Buchanan tied the success of his candidacy to issues he holds dear: the anti-abortion movement, a smaller central Government and other conservative causes.
"I win the nomination and carry the agenda forward or it's not carried forward," Mr. Buchanan told a group of abortion opponents gathered in the living room of Barbara and Bernard Sand in Waterloo on Thursday. In Cedar Rapids, where Mr. Buchanan gave a pep talk to supporters at the home of Robert and Marilyn Ask, he asked each of his backers to find 10 more like-minded conservatives and get them to the caucus to vote for him.
If provocative policy planks were the focal point of voter interest, Mr. Buchanan would be seen as a breed apart for his advocacy of tariffs against nations whose markets are not entirely open to American products and for his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. His belief that the Government's free trade policy is partly responsible for destroying family farms and encouraging corporations to move high-wage American factories overseas is a novel populist position for a cold-war wordsmith who devoted so many years to promoting democracy and free market economies.
Nowadays Mr. Buchanan, a former speechwriter for President Richard M. Nixon and communications director for President Ronald Reagan, sounds much less gung-ho about capitalism and more like an advocate of the "small is beautiful" philosophy of the economist E. F. Schumacher.
"We have to ask ourselves as conservatives what is it we want to conserve in America," he said in an interview during which he placed family farms and other family businesses high on the preservation list. "I believe in the market system, but I don't worship the market system. I don't worship at the altar of efficiency as I believe some so-called conservatives do. To prefer a 100,000-hog confinement to hundreds of family farms, it seems to me, is not conservatism. I mean, that's to worship at a supermarket civilization."
In the same interview, Mr. Buchanan said that the rise in corporate profits and the stock market was a positive development so long as workers, middle management and white-collar employees shared in the prosperity. But, he said, "middle-class income is stagnant or going down at the same time these corporate profits are soaring."
Mr. Buchanan places the blame for that income stagnation on what he calls unfair trade deals that export high-paying jobs abroad, legal and illegal immigrants who work for less than Americans born in the United States and his new nemesis: corporate America. "I think it's corporations who have gone global, who have lost all loyalty to America," he said. Their "loyalty is to the bottom line on a corporate balance sheet." That loyalty, he said, leads them to move their plants to places like Singapore and Mexico, hire workers there for low wages "and fire Iowans who make $9.50" an hour.
Wherever Mr. Buchanan campaigned this week -- Des Moines, Newton, Mason City, Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, Cedar Falls, Dyersville and here -- he pushed his 10-point bill of rights for family farmers. At a speech to the influential Iowa Farm Bureau convention in Des Moines on Wednesday, his call for abolishing the inheritance tax and the capital gains tax on farms worth less than $5 million was politely received; so was his proposal to relax wetland regulation.
But knowledgeable Iowans say his promise to be a trade hawk in the White House really did not go over well with Hawkeye farmers. Like all farmers, they want greater access to consumers in Asian markets, but not at the price of rounds of retaliatory tariffs that they say would hurt Iowa's agriculture and agriculture-related industries, said Hugh Winebrenner, a professor of public administration at Drake University in Des Moines. The notion of a tariff fence around the United States, he said, "doesn't sell well in Iowa."
From a demographic point of view, Professor Winebrenner said, Mr. Buchanan's family farmer bill of rights, however heartfelt, also amounts to a dubious vote-getting strategy, since 43 percent of all Iowa Republicans are in 10 metropolitan counties, with a huge concentration around Des Moines.
"Every candidate has to operate on family farm rhetoric," he said. "There are family farms." But, he said, it is hard to define the line between a family farm and an incorporated business.
Nor should anyone think that Iowa's "Field of Dreams" landscape is an accurate picture of the state's economy. Agriculture-related activities may dominate here, but Iowa's economy is diverse.
"Manufacturing generates between three and five times as much personal income for Iowans as does agriculture," the Iowa Caucus Project fact book says. Job gains are in factory employment now, and Iowa's industrial base includes machinery, food products, insurance, financial services and electronic and electrical equipment.
After another bill-of-rights news conference in snow-covered Cedar Falls on Thursday, though, the photo opportunity won out. Without hesitation, Mr. Buchanan climbed behind the wheel of a green 1956 John Deere tractor on the four-acre Kellner Farm for the cameras.

HEADLINE: Deficit Partnership

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Like rival clans locked in some ancient feud, Democrats and Republicans have now been arguing for so many years over the budget deficit that the origins of the dispute have gradually been forgotten.
Democrats in Congress have repeated for years the mantra that President Reagan pushed the deficit out of control by cutting taxes while raising military spending. Republicans have recited just as regularly the view that Democrats voted for ever larger deficits during their 40 years of control in the House. 
 But among experts who have studied the history of the American budget deficits, there is fairly broad agreement that both sides are partly right. Neither party has clean hands and the slower economic growth over the last 20 years has made the situation worse.
The current budget negotiations between the Republican Congress and a Democratic President, stalled in large measure over handling the deficit, are a reminder that budget policy in the United States is made by compromises. And those compromises have put politically popular tax cuts and spending programs ahead of mundane but important matters, like whether there are enough tax revenues to cover spending, particularly over the last two decades.
Some of the biggest decisions that continue to feed the budget deficit were made by Republican Presidents with Democratic Congresses, notably during the Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan Administrations.
During the 1980's, when the annual deficit soared from $72 billion to $278 billion, President Reagan and Democrats struck a series of compromises in which tax revenues did not come close to covering spending. Each side vied with the other to say how unhappy it was with the deals, and many liberal Democrats voted against them. While President Reagan bore much of the responsibility for drafting these budgets, ultimately Congress voted for the budget bills and the President signed them.
"You can take a substantial amount of responsibility and dollop it around to everybody in this process," said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute here. "The glib charges -- that it was President Reagan cutting taxes and raising military spending or that it was Democrats who spend, spend, spend -- are not accurate, but part of what was going on."
Both sides were reluctant to cut popular entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, for which recipients are guaranteed money if they meet certain criteria. Those programs grew rapidly during the 1980's and now account for half the budget. Unwillingness to cut them, not just among Democrats but also among Republicans, meant that cuts had to be twice as deep in other spending programs to accommodate tax reductions. Those deeper cuts simply were not made.
"Why did the conservative, anti-spending party (GOP) end up ratifying a half-trillion-dollar-per-year welfare state?" David A. Stockman, who was President Reagan's first budget director, wrote in his book "The Triumph of Politics." "In the answer lies the modern dirty little secret of the Republican Party: the conservative opposition helped build the American welfare state brick by brick during the three decades prior to 1980. The Reagan Revolution failed because the Republican Party decided to stick with its own historic handiwork."
While President Reagan's budgets remain controversial, probably because they are fairly recent, it was during the late 1960's and early 1970's that some of the costliest decisions were made. It was then that Democrats and Republicans created the Medicare system and made Social Security payments much more generous.
A rivalry between President Nixon and Wilbur Mills, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee who made a brief bid for the Presidency in 1972, contributed to the decisions to increase payments to Social Security recipients by 15 percent in 1969, 10 percent in 1970 and 20 percent in 1972. In each case the Administration advocated a generous increase and the Congress added a little more.
Both sides also agreed to set Social Security payments in 1972 to rise with inflation. The effect was to lock in large payments -- right before the oil crisis sent prices in the United States soaring.
While Social Security is technically excluded from calculations of the Federal budget deficit through an accounting device, the program's expansion has had a big effect, particularly when coupled with the parallel growth in the Medicare system. As Social Security payments have climbed over the last quarter century, payroll taxes to support them have nearly doubled as a share of employees' income. That has reduced the room for increases in other taxes to cover many other Federal programs.
As Medicare and Social Security costs have grown, they have squeezed out Federal spending on other programs like transportion and education. Exclude military spending and interest on the national debt, and half of what is left in the budget now goes to people over 65, said Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. The portion that goes for everything else represents a smaller share of the nation's economic output than on the eve of World War II.
Apart from all the compromise budgets created by Presidents and Congresses, the booms and busts and growth rate of the American economy have had at least as great an influence on the size of the budget deficit.
The big social spending commitments of the late 1960's and early 1970's were made with the assumption that economic growth would not falter. Economic growth per person averaged about 2.4 percent a year from World War II until 1973. But growth per person has averaged only 1.4 percent since then.
To be sure, the American economy has had some strong years since then, including last year. But when times are good and most Americans have jobs, tax revenues naturally rise and spending for unemployment insurance and food stamps drops. The budget deficit narrows sharply on its own, weakening the political consensus for further deficit reduction.
That is exactly what has happened over the last year. The deficit has plunged to about $160 billion this year, down from a peak of $340.5 billion in fiscal 1992. Part of the drop reflects the combination of tax increases and spending cuts that the Clinton Administration and Congressional Democrats enacted in 1993.
Administration officials, led by Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, have pointed to the steep narrowing in the deficit over the last two years as evidence that Federal spending is already coming under control. Yet most economists believe that the bulk of the improvement has come from the robust health of the American economy, with millions more Americans working than there were when President Clinton took office.
Cutting deficits during recessions is much harder. The deficit expands rapidly as unemployed Americans stop paying taxes and put much heavier demands on Government services. Corporate profits drop, further reducing tax revenues.
Worse budget problems may still lie ahead, when the Baby Boom generation begins to retire early in the next century. The number of people turning 65 each year and becoming eligible for Medicare and full Social Security benefits is fairly low right now. These are Depression-era children born when birth rates were fairly low.
"The 90's is an era of reprieve," said Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington research group. "This is an easy period to get the deficit under control. What are we going to do when the crunch comes?"

HEADLINE: Finance Chief Is Appointed By Giuliani

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani named the city's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, Alfred C. Cerullo 3d, to be Commissioner of Finance yesterday, making his third major appointment of the week in the areas of budget, finance and economic development.
Mr. Cerullo replaces Joseph J. Lhota, whom the Mayor appointed as his new budget director on Wednesday. Mr. Lhota will be the Mayor's third budget director in two years, reflecting an unusual turnover in an administration whose core appointees have largely remained in place. 
 On Friday, Mr. Giuliani appointed Charles Millard, a Republican member of the City Council who represents the Upper East Side of Manhattan, to be the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, an agency that offers incentives and tax advantages to encourage business growth and attract or retain private-sector jobs.
In yesterday's announcement, the Mayor said that Mr. Cerullo would have a dual responsibility as the head of the city's Department of Finance: the traditional one of overseeing the collection of almost $18 billion in taxes and other revenues, and an advisory role in the shaping of fiscal policy at a time when the city faces persistent budget gaps.
Although he has no background in municipal finance, Mr. Cerullo oversaw a drive at the Department of Consumer Affairs to streamline the licensing of businesses and the collection of fines from violators.
The Mayor said that made him well qualified for the job in the Finance Department, where Mr. Giuliani has proposed consolidating many of the city's collection functions to increase revenues without "becoming oppressive in the ways in which laws are enforced."
Mr. Giuliani's proposal, which would merge the city's administrative tribunals under the department, has for two years been stalled in the State Legislature, which must approve the changes.
"I can't think of anyone else who would be better in this very, very critical role," the Mayor said.
Mr. Cerullo, who is 33, was born in Brooklyn and raised on Staten Island, where he lives. He is a graduate of St. John's University and St. John's School of Law. In 1990, he was elected to the City Council, where as the only Republican he automatically became its minority leader, a position he held until taking the job at Consumer Affairs last year.
Mr. Cerullo said one of his goals as Commissioner of Finance would be to ease the summonses and fines for myriad violations -- from keeping sidewalks clean to parking -- that many business owners have complained are onerous. "I know that there's a very important element of working with the public and to develop a customer service element as to how the Department of Finance's reputation works in our neighborhoods," he said.

HEADLINE: Saving Science as Budgets Are Cut

 BODY:
In a memorable scene from the movie "Apollo 13," a space official dumps replicas of every item aboard the crippled spacecraft onto a table and orders the gathered scientists and engineers to figure out how to combine the debris into a workable exhaust system. They do.
Solving complex, unanticipated problems is what America's scientific community does uniquely well. Last week a panel of the National Research Council, a private group that advises Congress, proposed sensible ways to preserve the nation's scientific acuity in the face of steep projected declines in research budgets. 
 It urged Congress to adopt a coherent process for setting scientific priorities throughout the Government before separate committees vote on funding individual programs in separate agency budgets. It also recommended that Congress adopt a more accurate method for calculating spending, so that research is not mindlessly cut in the belief it is awash in money. Congress thinks it spends $70 billion on research and development, but the panel pointed out that about half of that is for maintaining armaments or for other purposes that create no knowledge and improve no technology.
The panel's most controversial recommendation was also its most important. It urged Congress to favor academic institutions over Government laboratories. Even after discounting the self-interest of a panel dominated by academics, this is a sensible suggestion. University-based research is more likely to be of higher quality because grants are awarded through a competitive process of peer review, whereas Government laboratories are generally guaranteed large lump sums that can support many less-capable scientists. University research is more likely to trigger a bigger impact because the results are widely disseminated and the projects train graduate students, the next generation of scholars.
The panel makes the important point that the purpose of university-based research is not only a startling discovery or application, but also the training of a skilled scientific community. Some of the most valuable research projects Government undertakes are those that have almost no chance of leading to applications but keep smart, creative and highly motivated scholars at the top of their profession. The return for the country is that it has created generations of scientists who fan out into the economy to solve hard problems wherever they arise -- even on a spaceship.

HEADLINE: The Lives of No. 714

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: UNION CITY

 BODY:
THERE is nothing imposing or distinguished about the house at 714 11th Street. Built in 1893, last sold in 1994 for $166,000. Three stories (one to a family), of a weathered, tan-colored brick that seems to have collected 102 years' worth of grit. No one has suggested that it be designated a landmark. No one famous has ever lived there.
But its story is the story of those who have -- of Abel and Maritca Moran, Honduran immigrants, who bought it last year from Angel and Hilda Acebo, Cuban immigrants. Of the Sisos, also Cuban, who sold it to the Acebos in 1978, and the Napolitanos, Italian-American, who lived there for 10 years and sold it to the Sisos in 1974. 
 In all, nine families have owned No. 714, going back to the days when 11th Street was John Street and this part of Union City was called West Hoboken.
For more than a century, Hudson County -- resolutely working-class, inner-ring, the quintessential urban suburb -- has been a magnet for immigrants and their sons and daughters.
As Union City became home to new immigrant group after new immigrant group, so too did this house.
"The newcomers know they can make something of nothing here," said Francisco Canonico, a Cuban-born real estate broker who, with his wife, Hortensia, has sold the house three times since 1974. "You've got the same nationalities and language and people help each other, the same way they used to do it in their own country."
And as the newcomers settled in, worked hard and eventually made enough money to afford a house in the leafier suburbs of Essex or Bergen or Monmouth County, so too did the owners of No. 714.
"With most immigrant groups, the first place they settle on arrival isn't the place they stay for many generations," said Nicholas Lemann, author of "The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How It Changed America" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1991). "First, they go to these 'starter' neighborhoods where there's all one ethnic group, all poor or working poor. Then, there's a mass movement where they move to an area where there's almost all that ethnic group, and one notch up economically. Third, they move to a more middle-class place, more likely to be in the suburbs, and less likely to be mono-ethnic."
The pattern has been repeated over and over in New Jersey, where about a million residents, one-eighth of the population, are foreign-born. (Only four states -- California, New York, Texas and Florida -- have a higher ratio.) The largest contingent is in Hudson County, where every third person is foreign-born. And in Union City, a third of all residents are from Central and South America, double the number in 1980.
"Immigration usually proceeds on a colony model: once there's a small culture supporting institutions like churches and businesses, then it becomes a magnet for new people," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "You can use that house and its occupants to look at changing demographics, the changing economy, and the changing life styles of people, not just in Union City but in the state."
 
1875: THE IRISH
From Woods to Streets
 Until this century, there was no Union City. First inhabited by the Lenape Indians, the area was part of a large swath known as the Bergen Woods, which now encompasses Union City, North Bergen, Hoboken, Weehawken and West New York. In the early 18th century, French and Dutch traders settled and built houses, taverns, industry, churches. Irish and German immigrants landed in the mid-19th century.
The land that is now 11th Street was owned by a wealthy Irishman named James Kerrigan. In 1875, he divided the land among his five children; his daughter Catharine T. Perkins got much of what was then called West Hoboken -- including block 19, bracketed by paper streets called John and Savoye, and by Summit and Central Avenues.
In 1885 Mrs. Perkins sold lot 12 for $250 to Sarah and Charles A. Yates, a middle-aged couple. (He was born in Massachusetts; she was Scottish.) And in 1893, the Yateses built 714 John Street, in the Second Renaissance Revival style that was popular at the end of the century.
Other houses were springing up in the neighborhood too, in a hodgepodge of utilitarian styles. It was a working-class community (Charles Yates was a carpenter), heavily German with a sprinkling of Irish and Danish families. The neighbors were silk weavers and tailors, feather-factory workers and dressmakers, grocery clerks and book agents.

1910: THE ITALIANS
Trolleys and Stickball
 The Yateses left for Stroudsburg, Pa., in 1910. The sale price is not known; until the 60's, deeds listed the price as "one dollar and other good and valuable consideration." What is known is that Emilio and Emma Viotto of West Hoboken bought the place, their first home in the new world.
The Viottos came to the United States from Italy in 1900, part of the huge influx of European immigrants drawn by America's industrial revolution. In 1900, about one-fourth of New Jersey's population was foreign-born, the highest percentage ever; in West Hoboken, the total population was 15,187, triple that of 1880.
The Viottos came when they were in their 20's, with their infant daughters Lena and Pierina. Emilio Viotto was a building contractor and his wife was a homemaker; Lena became a dressmaker and Pierina a stenographer. To make extra money, they rented out the second and third floors.
"It was basically the Germans and the Italians in those days," said Doretta Jungermann, who has lived in Union Hill, now part of Union City, all of her 88 years. "Most of the immigrants were from poor families and didn't have the education, but they made sure their kids had the education. There were always little stores, bakeries, individually owned places -- Servo's, a men's shop, and Heinz, a delicatessen on Bergenline" -- Bergenline Avenue, then as now the main drag.
In 1921 the Viottos sold the house to the Rosso family, who sold it to their son Mauro and daughter-in-law, Claudina, in 1935. The Rossos had their own grocery store. At one point, they rented an apartment to Alice and Kathleen Kelly, two kindly sisters would pay the neighborhood children 20 cents to carry their groceries up the stairs.
"Everybody knew everybody on this block," recalled Ed Rumi, who has lived across the street at No. 715 for most of his 63 years. "Mr. Rosso, he was a very heavy-set guy with a big belly and a good sense of humor. He had a narrow, lengthy truck to deliver eggs and cheese. We used to kid him that he would eat all the cheese and he just laughed. Nice man."
There was much talk in the 1920's of a "Greater Jersey City" conglomeration to rival New York City, but all that resulted was a modest merger: West Hoboken and Union Hill joined to become Union City in 1925. (Other possible names included Hillboken, Narcissus and Hudsona.) East-west streets were renamed to conform with the numerical grid of Union City; John Street became 11th Street.
Life was good on 11th Street, Mr. Rumi remembers. The street was lined by a tunnel of poplars, chestnuts, and cottonwoods. Children would shovel the snow for a nickel. Milk and bread were delivered by horse and wagon; perhaps there'd be one car driving through every hour, no more. Children played stickball in the street, with Mr. Rumi's chestnut tree as first base and the sewer plate as second. Over on Summit Avenue, the trolleys, which cost a nickel, carried people to North Bergen and Hoboken until 1948. A little farther away, there were enough burlesque theaters and bars to give the area the nickname Barbary Coast.
It was also a time when immigration slowed to a trickle, said Dr. Hughes of Rutgers. Many families in Union City stayed longer; the Rossos were at No. 714 for almost 40 years.
Mr. Rosso died in 1958, and the family sold the house the following year. The new owners were a couple in their 30's from Hoboken, Frank P. and Adeline M. Rotella. Real-estate agents say they probably paid $20,000 to $25,000.
For many immigrants, moving from Hoboken to Union City -- "up the viaduct" -- signaled the upward mobility of a second- or third-generation immigrant family just a few steps away from the suburbs. Union City was a thriving manufacturing center then, with dozens of factories producing textiles, silk, beer, cigars and pencils.
In 1965, the Rotellas sold the house to Carmine and Maria M. Napolitano of Jersey City, and moved to Toms River. The Napolitanos were friendly, neighbors remember. They had relatives who lived upstairs, and they had a summer house in Belmar. And though not much else could be learned about them, they did leave a mark on No. 714: a mural on the entryway ceiling with the letter N emblazoned against a blue shield.
 
1974: THE CUBANS
Havana to Bergenline
 
 The mid-70's marked another passage for No. 714. In 1974, the Napolitanos sold the house for $48,000 to Jose Siso and his mother, Maria Heredero, Cuban immigrants. The sale was indicative of the changing face of Union City: from 1960 to 1970, the number of people of Italian descent fell to 6,231 from 11,234, while Cubans -- who weren't even recorded in 1960 -- swelled to 16,538.
"When Castro took over, all the professionals were afraid and many decided to leave," said Mrs. Heredero, at her simple, spartan studio apartment in West New York, speaking Spanish as Mrs. Canonico, the real-estate broker, interpreted.
Mr. Siso, now in his mid-60's, had been a lawyer in Havana before landing a job as a social worker in New York City. They chose No. 714 because of its convenience -- it's close to Kennedy Boulevard and Interstate 495, and a variety of services and businesses run by Cubans or Puerto Ricans: the corner bodega, the paella place up the block. Later, Mr. Siso remarried and moved to Paterson, then to Florida, while Mrs. Heredero stayed in Hudson County. In 1978, they sold the house to Angel and Hilda Acebo, both factory workers from Cuba, for $53,500.
The Acebos had come to the United States in 1969, also for political reasons. Overwhelmed by New York City, they moved to Union City, first to an apartment house, then, after saving enough money, to 11th Street -- the first place they'd had a backyard where their children could play. Real estate prices skyrocketed during the Acebos' tenure; so, too, did taxes, going from $2,800 a year in 1980 to $7,000 in 1992.
The Acebos were part of another change: the swift decline of the once-mighty Democratic political machine of Hudson County. Anti-Castro Cubans tend to vote Republican, and in the 1970's and 80's they began making life harder for Democrats. (So, too, did a series of corruption prosecutions.)
"My parents have always been Republicans because they support their policies," said Susana Robison, the Acebos' daughter. "In the next election, they'll support whoever runs against Clinton."
 
1994: THE HONDURANS
Harder Times, and Hope
 But as Union City's Cubans began doing better financially, they too began moving on. Last year the Acebos sold their house to Abel and Maritca Moran for $166,000 so they could live closer to Susana, who had got married and moved to a Baltimore suburb.
The Morans bought into a neighborhood that was increasingly filled with recent immigrants from Central and South America. Upstairs, there are renters from Puerto Rico and Honduras, who each pay about $600 a month. In the city, the number of Cubans has dropped below the 15,054 recorded in 1990. Meanwhile, the number of Central and South American immigrants has doubled, to 18,000 since 1980, coming mainly from the Dominican Republican, Colombia, El Salvador and Ecuador.
The Morans met here in 1985. They returned to Honduras in 1992 to get married; now Mr. Moran, 43, is a foreman at a Brooklyn factory, while Mrs. Moran, 31, works at a direct-mail company in Jersey City. Their daughter, Scarlett, is 16 months old. Like the previous owners, they live in the long, narrow first-floor, two-bedroom apartment. The white tin ceiling is still there, as is the Napolitanos' mural, but the rest of the house is distinctly Honduran: black and pink murals of birds, wood carvings, dolls in native garb.
"I like this place because the brick house construction is good, everything is convenient, and we have money to help pay the mortgage," said Mr. Moran. "It feels nice."
How long they stay, of course, remains to be seen. Union City is the state's most densely populated municipality, with 60,000 residents crammed into 1.27 square miles, an ever-changing tapestry of ethnic groups. As in the rest of the state, service jobs are supplanting manufacturing jobs. Small stores selling nickel-and-dime goods have popped up. Along Summit Avenue near 11th Street, only a few longtime establishments remain: Canonico's real estate, Polay's Lumber and Hardware, and Eckhart & Bartolomei Inc., an insurance company.
"A lot has changed in Union City, and we have more needy people now," said Ruth Molenaar, publisher of La Tribuna in Union City, New Jersey's oldest Spanish-language newspaper. "But I'm optimistic about the future because I trust the youth and the politicians and the businessmen and businesswomen."
That sunny outlook is not surprising here. "They still go back to Union City every couple of months and stay with friends," said Mrs. Robison of her parents. "They always walk by the house because it brought them a lot of luck. They look at it, they smile, and they say, 'There was a lot of good memories in that house.' "

HEADLINE: Defending Harlem: Residents Weigh In

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As an African-American who has lived in Harlem for 10 years (I moved to New York from Ohio to attend business school at Columbia University), I read Lisa Anderson's report of her year in Harlem with interest, dismay and anger ("Harlem on Her Mind," Nov. 19). Not until the last three paragraphs of a page-and-a-half story does she concede that some of her negative reactions could be due to herself rather than the community. 
 In Harlem I have found a church where I have been welcomed, an apartment at a reasonable price, a job I can walk to from home and friends I am anxious to return to when I am away.
I work in the field of community development, and therefore I am as familiar as anyone with the problems of poverty, unemployment and drugs that face Harlem. But there are people who have moved in, or never left, who are living their lives in a community where they feel comfortable while trying to make positive contributions toward improving it.

HEADLINE: THE RADICAL CENTER OR THE MODERATE MIDDLE?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LIND; Michael Lind is a senior editor of The New Republic and the author of "The Next American Nation: The New Nationalism and the Fourth American Revolution."

 BODY:
COLIN POWELL'S DECISION NOT TO SEEK THE PRESIDENCY HAS left an opening for the emergence of a new leader or a new party in the center of the political system. Whether or not there is an independent or a third-party challenge, the Democratic and Republican Presidential nominees in 1996 will have to court centrist voters who are repelled both by traditional liberalism and radical conservatism.
This is the conventional wisdom. It is half right. A substantial number of Americans (as much as a third of the electorate, in some polls) are indeed alienated by a two-party system that tends to present only two options -- conservative Republican or liberal Democrat. But the growing number of disaffected voters do not form a cohesive bloc with a shared viewpoint that might serve as the basis for a third party. On the contrary, alienated voters tend to divide into two distinct and incompatible camps: the moderate middle and the radical center. 
 Paul Tsongas declared after Powell's decision not to enter the race that "there is a clear consensus and it's right in the middle -- socially liberal, fiscally conservative, pro-environment, pro-campaign reform." The "clear consensus" Tsongas describes is that of the moderate middle (which Powell called "the sensible center"). Members of the moderate middle tend to be old-fashioned Eisenhower and Rockefeller Republicans alienated by the supply-siders and religious right activists who, since the 1970's, have taken over the G.O.P. The moderate middle also includes neo-liberal New Democrats based in the suburbs and successful in the private sector. The ranks of the moderate middle are heavy with managers and professionals with advanced degrees. They tend to combine liberal views on social issues like abortion and gay rights with concern about excess government spending on welfare and middle-class entitlements. The standard-bearers of the moderate middle include Democrats like Bill Bradley, Gary Hart and Paul Tsongas as well as former Republicans like John Anderson and Lowell Weicker.
The moderate middle, however, is only one of the two "centers" in American politics. The "radical center" (the name was coined in the 1970's by Donald Warren, a sociologist) consists largely of alienated Democrats, who broke away from the New Deal coalition to vote for George Wallace in 1968, Nixon in 1972 and then, in 1980, for Ronald Reagan. These former Wallace-Reagan Democrats tend to be white, blue-collar, high-school-educated and concentrated in the industrial Middle West, the South and the West. They are liberal, even radical in matters of economics, but conservative in morals and mores. Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan and Jerry Brown, while not spokesmen for the radical center, have espoused ideas and sentiments that are attractive to this constituency.
The moderate middle, by and large, is satisfied with the American private sector, to the extent of viewing its accounting procedures and organizational structures as a model for good governance in the public sector. The radical center hates big business (and big labor) as much as big government. Not infrequently, this hostility extends to the two big parties, between which, as George Wallace famously suggested, there isn't a dime's worth of difference.
The moderate middle could not be more different, in style and goals, than the radical center. It is hard to imagine Paul Tsongas slow-dancing, as Perot has, to the strains of Patsy Cline's "Crazy," or to picture Warren Rudman joining Pat Buchanan in summoning the country to "religious war" and "cultural war." The belligerent and often colorful oratory of today's self-described populists of the radical center echoes the oratory of the Jacksonian Democratic and Populist spellbinders of the past, like William Jennings Bryan, and Huey P. (Kingfish) Long.
The political spectrum, like American society in general, is divided by class, so that the rationalistic meliorists of the moderate middle, in socioeconomic terms, are "above" the angry populists of the radical center. The difference is reminiscent of the class and cultural divide between upper-middle-class metropolitan Progressives and rural and small-town Populists at the turn of the century, who viewed each other with suspicion even though they shared many criticisms of the existing order.
 THE ANGRY CENTER, ON CLOSER INSPECTION, turns out to consist of two groups so unlike as to doom any project of uniting them in a single third-party movement. The platform of Perot's new Independence Party stresses reforms of campaign finance and the budget process that both radical centrists and moderate middlers, for different reasons, can approve, but takes virtually no stand on contentious social and political issues that divide the two centers. Perot himself, in spite of his Texan populism, resembles a classic good-government progressive in his concerns about special-interest influence and bureaucratic inefficiency. However, to judge from the rapturous reception given at Perot's recent Dallas convention to the Nafta opponents Patrick Buchanan and Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio, the center of gravity of the Perot movement is the radical center, not the moderate middle.
A more logical alternative, then, to today's two-party system would be not a three-party system but a four-party system, with parties representing liberalism, conservatism, the moderate middle and the radical center. More likely, however, the two centers will transform American politics by influencing one of the existing parties, or perhaps both, to adopt the most important parts of their agenda.
Given the deep contradictions between the radical center and the moderate middle, Democratic and Republican strategists may have no choice but to pursue one faction while writing off the other. Interestingly, the Republican and Democratic parties for some time have been pursuing the centrists who have defected from the other party, rather than trying to lure their own defectors back into the fold. For example, Republican strategists since Richard Nixon in 1968 have been willing to abandon liberal and moderate Republicans in order to court ex-Democratic members of the radical center by stressing social conservatism, while ignoring the economic populism that is dear to the hearts of the same constituency. In a memo for the 1984 Reagan campaign, Lee Atwater made this strategy explicit: "Populists have always been liberal on economics. So long as the crucial issues were generally confined to economics -- as during the New Deal -- the liberal candidate would expect to get most of the populist vote. But populists are conservatives on most social issues. . . . When social and cultural issues died down, the populists were left with no compelling reason to vote Republican."
Meanwhile, "New Democrats" like Bill Clinton have written off the radical center (most notably, during the Nafta debate) while reaching out to the business-class members of the moderate middle, many of them with liberal Republican roots, by supporting deficit reduction and good-government reforms like "reinventing government."
Of the two strategies, the Republican so far appears to be more successful; Buchanan's Presidential campaigns may even help weld the radical center to the G.O.P., as a wing of the party comparable in importance to the religious right (a sectarian coalition quite different from the radical center). Clinton, however, has managed to alienate working-class radical centrists with his moderate-middle synthesis of free trade and cultural liberalism, without inducing a mass conversion of John Anderson Republicans to the Democratic party.
 WHICH OF THE TWO RIVAL CENTRIST movements is more likely to succeed -- either as an independent party, or (more likely) as a wing of one of the two established parties? The answer might be sought in the historical precedent of the Populists and the Progressives. Progressive politicians enacted many of the reforms on the Populist agenda, from government relief for farmers to child labor laws. The Progressives, though, rejected radical Populist economic ideas, like the nationalization of the railroads and the re-monetization of silver. More concerned with good government than with popular government, Progressives also rejected the radical democratic ideal of the Populists; though they sometimes supported measures like referenda as tools to combat political machines, their favored alternative to government corruption tended to be the extension of government centralization by educated elites, not the extension of grass-roots Jacksonian democracy. The Populists fizzled out at the turn of the century; the Progressives, and their heirs, the New Deal liberals, proved to be the dominant force in 20th-century American politics, reshaping state and society alike.
If this parallel holds up, then the moderate middle (today's Progressives) may adopt some of the reforms of the radical center (today's Populists), while rejecting the most extreme radical-centrist approaches to economic nationalism and direct democracy. Because the moderate middle tends to be composed of disaffected members of the political, economic and intellectual establishments, it has an enormous advantage over the less-educated and less-sophisticated radical center. The moderate middle has prestige, connections and access to institutional power and wealth; the radical center tends to have none of these.
The long-term odds, then, are stacked in favor of the moderate middle -- particularly if its spokesmen adopt, and domesticate, a few ideas from the radical center (like campaign and lobbying reform, or trade sanctions on countries that exploit labor). Even if some of its favorite reforms are co-opted, though, the radical center may not be appeased. If wages continue to stagnate or decline for most Americans, the accumulating resentments of the radical center could energize a destructive anti-system populism, an American form of Argentine-style Peronism that would make Buchanan's right-wing populism look tame by comparison. The stability of the American political order may depend on its ability to reassure angry populists -- and yet the elitist bias of that very political order may insure that the interests of the working-class members of the radical center continue to be sacrificed to the ideals of the affluent and suburban moderate middle. If so, a new "South American" politics of outsiders versus insiders or of bottom versus top may replace the traditional American left-right spectrum -- and, with it, the very notion of a "center" at all.

HEADLINE: Forbes the Candidate: Different Hat, Same Message

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
When Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., the chief executive of Forbes Inc. and the editor in chief of Forbes magazine, announced on Sept. 22 that he would seek the Republican nomination for President, relatively few people had heard of the self-effacing and somewhat shy 48-year-old candidate.
Mr. Forbes, known as Steve, had never been elected to office, though he had gained attention as the architect of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's tax-cutting program in New Jersey. And for years, as a rising executive in the family publishing business, he was overshadowed by his flamboyant, motorcycle-riding father, Malcolm, who died in 1990. 
 Though hardly a household name, Steve Forbes is even with or ahead of most rivals, other than Senator Bob Dole, who leads the Republican field by a large margin in most polls in New Hampshire and Iowa. Mr. Forbes's rise from obscurity is credited less to his rhetoric than to the $7 million of his personal fortune he has spent on TV and radio advertising in pivotal states. He is now trying to get on the ballot in New York.
But as he traverses the country calling for a flat tax and term limits for politicians, Mr. Forbes's views are eminently recognizable to readers of his magazine, in which he has long propounded them. He continues to write his Fact and Comment column for the magazine, though he has turned over other corporate duties to his brother Timothy for the duration of the campaign.
At a time when many politicians are better known for shifting political beliefs than for firmly held convictions, people in the magazine industry say Mr. Forbes stands out as a man with a conviction: that economic values are the driving force in the country and that his supply-side proposals would carry the nation into a period of real growth.
"What you see in Steve is what you get in the sense that he deeply believes in those issues and writes about them all the time," said Stephen B. Shepard, editor in chief of Business Week, the archrival of Forbes.
Some editors, however, raise the question of whether Mr. Forbes has politicized the magazine with his strongly held views.
"It's abundantly clear that Steve, like his father, has a very strong point of view and that point of view is reflected in the pages of the magazine," Marshall Loeb, a former managing editor of Fortune, said. "Whether the other side is given a fair hearing would be a debatable point."
As an executive and publisher, Mr. Forbes is credited with vigorously expanding the business he inherited from his father. In 1992 Forbes became the No. 1 magazine in the industry in the number of advertising pages, ending the 17-year reign of Business Week. It was a crown Malcolm Forbes had never been able to attain. Last year Forbes was the only magazine of the 185 tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau with more than 4,000 advertising pages.
"The magazine is solid and he is solid; I wouldn't be surprised if it makes more money than when Malcolm was there," said Martin S. Walker, the chairman of Walker Communications, a magazine consultancy. Mr. Forbes is described by colleagues and employees as an old-fashioned editor with a clear vision of what he wants his magazine to be. He makes little use of marketing surveys to discover what his readers want. He does his homework, listens attentively to other opinions and then makes up his mind quickly.
In a brief telephone interview recently, Mr. Forbes said his experience as an editor had served him in good stead in campaigning.
"It's knowing your readers, sensing their needs, recognizing that what some may need may be different from what others need," he said. "It underscores the need for a clear purpose, whether it's for the magazine or whether it's knowing what are the obstacles standing in the way of voters.
"If they don't feel it's something done on conviction, they don't believe you," he said, speaking of voters and readers alike.
His decisiveness is one of his strongest attributes, people who work with him said.
"Pa would decide things very quickly but you could probably get him to change his mind, whereas Steve is more deliberate," said one of his brothers, Christopher. "Although there may have been more meetings leading up to it and much more taking of everyone's opinion, once he has made up his mind I would not want to change it."
Rich Karlgaard, the editor of ASAP, a Forbes magazine supplement about information technology, spoke of the clarity with which Mr. Forbes first described his vision for ASAP before it was introduced in 1992.
"Steve's notion of the information revolution was that it was doing deep systemic things to the economy and that information technology was going to change profoundly the way business was being done," Mr. Karlgaard said.
"He employs a sort of Socratic method in which his vision gets fulfilled but he makes you feel you concluded it, so you feel really good about it."
When Malcolm Forbes died, he left Steve, his oldest son, with a 51 percent share of Forbes Inc. and named him president and chief executive. Though Steve Forbes is in charge, the business is run by all four of Malcolm's sons: Steve, Robert, Christopher and Timothy.
They are not only close personally but by all accounts work surprisingly well together in running the business, which also owns a chain of 14 suburban weekly newspapers in New Jersey.
Since Malcolm's death, the company started FYI, an irreverent life-style publication that, like ASAP, is sent out with some editions of Forbes, and three foreign-language editions of Forbes. (The German one ceased publication earlier this year.) In 1986 the company acquired American Heritage magazine, which has since doubled in circulation and quadrupled in ad pages. The American Heritage Custom Publishing Company, a publisher of custom textbooks, was started in 1992.
One of the people who has known Mr. Forbes the longest at the company is James W. Michaels, the longtime editor of Forbes and Mr. Forbes's first boss when he started as an editorial trainee in 1970 after graduating from Princeton.
"If I had to characterize Steve it would be as an intensely serious person," Mr. Michaels said. "I think Steve has trained himself over the years quite consciously to be a good speaker, and I think the shyness that he sometimes exhibits in personal encounters vanishes when he gets up on his feet."
Mr. Forbes has also won respect as an economic prognosticator. He is the only writer to have won four Crystal Owl awards, prizes formerly given by the USX Corporation to the financial journalist whose economic forecasts for the coming year proved to be the most accurate.
What Mr. Forbes is not good at, however, is small talk.
"I won't say he has no small talk," said Christopher Buckley, the editor of FYI. "But his small talk is always consequential. You say to Steve, 'Gosh, haven't the leaves turned a lovely color?' and I can almost guarantee that you will be having a conversation about the gold standard within three minutes."

HEADLINE: Death and Deficiency in Kidney Treatment

SERIES: MISMANAGED CARE: The Perils of Dialysis - First of three articles.

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
Two hours into the medical treatment that was cleansing her blood, Sue Ellen Coffin screamed, pulled at her hair and vomited.
Pandemonium spread at the Albuquerque Kidney Center as Mrs. Coffin's screams were followed by those of five other people in intense, unexpected pain. The nurses on duty shut off the kidney dialysis machines hooked up to the six people. Most of the patients recovered. But Mrs. Coffin died within six hours. 
 The terrifying episode 15 months ago was attributed to human error: a technician had thrown a switch to rinse the dialysis machines while patients were hooked up to them. The rinse, rather than the appropriate blood-cleansing solution, had been sent into their bloodstreams, causing a breakdown of cells.
But some experts argue that responsibility for the accident may lie with the kidney center and its parent, National Medical Care Inc. The New Mexico clinic used older dialysis machines that distribute solution to many patients at once, rather than through individual stations as in newer versions. Worse, the system did not sound an alarm to warn when the wrong solution was being used, as some newer machines would.
"It's very surprising that such equipment would still be in operation," said Dr. A. Peter Lundin, a prominent New York kidney specialist. "It can be extremely dangerous, as this episode makes evident."
Such problems are nothing new for National Medical Care, by far the biggest company in an industry that offers a striking anomaly: in a medical system that is in many ways the envy of the world, an American dialysis patient is as much as twice as likely to die in a given year as a patient in Western Europe or Japan.
What has happened? How can a country that prides itself on top-flight health care perform so badly with a treatment that means the difference between life and death for 187,000 Americans?
To find out, The New York Times examined the American dialysis business, particularly that of National Medical, the most influential company in the field. The investigation included interviews with doctors, administrators and Government officials, as well as a review of medical, court, government and company records.
The investigation found an industry that uses equipment and procedures that cut costs and raise profits, often at the expense of patients' health; that operates with few rules to assure high-quality care, and that has induced doctors to play along by giving them a share of the cash.
The case of National Medical provides more than just a window on troubles in the dialysis business. It also reinforces the concerns of some patients, doctors and policy makers about the increasingly common delivery of health care by for-profit companies facing tight cost controls from private insurers and the Government.
Over the last decade, National Medical Care, a division of W. R. Grace & Company, has been accused in legal proceedings and by patients, medical experts and some Government investigators of a variety of shortcomings. These are among the actions by the company, critics say, that have led to deficiencies in care:
*Shifting the duties of doctors and registered nurses to lesser-trained and poorly supervised technicians and medical staff.
*Allowing the use of outdated, poorly maintained equipment.
*Manufacturing equipment that has not met Federal standards.
*Keeping patients on dialysis for too little time.
*Re-using disposable equipment that manufacturers -- including, for many years, a division of National Medical itself -- recommended be used only once.
*Diverting Federal money that could be spent on patient care to enrich its doctors for little work and to finance other businesses.
In lengthy interviews, executives with Grace and with National Medical Care, based in Waltham, Mass., said the company's practices were perfectly proper. The executives -- including Dr. Edmund G. Lowrie, president of National Medical, and Dr. Edward E. Berger, corporate vice president -- strongly denied accusations that patients' health might be suffering, saying that none of the company's cost-saving policies had affected its patient care. They also pointed to numerous studies the company has undertaken of patients, with the intent of improving care.
Many practices of National Medical affect even dialysis patients who are treated elsewhere. Indeed, as the industry pacesetter, National Medical, with one of every five American dialysis patients, has seen its methods copied by many competitors.
And the industry's record is not enviable. Annual mortality rates for dialysis patients in the United States hover above 23 percent, more than twice the level of Western Europe or Japan, where rates are closer to 10 percent, according to the National Kidney Foundation. Even when adjusted for age, severity of illness and other factors, the American death rates remain far above those overseas, medical experts said.
Still, some experts say National Medical and its competitors do not bear sole responsibility for this troubling record. They say that these companies have simply responded to the perverse economics of the American dialysis system.
Since the early 1970's, the Government has paid 80 percent of the bill for dialysis patients of all ages through the Medicare program. But as the cost of the Government's good intentions outstripped its willingness to pay, Washington cut reimbursements for the treatment. Today Medicare spends more than $6 billion annually -- or more than $30,000 a patient -- on dialysis treatments. Yet it pays less for each treatment than it did 22 years ago, even as inflation has more than tripled consumer prices.
Government officials attribute the decline in compensation largely to the industry's ability to thrive even with relatively low payments. It does not help that dialysis patients, as a group, have relatively little political power; almost 40 percent of them are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, Government statistics show.
Added to that mix is the prominent role played by for-profit clinics like those run by National Medical. More than 60 percent of the dialysis clinics in this country aim to make money, according to Government figures, and each of these clinic operators can keep as profit every dollar that is not spent on treatment.
In essence, cutbacks in payments have pushed National Medical to find ways to reduce its dialysis costs. And competitors of National Medical, seeing its financial success, have mimicked its policies.
The result, the critics say, has been a lowering of standards that has damaged the entire field.
"National Medical Care has largely destroyed the dialysis industry," said Perry Ecksel, president of the National Kidney Patients Association, a group organized to improve the quality of dialysis. "I think they are one of the reasons the field is suffering so intensely."
But despite the problems in the industry, Wall Street views the dialysis business as a valuable investment. A number of National Medical's competitors have sold shares to the public, and their stocks have performed strongly.
Hoping to capitalize on that enthusiasm, W. R. Grace has been preparing to spin off National Medical as a publicly traded company in the next few months. At the same time, several companies are trying to persuade Grace to sell it to them.
"The good will and benevolence of Congress has slowly been manipulated into an extremely profitable business, which Wall Street thinks of as an extremely good investment even though, clearly, the results in terms of patient health are not as good as they are in other economies," said Dr. Stanley Shaldon, a noted kidney expert who is a former professor of medicine at the University of Montpellier in France.
While National Medical executives do not dispute the fact that the American dialysis industry has a mortality rate higher than those of other countries, they argue that their company's rate is among the lowest in the nation. Indeed, Government statistics show that National Medical has a slightly lower death rate than most of its domestic competitors. Even some of those rivals agree that despite all the problems at National Medical, the company is still among the best for-profit dialysis providers in the United States.
Still, National Medical's operations have attracted the attention of the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors in New Jersey are examining whether the company manufactured and sold defective products in violation of an earlier settlement with the Government.
In the biggest investigation, Federal prosecutors in Massachusetts are examining whether the company illegally awarded lucrative profit-sharing contracts to doctors. They are also examining potential illegal billing procedures by the company. A third investigation, in Virginia, is also studying the company's financial relationship with doctors.
National Medical says that it is cooperating with the investigations, and that it does not believe it has violated any laws.
Regardless of the investigations' outcomes, medical experts said the company and its competitors should be closely studied as more for-profit health care companies operate under heavy price pressures. They say that based on the experience at National Medical, this trend offers strong reasons for concern.
"National Medical Care is sort of a harbinger to look at in terms of what is coming in the future of health care," said Dr. Lundin. "And that is somewhat ominous."
 
The Business
A Company Tied To U.S. Payments
National Medical got its start in 1968, when Constantine L. Hampers, a young instructor at the Harvard Medical School, decided to go into business. Dr. Hampers, widely known as Gus, had completed his training in nephrology, the branch of medicine dealing with the kidney, only two years before. Still, he and a colleague attracted enough investors that year to open a dialysis clinic, which became the foundation of the company.
Dialysis is a life-saving treatment first demonstrated as effective in 1960. Patients with kidney failure cannot cleanse their bodies of the wastes normally flushed by the kidneys in urine. During the treatment, a patient's blood is conveyed from the arm through plastic tubing to a plastic artificial kidney, known as a dialyzer. The dialyzer removes wastes like salt and urea from the blood, which is then returned to the body through a second tube.
Dialysis in this country usually lasts about three hours and is performed three times a week. Two-thirds of the Americans on it are under the age of 65; about a third are black, and slightly more are men than women. Without the treatment, or a kidney transplant, patients with kidney failure will die.
When National Medical opened its doors, dialysis was expensive, and so primarily benefited the wealthy. But in 1972, Washington mandated that the Government pay most of the cost for the dialysis of everyone who needs it. And National Medical was the company best prepared to take advantage of the new rules.
Today, mostly through its 624 clinics, National Medical provides dialysis to more than 40,000 people in the United States and 6,000 abroad.
In turn, the company, which W. R. Grace fully acquired in 1990 after many years as its largest shareholder, has earned handsome profits. In 1994, National Medical's dialysis-treatment division alone had revenues of more than $1.3 billion and an operating profit of $250 million, nearly 75 percent better than its earnings two years before. Its growth has come from acquisitions of competitors and growth in the number of patients requiring dialysis.
But efforts by the Government to control medical costs have made it more difficult to maintain both profits and high-quality dialysis care. In 1973, the Government fixed the maximum rate for a treatment at $135, which had it kept up with inflation would now be more than $450. Yet today, 22 years later, that fixed rate has fallen to $126 a treatment.
That has increased the pressure on National Medical and its competitors to lower their costs to remain profitable. In essence, the less a treatment costs the companies to deliver, the higher the profit.
The doctors who oversee the clinics also have strong reason to insure that costs are held down. For more than a decade, National Medical offered many of its part-time doctors a percentage of profits from the clinics, and it still bases their compensation partly on their ability to keep costs low. Those policies, which have been adopted throughout the industry, give doctors incentives to spend as little as possible on everything from equipment to clinic staffs.
Critics contend that the financial arrangements have contributed to problems at National Medical. "Based on the evidence I have seen in litigation, I must conclude that this company is driven by economics, and not by any overriding concern for the welfare of its patients," said Omer L. Rains, a lawyer in Sacramento, Calif., who has brought two antitrust suits against National Medical on behalf of competitors.
 
The Staffing
Lack of Standards For Technicians
Even with that potential incentive to cut corners, no standards on what procedures constitute good-quality treatment -- or even minimum qualifications for technicians and nurses -- have been established by the Government or the industry. Indeed, as recently as last year, the National Kidney Foundation was calling for the creation of such standards to reduce dialysis patients' death rate.
The standards for clinic staff would seem particularly important. While dialysis was once considered a complex procedure handled by doctors and registered nurses, it is now largely the domain of technicians who receive no formal medical training. A 1990 medical study found that doctors spent only about eight hours a week in dialysis clinics, and that registered nurses have increasingly been replaced by technicians and nurses with less training, a trend that troubles experts.
"We've seen some data that the number of registered nurses is directly inverse to mortality rates in dialysis," said Dr. Eli A. Friedman, chief of the division of renal disease at the State University of New York Health Science Center.
 
The Equipment
System Failures At Some Clinics
Problems began to emerge many years ago in National Medical's operations. For example, hospital records show that on the morning of Dec. 29, 1983, an alarm sounded in the intensive-care unit of Paradise Valley Hospital in National City, Calif., warning that one of National Medical's dialysis machines there was exposing patients and doctors to the possibility of electric shock.
"If this was an isolated problem we might be able to overlook the problem this one time, but this is an ongoing problem," Ed Ewing, the plant superintendent for Paradise Valley, wrote to the company. The problem "negates the protection that is built into the system to protect our patients' lives," he wrote.
As early as 1984, officials at the company's San Diego clinic, called Biomedical Artificial Kidney Centers, were warning executives at National Medical that equipment was out of date and dangerous.
Loren Macey, an administrator at the clinic, said in a letter to National Medical executives that the equipment being used to treat patients was "over 20 years old and riddled with problems." She said the equipment was not receiving any preventive maintenance and was flooding rooms with water and posing the danger of electric shock.
"The nursing and technology staff have become apathetic about working because the equipment is frustrating and embarrassing," she wrote.
Problems, from mild to severe, cropped up at National Medical clinics around the country. For example, in 1986, health inspectors cited a clinic in Washington for a range of problems that included repeated flooding from bathroom pipes. The flooding closed the clinic and left patients looking for treatment elsewhere. That same year, a patient at a company clinic in Louisville, Ky., was given the wrong blood type when the medical staff performed a transfusion. He later died.
In 1990, Medicare officials cited a National Medical center in Delaware as having poorly maintained and rusted dialysis equipment and dirty and poorly stocked emergency carts for treating patients in cardiac arrest. The regulators also found debris -- including a cigarette butt -- in the tanks of solution used to clean the equipment.
Health inspectors also found problems last year at the company's clinic in Albuquerque, which are the focus of a lawsuit on behalf of the husband and estate of Mrs. Coffin, the patient who died. After the mistake in which patients were infused with cleaning solution, health inspectors cited the clinic for failing to comply adequately with health and safety rules. In particular, the inspectors noted that the clinic failed to properly maintain equipment that could be hazardous to patients, and did not have adequate supervision by doctors.
In interviews, National Medical executives said that while isolated problems have happened, the number is small in light of the company's size. "We're dealing with hundreds of facilities, performing millions of treatments a year," Dr. Berger said. "Unacceptable events will occur. But the frequencies are small when taken against those sizes." The executives added that they moved quickly to fix problems when they are discovered.
But while quality problems like these may have involved lapses only at individual clinics, rather than system-wide, most every clinic affiliated with National Medical was touched by another problem: the manufacturing of medical supplies that fell short of Federal requirements.
 
The Manufacturing
Pricing Questions And Quality Woes
Each time a kidney patient is hooked to a dialysis machine, there is a new opportunity to make money -- and not just for the company providing the treatment. Dialysis involves an array of medical equipment, much of which has to be bought again and again. And ever since the company was young, National Medical has been getting a piece of those profits.
National Medical has long operated its own manufacturing division. For much of the company's existence, the treatment division of National Medical was required to buy much of its equipment from the manufacturing division.
The manufacturing division makes plastic dialyzers and tubing, home dialysis machines and other products, although not the larger pumping machines used in clinics. Owning the division makes sense for National Medical. As the nation's largest user of such equipment, the company can cut out the middleman by making its own equipment, lowering the cost of treatments.
But in fact, the opposite has happened. According to court testimony and company officials, National Medical's manufacturing division has for years charged its clinics above-market prices for some equipment.
In sworn testimony in 1985, Dr. Lowrie, National Medical's current president, said the higher prices were used to make the manufacturing division's profits appear plumper to satisfy Wall Street analysts.
In essence, the company transferred Federal money intended for patient care to another business for the company's benefit.
These days, National Medical has another reason for charging the higher prices. Senior executives said the higher prices charged to the National Medical clinics have allowed the manufacturing division to offer lower prices to other companies buying the equipment.
But using that equipment had drawbacks. The Government has found that National Medical frequently manufactured items that did not meet Federal manufacturing and quality requirements.
In January 1994, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it had found "a corporate-wide pattern of serious manufacturing violations" at National Medical. Specifically, the Government cited deficiencies that had resulted in 18 recalls by National Medical since 1987.
To resolve the case, National Medical, along with Dr. Hampers and two other senior officers, entered into a consent decree with the Government. That agreement required the company to meet regulatory standards in its manufacturing division. Under the agreement, equipment manufactured at two of the company's plants -- in Dublin and in Reynos, Mexico -- was banned from the United States.
Company officials said the F.D.A.'s findings were a result of new, stricter enforcement by the Government agency. They added that they thought the company maintained a strong relationship with the Government, and was now working toward being a model of compliance in the dialysis industry.
But in two inspections late last year, the agency discovered that National Medical still had problems.
For example, the inspections uncovered evidence that the company had previously found that its blood-line tubing frequently kinked, which could cause serious health problems for patients. A solution to the problem was approved by the company in March of last year, but according to Government documents, the solution had not been put into effect more than eight months later. During that time, 31 patients complained of problems caused by kinking in their blood tubing.
In recent interviews, company officials said that they were working to solve the problem of kinking lines, and that the F.D.A. had accepted their new timetable.
The F.D.A. found other problems as well. Early this year, after inspecting the Dublin plant, the agency informed National Medical that it was still in violation of regulations. To this day, equipment from that plant is not allowed in this country.
The F.D.A. also informed Dr. Hampers that the company's plant in Rockleigh, N.J., was not in compliance with standards and could be putting patients' lives at risk. In particular, the Government found that the company failed to properly identify and solve quality deficiencies in its products. Blood filters that had to be sterile were not. And F.D.A. records show that chemical residues were found in dialyzers, and had already caused health problems for at least four patients.
In a letter in March, the F.D.A. informed the company that it had violated the 1994 consent decree, and that its manufacturing problems posed a medium to high risk of causing cramps, burns, seizures, infections and other health problems.
 
The Treatments
Time Is Limited On the Machines
 Dialysis is an unpleasant and often boring process. The patients at National Medical clinics are hooked up to dialysis machines for an average of slightly more than three hours a day, three days a week.
But some experts contend that the patients would be better off if they remained on the machines even longer. A number of medical studies have reported that the longer the dialysis, the lower the death rate.
But in the American dialysis business, time is a precious commodity. Medicare pays the same amount for a three-hour dialysis treatment as it would for one that lasted five hours. The result, medical experts say, is that American companies like National Medical would be unwilling to provide longer treatments even if they thought they were needed.
"The dialysis industry in this country does not want to confront the necessity to increase the time of treatment because it decreases their profitability," said Dr. Raymon Hannah, the head of dialysis at Kaiser Permanente of Southern California. "And the people running it have told me so themselves."
Indeed, a 1991 medical study found that patients who received shorter dialysis were disproportionately treated in for-profit clinics.
The United States has the shortest average dialysis treatment of any industrial nation. American dialysis patients receive, on average, about 10 hours a week, medical experts said. German patients were treated for an average of 12 hours, and Japanese patients for 14 hours. The mortality rates in both countries are far lower than the American rate.
National Medical itself reported a level of dialysis for a substantial number of patients that was below the levels indicated as appropriate by a 1983 national study of dialysis, a 1991 company memo shows.
Company officials have acknowledged that the push to hold down costs has affected patient care. "Economic decisions can and do entail clinical compromises, and the patients will bear the cost," Dr. Lowrie and Dr. Berger wrote in an article that accompanied the 1991 study that found a link between length of dialysis and mortality..
In their article, the two doctors said dialysis providers had been pushed toward shorter treatments because of financial pressures resulting from the decline of Medicare reimbursement rates.
Still, National Medical executives said that while compensation rates did push companies to shorten dialysis, the company had conducted studies that found the length of dialysis was not a significant factor in patients' health. Instead, they said, dialysis intensity, as measured by the reduction of urea in the blood, as well as factors like patient nutrition, are more important. They said the company had led efforts to improve dialysis by closely monitoring those two areas.
Other experts remain unconvinced. "National Medical Care's position of advocating shorter hours of dialysis is resulting in premature deaths, in my opinion," said Dr. Shaldon, the kidney expert in France.
 
The Recycling
Disposable Items, Repeatedly Used
For years, the side of disposable dialyzers made by National Medical Care's manufacturing division bore a simple instruction, in capital letters, "SINGLE USE ONLY."
But despite the recommendation of its own manufacturing division, National Medical has spearheaded the re-use of disposable dialysis equipment, including dialyzers, blood lines and other equipment. And it has continued to re-use the equipment despite instances in which patients were infected, and even died, as a result of used dialyzers that were poorly cleaned.
Overseas, where the dialysis mortality rates are lower, many countries frown on re-use. For example, the practice is not allowed in Japan.
The National Institutes of Health, in studies completed in late 1992, found an increased incidence of death among dialysis patients treated at centers that re-used equipment. In response, the F.D.A. called for more studies.
National Medical has already experienced numerous problems in patients as a result of re-use. According to court records and company documents, after disposable equipment was cleaned for re-use, residues of bleach and formaldehyde were pumped into patients' bodies. One time, a doctor stopped a dialysis treatment seconds before it was to begin when he noticed a fruit fly had climbed into a re-used dialyzer during the cleaning process.
Indeed, some patients have even died as a result of equipment re-use, according to lawsuits and Government records. In 1982, at a National Medical clinic in Baton Rouge, La., 15 patients died and 12 became seriously ill after being infected by bacteria that grew inside improperly cleaned re-used dialyzers.
"Once you had a re-use procedure, it increased the risk of infection unless the equipment was properly sterilized," said Charles Moore, a lawyer who won a wrongful-death case against the company in 1988. "They didn't do that."
While the Government allows re-use, some manufacturers still caution that dialyzers be used only once. But National Medical has removed the admonition from its dialyzers, now simply warning that the equipment is sterile for only one use.
If there are potential dangers from re-use, why do National Medical and other companies do it? Critics say the driving force is money.
"There is nothing about re-use that helps the patients," said Larry Wolford, a former National Medical regional administrator who failed in an attempt to begin a company that did not re-use equipment. "It's just a matter of corporate bottom line and profitability. N.M.C. was the first to push the interests of patients aside in favor of profits."
For each treatment, the amount saved is small. Dialyzers range in price from about $8.50 to more than $30, while other disposable equipment, like blood tubing, can cost as little as a few dollars.
But in practice, the policy has a huge effect on the bottom line. According to company documents, National Medical clinics are allowed to re-use a dialyzer as often as 30 times, which saves huge sums.
For example, if the company paid an average of $20 for dialyzers, and re-used them an average of 15 times, National Medical would save about $130 million annually compared with what it would have to spend if it used a new dialyzer for each of its almost seven million treatments. That amount is more than the company's total after-tax profit in 1994. And that does not include the savings from re-using other equipment, like tubing.
National Medical's practice of re-using disposable dialyzers is now accepted in most of the industry as a necessity, given the limits on Government compensation. Indeed, the F.D.A. is putting together standards for the proper ways to re-use disposable dialysis equipment.
For their part, company executives said that if done properly, re-use is safe. They also said that the practice prevents a problem in patients called first-use syndrome, a reaction occasionally caused by the initial use of a dialyzer.
But critics contend that first-use syndrome is little more than an excuse by National Medical and others to justify the expense-saving re-use of disposable equipment. First-use syndrome is rare, they say, and is virtually eliminated if dialyzers are properly cleaned before use.
In a 1994 letter to the Food and Drug Administration, 18 foreign kidney specialists agreed that there was little evidence that first-use syndrome should be a concern. On the other hand, the doctors noted, re-use has been shown to result in an increased incidence of chronic low-grade infections among patients.
Even Dr. Shaldon, a doctor who in the early 1960's pioneered the idea of re-use for dialyzers, says he now thinks the procedure should be prohibited. "The sole reason for re-use is economic," he said. "And when done badly, it can kill you."
Some experts noted that the re-use of other disposable equipment, like blood lines, had not been studied sufficiently. "I have concerns about the safety of re-use of blood lines," said Dr. Hock Yeoh, chief of nephrology with Kaiser. "They are difficult to clean, and I'm not sure it is worth saving $2 to $3 at the expense of the safety of the patient."
Experts added that with the quality of the medical staffs in clinics going down, the dangers of re-use grow. "The average re-use procedure is done by people who have not much more training than a McDonald's hamburger flipper," said Dr. Friedman of the State University of New York. "And it is far too easy to have confusion or a mistake."
Despite the controversy, patients have no choice but to re-use dialyzers at National Medical clinics. Under Medicare rules, dialysis providers cannot accept offers from patients who want to pay for new dialyzers out of their own pockets. And experts and patients say that those who refuse to allow the re-use of disposable equipment are told to take their business elsewhere.
"National Medical Care has had the attitude that if you don't like what we're doing, then leave the unit," said Mr. Ecksel of the National Kidney Patients Association. "But usually, there is no place for most of these patients to go."

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Helping Cities to Revive Industrial Sites

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
With the support of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, state legislators, local officials and real estate developers in scores of cities have begun to redevelop thousands of acres of urban industrial land that was long neglected because of concerns over legal liability for pollution and contamination.
These so-called brownfields, which are concentrated in the Northeast and the Midwest, have lingered as trash-strewn eyesores while businesses have shifted their operations to pristine locations in the suburbs and the countryside. 
 Government officials, with few objections from environmentalists, say that many old industrial sites, which are close to transportation and communication hubs, can be easily cleaned and transformed into attractive commercial properties.
"Brownfields affect a community's sense of hope," said Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. "There is something depressing when a block is fenced off and desolate for years."
Redevelopment has begun in scores of sites across the country, still only a fraction of the land idled by environmental concerns. A Congressional study this year concluded, "The range of estimates of brownfield sites in the United States varies from tens of thousands to nearly 450,000 sites, and the associated number of acres involved is equally uncertain." Chicago alone has identified more than 2,000 brownfields in its metropolitan area, while Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes Cleveland, estimates that 167 parcels qualify as brownfields.
To move these efforts along, 25 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have adopted laws or regulations that ease the threat of liability and adjust pollution treatment standards. And the Environmental Protection Agency has taken a series of administrative measures, including removing thousands of less-polluted properties from its list of possible Superfund sites, in an effort to spur commercial development.
One of the most potentially valuable brownfield sites is a former steel mill here on the South Side, a nearly square-mile tract of vacant lakefront property with a spectacular view of downtown skyscrapers. If the USX Corporation, which owns the property, can navigate the environmental, bureaucratic and political obstacles ahead, the company believes the site could command an $80 million price tag.
Other projects are under way across the nation. Private developers are working on a paper recycling mill on the site of the old Harlem River rail yards in the South Bronx. In Ohio, Cuyahoga County has helped convert an old Cleveland factory into a bustling warehouse. And the Environmental Protection Agency is backing demonstration projects in cities like Bridgeport, Conn., Baltimore, Rochester, N.Y., St. Louis and Sacramento.
 
Overall Enthusiasm, And a Few Concerns
Environmentalists generally applaud the efforts to reclaim brownfields, noting that anything that helps slow urban sprawl eases air pollution by reducing driving. But some of them are concerned that in the rush to develop old industrial properties, some environmental safeguards may be brushed over.
"One thing to be concerned about is the issue of future use of a property," said Carol Andress, an economic development specialist in Washington with the Environmental Defense Fund, a New York-based advocacy group. "If a property is cleaned to industrial standards, what is to prevent it from flipping to residential use? That may involve deed restrictions or zoning restrictions."
Another issue, Ms. Andress said, is posed by brownfields next to residential properties. "Will contamination from the site affect nearby housing and will kids play on it?" she asked.
Until this year, developers and lenders had particularly avoided 38,000 sites listed as possible targets of action under the Federal Superfund law, which says that anyone involved in the management of a property can be responsible for the entire cost of cleaning. While these sites were, theoretically, the most severely polluted in the nation, many had in fact long since been passed over by the Environmental Protection Agency as not contaminated enough for its attention. But as long as they remained on the list most real estate executives and lenders considered them untouchable. "It's like a bad credit rating that never goes away," Ms. Browner said.
Lenders were particularly skittish, fearing that they could be forced to pay for cleanups or end up saddled with worthless property if the developer disappeared. A survey by the American Bankers Association in February 1993 showed that 83 percent of smaller banks had refused to make loans to projects because of concerns about environmental liability.
 
At Every Turn, The Superfund Issue
To help the reclamation effort, the environmental agency this year removed 25,000 of the least-polluted sites from the list, a step that local officials have hailed as a great leap forward. The sites would still require some type of cleanup, but by being removed as targets of the Superfund, they would not be subjected to that program's tougher standards.
"The problem is the whole issue was framed by Superfund," said Henry L. Henderson, Chicago's environmental commissioner. "The shadow of crushing liability and the fear of lenders made it impossible for small businessmen to get loans to develop urban properties."
The result, Mr. Henderson said, was an unintended effect of a law designed to protect the environment: the abandonment of urban areas by businesses that built factories, warehouses and commercial centers on unspoiled greenfields in rural areas, draining badly needed jobs from inner cities.
"Brownfields are largely artifacts of regulation," said Joseph Dufficy, a Superfund specialist, in the E.P.A.'s Chicago office. "Until we change, people will continue to go to greenfields."
Meanwhile, economic development specialists as well as representatives of environmental groups have been depicting urban sprawl as a waste of natural resources and a means of depriving low-income city dwellers the opportunity to grasp the lower rungs of the economic ladder.
"The economic distress of America's inner cities may be the most pressing issue facing the nation," said Michael E. Porter, a professor who specializes in economic development at Harvard Business School. "The lack of businesses and jobs in disadvantaged urban areas fuels not only the crushing cycle of poverty but also crippling social problems, such as drug abuse and crime."
Professor Porter said inner cities have some natural economic advantages, like a strategic location, with transportation and communications facilities already installed. The South Works steel mill, with its prime lakefront location, is seen by many as a prototype. For more than 100 years, it produced the structural beams used in the high-rise buildings of Chicago and other cities in the Midwest. But its steel production ended in 1992 and since then the owner, USX Corporation, has been tearing down factory buildings and preparing for cleanup.
Despite the tract's size, USX officials said they did not expect particularly difficult contamination problems. It had never appeared on the Superfund list.
"There was common ownership here for 100 years so we knew what had happened there," said J. David Moniot, general manager for environmental affairs at USX's steel subsidiary. He said the company found what it expected: underground fuel tanks, electrical devices contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, and some areas with excessive amounts of lead.
"There are five areas with lead levels in excess of the standard we negotiated with Illinois E.P.A.," Mr. Moniot said. He said the company plans to clean the entire 600-acre site to a level suitable for residential development, at a cost of about $8 million and expects to get a "no further action will be taken" letter from the state agency next year.
Under an agreement with state officials in the Upper Middle West, regional officials of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency have issued a memorandum of understanding saying that if state standards are satisfied, the Federal agency will have no further interest in a site.
While not legally binding, the Federal assurance offers comfort to buyers and lenders.
"So much of the problem has been fear," said David L. Rieser, who is a lawyer with Ross & Hardies, a Chicago law firm, and represents industrial groups like the Illinois Manufacturers Association. "If you can get past fear to reality, you can solve problems. If you can reduce environmental problems to a dollar amount, then it just becomes a part of the development process."
 
Tackling the Problems With 'Common Sense'
Local, state and Federal officials have been cooperating to get some prime but polluted sites back into operation.
In Cleveland, for example, an old plant that cleaned metal parts sat idle, despite its proximity to two interstate highways because the owner of the bankrupt company lacked the money to remove a solvent, trichloroethylene, that had leaked into the soil. Like many such chemicals, the solvent poses a number of risks to humans, but technology has been developed to remove it while meeting standards established by the Ohio environmental agency.
The site was attractive to a prospective tenant, a warehousing operation, because of the transportation links. Under the terms of a new state law, officials of the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission, developed a cleanup plan the owner could afford based on rent payments from the warehousing company.
"We have no regulatory power, so we just helped the owner through the process," said Virginia Aveni, a program manager with the commission. The treatment program, which involves pumping ground water and removing the solvent, will take about a year to complete, Ms. Aveni said.
When the clean up is completed, the Ohio E.P.A. is expected to issue a "covenant not to sue." And, under the agreement with the Federal E.P.A., Federal officials have said that they will accept the Ohio ruling.
Concerned that stringent environmental regulations not be degraded, some representatives of environmental groups say pollution is just one of a host of problems that tend to inhibit brownfield development. "You cannot say that malfunctions of the Superfund are the main problem," said Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist with the National Resources Defense Council, who is involved with a paper recycling project in the South Bronx.
Mr. Hershkowitz explained: "A developer is usually facing much higher energy, water, construction labor and waste disposal costs in urban areas than in the suburbs. And there is usually a lengthy, labyrinthine permitting process in cities. In rural areas, you do not even have to file an environmental impact statement."
Ms. Browner said she views brownfields as a "common sense" matter. "We look at them and ask, 'What makes sense here?' " The agency has financed 50 demonstration projects nationwide at a cost of up to $200,000 each, to explore cleanup methods.
"We are going to learn more about how the redevelop these properties," she said. "We are going to develop tools that can be applied across the country."

HEADLINE: Price Wars on Personal Computers Are Already Heating Up Sales for Holiday Season

BYLINE: By LAURIE FLYNN 

 BODY:
There may have never been a better Christmas to buy a computer. There may have never been a Christmas when it was such a bruising battle to sell one.
Seductive prices and consumers' eagerness to be on the Internet have set off a stronger-than-expected start for home PC sales this holiday season. But the intense competition among computer makers is putting the squeeze on companies like Packard Bell Electronics, which is fighting to maintain its lead against companies with better-known names and deeper pockets, like Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard. 
 The latter are offering machines comparable to Packard Bell's at only slightly higher prices.
And on Friday, there was a new round of price-cutting by Apple Computer, whose machines once cost much more than other brands, but can now compete head-on in the home PC market.
"People typically spend about $2,000 on a home PC, and it's been that way a few years," said Larry Mondry, who is executive vice president of merchandising for CompUSA Inc., the nation's largest computer retailer. "What's changed this year is how much you get for your money."
Last year Packard Bell dominated the home market because of its low prices and because it was one of few retail providers of PC's using Intel's Pentium chips. A top-of-the-line Packard Bell home PC sold for about $2,500 and had a 90-megahertz chip, 8 megabytes of random-access memory and a hard drive with a storage capacity of 540 megabytes.
This year, Mr. Mondry said, a comparable Packard Bell model sells for $1,600. And that buys a 100-megahertz Pentium chip, which means faster processing time, the same 8 megabytes of RAM, and a full 850 megabytes of hard-drive capacity.
Much of this price trend is simply in keeping with the traditional movement of the silicon economy, where technology's costs fall while performance soars. But this season, more companies are competing in the home PC arena, a fast-growing segment -- although that growth has cooled to about 25 percent, compared with last year's 50 percent rate.
When the final 1995 sales figures are available, experts expect that sales of PC's to homes in the United States will approach the 10 million mark -- with half of those sold in the last three months of the year.
There were no firm sales figures yet for the season, but the anecdotal evidence indicated that consumers were not hesitating to open their wallets. A survey of stores conducted last week by the trade magazine Computer Retail Week found that 76 percent said that business was better than anticipated.
Last holiday season, a flood of new multimedia software titles helped propel the sale of PC's equipped with CD-ROM drives. Multimedia capabilities are still in demand, but this season everyone is intent on exploring the Internet and its World Wide Web, so the modem -- crucial for electronic communication -- has emerged as a standard component of virtually all new home PC's.
"Anything that has to do with the Internet is selling," said Abe Brown, spokesman for J & R Computer World of New York, one of the largest independent computer superstores in the nation. "More and more people are flocking to buy computers to get on it."
In addition to wanting to use the Internet, home PC buyers are buying high-performance systems to run Microsoft's new Windows 95 software, as well as games and entertainment software.
And consumers are demanding that these systems last. Unlike business buyers, who replace their computer systems every few years, consumers expect to own the same machine five years or longer, and so tend to buy machines with high-performance microprocessors that can accommodate future advances in software.
"Customers seem to be saying, 'Whatever you buy is obsolete the minute you buy it, so why not get as much bang as you can for your buck?' " said Andrew Neff, an analyst for Bear, Stearns in New York, who said that the weekend after Thanksgiving he saw people buying computers "like groceries" at the CompUSA store in White Plains.
Another factor in the surge in sales of powerful PC's is the fact that many customers are already buying their second or third home PC's, according to the research firm IDC/Link Resources.
In the past, computer makers and sellers underestimated consumer demand for powerful machines. In 1994, supplies of the Pentium-powered models tended to sell out early.
"Everybody was scared to death by what happened last year," said Larry Sennet, a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard, which began selling PC's to the home market this year. "We see no indications there are going to be huge shortages."
Mr. Mondry of CompUSA agreed. "This is the most plentiful Christmas season on record," he said. Still, if purchases accelerate this month, supplies of the most popular equipment could run low, analysts said, and regional independent stores could find themselves unable to restock as easily as big chains like CompUSA that have more influence with manufacturers.
The few spot shortages so far have tended to be of the higher-performance models -- Pentium machines or Apple Macintosh's with PowerPC chips.
Analysts said last week that Packard Bell had built more of the less powerful 75-megahertz Intel computers than consumers were buying. And several analysts said that Packard Bell's financial problems had forced it to fall into arrears with Intel -- to the tune of $470 million.
Packard Bell issued a statement last Thursday saying that it was having "a great year" and denying that it had an oversupply of 75-megahertz machines -- but skirting the Intel question.

HEADLINE: Clinton Showing Strength Among Michigan's Voters

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LINCOLN PARK, Mich., Dec. 2

 BODY:
This state may be known for automobiles, soul music and Big Ten football, but it also has an impressive record as a political mirror: For decades, the vote for President in Michigan has been nearly identical to that of the entire nation.
That is why politicians are taking special note of a small renaissance for President Clinton here. After two years of slipping and sliding, Mr. Clinton is enjoying newfound popularity in the state, according to interviews with politicians, academics and voters as well as the latest opinion polls. In a whimsical sign of the President's rising acceptability, a bumper sticker spotted near here proclaimed, "Clinton! At Least He Cares," instead of the more familiar, "Impeach Clinton." 
 Mr. Clinton's standing in Michigan, a racially mixed microcosm with heavy industry and substantial agriculture, is important not only as an indication of how he is doing elsewhere. Michigan, which the President won, with 44 percent of the vote in the 1992 election, is also one of a handful of pivotal states where White House officials say he must prevail if he is to be returned to office.
"For the first time since December of 1992, the majority of Michigan voters say Clinton is doing a good job -- that is a major shift to go from a negative job rating," said Ed Sarpolus, a leading Michigan pollster based in Lansing.
In the latest poll by Mr. Sarpolus's organization, EPIC/MRA, released this week, respondents in Michigan who described themselves as likely to vote gave the President a 52 percent positive rating, while giving the Republican Congress only a 34 percent positive rating. Much of the growth in support for Mr. Clinton, Mr. Sarpolus said, has been among moderates, women and the elderly -- voters who might find the Republicans' budget proposals threatening.
These findings are all the more significant because this is a state where Gov. John M. Engler, a conservative Republican, swept to re-election last year and helped elect Spencer Abraham, the state's first Republican Senator in 16 years.
Nowhere is the increased comfort with Mr. Clinton better demonstrated than in this working-class enclave in what is called the "downriver" area south of Detroit, which was established as home to automobile workers in the 1930's and 1940's. Once overwhelmingly Democratic, and still home to many conservative Democrats, the residents have tended to split their votes more in recent years and, in 1992, helped Ross Perot win a respectable showing.
In interview after interview here in Wayne County, people approached at random were so full of praise for Mr. Clinton that they sounded like they were actors paid by the Democratic Party. Many said that six months ago or so they were not as effusive.
"It seems to me right now that the Democrats are for senior citizens and Medicare," said Dominic Mazzola, 72, a retired steam engineer for the local school system, who added that while he "could go either way" he expected to back Mr. Clinton next year. "The way I read it, the Republicans want to do away with everything that helps the little person."
Understanding of the President's earlier missteps, Mr. Mazzola said: "He's been serving an apprenticeship. Whoever we put in there is going to have to start from the bottom and work his way up. He's going to get himself in a mess also."
More than anything else, the increased support for Mr. Clinton seems to stem from the Democrats' public relations offensive to convince voters that he would protect them from what he depicts as Draconian budget cuts proposed by Republicans. It is also a big help to Mr. Clinton that the automobile industry has bounced back. Unlike last year when the President seemed to get no credit for the economic recovery, voters here now seem willing to give him at least a grudging pat on the back for it.
But the President's support is all the more striking because of the enormous popularity of Governor Engler, whose programs are widely credited as an inspiration for Speaker Newt Gingrich's economic and welfare proposals. Many people were disdainful of Mr. Gingrich and the Republicans in Washington, but had no criticism for the Governor.
Fresh from the day shift, Chuck Inman, an electrician from Ford, put on his bowling shoes at the Fort Park Bar & Bowling here and explained that he backed Mr. Perot but may well vote for Mr. Clinton this time. "He's starting to look better," Mr. Inman said. "He's looking more like a President. I'm glad he's standing up to the Republicans on the budget."
While voters' feelings were mixed about Mr. Clinton's plan to send troops to Bosnia, Mr. Inman, 41, said, "I'm all for that if it helps keeping the peace. But if people get hurt, the opinions about Clinton might change."
Bruno Bucca, 49, the owner of a hairdressing salon who also voted for Mr. Perot in 1992, has recently become a booster of Mr. Clinton. "He's the most underrated President we've had in years," he said. Using words that in the past have not been commonly associated with the President, except among hard-core Democrats, Mr. Bucca added, "I like that he stands for what he believes in -- like with the budget. It took a lot of guts."
One sign of the Republicans' growing concern about Michigan is that the Republican National Committee last week bought additional advertising time on television in the state to run a commercial that ridicules Mr. Clinton as only offering what the announcer describes as "double talk" about balancing the budget.
"They've decided that Clinton is just doing too well in the polls compared to where they thought they had him a year or two ago," said William S. Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics, a nonpartisan newsletter. "Republicans are nervous -- and they should be."
Republicans acknowledge that they have suffered here, but dismiss Mr. Clinton's rise as fleeting. "We know in the short run you may suffer negative ratings," said Suzy Heintz, the Michigan Republican chairwoman. "But once people see the good that comes out of the balanced budget, and interest rates going down, they're going to be extremely happy with what's going on in Congress and in Washington." Noting that Governor Engler recovered from rock bottom approval ratings after making hefty budget cuts, she added, "We've been through this before. The Governor bounced back."
Michael W. Traugott, a professor of communication at the University of Michigan who specializes in media and politics, noted that even with Mr. Clinton's strength, he faced a hard fight given that the Governor and the Republican majority in the Legislature are against him. "John Engler is not going to ease up and be complacent," he said.
But for now, Mr. Clinton's rise is of concern to candidates like Representative Dick Chrysler, a freshman from central Michigan who was the only Republican in the state to pick up a House seat last year. He faces a strong challenge from a former Democratic state Senator, Debbie Stabenow. Recent polls show that Mr. Chrysler, a former automobile manfacturing executive, could be in trouble, and analysts say he is not helped by his association with Speaker Newt Gingrich.
"Dick Chrysler is trying to establish an independent persona," said David W. Rohde, a political science professor at Michigan State University. "But if somehow the Republican difficulties went away, Chrysler would be in better shape."
Things do not look any better for the top of the ticket. The EPIC/MRA poll of 600 likely voters, conducted Nov. 15 to Nov. 21, found that if the election were held today, 53 percent of Michigan voters would lean toward Mr. Clinton and only 40 percent toward the leading Republican candidate, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
But it is a long, and no doubt rocky, path to next year's elections, and Democrats are well aware that their improved fortunes may be short-lived. Much depends, of course, on the resolution of the budget machinations on Capitol Hill and events that no one can predict.
Whatever unfolds, some voters here say they are sticking to Mr. Clinton not out of great admiration but because of their dislike of Mr. Gingrich. Jackie Milot, who works at Mr. Bucca's hair salon, rated Mr. Clinton "a fair President" but said she will probably vote for him.
Referring to Mr. Gingrich's complaint that Mr. Clinton ignored him on Air Force One during a trip back from Israel after the funeral of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, she said: "What sticks in my mind is this thing of Gingrich coming out of the back door of the plane. He's a man in a good position. He doesn't have to act like a child."

HEADLINE: Panama Changes Tune to 'Yankee Don't Go Home'

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
Almost from the day they first arrived here in 1903 to build the Panama Canal, Americans have contended with chants of "Yankee Go Home!" But now, with the United States actually poised and apparently eager to leave, Panamanians are suddenly having a change of heart.
The turnabout stems from the growing realization here that when the United States leaves on Dec. 31, 1999, as required by the Panama Canal Treaties of 1977, Panama will, for the first time in its history, be left to fend for itself. 
 As a result, the desire to eliminate the last remnants of a colonial enclave in the heart of this small nation is giving way to fears of losing the economic and political stability the American presence has long guaranteed.
"Who do we know, and who has always protected us from our own mistakes and given us prosperity?" asked Ramiro Chang, a 28-year-old accountant here. "The gringos, that's who. We're used to having them around, and if they stay, that would be the best safeguard against any future problems."
According to a poll published in mid-October by the newspaper El Panama America, 86 percent of Panamanians now want United States military bases to remain here after the year 2000. Those in favor said a continuing American military presence was necessary both for "the security of the canal" and of Panama itself, as well as for the economic benefits the installations confer.
Studies by the United States military and other economic analysts estimate that the 8,800 American troops here, plus the even larger number of dependents with them, generate 22,000 jobs and inject more than $350 million annually into the Panamanian economy. The Panama Canal, currently run by a binational commission but scheduled to pass to Panamanian control at the end of 1999, yielded $462 million in revenues last year, most of which was immediately reinvested in the 52-mile waterway.
Bowing to those realities, President Ernesto Perez Balladares has put aside ideology and cautiously agreed to "exploratory talks" with Washington starting some time next year about extending the American military presence here. His party, the Revolutionary Democratic Party, or P.R.D., was founded by Brig. Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera, the nationalist strongman who negotiated the canal treaties, and later, under Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, became even more virulently anti-American.
[The talks were originally scheduled to begin on Nov. 30, but on Nov. 22 the two sides announced a postponement. That action followed two weeks of protests by university students here and the internal resistance of some P.R.D. leaders, but Panamanian officials maintain that has no connection with the delay.]
With the cold war over and bases in the United States being closed as a result of budget pressures, the Clinton Administration has shown little enthusiasm, at least in public, for remaining here. Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the senior officer of the Southern Command, the United States military's regional headquarters for Latin America, recently said there was "no vital U.S. interest" here that would require a military presence into the 21st century.
In another sign of Washington's hardball approach, General McCaffrey has also said he wants to move the Southern Command from its headquarters in Quarry Heights, overlooking the capital here, to a new site in Miami well before the departure date set by the treaties.
"We expect to be there on July 4, 1998, at the latest," he told reporters here in September, adding that he thought a September 1997 withdrawal would be even better.
Panamanian officials say they have been told that other military sites, ranging from bases to schools, may also be handed over ahead of schedule. That saves the Pentagon money, but, more pointedly, also serves to remind Panama of the importance of the American presence here and of the benefits that will accrue should the two countries agree on a prolongation.
"There are a lot of guys at SouthCom who say Panama needs to feel the pain of us leaving," said an American civilian who works closely with the military. "They are really enjoying this, watching the Panamanians squirm, after so many years of being told they weren't wanted here."
The relationship with Panama is one of the most intimate and complicated the United States has anywhere in the world, and has been from the very start. This country owes its very existence to an act of imperialism on the part of Theodore Roosevelt, who on Nov. 3, 1903, engineered Panama's secession from Colombia to win approval to build the Panama Canal.
"If not for Roosevelt's chicanery, we would still be the most remote and backward province of Colombia, instead of the prosperous trading society we have become," a prominent businessman here said. "But it is hard to admit to ourselves that an American President is the father of our country."
Since then, thousands of Americans have settled and married here, becoming a minority group as easily recognizable as the Chinese, Arab, Jewish and Indian merchants who also help give Panama a cosmopolitan character. Nearly a century of United States presence here has also left Panamanians with distinctly American tastes, ranging from a passion for baseball and basketball to grocery stores that stock items like maple syrup and root beer.
In addition, many Panamanians fear that their country, which last year abolished its army, would be defenseless against foreign threats without a continuing American security blanket.
"I'd rather have a dictator imposed by the gringos than one imposed by the Cali cartel, and I fear that is what could happen," said one of the country's leading businessmen, speaking on condition of anonymity.
During a trip Mr. Perez Balladares made to Japan in September, Asian investors indicated to him that they too would welcome an American military presence beyond 1999. The Panamanian Government has increasingly been looking to companies from Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong to fill at least part of the economic gap the American departure is expected to cause.
For those reasons, even Panamanians who do not want the American military to stay on understand the deep-seated appeal of the idea.
"It's hard to get out from under Daddy when Daddy has been around so long," said Roberto Eisenmann, the founder of La Prensa, the country's leading newspaper. "But we have to become adults some day."
In an interview, Mr. Perez Balladares said he saw no contradiction in his party's sudden willingness to sit down and haggle with Washington. The Panama Canal Zone, he noted, has passed into history, and with it the discriminatory features that fed nationalism here, like separate pay scales for Americans and Panamanians and the authority of American police, laws and courts.
"Torrijos did away with a colonial situation, which is totally different from what we have today," he said. "Now we are partners with the United States, with mutual interests in the area, and we want to build on that."
Some within his party have accused Mr. Perez Balladares of betraying the legacy of General Torrijos, but he dismissed those charges. "I lived closer to Torrijos than almost anybody else in Panama, and I know for a fact that if he were in my shoes today he would be doing exactly what I am doing," he said.
The presence of American bases after 2000, he argued, would not prevent Panama from being sovereign and self-sufficient. "Does that mean Japan has an umbilical cord to the United States because it has bases?" he asked. "No, of course not."
Panamanians now recognize, he said, that the relationship between the two countries is so intertwined that it resembles "a mixed marriage between a very tall guy and a very short girl" in which both are willing to overlook their disparity in size.
"I don't want my people to be left out of the world," he added. "I want them to get on the train to development, and obviously that requires the United States."

HEADLINE: Bronx Group Signs Recycling Company for Mill Project

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
After a court battle stalled its plans for a year, a group seeking to have a paper recycling mill built in the South Bronx has taken the first step toward construction of the $400 million operation at the old Harlem River Rail Yard, officials said last week.
The group, the Bronx Community Paper Company, has signed an agreement with the Prins Recycling Corporation of Fort Lee, N.J., to build and operate a $25 million wastepaper sorting plant on a 19-acre tract just north of Randalls Island, said Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental group that has been seeking developers for the project. 
 "The agreement is a demonstration of serious interest by an established recycling company and formalizes the negotiating process," said Randy Daniels, a project manager of the Empire State Development Corporation, the economic development arm of the state. The corporation has been working with the Bronx group on the project, which would recycle office paper from New York City's trash.
The sponsors of the project, however, still have to complete a deal with a paper company to build a main recycling plant before they can get the financing to proceed with the entire project.
The mill, which has been embraced by residents, environmentalists and government leaders, is expected to bring 700 jobs and other economic benefits to the South Bronx. It also includes a plan to provide housing, day care and health services for the workers.
The project had been stalled for a year by a lawsuit brought by a Manhattan lawyer who is a railroad buff. The lawyer, John McHugh, objected to the plan because he said the yard should be used as a transportation hub. By the time a judge ruled against the suit in August, the mill's two principal investors had withdrawn from the project.
Now, supporters of the project say they have taken a small but major step toward getting their plans back on track by signing the agreement with the Prins Corporation. Many of the project's environmental, zoning and building permits had been issued by the city and state after a lengthy public review process.
The Bronx group is negotiating with two international paper mills to build the main plant and hope to strike an agreement with one of them by the end of the year, according to officials with the city's Economic Development Corporation, which has been working with the group to revitalize the South Bronx.
The sorting plant would be built in conjunction with the larger recycling plant, and construction could start by the spring after financing is arranged, city officials said. Pulp from the sorting plant would be used to run the $375 million mill.
Fred L. Prins, chief executive officer of Prins Corporation, one of the largest waste paper processors and brokers in the Northeast, said he is confident that the rest of the project will fall into place.
The Bronx Community Paper company was created by the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association, a leading community organization in the South Bronx, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. The groups came together when Yolanda Rivera, chairwoman of Banana Kelly, approached the council to help lure nonpolluting industries to the South Bronx.
But Mr. McHugh, who has appealed the court decision, is not convinced of the project's viability.
"I don't know how this justifies using the last piece of property in all of New York state west of the Westchester County line that can be developed as a rail intermodel as a paper mill. It's ridiculous."

HEADLINE: New Effort by U.S. and Vietnam to Return Boat People Home

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Seeking to end a long epilogue of the Vietnam War, Washington is working quietly with Hanoi to create a program that would persuade the remaining 40,000 Vietnamese boat people in Southeast Asian refugee camps to return home.
The initiative is being undertaken by the National Security Council and the Departments of State and Justice in hopes of avoiding more public debate and violent protests in the camps by detainees who do not want to return to Vietnam. 
 The plan comes in response to legislation sponsored by Representative Christopher H. Smith, a New Jersey Republican, that would bar the United States from providing about $25 million to the United Nations to help resettle the Vietnamese. The migrants fled their homeland, many in rickety boats, after the defeat of South Vietnam in 1975.
In talks that began one month ago in Hanoi, "we laid out an approach to the Government of Vietnam, and they made clear that they shared our goals and would try to come up with a workable way to do it," said a Clinton Administration official working on the plan. A formal response from Hanoi is expected this month.
Sergio Vieira de Mello, a senior official of the United Nations refugee-relief agency, called the American initiative "most welcome."
Under the plan, the Vietnamese would be transported to Ho Chi Minh City under the auspices of the United Nations. There, they would be guaranteed interviews with United States immigration officials.
Those who qualify as political refugees -- like people who worked for the United States or its allies during the war, or who were religious leaders, or who were imprisoned in "re-education camps" after the war -- would be allowed to come to this country. Others, like North Vietnamese fishermen who fled for economic reasons after the war, would have no choice but to try to make a new life in their old country.
Administration officials say as many as several thousand of the Vietnamese in the camps worked for United States military and intelligence services during the Vietnam War and have reason to believe that they will be allowed to resettle in the United States.
Tens of thousands of others may be persuaded to return to Vietnam, if they can be convinced that they will not be persecuted. The United Nations, which is responsible for monitoring the treatment of the tens of thousands of Vietnamese who have been returned home, says it has not documented any cases in which returning migrants have been treated harshly.
In a statement this year, Representative Smith said he had proposed the legislation because of concerns that many of the Vietnamese in the camps had been unfairly denied refugee status, but the United Nations has denied this.
The Vietnamese are the last of the so-called boat people, more than one million of whom fled their country in crowded vessels after the war's end. Most resettled outside of Asia, mainly in the United States. Those still in detention camps in Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines eke out an unhappy existence.
Their homeland, once a symbol of endless war and impoverished communism, now has one of the world's fastest-growing economies. And the time has passed when the United States and other wealthy nations willingly open their arms to immigrants. Refugee officials say it is unlikely that new migrants will receive the unconditional and generous welcome once accorded the Indochinese.
Rejected for resettlement after extensive interviews by United Nations refugee officials, thousands of the boat people in the Hong Kong and Southeast Asian camps had accepted the inevitable and were returning home voluntarily under United Nations supervision until this summer.
Then word of the Smith legislation created a stir in the detention camps, creating new hope among some Vietnamese there that they would not have to go home. Some renewed violent protests, and others reconsidered their plans to return voluntarily. Refugee officials worried that it could not only set off another exodus of boat people but also could create false hopes among the migrants that they would be allowed to come to the United States.
The House of Representatives passed the legislation, earmarking $30 million to bring some of the Vietnamese to the United States. But the legislation, part of a foreign affairs appropriations bill, is now languishing in the Senate.

HEADLINE: Ciudad Juarez Journal;
At U.S. Door, Huddled Masses Yearn for Better Pay

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico

 BODY:
Sometimes Ana Serratos pauses outside a McDonald's restaurant here, but she resists the temptation to stop in. Fast food is way beyond her means.
A Big Mac, medium Coke and fries cost $3.05, and for Ms. Serratos, who earns 35 cents an hour wrapping tape around bundles of electrical wires in one of Juarez's assembly plants, that is a full day's wages. 
 "What people in your country make in an hour, we work a whole day for," Ms. Serratos, 32, said to an American visitor during a recent family gathering in one of Ciudad Juarez's dirt-street suburbs. "These companies from the United States and Japan don't pay people what they ought to. They come to kill us with work."
Then she paused, reflecting. "But we have to recognize that they're important for Juarez."
During the last 25 years, 310 mostly foreign-owned assembly plants, called maquiladoras, have set up operations to take advantage of cheap labor and special tax breaks. They have come to dominate life in this sand-blown city across the Rio Grande from El Paso. Like Ms. Serratos, six of her siblings work in maquiladoras, and there are thousands of other families also marching to the daily rhythm of the assembly plants, which employ more than 150,000 of Juarez's 1.2 million residents.
The city is growing fast, and Juarez's 40-year-old Mayor, Ramon Galindo, who belongs to the pro-business National Action Party, says he hopes to attract still more maquiladoras to Juarez. But in an interview in his City Hall offices he also said the fact that a vast majority of taxpayers earn the minimum wage of about $18 a week or not much more is a critical problem for the city.
"We're creating an enormous mass of wretchedly poor people," he said.
Mexico's minimum wage, which varies from region to region, is to increase by 10 percent on Dec. 4, bringing Juarez's minimum up to about $20 a week. The increase comes after a 30 percent decline in Mexican wages this year.
Because most Juarez residents have little to give, and the maquiladoras are required to give little, the city raises only meager tax revenues, Mr. Galindo said. And to make matters worse, the federal Government keeps 90 percent of the minimal taxes the maquiladoras pay to Mexico City.
"Our problem is, where is the money going to come from to provide services for all these people?" Mr. Galindo asked.
Juarez's entire 1995 budget was just $37 million, said Jesus Abrego Lopez, Juarez's economic development director. Even if the city were not to grow at all and were to spend its entire budget for 15 years on paving projects, many streets would still be unsurfaced in 2010, Mr. Abrego said.
Other huge challenges confront the city. Juarez's working-class sections, where many residents already must buy their drinking water by the jug from tank trucks, now sprawl across the desert horizon, and the water is running out.
"We need huge investments to dig deeper wells, but the city doesn't have the money," said Vicente Jaime, managing editor of the newspaper Norte.
Along a potholed track off the main highway near the Juarez airport, five young men, all maquiladora employees, were repairing a car. Their wages, they said, ranged from 68 cents an hour, which Gerardo Hernandez earns for punching holes in electric motor covers, to the $1.06 an hour Ivan Villanueva makes as a maintenance mechanic in a seat-cover factory. Theirs were good jobs, they said. And what is attractive about Juarez, they said, is that there are plenty more available.
"If you don't like one job, you can walk down the street and get another," said Ruben Hernandez, Gerardo's brother.
Cesar de la Rosa, 26, a foreman in an appliance repair plant, listed the benefits of maquiladora employment: workers qualify for membership in Mexico's social security system, which provides low-cost medical care, and another Government agency extends accessible home loans. Mr. de la Rosa said he also gets five days of vacation each year, with his full $37-a-week salary paid.
Two miles away in another working-class enclave, seven of the Serratos siblings were listening from the edges of their father's cramped living room as Ana talked about life in the maquiladoras. The smell of sausage and chiles wafted from the kitchen, and Ana's brother Jorge, 24, moved from glass to glass, pouring beer.
Jorge betrayed a hint of bravado when he said that as a fork-lift driver in a plant called Productos Electronicos Diversificados, he earns a good deal more than a mere assembly line worker: 53 cents an hour.
A visitor asked whether there were unions in Juarez, and Jorge looked puzzled.
"What's a union?" he asked.
A brother-in-law, Ramon Lopez, helped out from a couch. "That's a situation where if you have a problem at work, people try to help you out with the boss."
There was a pause.
"No, I haven't heard about anything like that," Jorge said.
Ana described her commute to her plant, a two-hour battle that involves two ramshackle buses and requires her to rise at 4 A.M. to arrive at 7.
Her older sister, Leticia, said, "Look how you have to suffer to earn a few pennies!"

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: DIGITAL COMMERCE;
The Rand Corporation salutes E-mail as the new foundation of democracy.

BYLINE: By Denise Caruso 

 BODY:
DESPITE open hostility in today's political arena toward new taxes, a well-known public policy research organization has bravely published a sweeping thesis: not only does every American citizen need access to electronic mail to fully participate in a democratic society, but the Federal Government should make sure that industry helps foot the bill.
That proposal by the Rand Corporation comes in a newly released report, "Universal Access to E-Mail: Feasibility and Social Implications." It can be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR650/. 
 The report is the result of a two-year study begun before the current budget-cutting Congress was elected and at a time when Vice President Al Gore and many other people in the Government were calling for a National Information Infrastructure -- also known as (wince) the "information superhighway" -- a new public network that would change the way business was conducted around the world.
While most of the attention was on building a network to support commerce, Rand began to examine how access to a critical technology like E-mail might affect American society. Its study questioned what would happen if E-mail was a key feature of the National Information Infrastructure initiative, widely available "at modest individual effort and expense to (almost) everyone in the United States" -- much as telephone and postal services are inexpensive and easy to use.
Based on Rand's study of on-line communities (like Latino Net in San Francisco and the Blacksburg Electronic Village in Virginia), and what it discovered about how citizens use E-mail today, the report concluded that "use of electronic mail is valuable for individuals, for communities, for the practice and spread of democracy, and for the general development of a viable national information infrastructure."
Even if one is willing to accept the report's basic premise -- that access to E-mail will promote democracy -- there are still many practical considerations to be addressed before launching the entire United States population into cyberspace.
The biggest sticking point is how to pay for it.
Tora Bikson, one of the study's authors and a psychologist in Rand's Social Policy Department, said that an amount equal to about $100 a household, or about $1 billion a year, would be sufficient to amortize E-mail service (and the required computer equipment) for the poorest 10 percent of the nation's population.
To raise that money Rand proposes a system in which communications and information service providers would be charged an E-mail tax that would go into a special fund. The Federal Government would then dispense vouchers from this fund that qualified low-income individuals could use for signing up for an E-mail service or buying the necessary computer equipment.
Even though a new Federal tax is likely to find few proponents in industry or Congress, Dr. Bikson contends that an E-mail tax could go a long way toward helping the Internet achieve "universal" status quickly. "The assumption is that if businesses can really operate through the Net and reach almost everybody in the country, everyone benefits," she said.
But assuming we agree on how to finance universal access, who then provides every citizen in the nation with a unique E-mail address? Do we each get a national E-mail identity card, or maybe require that our E-mail address be our Social Security number?
Dr. Bikson concedes that that is a mind-boggling problem. "The report didn't recommend a specific addressing mechanism, just that one was needed," she said. "In fact, we encouraged the U.S. Postal Service and possibly the Federal Communications Commission to consider some mechanism to make sure that there is a always a default address for people."
Even if the addresses could be assigned, a larger question remains. Are we ready, as a society, for ubiquitous Government-mandated electronic communication? Not yet.
E-mail today does not have the same constitutional free-speech and privacy protections already afforded our other two ubiquitous communications vehicles: telephone calls and first-class letters. Business E-mail can be -- and often is -- read by employers. And while commercial E-mail providers promise not to read their customers' mail, there is currently no law against their doing so.
And unlike other countries, particularly those in the European Union, the United States does not restrict marketeers from compiling and selling data bases filled with information about how individual consumers use on-line services.
In addition, free speech on the Net is far from assured. There are several bills pending in Congress right now (see Voters Telecom Watch at http://www.vtw.org/billwatch/) that would severely restrict what people can say in either private or public forums on the Internet. Despite Rand's finding that virtual communities are powerful tools for democratic discourse, it will be difficult for communities to form under constant threat of censorship.
Dr. Bikson says that Rand is "not trying to turn a blind eye to the darker side of cyberspace." But the optimistic bent of the Rand study's conclusions is provoking controversy in various electronic forums, where telecommunications and public policy experts are debating everything from the study's central thesis -- that universal E-mail is indeed a boon to society -- to related issues like economic and racial equality, taxation, literacy and employment.
Ideally, these critical and clarifying discussions will soon find their way beyond the Net and into the mainstream. We all might learn something by inviting the millions of Americans who don't yet have E-mail to take part in the debate.

HEADLINE: IN BUDGET TALKS, NO HINT OF PACT ON HEALTH ISSUES

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Less than two weeks before the next budget deadline, President Clinton and Congress have yet to begin serious discussion of compromises on Medicaid or Medicare, issues that are essential to reaching a budget accord.
The shape of the nation's health policy is at the heart of the debate between the White House and the Republicans. After a week of fruitless budget negotiations, the two sides are expected to return to the table on Tuesday, just 10 days before the expiration of the Government's temporary authority to spend money, when the prospect of another partial Government shutdown looms. 
 There can be no deal without some grand compromise on Medicaid and Medicare, the health programs for the poor and the elderly, which are growing much faster than the budget as a whole. Thirty-seven percent of the savings the Republicans seek to balance the budget by 2002 come from those two programs, which many conservatives see as dinosaurs from the Great Society.
G. William Hoagland, the Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, said tonight that "there has been absolutely no discussion that has gotten into the specifics of policy for Medicare or Medicaid" in the budget negotiations.
The committee chairman, Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, still hopes for an agreement, Mr. Hoagland said, but detailed discussions will not begin until the Congressional Budget Office re-estimates Federal spending for various programs in the light of new economic assumptions.
The disagreements on health issues in some cases result from political posturing and in others reflect deep philosophical divisions. Medicare has generated the fiercest public disputes, but some experts consider the disagreements over Medicaid to be much greater, and perhaps unbridgeable.
On Medicaid, the biggest question is whether to preserve a basic Federal guarantee of health coverage for the needy, as the Administration insists, or whether to let each state design its own program with a lump sum of Federal money, as the Republicans propose.
In the midst of the shouting, it is easy to overlook areas of potential agreement. In their plan to overhaul Medicare, the Republicans encourage competition among private health plans, both to control costs and give consumers greater options.
These are the principles President Clinton tried to apply to the entire health care system in his ill-fated health plan in 1993 and 1994.
Still, the two parties come to the current negotiations from very different starting points. Republicans bring a fervent commitment to scale back the Federal Government and eliminate its deficit in seven years. The Clinton Administration, while acknowledging current political realities, still remembers its heady dream of universal health insurance coverage, a vast expansion of the social welfare system.
"We still hold fast to our goal of expanding coverage," said George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to the President. "The worst thing you can do is begin to take coverage away."
Republicans see their Medicaid plan as a chance to return power to the states while saving money. The Administration says the proposal will rip holes in the safety net, causing the number of uninsured to soar.
This is a huge disagreement about money. The Republicans want to cut projected spending on Medicaid three times as much as President Clinton. Republicans would curtail it by $163 billion, or 17 percent, over seven years; Mr. Clinton would reduce it by $54 billion, or 6 percent.
It is also a dispute about the role of the Federal Government. In keeping with their campaign to shift power to the states, the Republicans would give each state a fixed amount of Federal money to finance health care for the poor, with few Federal requirements. These block grants would make Medicaid costs more predictable for the Federal Government, and give states much more flexibility. But coverage for the poor would become less certain, largely at the discretion of the states and ultimately determined by how long the money holds out.
Medicaid is now an entitlement, guaranteed to anyone who meets the Federal and state eligibility criteria, based largely on income and assets. Mr. Clinton sees the preservation of that safety net as an appropriate Federal role. By contrast, the Republicans' budget bill says the Medicaid law "shall not be construed as providing for an entitlement."
There are safeguards in the Republicans' budget bill. It says states must provide Medicaid to three groups: poor pregnant women, poor children under the age of 13 and disabled people. But the bill does not require states to provide any particular health benefits.
The White House and Congress have different ideas about how to control Medicaid costs. The Republicans would impose annual limits on total Medicaid spending. But Mr. Clinton would, for the first time, limit the growth of how much the Federal Government spends, on average, for each Medicaid recipient.
A limit on per capita spending would help control costs and allow Medicaid to expand if necessary because of a recession or an epidemic. In other words, poor people would still have a right to coverage.
White House documents show that the President's proposal would calculate the average amount of Federal Medicaid money spent on a beneficiary in each of four eligibility groups: children under 21, adults 21 to 64, elderly people and the disabled.
The average Federal payment for each category would be allowed to increase each year by the average annual change in economic output over the previous five years, before adjusting for inflation.
Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said: "Block grants would lock in existing inequities in the distribution of Medicaid money. On a per person basis, New Hampshire gets more than three times as much as California." By contrast, he said, the President's proposal for a "per capita cap" controls costs while guaranteeing health care.
But Republicans in Congress and Republican governors vehemently oppose the idea. Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., a Virginia Republican who supervises Medicaid as chairman of the Commerce Committee, said: "The per capita cap would create the worst of all possible worlds. It keeps the entire Medicaid program intact -- mandatory entitlements, a mandatory package of benefits and Federal micromanagement of the states -- at the same time it limits Federal spending.
As for Medicare, the program for the elderly and disabled, President Clinton and Congressional Republicans will find it difficult to compromise after exchanging angry charges and countercharges for six months. This issue has generated some of the angriest standoffs, like the dispute over how much Medicare premiums should increase.
But the policy differences on Medicare, while numerous, are not as profound as on Medicaid.
The Republican budget promises to preserve the traditional Medicare program, which allows patients free choice of doctors and hospitals. But it would also offer Medicare beneficiaries new options, encouraging the use of health maintenance organizations.
The ultimate goal, Republicans say, is to control Medicare costs, which have been rising 10 percent a year, and to prevent the bankruptcy of Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Supporters of this approach say H.M.O.'s will be less expensive because they discourage unnecessary services and emphasize ways to prevent disease and disability. The Government would give private health plans a lump sum of Federal money for each Medicare beneficiary they enroll, eliminating the commitment to pay for whatever services the person requires.
The Administration has supported managed care for the population at large, and White House aides suggest that there is room to talk about the Republican proposals for structural changes in Medicare, if the negotiations ever get to that point. But these aides also assert that the Republicans' safeguards fail to protect the people who prefer the standard Medicare program, or to insure that the private marketplace works.
Democrats say they fear private health plans will woo the healthiest people, leaving the traditional Medicare program as the last refuge of the sickest and oldest Americans, many with high health care costs. This will happen, the Democrats assert, while the Medicare program is coping with major cutbacks mandated by the Republican plan.
The White House and Congress also expect a fight over medical savings accounts, one of the new Republican options. Under this proposal, elderly people could use their share of Medicare money to set up tax-free savings accounts to pay routine medical bills, while purchasing a high-deductible, catastrophic plan to pay the rest. Critics say this could become a huge giveaway to the healthiest, wealthiest Americans, who could then use the standard Medicare program when they got sick.
Democrats say they want more consumer protection for the elderly in the new health care marketplace. A lobbyist close to the Administration said: "Clinton, having been through this before, understands the paradox -- that as you move to a more market-oriented approach, you need more regulation, not less."
Some analysts say there should be a compromise on the savings expected from Medicare. President Clinton has proposed $124 billion of savings over seven years, while the Republicans have proposed $270 billion.
Gail R. Wilensky, an economist who was in charge of Medicare and Medicaid under President George Bush, said, "Conceptually the ability to compromise is there," probably with savings of about $200 billion.
But compromise will be difficult for the Administration. Many Democrats on Capitol Hill are implacably opposed to Medicare reductions of that magnitude; some are even uncomfortable with the Administration's target.
In addition, many health policy experts are cautioning the Administration about the cumulative impact of the cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid, saying that they could force hospitals to close and services to deteriorate. "How much do you want to pull out of the health system in terms of dollars?" asks Stuart H. Altman, a professor of national health policy at Brandeis.
This is where the pre-1994 Clinton, driven by a grand vision of health care reform, meets the post-1994 President, on the defensive with a Republican Congress bent on balancing the budget.
Advocates for the elderly say they keep reminding Administration officials what their legacy will be if they acquiesce in these cutbacks.
"These are the issues that have been raised very sharply and very privately: that we can't go back, we can't lose ground, we've got to hold on to the coverage we have," said Jeff Eagan of the Long-Term Care Campaign, a coalition of 143 organizations from religious groups to advocates for the disabled.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Sends Mixed Signals on a New Shutdown

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Senior Republican lawmakers and their majority leader, Senator Bob Dole, sent varying signals today about the chances of a new Government shutdown over the budget. But all seemed to back away somewhat from optimistic remarks Mr. Dole made on Saturday.
About 800,000 Federal workers were sent home last month when their departments and agencies were without money because Congressional Republicans and President Clinton were at an impasse over the budget. After a week Congress and Mr. Clinton agreed to a temporary financing bill to return the Government to full operations. 
 That accord ends on Dec. 15, and with budget negotiations apparently going nowhere some politicians are discussing the possibility of a new shutdown.
In South Carolina on Saturday, Mr. Dole said that people should not worry about a shutdown's ruining their holidays. Today, he qualified that while remaining optimistic.
"I can't predict what the President may do, but as far as Bob Dole is concerned I think it'd be a mistake" to shut down the Government, Mr. Dole said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation." "But if he doesn't come forth with anything and make any serious offers, then we have to face up to a shutdown on the 15th. I don't think it should happen. I don't believe it will happen. I'm going to ask the President to be as serious on the budget as we've been on Bosnia."
Even with another partial shutdown, essential services would continue. Congress has passed 7 of the 13 appropriations bills, including one for the Defense Department.
Republicans say they want to balance the budget in 2002 by reducing spending on historically Democratic efforts like Medicare, Medicaid and farm programs. The Republicans are also proposing to cut taxes $245 billion.
Mr. Clinton says cutbacks would devastate essential social programs. He and other Democrats contend that the tax cut would be too big and would help mainly the richest Americans.
The two sides met last week but were so divided that the talks were canceled for Friday, Saturday and Monday. Leaders said the negotiations would reconvene only after the Republicans had new economic projections.
The senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota, said on "Meet the Press" that he believed that the budget could be balanced in seven years, but that Mr. Clinton should hold out for a better deal.

HEADLINE: Blaze Suspect Held in Death Of Firefighter

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC 

 BODY:
A man who said he set fire to his bed because his wife had left him, then walked away as the flames consumed his Queens tenement, has been charged in the death of a firefighter who was killed in the blaze, officials said yesterday.
The man, Moises Antonio Blandon, 27, an unemployed auto mechanic, was arrested late Saturday and charged with two counts of second-degree murder and arson in the death on Oct. 8 of Peter McLaughlin, 31, a firefighter with an elite rescue unit, Fire Department officials said.
If convicted, Mr. Blandon faces a maxi 
 mum penalty of 25 years to life in prison.
Mr. McLaughlin was searching for anyone trapped in the Long Island City building when a wave of flame roared over him inside the fourth-floor bedroom where the blaze had been set, Fire Commissioner Howard Safir said.
"Blandon admitted to setting the fire," Commissioner Safir said. "He has admitted that he set fire to a mattress in the apartment."
Mr. Blandon told investigators that depression over the breakup of his marriage drove him to set the fire, officials said.
"He tried to put the mattress out, he claims, and when he could not, he just closed the door and left," Mr. Safir said. "He notified no one. And this resulted in the death of a hero."
Rescuers found Mr. McLaughlin's body huddled behind a door, his arms raised as if to fend off the flames. Eight other firefighters were hurt battling the flames in the building at 40-04 36th Avenue.
A native of Northport, L.I., Mr. McLaughlin was the third firefighter to die this year from injuries suffered in the line of duty. An unmarried Marine Corps veteran, he had been with the Fire Department for seven years and was the youngest member of Rescue Company 4, a Woodside-based unit whose members search through burning buildings for victims.
Fire officials said Mr. Blandon told investigators that he started the fire by throwing a match on the bed.
"He certainly was trying to hurt somebody," Commissioner Safir said when asked whether Mr. Blandon intended to harm his wife. "We're not sure exactly what his motivation was. That will come out as the investigation continues."
Michael Vecchi, the department's Chief Fire Marshal, said Mr. Blandon's wife and two children were not living in the apartment at the time the fire was set.
The blaze was started about noon on that Sunday. It burned for 45 minutes before smoke set off an alarm in another apartment and firefighters were summoned, the Commissioner said.
"When you close a door in an unvented apartment and the fire continues to burn without anybody being notified of it, it can extend very quickly to the rest of the building," the Commissioner said. He said the fire spread into the space between the building's ceiling and roof before the Fire Department arrived.
Commissioner Safir said that forensics specialists from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had pinpointed the place in the building where the fire began.
"They determined that it was indeed an arson fire," Mr. Safir said. The Federal investigators routinely join city fire marshals in investigating possible arson fires, he said.
Mr. Vecchi said mattresses and other items, including a bunk bed, were stored in the room where the fire originated because it was the only part of the apartment where water was not leaking through the ceiling.
Commissioner Safir refused to say where Mr. Blandon had been between the time of the fire and his arrest. "He didn't come forward," Mr. Safir said.
Mr. Blandon is from Nicaragua and has been in the United States about seven years. His family had lived in the apartment about six months before the blaze.
The news of Mr. Blandon's confession seemed to do little to raise spirits at Rescue Company 4, where Mr. McLaughlin had worked for about three years.
"The wounds will never heal," said Joseph Tufano, a firefighter chosen to speak for the rest of the members of the Rescue Unit. "The scars will always be there."

HEADLINE: Gore Visit To Signal New Status For Pretoria

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore is not signing any earth-shaking accords on his trip here this week, but senior diplomats say his visit is meant to signal a more serious United States attitude toward the new South Africa.
Washington, they said, intends to treat South Africa not as another aid-hungry African nation but as a continental powerhouse and an emerging multiracial democracy that could serve as an example to smaller countries overwhelmed by ethnic hatreds, from Rwanda to Bosnia. President Nelson Mandela, for instance, recently led the international criticism of Nigeria for executing human-rights activists. 
 "Now there's a Government we like -- big on human rights and diplomacy, and also a country that carries weight in Africa," a senior diplomat said.
The diplomats said the Clinton Administration would see South Africa in much the same light as it does Russia, a view that implied an understanding that such countries will have rough spots on the road to democracy.
Mr. Gore, who is to arrive on Monday night, is officially here to discuss with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki ways to strengthen the relationship between South Africa and the United States.
The two men are meeting as part of a new binational commission and will sign agreements creating committees to discuss business development, the environment, energy, education and science. The United States has similar binational commissions, which are essentially vehicles for regular meetings between vice presidents, with Russia and Egypt.
They will also sign an agreement allowing the Peace Corps to operate in South Africa for the first time. One diplomat suggested that the seemingly routine accord would be the most important item signed.
"In 10 years, those Peace Corps volunteers are going to be in crucial positions in the media and in Washington," he said. Their South African contacts and expertise, he added, will help cement relations between two countries that now barely know each other.
Also, once completed, an agreement between civil aviation negotiators could allow more direct flights between Johannesburg and New York, he said. More flights could increase tourism and help spread favorable word of mouth about the country.
Mr. Gore's delegation includes Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary and Mark D. Gearan, director of the Peace Corps.
Mr. Brown's committee is already holding talks about commercial ties. American investment in South Africa, after a slow start in 1991, has surged this year, according the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington.
On average, five new or returning companies are opening offices here every month. Levi Strauss, Nike, Heinz, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Chrysler, Dell Computer and Ebony magazine have all recently announced expansion plans.
But substantial barriers to American investment remain. Chief among them is the general poverty of Africa that makes investment in Asia or Latin America easier.
Other barriers are more malleable. As McDonald's recently found out, South African trademark laws still reflect the era of sanctions, when preserving South African companies was the rule of the game. So do the high tariffs and tight laws that keep currency in the country. And the economy is still dominated by monopolies and cartels, like the mining companies and South African Breweries.
The Clinton Administration has selfish reasons for wanting private investment to succeed in South Africa. It is committed to providing $600 million in aid over three years -- mostly for education, health care and democratic institutions -- but Congress wants to pare that back.
Mr. Gore is also planning to visit Botswana to reassure smaller African nations that they will not be forgotten in the shadow of South Africa, which has a bigger economy than all of the rest of southern Africa combined and the only formidable military.
Military talks are deliberately not part of the scope of the binational commission, diplomats said. But South African officers are training with American troops in Europe, and the United States may sell South Africa some C-130 transport planes.
The Clinton Administration accepts that the South African Government will keep up ties with countries like Cuba and Iran, a diplomat said.
"The Iran tie is economic -- it's about oil," said the official. "The Cuba one is emotional -- they supported them during the liberation struggle."
There is one regret a senior diplomat expressed: "The Russians' offering to put a South African in space. That was a beauty. Wish we'd thought of that."

HEADLINE: Governor Pataki's Jobs Shuffle

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki is trying to take state jobs away from Democratic urban centers like New York City and move them to Republican areas upstate. His administration calls it reinventing government. Political payoff seems much closer to the mark.
The plan, which has been percolating for nearly a year, involves transferring state workers to empty I.B.M. facilities in Kingston and Binghamton. The Governor says he wants to save money by merging the state's far-flung data-processing operations in these buildings. Efficiency and cost-cutting are always desirable. But Mr. Pataki's aides went about it in a most peculiar way. 
First they picked the sites that would receive the transferred workers -- two areas that had given Governor Pataki substantial support in the last election. Then they told the workers they were being moved. Then they requested bids for a feasibility study on whether merging the data-processing operations was a good idea. The study is still underway.
The Governor claims his plan will save $50 million, a figure he has stuck to resolutely, even though he has reduced the number of workers to be transferred and promised to add new state jobs to the mix. In fact, the only solid figures so far are the $13 million Mr. Pataki has agreed to pay I.B.M. for the buildings and $37 million he has committed for renovations.
New York City, which has the fewest state workers per capita of any area in the state, is scheduled to lose 500 jobs to Binghamton. Since Binghamton also has an unemployment rate about half the size of New York's, this makes Mr. Pataki a sort of reverse Robin Hood of economic development.
Any nonpartisan gloss on the plan was shattered when Governor Pataki quickly retreated on a plan to move 4,100 Albany jobs to Kingston. Albany may be a Democratic stronghold, but those state workers lived in the suburbs, and were represented by the State Senate Republican leader, Joseph Bruno.
Senator Bruno howled, and the Albany workers are now to be left alone, unless they volunteer to be transferred. Instead, Mr. Pataki convinced an Albany bank to relocate several thousand workers who are employed under a state tax-processing contract. Losing those jobs may also hurt the city of Albany, as much as losing the others, but the tax workers are not represented by the powerful state employee unions.
New York City's Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, does not have Mr. Bruno's clout with the Pataki administration, but the Governor should back off from this inept plan anyway. If the empty I.B.M. facilities are a drain on the upstate economy, the Governor should get his economic development authority to work on finding commercial tenants for them. But the data-processing workers should not be moved anywhere until that feasibility study is conducted.
If merging the operations does turn out to be a good idea, the new sites should be chosen objectively, using criteria other than the number of voters who went Republican in the last election.

HEADLINE: 'Insurance Capital' Hartford Finds Itself Without Its Net

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 2

 BODY:
A decade ago, the idea that Aetna Life and Casualty Company would sell the heart of its business, its casualty and property divisions, would have been unthinkable.
"To put it delicately," said Paul Shipman, an aide to Hartford's Mayor, Michael P. Peters, "people would have thought you were crazy." 
 But on Wednesday, when Aetna announced that it was doing just that, selling those divisions to its crosstown rival, the Travelers Group Inc., meaning a net loss of up to 1,500 jobs, few experts in the insurance industry were surprised. It was just the latest slide in the business landscape of this city, which still proudly boasts of being the "insurance capital of the world," even though that claim is beginning to ring hollow.
The change can be seen in numerous small daily examples. At 5 P.M, there is no longer the parade of insurance employees walking to their homes in the Asylum Hill and Frog Hollow neighborhoods surrounding the insurance giants. Longtime employees like Lorenzo DeBenedictis, an Aetna systems administrator, no longer speak proudly about where they work. "We used to refer to it as Mother Aetna," he said. "We don't anymore."
The local United Way collected less money this year than it did four years ago. When Michael Douglas's character in the movie "An American President" referred to Hartford as the world's insurance capital, the audience at the Showcase Cinemas in nearby Berlin laughed bitterly.
Today, at least one of every 10 Hartford buildings is abandoned.
"We're a ghost town," said Nick Carbone, a leading city developer and a former Deputy Mayor.
The 1994 census data show that Hartford's population has fallen to its lowest level since World War I: about 124,000, down from a high of 177,000 in 1950. According to the United States Bureau of the Census, Hartford had the largest rate of population loss of any major city in the country, losing 11.1 percent from 1990 through 1994.
The slump is partly a result of a general exodus to the suburbs and layoffs in the military and banking industries, but equally significant are the deep cuts that have swept the insurance companies here, a move that ended the long-held conviction that a job at a Hartford insurance company was a job for life.
Over the last five years, the city's coterie of blue-chip insurance companies, once thought immune to severe turns in the national economy, have made their first extensive layoffs here in their history.
State labor statistics show that insurance employment, which is found predominantly in the Hartford region, dropped 12 percent, to 70,400, this year from 82,600 in 1991.
There have been other setbacks that will be difficult to overcome. The Travelers, once a pillar for the region, was bought in 1993 by Sanford I. Weill, the Wall Street investor, who moved the company's headquarters to Manhattan and has on occasion threatened to transfer more operations from Connecticut.
Another industry stalwart in Hartford, Connecticut Mutual Life, is merging with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, of Springfield, Mass.; the new company is to be based in Springfield.
In the coming months, Aetna is expected to announce more reductions, following layoffs and consolidations costing more than 5,000 jobs over the last few years.
To be sure, the decline in the industry's presence here should not be interpreted as its death knell.
Top political officials and business leaders say that the national wave of mergers and acquisitions has naturally affected Connecticut companies. A result, they add, is that many of the Hartford-area concerns are completing a retooling and are poised for new growth.
Aetna's sale of its property and casualty businesses is a case in point. The company now has $4 billion in cash to expand its more profitable health care and financial services operations. In turn, if projections bear out, the new company to be formed by the merger of the Travelers and Aetna's property and casualty divisions will have the third largest total of property and casualty premiums in the country. Travelers plans to keep the business in Hartford.
"What makes a strong local economy is to have strong local companies," Joyce Oberdorf, an Aetna spokeswoman, said. "As we grow, employment opportunities should be strengthened. We've been here 150 years, and we're not leaving."
Still, it is widely acknowledged that the city and state can no longer take the industry for granted, and that it needs a policy to encourage its growth here. Gov. John G. Rowland and Mayor Peters remain confident that this can happen, and they have been meeting with insurance leaders to find ways. "I think we are at a turning point," Mr. Rowland said. "If we are not responsive and pro-active, then we lose."
Yet even those who are most optimistic about the industry's future here admit that it will never return to the days of a few decades ago, when an Aetna employee could walk to the bank across the street and get a mortgage just by showing his company identification.
The chief executives of the insurance companies, along with the top executive of the United Technologies Corporation (owner of Pratt & Whitney), were known for decades as "the bishops," aggressively looking after the city's welfare and regularly meeting to discuss its future.
The lives of thousands of employees were based on the principle that the company would take care of them. "It's a radical change," said Mr. DeBenedictis, 43, who joined Aetna right out of high school in 1971.
Mr. DeBenedictis is unsure whether his job will exist next year, and he said that his fears are shared by many in the company. "Doom and gloom" is the way he described the morale at work.
Employees once felt a tremendous loyalty to the company, he said: "Now, you feel loyalty to yourself." He said he once felt proud to tell people he worked at Aetna; now, he sometimes ducks the question.
The change can be seen on the streets of the city. Veronica Airey-Wilson, a Hartford City Council member, recalled that at the start of the 1990's, she would see as many as 60 acquaintances walking from the three big insurance companies to their homes nearby. "None of those people are here anymore," she said.
In 1991, the United Way of the Capital Area collected $26 million; this year, $21 million. "Many of those who contributed are now on the receiving end," Susan Dunn, its vice president, said.
Mr. Carbone, the real estate developer, who now is president of the Connecticut Institute for Municipal Studies, said that the pain caused by the downsizing was too often being overlooked. Several friends, he said, have died from heart attacks that he attributed to the stress from the failing local economy. He suffered a heart attack himself when Aetna stopped leasing a building from him last year.
"If I were Mayor of Hartford, I would hire the best lawyers out there and make it clear that there'd be no mergers unless the companies make an explicit commitment to Hartford," he said. "These people have an obligation to employees, and they have to be forced to meet it."
Indeed, Governor Rowland has scheduled a meeting for Mondaywith the heads of Aetna and Travelers to discuss the proposed sale, which needs state approval, and to insure that adequate steps are being taken to protect employees.
Ms. Oberdorf, the Aetna spokeswoman, said that the agreement includes a strong safety net for all its employees who may be affected. A spokeswoman for Travelers said the company was unable to provide an executive to discuss its future commitment to Hartford.
Yet there is also a sense that the insurance industry's downsizing here is driven by forces that go beyond the state's control.
Lewis Mandell, who as a professor at the University of Connecticut Business School issued a report on the Hartford insurance industry earlier this year, said he did not expect substantial future job growth.
Dr. Mandell, now a dean at Marquette University, noted that some companies found it difficult to recruit young people to Hartford and that several executives' remarks suggested they had little commitment to the area.
"There's one thing keeping them in Hartford," Dr. Mandell said: "They have big pieces of real estate that no one wants to buy."
His study, which included an analysis of labor trends and confidential interviews with executives from eight local companies, showed that the higher-end jobs were staying in Hartford and increasing in pay, but that less-skilled jobs were being transferred to other states or countries with lower labor costs. Those jobs were also being "out-sourced" to local contractors that provide the services at a cheaper price.
Hartford's claim to being the insurance capital was never that it controlled a dominant share of the business -- both New York and London have much more -- but that the concentration of major companies was so high in such a small area. While insurance accounts for 1.9 percent of jobs nationally, it constitutes more than double that in Connecticut, with 4.7 percent, and far more in the Hartford area, where most of the Connecticut insurance jobs lie.
While many argue that Hartford's pool of skilled labor will attract new insurance business, Dr. Mandell was less confident. Many tasks, like forms processing and sales, no longer need a skilled work force at headquarters, he noted. Insurance companies are increasingly opening satellite offices to be closer to customers around the nation, he said.
In recent years, a number of other insurance centers have emerged, most notably in Des Moines, and in some respects, they have eaten into Hartford's pre-eminence.
"Is there a single city in the United States that has a greater insurance concentration than Hartford?" Dr. Mandell asked. "I think the answer is no; it still has the crown."
"But I don't know how many of these jobs will remain there," he added. "The Hartford area is still very much at risk."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 7, 1995, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the decline of the insurance industry in Hartford referred incorrectly to the abandonment of buildings. Hartford officials say 1 building out of 30 has been abandoned -- not 1 in 10, a figure supplied by Nick Carbone, president of the Connecticut Institute of Municipal Studies.


GRAPHIC: Insurance has long been the dominant industry in Hartford, but as companies have merged and streamlined, Hartford has suffered.
 
1982 -- Connecticut General, based in the Hartford suburb of Bloomfield, merges with INA Corporation. A Connecticut General subsidiary, the Hartford-based Aetna Insurance Company, is dissolved and 1,000 jobs in Hartford are elimated.
 
1990 -- Hardford-based Aetna Life and Casualty announces plans to elimate 2,600 jobs, the majority in the Hartford area.
 
1992 -- Hartford-based Travelers Insurance announces pland to lay off 5,000 workers by the end of 1994, the majority in the Hartford area.
 
1993 -- Travelers is acquired by Primerica. The deal costs Travelers 300 jobs.
 
1994 -- Aetna Life announces plans to elimate 4,000 jobs, half of them in the Hartford area.
 
1995 -- Hartford-based Connecticut Mutual Life announces a merger with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. Headquarters of the merged company will be in Springfield, Mass., and more than 400 jobs in Hartford will be elimiated.
Chronology: "A CHANGING INDUSTRY: The Insurance City No More"
 Travelers announces plan to buy the property-causalty division of Aetna Life for $4 billion. The companies project the elimination of 3,300 jobs, 1,500 of them in the Hartford area. (pg. B2)

HEADLINE: Orange County Bankruptcy: The Poor Feel the Most Pain

BYLINE: By By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Dec. 1

 BODY:
One year after startling America by declaring its improbable bankruptcy, Orange County is stumbling through a fiscal recovery that has generally placated its affluent middle class and faraway Wall Street but has shifted much of the burden to the county's growing numbers of poor.
The initially frightening predictions of a financial calamity that would spread across the land have proved overblown. Instead, Orange County has passed through phases of shock and defiance and has entered a comfort zone that many here say is part denial, part business as usual and part pushing the costs of the crisis on to those who have the least voice in civic affairs. 
 The county has settled into what many experts here describe as a kind of ominous stability. "I'm not sure we've dealt with some of the fundamental problems that caused this bankruptcy," said William J. Popejoy, a retired banking executive who served as the county's chief executive for several months after the crisis erupted. "We haven't improved accountability in the government; we haven't shared the costs very evenly."
In the aftermath, the county has tried to recoup its losses in a lawsuit against Merrill Lynch & Company, its main securities firm. Indeed, Merrill Lynch, which denies any wrongdoing, is the target of more than 10 lawsuits as a result of the bankruptcy. [Page D1.]
The county's bankruptcy was the result of an attempt to avoid a harsh fiscal reality: With property taxes falling, the county pushed to maintain services by increasing its interest income from investments. Its treasurer bet aggressively -- and ineptly -- in the bond market, losing $1.7 billion when interest rates turned upward early last year. Rather than express remorse at having fumbled away such a vast sum, the county has faced down Wall Street's threats and forced many of its bondholders to accept at least a one-year delay in repayment.
Last April, a newsletter published by James Grant, a New York bond market expert, warned that Orange County might not be able to sell new bonds for a decade. In fact, it has been back to the market already, backed by an expensive form of bond insurance, and investors are likely to buy even more next year. "Markets don't hold grudges," Mr. Grant now says.
Those who successfully opposed a sales tax increase last spring predicted as much, saying the county could muddle through without more cash. Indeed, lawyers for the county say the government is likely to emerge from bankruptcy by June. Credit rating agencies are already saying they will consider raising the junk grading of the county's bonds to an investment grade at that time.
"I suspect that five years from now this will be just a blip in financial history," said Zane Mann, publisher of the California Municipal Bond Advisor, a newsletter. "And believe me, this will happen all over again somewhere. Nothing really has been learned."
But the bankruptcy has exacted a price. The county government has made sharp spending cuts of more than $180 million and has tried selling off everything from office buildings to landfills. Voters in June rejected a half-cent increase in the sales tax that would have helped repay $800 million in bonds coming due. The resulting austerity drive has created the spectacle of one of America's most affluent counties slashing programs for the poor.
"It's been the disadvantaged, the poor, the incarcerated who have felt what this bankruptcy is about," said Marian Bergeson, one of five county supervisors. "They have been the losers, and will continue to be."
At a crowded welfare center here on Walnut Street on Friday, Susan Fogarty, the district manager, said layoffs had increased employees' case loads to 216 new food-stamp recipients a month from 137.
"This is a stressful job to begin with," she said, motioning toward the lobby, where five sheriff's deputies stood near a metal detector, keeping order. "All this just makes it a lot more tense."
 
Programs Are Cut For Homeless and Others
The county's probation department has had to shut down a program that allowed 110 low-risk prisoners to maintain jobs while living in halfway houses. There are no longer outreach programs for the 12,000 homeless people who subsist in the county. A program that trained and found jobs for 250 people with severe mental impairments has closed.
"Those people had the hope of a job on their horizons," said Tim Mullins, director of the county's mental health and alcohol and drug abuse programs. "That door is now shut."
Out of the 1,600 county jobs that were eliminated, half came from the Social Services Agency. The agency was also forced to halve the number of its contracts with community therapists that counsel and monitor thousands of families at risk of child abuse, a move that its former administrator, Gene Howard, called "most devastating, and most dangerous."
With ordinary channels of providing food and medical care to the poor being squeezed, private charities are also feeling the pinch. On Thanksgiving Day alone, the Orange County Rescue Mission in Santa Ana handed out 19,000 meals, a fivefold increase over last year, said James E. Palmer, executive director.
In the past, the mission's mobile medical unit attracted only a handful of patients. But last week, when the van showed up at a park, it was mobbed by 150 people in an hour, he said.
 
Middle Class Takes The Crisis in Stride
Kathryn L. Ditch, a coordinator for Friends in Service to Humanity in Newport Beach, said the crisis was overwhelming her organization, which grants emergency loans to low-income renters. "People we see are living on the edge," Ms. Ditch said.
But if the poor are hurting, the middle class is sailing through the fiscal belt-tightening with relative ease. The most serious economic consequence for many has probably been the slump in housing prices. Two big local real estate companies, the Santa Margarita Company and the Western National Group, recently scrapped a merger plan in part, they said, because the bankruptcy had weakened the housing market.
But over all, the county -- like the rest of the state -- is growing again after the long California recession. Tens of thousands of new jobs have been created. Meantime, the middle class is rallying to the support of one cause it holds dear, public schools.
Schools throughout the county will benefit from money raised from a Jan. 2 raffle for a donated car at Fashion Island, a Newport Beach shopping center. A spring convention of businesses that caters to children raised $5,000 for school districts from ticket sales. Joe MacPherson, a car dealer, who pledged $50 from each car sold toward schools, ended up contributing $170,000. Parents even rushed to supermarkets and warehouse stores and bought giant packages of toilet paper to resupply the Venado Middle School in Irvine after it ran out.
Such grass-roots action "absolutely didn't occur before the bankruptcy," said Elizabeth A. Thomas, executive director of the Irvine Education Foundation, which raises funds for Irvine schools.
There are other silver linings. Mr. Mullins, the director of the county's mental-health and substance-abuse programs, said he had to cut 14 percent from his budget in one fell swoop. While painful, the reductions and layoffs were necessary, he said, to bring his costs in line with those of the private sector, with which he competes.
"I used the situation to do some downsizing that I could never have done otherwise," Mr. Mullins said. "In the long term, in some ways, I'll be better off."
 
Official Under Pressure For Higher Returns
The unraveling of Orange County's finances built up over several years but came to a head quickly. Robert L. Citron, its Treasurer for 24 years, had been under pressure to produce higher returns from a county-run investment fund in part because California's taxpayer revolt was putting a lid on property taxes. He placed about two-thirds of his investments in complex financial instruments known as derivatives. These bond-like securities are structured so that their value rises -- and falls -- much faster than ordinary bonds.
In the spring of 1994, Mr. Citron was up for re-election, and he was criticized by his opponent for the risky investments. Mr. Citron dismissed the criticism as partisan bickering and even the Orange County edition of The Los Angeles Times declared in an editorial, "The cloud drawn over Citron increasingly looks like a bum rap."
The Securities and Exchange Commission met with Mr. Citron in April and May of 1994 to review his investments, but took no actions. The rating agencies also examined the county's finances. In August, Moody's Investors Services gave Orange the highest county investment rating in California.
But Mr. Citron had bet on lower interest rates, and instead they kept rising. County officials, growing increasingly alarmed, finally brought in a consultant, who informed them on Nov. 16 -- a month after Mr. Citron had issued a generally bullish annual report -- that the county's $7.4 billion investment fund had suffered at least a $1.5 billion loss. The county disclosed the news on Dec. 1 and declared bankruptcy five days later.
For the most part, that has placed much of the responsibility for sorting out the county's problems into the hands of its lawyers and consultants, who will have earned about $50 million by the time the bankruptcy ends, the county estimates.
The bond rating agencies missed all the early warning signs. Barbara Flickinger, an official at Moody's, said the agency now looked more closely at municipal investment practices, but her agency had not altered its basic procedures to catch such problems in the future.
The county has sued Merrill Lynch for more than $2 billion, contending that Merrill sold the county inappropriate securities and misled Mr. Citron.
Recently released tapes show that Merrill's broker, Michael Stamenson, warned Mr. Citron as early as 1992 that his investment strategy carried terrible risks, but Mr. Stamenson continued to sell him the securities. Merrill says that Mr. Stamenson remains an employee in good standing.
 
Budget Is Reordered, And County Goes On
As for the county government, the bankruptcy has reordered its budgetary priorities. Since a new tax was rejected as a way of repaying bondholders, the county and state agreed on a plan to take $15 million a year away from the county's transportation agency, which would mean sharp cuts in bus service. Several million dollars more will be diverted for more than a decade from flood control, harbors and parks.
Many of the politicians who were supposed to have been overseeing the county's finances have resigned or said they will not run for office again, but the wholesale reorganization of the government many people had promised in this highly conservative county looks like a distant dream.
As for Mr. Citron, he has pleaded guilty to six felony counts related to his financial mismanagement, but has not been charged with taking a penny for himself. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 29. His defense has been that he suffered from dementia. That is a strange twist for the proud man who lorded over the county's finances with the kind of cockiness the county itself had once demonstrated. A year ago, withdrawn and slightly incoherent, Mr. Citron signed a letter of resignation in his living room here, then waited for a psychologist sent by his colleagues to arrive.

Chart: "Orange County Cuts Corners After Disaster"
 When Orange County's investment pool went wrong last year, many people predicted disastrous budgetary shortfalls for the local governments and public agencies that had relied on investment income from the pool. While public payrolls and services have indeed been reduced sharply, the cutbacks have not been as severe as many feared. ANDREA ADELSON
 
RECREATION
 Fees raised at county beaches, zoos and parks.
 
HEALTH
 One prenatal clinic for poor women closed and 15 monthly clinics for children were shut down.
 
SOCIAL SERVICES
 Outreach effort to homeless mentally ill and advocates for veterans eliminated. Workers monitoring child abuse halved.
 
PUBLIC SAFETY
 Gang prevention and confinement programs eliminated. Some misdemeanor offendors fined and not jailed.
 
ROADS AND BUSES
 Some money for transportation will be transferred to a fund to pay bond holders, cutting into future bus service and postponing road building.
 
SCHOOLS
 Districts have cut back on maintenance, travel, teacher conferences and field trips but have avoided cuts affecting classrooms.
 
VENDORS TO THE COUNTY
 A few have started to receive some of the $100 million vendors are owed; most must wait until next July.
 
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES
 1,600 jobs have been cut and salaries and merit raises frozen. Portions of labor contracts were annulled, but some layoff and grievance provisions have since been restored. (pg. D8)

HEADLINE: As Larger Cities Gain Ground on Ills, Smaller Ones Lose

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Increases in violent crime, infant mortality the spread of AIDS and other urban problems have begun to recede in some of the nation's largest cities, while they are continuing to rise in smaller cities, a new report by a public-health research organization said today.
The report, issued by the nonprofit National Public Health and Hospital Institute, was based on census information, Federal crime statistics and health-care surveys from the nation's 100 largest cities. It found, among other things, that from 1980 to 1990, the number of children living in poverty increased nationally by 12 percent, while in the 25 largest cities, the ranks of poor children increased by 9.4 percent. 
 The study also found that violent crime over the same time increased nationally by 46 percent, while the rise was 36.4 percent in the largest cities.
Referring to programs that had lowered the incidence of disease, the report said that since 1980 "the largest 25 cities are doing better" than the United States generally.
Dennis P. Andrulis, the institute's president, said the group's report should be taken into consideration by Federal lawmakers in drafting legislation that would turn programs like Medicaid into block grants administered by states.
The Republicans' plan to balance the budget would establish block grants for welfare, child care and Medicaid, and, in some cases, food stamps. Mr. Andrulis said he was concerned that block grants would not take into consideration specific needs of individual cities, adding, "Proposed block grants, with their fixed-funding formulas, may not be well-suited to what cities need."
President Clinton has said he will veto the budget bill, but he has not specifically objected to the idea of using block grants for cash assistance to poor people, though he has objected to the Medicaid block grants.
Mr. Andrulis said that many of the largest cities were finding some solutions to intractable problems simply out of desperation and that their approaches should be studied by smaller cities with similar problems.
For example, the report found that local health officials in Cleveland, the country's 23d largest city, had made significant strides in combatting the incidence of tuberculosis, gonorrhea and AIDS.
"Cleveland may serve as a model of disease control for other U.S. cities," Mr. Andrulis said.
The report said the country's most populous city, New York, was a prime example of a large city's having rates of violent crime, infant mortality, teen-age pregnancies, high school graduation and households headed by women among others that were better than the national averages.
By comparison, the report found that in Mobile, Ala., the 79th most-populous city, the increase of violent crime was almost triple the average of the 100 cities; the decline in the rate of infant mortality was a third of the national average; the decline of teen-age pregnancies was less than half the national average, and the increase of high school graduations lagged behind the national average by about a fifth.
The number of households led by women in Mobile increased by almost 26 percent, a rate two-thirds above the national average.
"The overall perception of large cities is that they are dens of iniquity while smaller cities have more of a main street ideal with a veneer of respectability," said Sara Rosenbaum, director of the George Washington University Center for Health Policy Research and an adviser to the report. "But if you put aside the assumptions, underneath, the problems are often far worse in smaller cities."
Officials from cities with smaller populations than the 100 examined by the report say urban problems are finding their way into suburban towns and villages. John DeStefano, the Mayor of New Haven, said in an interview that communities around Connecticut's largest cities, Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven none of which are among the 100 most populous cities, have begun encountering the same problems found in New York and Los Angeles.
And just as necessity has forced big-city mayors to devise solutions to these problems, officials in the smaller towns have also been pressed to find creative programs.
"We do much better with crime and violent crime than towns around us," Mr. DeStefano said. "We had to. You tend to see more aggressive response in areas of greater challenge."
The report, which was financed in part by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, found that smaller cities struggling with one problem were not necessarily suffering others to the same degree. El Paso, for example, 22d in population, experienced no appreciable improvement in poverty rates from 1980 to 1990, but over the same time moved into the lead among the largest cities in its AIDS prevention rate.
While no city distinguished itself as the worst in all categories, Detroit, the seventh-largest city, came dramatically close, ranking No. 100 for unemployment and poverty, No. 99 for infant mortality and No. 97 for the murder rate.

HEADLINE: As Logging Returns, Recrimination on Why

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Dec. 1

 BODY:
Loggers have returned to the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest this fall, bulldozing roads into pristine areas and leveling 200-year-old trees in a manner that was illegal until four months ago.
The leveling, or clear-cutting, will damage rivers and streams, set back a $1.2 billion Federal program to restore overcut national forests and could eradicate some runs of Chinook salmon, President Clinton has said. 
 But, whether by bad fortune or design, the President now finds himself in the position of criticizing something he helped to create. The act he recently attacked for its potential to cause "grave environmental damage" is one he signed into law last summer, after initially vetoing it. It has turned out, Mr. Clinton said, to be far more damaging than he or many members of Congress anticipated.
The green light to cut big swaths of centuries-old trees came about because of a Congressional rider to a popular budget-reduction bill that suspends all environmental laws in some areas of national forests in Washington and Oregon through the end of next year.
The rider was promoted by Western Republicans, like Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, as a way to cut fire-scarred or bug-infested salvage timber and promote forest health.
But a single paragraph in the rider had nothing to do with damaged trees. It directed the Government to lift all environmental laws in a few areas so that some old-growth timber could be cut.
The timber industry, which, along with other development interests in the West, has strongly opposed Mr. Clinton as being too sympathetic to environmentalists, asked Congress for a suspension of the laws, saying they were being used in court to virtually shut down logging in national forests. After Republicans took control of Congress this year, they approved the rider.
Mr. Clinton initially vetoed the budget bill, saying the rider "would basically direct us to make timber sales to large companies subsidized by the taxpayers." After some changes were made -- changes that the President said would provide adequate protection -- he signed the bill with an amended rider.
A day later, the timber industry went to court, arguing that the crucial paragraph in the rider permitted unregulated logging of forest lands throughout the Pacific Northwest that were long thought to have been protected. A Federal court in Oregon has agreed.
Now, even as Mr. Clinton has embraced environmental values as a rallying cry for his re-election campaign -- "I will not compromise on the environment," he declared last week -- environmentalists say the President has already betrayed them. Although the Administration says it was misled about the rider's intent, environmentalists say the intent was clear and by signing the bill, the President risked the very thing he now criticizes.
"Most of Congress, the President and the American people were duped," said Patti Goldman, an attorney with the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. "A few watchful timber industry advocates knew exactly what they were doing when they wrote this rider into the law. This is political payback to the industry."
Before the President signed the bill, environmentalists had flooded the White House with more than 50,000 letters and calls urging him to veto it again. Ever since he signed it, on July 27, they have been furious.
"The timber industry bought Congress and in essence got them to remove all citizens' rights, barring them from the courthouse door," said Tim Hermach of the Native Forest Council in Oregon. "To be kind, you can say President Clinton was naive to go along with them. To be less than kind, you can say it was stupidity or a cave-in."
To critics in both parties, the twist of events shows the danger of using obscure side-amendments to change some of the nation's basic environmental laws. Republicans in Congress have attached riders to the budget reconciliation that would open the Arctic National Wildife Refuge to oil drilling and increase logging elsewhere.
The logging rider was attached this summer to a bill that cut 1995 spending by $16 billion and that included money Mr. Clinton had urgently sought for relief of disasters like the Oklahoma City bombing and the California earthquakes.
Since then, the price of wood has declined due to a slump in the housing market, and the timber industry has not shown as much interest in cutting salvage timber. The Forest Service has offered thousands of acres but have not gotten a single offer in the last three months.
The real action is with the healthy, valuable stands of old-growth forest that had been protected both by the President's 1993 forest plan and by litigation, which has kept them off-limits to logging for the last five years. These stands are home to endangered fish and birds, and in some case hold most of the water for entire river systems.
Now that they are exempt from environmental laws, including statutes that protect clean water, timber companies are trying to get as much of this wood as they can during the period when they do not have to comply with the law.
The Clinton Administration had said the rider applied only to a few select areas of some national forest, according to Jim Lyons, assistant Agriculture Secretary for forestry.
But Federal Judge Michael Hogan of Oregon, who is hearing the suit by the timber industry, agreed with the logging companies' interpretation. He ordered the Forest Service and other agencies to offer for sale old growth timber in areas of all national forests in Oregon and Washington. The Administration has appealed, but an appeals court has refused to grant an injunction.
So, after five years of relative peace, the timber wars have returned to the Northwest, with protesters blocking logging roads and interest groups pointing fingers.
The Forest Service now estimates that nearly twice as many trees will fall under the special rider as was estimated by the Administration when the President signed the bill. They say more than 600 million board feet of mostly old-growth timber will be cut. By comparison, less than 100 million board feet of older forests have been been cut in the last three years. About 10,000 board feet of timber are used to build the average house.
The numbers are crucial, say people who have been working to restore national forests in the Northwest, because more than 90 percent of old-growth forests, a term that describes stands that have never been cut, have been logged.
"This is not what we had in mind when the President signed the bill," said Tom Tuchmann, who is overseeing the new forest plan for the Administration. "But you have to put this in perspective. These are the last of the big old-growth sales. Over all, it will have small impact. The President's plan still protects 80 percent of the remaining old growth."
Timber industry officials say Mr. Clinton is being disingenuous in his recent statements about the intent of the rider.
"The environmentalists for the first time are not getting their way," said Chris West, spokesman for the Northwest Forestry Association, which represents timber companies. "They are beating up on the President, so his recent statements are just a way to show them that he's green."
Mr. West said the old-growth logging is "a drop in the bucket" compared to years ago, and he said it will not significantly harm the environment. When asked whether loggers would comply with requests by Federal biologists that they try not to harm some streams with endangered salmon and trout runs, Mr. West said, "that's a call left up to the individual companies."
He said Federal environmental laws had been used to shut down virtually all logging in the remaining old-growth areas on public land and until the laws are changed, the industry is likely to need protection from lawsuits.
Logging company owners, after years of losing court battles to environmentalists, are happy to finally have some Federal timber back in the mills. The owners of Hull-Oaks Lumber in Monroe, Ore., say the new timber will allow them to keep their small mill -- which depends almost exclusively on old growth -- running for another five months.
Throughout the Northwest, much of the new clear-cutting will take place in the very areas where the Government is spending millions of dollars trying to restore streams and woodlands to protect fish and wildlife. It is, for the most part, the old-style logging that the Forest Service, since the early 1990's, has condemned -- felling every tree in a given area, logging right to edge of streams that may be spawning grounds for salmon and trout.
In southern Oregon, logging will begin taking place any day in forest areas near the Umpqua River, the centerpiece of a $36 million sports-fishing industry. Federal biologists have recently written memorandums saying that the new logging in the area, because it does not have to comply with environmental laws, could severely damage cutthroat trout and salmon runs in the river basin.
Also, a thriving tourism business has developed around rafting and sightseeing along the Umpqua, portions of which are part of the nation's Wild and Scenic River system.
Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon said much of the new Federal logging went too far and could damage the state's thriving economy.
Mr. Kitzhaber was one of several Democrats who earlier had said they thought the rider would be relatively harmless.
After Mr. Clinton vetoed the initial version, some changes were made after negotiations. The period when loggers could ignore all environmental laws was reduced by a year. And Forest Service supervisors were told that they could enforce good stewardship standards in the sales of burned or insect-damaged timber.
With those changes, the President signed the bill, saying there were adequate protections.
But the key paragraph of the rider dealing with the old-growth timber was never changed. It is that section that has caused the furor.
"Somebody convinced the Administration that it wasn't such a big deal," said Mitch Friedman, head of the Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, an environmental group. "They disguised this all as salvage sales. As it turned out, there was a loophole big enough to drive a parade of logging trucks through."

HEADLINE: Degrees of Separation;
At York College, Race and Generation Etch Tensions

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
On a crisp morning this fall, administrators bedecked in blue satin doctoral gowns and matching mortarboards celebrated the founding of York College in South Jamaica, Queens, with lofty speeches in the school's sprawling auditorium.
But the audience was so small that the ceremony, marking the school's 28th anniversary, could have been held in a lecture hall. And the few students who did attend seemed to be struggling to stay awake, including one young man stretched across two chairs. 
 While administrators attributed the light turnout to a primarily adult commuter population that does not have time for outside activities, student government leaders said it underscored their lack of respect for the administration.
"They alienate us," said Jose Rivas Cinque, 22, the student government president. "We're not interested in attending their ceremonies if they are not interested in listening to us."
For three years now, students at the largely black campus on Guy R. Brewer Boulevard have clashed with administrators over what they see as issues of race and self-determination -- specifically, who can deliver the keynote address on Black Solidarity Day.
The latest incident came on Nov. 6, when police officers and campus guards in riot gear were called in as dozens of students protested loudly outside the school over the administration's refusal to allow a former aide to Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, to speak. Administrators eventually rescinded their decision, and the crowd of 300 at the Solidarity address was almost twice as large as the one at the Founder's Day ceremony a week later.
At first glance, the students appear to be engaged in the kind of questioning of authority typical of youth. But a strong undercurrent of resentment seems to run beneath the surface, compounded by the fact that about 67 percent of the faculty is white and 62 percent of the college's 6,490 students are black.
Many attribute general tensions to the fact that it is a school in transition that is trying to balance dwindling resources. One of the youngest schools in the City University system, the college has seen its $24 million operating budget cut by $2.1 million, forcing a restructuring of the education, remedial and activities programs, and raising fears that the college will be scaled back to a two-year college or technical school, as has been proposed, despite assurances from officials that it will not.
An intensive search is also under way for a new college president. Josephine Davis, the school's first female black leader, resigned in February after being accused by some faculty members of using public dollars to renovate her office and residence, making political contributions with college funds and billing the school twice for certain expenses.
Events leading up to Dr. Davis's abrupt departure illuminated the tensions at the school, causing infighting and pitting local black leaders against the white faculty, whom they charged with waging a campaign of "academic sedition" against Dr. Davis because of her race. Supporters said her efforts to restructure the staff had unnerved some people who had been at the college since it was founded.
Today, six positions are filled with acting administrators, including that of president, which is held by Thomas K. Minter, a former deputy chancellor of instruction for the New York City public school system.
Coming out of retirement to take the temporary job, Dr. Minter, who is black, said he stepped in because he wanted to make a contribution to a school he saw as important to South Jamaica. The typical York student is a black woman around age 28 with a child.
Promoted as the linchpin of the area's redevelopment, the school opened in 1986 on once-blighted land after operating for 20 years out of temporary headquarters, in part because the mid-1970's fiscal crisis delayed construction until 1980.
To some extent, the school has lived up to to its redevelopment promise. Just south of the school, 250 units of two-family houses have been constructed over the last several years and the City University of New York has put forth a plan to turn an overgrown vacant lot into a federally subsidized strip of shops and restaurants with a provision to allow the college to use part of the development for a student center and day care center.
The Food and Drug Administration plans to open on the campus its largest laboratory outside its national headquarters in Maryland, testing batches of food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, which would strengthen the school's health and science program.
"The community wanted this college," said F. Carlisle Towery, president of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, a nonprofit group. "It's a consumer and generator of favorable traffic. What's going on there now I don't see as anything other than a normal college environment. Kids are intellectually curious, learning about political affairs, and they challenge authority."
But Quentin Wolcott, the student government vice president, who brought in the Farrakhan aide, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, said that "to call the conflicts an exercise of intellectual challenge would be simplifying tensions on campus," which have boiled over for three years on Black Solidarity Day. Students butted heads with administrators before Mr. Muhammad's first speech last year and over one the year before by Prof. Leonard Jeffries, who had been deposed and reinstated as the chairman of the black studies department at City College over statements he made that were considered anti-Semitic and racist.
While expressing anger with the school's administration, Mr. Cinque said the CUNY Chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds, was the real target.
"She realizes students are sleeping giants and someone like Khalid Muhammad might incite students to take control of the college and their lives," Mr. Cinque said. "Let us decide who we want to listen to and what to walk away from. Everyone is so focused on Muhammad, but that's not what this is about."
It is also, he said, about recent cutbacks that ended secondary-education programs and consolidated a state-mandated remedial program into mainstream studies. Mr. Cinque said he believed that the cuts are symbolic of larger plans to slash liberal arts programs, a concern voiced by other students.
"There are several technical schools and two-year colleges we could have attended if that's what we wanted, but we came to York," said Dana Palomo, 21, of Rego Park, one of a dozen or so students at the student cafeteria one recent afternoon who expressed fears about York's future. "We need more support from the students to rally against the budget cuts and any plans to turn this into a technical school. We need to fight this, or our degrees will mean nothing."
The source of the concern is a 160-page evaluation in 1993 from Leon M. Goldstein, president of Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, intended to eliminate duplication of services within the City University system. The report recommended strengthening the school's technical programs.
Jay Hershenson, CUNY's vice chancellor and a spokesman for Ms. Reynolds, said that the recommendation was never seriously considered and that most such fears were a natural outgrowth of the college's being between presidents.
"York College must remain a liberal arts institution that offers professional programs," he said. "It is a college that everyone has viewed from the outset as being indispensable to the economic and educational development of South Jamaica."
But Adolphus Frazier, director of career planning and placement, who has been at the school for 27 years, said the staff itself is worried about the school's direction. He said they remain disturbed about the racial makeup of the faculty.
"York College was established for the community, and I believe its faculty should reflect the community," Mr. Frazier said. "But black males are continually being passed up for promotions, and something has to be done."
W. Hubert Keen, provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs, maintained that the school has difficulty attracting minority faculty.
Mr. Hershenson said: "It is true that during the period when President Davis served, the college had its ups and downs. Now, we're in transition -- and it's not unexpected there will be growing pains -- it is everyone's hope that York College will be positioned for greatness."

HEADLINE: Dole at Forefront of Trade Battle To Aid Donor's Banana Empire

SERIES: THE FINE PRINT: A close look at a debate on trade.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole is a busy man these days. He is running for President. He is immersed in the arcane details of the budget battle, Bosnia policy and the future of Medicaid and Medicare. But when it comes to introducing legislation, one subject has repeatedly turned up at the top of Mr. Dole's agenda: bananas.
Several times in recent months Mr. Dole has tried -- so far unsuccessfully -- to include in the budget bill amendments that would impose sharp trade sanctions on Costa Rica and Colombia unless they pull out of a trade deal involving banana exports with the European Union. At least one major American food producer, Chiquita Brands International, says that deal is intended to reduce its share of the profitable banana market in Europe. 
 Mr. Dole's office says he is acting because the Clinton Administration has "failed to deliver on its two-year-old commitment to resolve this case of blatant trade discrimination, which continues to cause serious injury to U.S. commercial interests."
Other people in Washington have another explanation: One of the largest contributors to the Republican Party these days is the family and corporate empire of Carl Lindner, a multimillionaire from Cincinnati who controls Chiquita. Senator Dole has been flying around to campaign appearances in planes owned by the Lindner family's many corporate interests.
In a statement today, the Senator's office said the contributions, and the airplanes, were irrelevant. "Senator Dole has taken this position because it is right for America, and to suggest any other reason is totally absurd," the statement said.
Without question, Mr. Dole is hardly Chiquita's only friend in Washington: over the years, Democrats have also benefited greatly from Mr. Lindner's largesse.
Senator Dole's efforts have been backed by Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, whose office said today that it was aiding "a constituent with a grievance." The Administration has also opened an investigation into the banana politics between Europe and Latin America.
While that inquiry is not expected to end until early next year, the White House has already made clear that it is a low-priority issue, hardly worthy of the severe trade sanctions against Costa Rica and Colombia that Mr. Dole is proposing.
The problem for both the Senator and the Administration is that the agreement between Europe and several Latin American countries has little direct effect on American jobs.
The pact reserves a share of Europe's banana market to each of several Latin American nations. Those nations largely determine which producer gets the license to export to Europe, and Chiquita's share has been vastly reduced. But there is little direct effect on American jobs, because very few bananas are grown in this country.
Instead, American companies like Chiquita buy or invest in bananas grown elsewhere. And until now, trade retaliation has rarely been a weapon used to protect American investors abroad.
Even the United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, who has a pretty subtle understanding of how political and trade interests merge, had to pause for a minute when he was asked at a news conference the other day to identify any American economic interests at stake in what many in Latin America now call the "banana war." Then, with a broad smile, he said, "If you drive north on the Pacific Coast Highway, I think there's 10 acres of bananas on the right-hand side."
Chiquita and the Lindner family have little to say about Senator Dole's efforts. A Chiquita spokesman did not return calls today about the issue, nor did Mr. Lindner.
Both Democrats and Republicans maintain that Chiquita has a legitimate case: The agreement between the Latin American countries and Europe, where bananas sell for comparatively high prices, probably is a violation of the world trade treaty approved last year. Mr. Dole reluctantly embraced that accord, in a deal with the White House that saved the agreement from defeat.
But Chiquita has been alone in its complaints. Its other major competitors, including Del Monte Foods and the Dole Food Company (with which Mr. Dole has no relationship), have found alternative ways around Europe's restrictive rules by investing in companies in the Caribbean that benefit from the arcane European quota system. Chiquita was slower to move, and so it has turned to Washington to stem the damage.
What surprised many in Congress, however, is the ferocity with which Mr. Dole took on Chiquita's cause. Twice in recent months he proposed an amendment on the Senate floor to impose sanctions on Costa Rica and Colombia, hoping to get unanimous consent to append the action to bills that were far larger.
Those efforts failed. An effort to get the amendment included as part of the broad budget bill now being negotiated with President Clinton also failed after other Republicans expressed fear that including one special-interest trade provision would open the floodgates to others.
Senator Dole has also urged Republicans in the House to act on the issue. The Journal of Commerce reported recently that he raised the issue with Speaker Newt Gingrich when the two leaders were flying to Israel last month to attend the funeral of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Whether he struck a banana deal at 30,000 feet is lost to history.
Mr. Dole's aides say that, for a while at least, bananas are off the table. But the search is on to find other, appropriate legislation to append the Dole amendment.
All this, not surprisingly, has hardly drawn much attention in Washington, where bananas do not rate with Bosnia and the budget. But in Latin America, it has been front-page news.
Trade experts say that one reason that Mr. Dole's efforts have not received more attention is that Democrats and Republicans alike are indebted to the Lindner family's generosity.
While estimates vary, groups that track campaign donations agree that the Lindners, companies they control and other senior executives of those companies gave roughly a million dollars to Democrats and Republicans in the last two years, mostly in "soft money" to political action committees. Gopac, which Mr. Gingrich headed until earlier this year, has received contributions, and so has Mr. Dole's committee.

HEADLINE: 25-Year Checkup Shows Gains in Air Quality but a Decline in Trash Disposal

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
In 25 years, New York City has made significant gains in improving its air quality and the cleanliness of its waterways, but the quality of its drinking water has slipped, and disposing of the city's garbage is a persistent problem, according to a report by a leading environmental advocacy group.
The report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, "New York City's Environmental Vital Signs: A 25-Year Checkup," compiled findings from 75 governmental and independent studies to paint a broad picture of the city's environment since the first Earth Day, in April 1970. 
 "It's safe to say that since 1970, there has been gradual improvement," said Eric A. Goldstein, director of the council's urban project. "But that's different from saying that comprehensive environmental health protections are in place or that the city's ecology is in balance."
The report, written by Mr. Goldstein and Mark Izeman, a lawyer with the council, found that while air and waterway quality have generally improved, progress has been little or nil in other major areas. It said, for example, that although all but one of the city's nine landfills operating in 1970 have been closed, the amount of garbage generated by New Yorkers has increased and recycling efforts have had only moderate success.
The amount of sewage flowing into the city's waterways has been sharply reduced, the report also said, but toxic pollutants from past industrial discharges are a lingering problem. And local problems -- like the proliferation of industrial pollution in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Greenpoint -- persist. Lead poisoning of children, particularly in the poorest communities, remains one of the city's "most pressing" health threats.
The city's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, Marilyn Gelber, called the report "a fair assessment of the environmental protection progress that we've made."
"In particular," she said, "it highlights the importance of the Federal role in regulating and funding these efforts because clean air and clean water have nothing to do with political boundaries."
The report said that in the area of air quality, lead levels in the region have fallen by 95 percent since 1970, and "levels of carbon monoxide have declined from more than two and a half times national health standards in the early 1970's to just below the standard itself today." The levels of sulfur dioxide, which is considered a major cause of acid rain, have also declined significantly since 1970, the report said.
Still, "it goes too far" to suggest that the city's air quality problems have been solved, the report continued. Smog and particulate matter, especially from diesel trucks and buses, remain problems.
The quality of the city's waterways has also shown some improvement since 1970, the report said. The number of beaches open during the summer has increased, and the destruction of valuable wetlands has been slowed.
Only 10 years ago, at least 200 million gallons of raw sewage were discharged daily into the city's waterways. The opening of major sewage treatment plants on the Hudson River in Harlem and in Red Hook, Brooklyn, "largely stemmed these raw sewage discharges," the report said.
"Despite such improvements, significant sewage-related pollution persists in certain sections of the city," the report said. "The primary culprit is the discharge of raw sewage during wet weather periods, a result of the city's combined sewage pipes, which carry both stormwater and wastewater." And certain waterways, like the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, still have significant pollution.
New York City's drinking water is also considered safe, though the report said that "New York can no longer accurately boast that it has the most pristine drinking-water supply in the nation."
Although the upstate reservoirs are generally free of toxic contaminants and heavy metals, data from the city's Department of Environmental Protection indicate that 13 of the 19 reservoirs are eutrophic -- a condition that results in algae blooms and diminished water clarity.
Commissioner Gelber said the recently concluded agreement between the city, the state and eight upstate counties in the watershed would bring a new level of protection to the city's supply of drinking water. But, she added, "while it is a solid foundation for the future, it is not meant to be the last step."
About solid waste, the report noted that poorly controlled incinerators have been shut and several problem-plagued landfills have been closed.
"To be sure, the city remains overly dependent on the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island," the report said.
As late as 1980, the report said, less than 1 percent of the city's residential trash was recycled. A shift occurred after 1989, when the City Council passed a mandatory recycling law. By 1993, recycling reached 15 percent, though it slipped to 13.5 percent in mid-1995.
The report also expressed concern about hazardous waste sites. The State Department of Environmental Conservation lists 26 such sites in New York City on its 1995 Superfund registry. Of those, 19 are designated as posing "a significant threat to the public health or environment."
Constantine Sidamon-Eristoff, who served as regional administrator for the Federal Environmental Protection Agency from 1989 to 1993, said the assessment by the council is "really very thoughtful and very well done."
"To me," he added, "emphasis should be on the fact that we have come a long way and have a long way to go."

HEADLINE: Union Capitulation Shows Strike Is Now Dull Sword

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Eighteen months after beginning one of the biggest and longest strikes of the 1990's, Caterpillar Inc. workers will soon be back making the company's giant yellow earth movers. By their own admission, they gained nothing by their walkout and, indeed, still face losing valued rights and benefits.
Over the weekend, about 80 percent of the 8,700 strikers voted to reject Caterpillar's last offer. But their union, the United Automobile Workers, still a rich and muscular giant within the depleted American labor movement, ordered them back. The union had spent $30 million, all for naught, defending them. Caterpillar never flinched. 
 Today, the company said it would take the workers back in its own good time. A Caterpillar vice president, Wayne Zimmerman, said in a statement that management had requested a meeting with union leaders "to determine whether their offer to return to work is being made in good faith." In view of changes in operations during the strike, Mr. Zimmerman said, "an immediate return to prestrike staffing of nearly a year and a half ago is simply not practical."
Faced with the union cutting off their $300-a-week strike benefits, the workers have little choice but to return when they are recalled to work.
Peter Feuille, director of the Institute for Industrial and Labor Relations at the University of Illinois, called the union's return "capitulation without surrender."
"The union has capitulated to the reality that Caterpillar has won the strike," he said. "They're not surrendering their quest for a fair contract. But when you're back at work as a union, what kind of leverage do you have?"
Union officials said that the rejection of the contract offer had proved the spirit of their workers. "We were elated about the vote," said Larry Solomon, president of Local 751 in Decatur, Ill., the site of a plant at which the union ordered an end to the strike. But he conceded that Caterpillar had won. "It's sickening to the stomach," he said.
Caterpillar's rout of the U.A.W. is a stark demonstration of the increasing futility of a weapon with which unions could once paralyze whole industries in promoting their members' interests. It also illustrates the might of the opposition confronting the new leadership of the 78-union American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, which promises militant new responses in trying to rekindle the labor movement.
Now and then, strikes can still hurt management and extract something for workers. A two-month strike by machinists against the Boeing Company is beginning to impede deliveries of new planes. But more and more often, companies succeed in devising strategies that blunt the power of strikes and unions.
Many companies permanently replace strikers, leaving union workers on the street even after a strike ends -- or terrify workers merely by threatening permanent replacement if they attempt a strike. Caterpillar stopped short of that threat and found it could still beat a strike.
So workers instead lay low and take their lumps in an erosion of wages, benefits and union prerogatives. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service said that work stoppages -- strikes, mostly, and lockouts -- declined to 385 in the 12 months that ended on Sept. 30, from a record of 3,111 in 1977.
Caterpillar workers, said Mr. Solomon, of Local 751, will be returning to the plant under the terms of a management contract offer that, among other things, eviscerates union prerogatives, like grievance procedures, freezes wages except for increases to keep pace with inflation, denies amnesty to 150 strikers who were fired for hostile behavior and gives management more flexibility in scheduling workers' hours.
William Gould, chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces the labor laws, declined to discuss the Caterpillar strike because the board had yet to rule on union complaints of labor practice violations. But he said that strikes, however disruptive, helped to balance the interests of workers with those of management.
"This trend," Mr. Gould said of the decline in strikes, "has brought about a potential for a decline in orderly labor-management relations. Strikes are orderly in that they are a part of a process that produces some resolution." That, he said, raises the question of whether unions will remain credible representatives of worker interests.
Caterpillar invoked the usual reasons why industries shave work forces and wages -- the pressure of foreign competition and the need to meet it with products that cost no more to make than they do in Mexico or Korea. The company also devised a strategy to undercut the union.
It moved white collar workers and temporary workers into its factories and proved the lie to its regular workers' claim that production quality would suffer and that customers would flee.
Two developments served the strategy. The forces of temporary workers, once mostly people with little skill, have grown with the addition of hundreds of thousands of skilled workers laid off in other industries, notably aerospace, and Caterpillar was able to draw on them.
Second, many manufacturing companies are less dependent on highly skilled workers than they used to be. Tobias Levkovich, a securities analyst at the investment banking firm of Smith, Barney, explained that Caterpillar once needed teams of tool-and-die makers, highly expert machinists who could take an engineer's drawing and fashion new machines and models of parts.
But these days, he said, much of the human skill required of tool-and-die making has been replaced by computer-controlled machines. "All they need is a technician, not a skilled tool-and-die guy," he said.
So the strike, he said, "was kind of irrelevant." Caterpillar's production rolled along. Sales rose during the strike. Profits rose. And the stock rose. "From Wall Street's perspective," he said, "they've really done well."
Mr. Feuille, of the University of Illinois, said: "There's no evidence I've seen that products suffered any drop in quality. I never heard any news reports from customers saying, 'You're sending me junk.' The strike was obviously not putting economic pressure on the company. The pressure was on the union and the workers."
There's a worse alternative to returning, union leaders say. They point to cases of strikes, like the one in the 1980's at Eastern Airlines, that ended with the collapse of the company -- and all its jobs.

HEADLINE: A Fidelity Fund Decides Not to Close to New Investors

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
When Fidelity Investments introduced its New Millennium fund in 1992, it said that the fund would employ a process called change analysis to uncover companies "likely to benefit from social and economic trends."
So far, it has done just that. The love for Internet-related stocks shown by the fund's manager, Neal P. Miller, has given New Millennium the best performance this year among all diversified Fidelity mutual funds, with a gain through last Friday of 51 percent. 
 But Fidelity, a unit of the FMR Corporation, had said in 1992 that it would take the unconventional step of closing the fund to new investments when assets reached $500 million, because "the more controllable fund size helps the fund manager to pursue the fund's objective."
When that level was reached last month, New Millennium's board voted to abandon the limit, angering at least one shareholder who said he had specifically invested because of that promise. In changing its mind, Fidelity apparently responded to an old-fashioned urge -- the lure of profit.
Fidelity's action illustrates what to many investors may be an unknown risk: mutual fund companies can change many such marketing promises at virtually any time, without seeking shareholder approval and, as Fidelity did last week, without informing current investors.
"It disturbs me that Fidelity would do this with an apparent lack of consideration for what shareholders might say and no awareness that anybody might be upset," said the disillusioned investor, James G. Taylor of Monterey, Calif., who added that he had bought the shares last month expecting the asset limit to be enforced.
The removal of the asset restriction is unlikely to have violated Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. But the incident was the second case in a week of questionable judgment in shareholder communications.
Last week, the company acknowledged that Jeffrey N. Vinik, manager of Fidelity Magellan, the biggest mutual fund, sold shares of Micron Technology even as a report was being readied for shareholders in which Mr. Vinik praised the stock's potential.
Robyn S. Tice, a Fidelity spokeswoman, said the New Millennium Fund's board voted not to enforce the asset limit because New Millennium was having "no difficulty complying with the fund's strategy." As of Friday, the fund held $540 million in assets, according to Ms. Tice.
When the fund was introduced, Ms. Tice said, Fidelity created the potential asset restriction because it was concerned that "with the trends the fund was seeking to follow and invest in, we weren't certain we would have enough investment choices."
A marketing brochure distributed to would-be investors and stapled around the outside of the fund's prospectus says that the strategy is to "discover unrecognized small and mid-sized companies with the potential to grow and benefit from future social and economic change."
But, Ms. Tice said, the board determined that enough of those potential investments existed.
Fidelity will enjoy greater benefits from higher assets because, as the fund's investment manager, it is paid a percentage of assets under management. Asked if that was a part of the decision, she replied, "The decision was based on our experience in managing the fund the past three years."
She said Fidelity planned to publish a notification of the change in its monthly mutual fund guide, a subscription publication, and to inform New Millennium shareholders in the fund's annual report, to be mailed in January. Until then, each prospectus sent to potential investors will contain a sticker noting the change.
A section on page 2 of the marketing brochure, "Fund Limits to Maximize the Potential," states that "New Millennium Fund seeks to cap its assets at $500 million, after which it will be closed to new investments."
On page 24 of the prospectus, dated Jan. 23, a more detailed explanation notes that the fund "currently intends" to suspend sales if the $500 million asset level is reached, but that "the fund reserves the right to change this limit in the future, and to reopen the fund to shareholders and/ or new investors after the current size limit has been reached."
A restriction that is not classified as a fundamental policy of the fund can be changed without a vote of shareholders, said Bob Plaze, assistant director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's division of investment management, who declined to comment on the specifics of the New Millennium case.
According to the fund's prospectus, the asset limit is not a fundamental policy.
As recently as late September, Fidelity officials said the company was "seriously considering" shutting off the fund to new investments, according to Laura Lallos, a mutual fund analyst at Morningstar. Ms. Lallos wrote an analysis of the fund on Sept. 29, noting the potential closing.
"An investor would have reasons to be disappointed if that was a serious consideration" in making an investment, she said. "Many investors do find a fund that limits its size appealing" because small funds can often benefit from a sharp move in the price of small stocks.

HEADLINE: Whitman Strongly Endorses Programs for Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: EWING TOWNSHIP, N.J. Dec. 4

 BODY:
Already at odds with the Republican Party's leadership for her support of abortion rights, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman put more space between herself and the party's conservative wing today by strongly endorsing affirmative-action programs.
Mrs. Whitman said New Jersey had benefited socially and economically because of public and private programs that take race and sex into account in hiring and promotion decisions. And she warned that the debate over the programs, taking place primarily in the upper ranks of her own party, "may ultimately threaten the progress we have made" toward equality. 
 Republican leaders in Congress have criticized affirmative-action programs, particularly those imposed by government on private industry. Some Republican leaders have said that weakening Federal affirmative-action policies would be on the party's agenda after the budget is passed.
"I know I can't end employment discrimination single-handedly," the Governor said at a conference of affirmative-action officers held at Trenton State College in this Trenton suburb, "but government should set an example of inclusiveness for others to follow."
The Governor made only one concession to new thinking about affirmative action, suggesting that one day the programs should be based on economic status rather than race or sex.
The mostly black audience of affirmative-action officers, largely from state and local government offices, gave Mrs. Whitman a standing ovation after her speech.
But the Governor got no such praise from New Jersey's public employee unions. Union leaders contend that Mrs. Whitman preaches affirmative action in state government while practicing budget policies that result in a disproportionate number of women and minorities being laid off or having their jobs and benefits downgraded.
"I think it's bogus on her part," said Bob Pursell, area director of the Communications Workers of America, New Jersey's largest state employee union. "On the one hand, she preaches diversity and inclusion; on the other, her layoff programs hurt the people she proposes to help. In the privatizing of the Motor Vehicles department, 90 percent of the people affected were women, and maybe 50 percent were minorities."
Mrs. Whitman has cut about 1,000 state jobs since taking office two years ago.
In her speech, the Governor drew a picture of a policy under attack and warned that affirmative action would have to strengthened, in ways she did not specify, to survive.
"If we do nothing," she said, "the whole system could be pulled down around us."
Mrs. Whitman has made a name for herself in national Republican circles as a fierce advocate of pro-business, small-government economic policies combined with a generous social inclusiveness, including a strong defense of abortion rights and a more muted but distinct support for homosexual rights.
Mrs. Whitman has never given evidence of trimming her views to suit her party's right wing. Early talk of her as a Vice Presidential prospect on the 1996 Republican ticket faded not only as the Governor denied interest in the office but also as her liberal views on these issues came into sharper public focus.
At a fund-raiser for moderate Republican candidates held in New York City last spring, several leading Republicans pleaded for tolerance within the party for differing views on abortion rights, but Mrs. Whitman rejected a soothing compromise on the issue, insisting in her speech that respect for abortion rights should be an irreducible element of Republican Party philosophy.

HEADLINE: The Bull, Under Fire;
Merrill Lynch Faces a Barrage Of Orange County Lawsuits

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
One year and more than 10 lawsuits later, Merrill Lynch & Company is in the crosshairs of legal sharpshooters as a result of the Orange County bankruptcy. Merrill's own shareholders are suing it. So are Orange County bondholders. The county itself wants $2 billion. Even a group of Orange County widows and their children have clamored for money from Wall Street's biggest brokerage firm.
To fight back, Merrill, which has denied any wrongdoing, has amassed an all-star defense team. The firm has spent about $40 million on legal fees so far, analysts say, with millions yet to come for litigation that could drag on for years. Novel legal theories are emerging. Merrill remains the most profitable firm on Wall Street and its municipal bond business is strong, but the firm is far more vulnerable on the legal front than any of its rivals that did business with the county. 
 Merrill's exposure comes partly from its size -- it did the most business in Orange County -- but also from the two hats it wore. Merrill-as-broker was the biggest seller of securities to Orange County's Treasurer, Robert L. Citron, who now contends he was suffering from "dementia" when dealing with Merrill. In a suit seeking $2 billion in damages, the county says Merrill sold it "unsuitable" securities.
But Merrill was also a leading underwriter of Orange County bonds. Many bond buyers now say the firm broke securities laws by withholding information from them that it got in its dealings with Mr. Citron about the county's crumbling finances, instead painting a rosy picture.
 A big problem for Merrill is that its defense against the county -- that it warned Mr. Citron repeatedly that his investments were risky -- could boomerang as it defends itself against bondholders. They ask a simple question: If Merrill warned Mr. Citron, why didn't it warn us, too?
"What Merrill offers as its defense in the suitability case," Harvey J. Goldschmid, a securities law professor at Columbia University, said, "may kill them in the underwriting case."
Clearly, the sheer volume of litigation reflects the sour feelings left in the wake of the bankruptcy a year ago. The county's $1.7 billion loss -- a result of bad bets with taxpayer funds on the direction interest rates would move -- shook confidence in the municipal bond market. There has been plenty of finger-pointing: against a county and its politicians, against a deal-hungry Wall Street, and against bond rating agencies and a Securities and Exchange Commission that failed to detect problems soon enough. The debate shows no signs of ending soon.
The main bondholder suit comes from the Kemper Investors Fund of Chicago, which argues that Merrill's disclosures were misleading and fraudulent and asks that it refund $198 million that Kemper invested in county notes. A similar class-action suit seeking unspecified damages has been filed on behalf of all retail buyers of Orange County securities between 1992 and 1994.
To Merrill, the suits are easily dismissed as sour grapes. "These are a bunch of people who suffered financial reverses," said a Merrill lawyer, Dennis J. Block, a partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. "Now they are looking to point a finger." Merrill, he added, "will fight has as hard as necessary to demonstrate how wrong these cases are."
To lead that fight, Merrill has assembled about 40 outside lawyers from six law firms. Joining Mr. Block is Harvey C. Pitt, a former S.E.C. counsel now with Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson. Also on the team are a bankruptcy specialist, Harvey Miller of Weil Gotshal, and Ron Olson, who represented the Exxon Corporation against suits stemming from the Valdez oil spill. Merrill denies the $40 million estimate for its legal bills, but declines to give a number.
Legal experts say the county's $2 billion lawsuit against Merrill seeks to offer a broadened interpretation of "suitability" -- the concept that securities brokers can sell only securities "suitable" for customers' needs. Typically, this is intended to protect unsophisticated investors, the proverbial widows and orphans.
But Orange County's lawyers say "suitability" can also apply to sophisticated institutional investors, who have traditionally been exempt. Adding a special twist is the county's contention that when taxpayer money is involved, brokers have a special duty to know state law and not sell securities that might conflict with it.
"This is very much the cutting edge of the law," Norman S. Poser, a Brooklyn Law School professor, said. "This isn't a case about the little old lady in tennis shoes. The question is whether a firm can be held liable for recommending unsuitable securities when the buyer is a sophisticated institution."
Even Michael Hennigan, Orange County's lawyer, admits his arguments are "unique to municipal finance."
"You are dealing with fundamental restrictions on a government official's ability to speculate with government funds," said Mr. Hennigan, who has won multimillion-dollar judgments in securities matters involving Disney and MGM. "Merrill Lynch encouraged and participated in the process of levering up the county's position."
The only precedent for this argument is a 1990 case involving the City of San Jose, Calif., in which a jury ruled against two Wall Street firms stemming from charges that the firms -- E. F. Hutton and Paine Webber -- had sold securities to public officials that were used to speculate on interest rates. Merrill was one of 11 other firms that settled with San Jose before going to trial.
"This is exactly the area where the suitability doctrine should apply," said Patricia M. Hynes, a lawyer at Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, who won the San Jose case. "A lot of the brokerage community has taken advantage of municipalities. This is a very fertile field for horse play."
Still, Mr. Hennigan may be bucking history. Joseph A. Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford University and a former S.E.C. commissioner, said that "the doctrine of suitability cannot be applied to someone like the Treasurer of Orange County."
Mr. Grundfest noted: "You even have correspondence from him to Merrill saying, 'Deal with me or I'll take my business elsewhere.' In traditional suitability cases, Grandma isn't making threats."
Merrill has yet to file its response. But Mr. Block outlined its argument against suitability: "Does suitability mean the broker just tells a sophisticated investor that he is a moron and that his investment strategy won't work? This buyer made his own decisions, with the support and encouragement of his board of supervisors."
Still, Merrill is vulnerable because different divisions of the firm were doing different kinds of business with Orange County. Merrill has offered reams of letters that it sent to Mr. Citron warning his strategy might go wildly awry if interest rates shifted -- which is exactly what happened. County bondholders now say that if Merrill gave Mr. Citron these warnings, the warnings should also have also been disclosed to investors in Orange County debt.
"Can a firm be doing two, or three, or maybe a dozen different activities, which can put them into a position of conflict?" Mr. Poser asked. "By keeping the letters they wrote to Citron private, it raises a question of their duties to the bond buyers."
Mr. Goldschmid added: "This is not going to be easy for Merrill. They can try to argue they had a Chinese wall" -- a reference to the policy of keeping work for clients separate and confidential -- "but I doubt it will work. Merrill has a lot of letters telling Citron that the county was way overextended. Then, at the same time, they are coming out with an underwriting. How could a diligent underwriter not notice?"
Kemper's lawyers declined to comment. But Alan Schulman, a Milberg Weiss lawyer handling the bondholder suit, is delighted. Merrill, he said, built "a trail of cover-your-rear memos so they could later say, 'We told Citron this was risky.' " He added, "Yet when Merrill was warning the county of these risks, its salesmen were inducing bondholders to buy more Orange County securities."
Mr. Block brushes off Mr. Schulman's comments, saying Merrill relied on the county itself for the information it gave bond buyers. He also said bondholders had been told that the county's investment portfolio had securities that could lose value. And he said many buyers, like Kemper, were sophisticated and would have been aware that investment risk was a core issue in Mr. Citron's 1994 re-election campaign.
"You had sophisticated investors who weren't operating in a vacuum," Mr. Block said. "They knew what was going on in the county treasurer's race."
Besides, Mr. Block added, no county bondholders have been out money yet -- as long as they have held their securities. The $198 million taxable bonds held by Kemper, which were supposed to have been redeemed in July, have been extended a year. And other bonds are still paying their promised interest.
But that is cold comfort to ordinary bondholders, Mr. Schulman said. He notes that anyone who sold an Orange County bond has sustained a loss. Besides, he said, investors who thought they were buying a triple-A security are now holding paper from a bankrupt entity.
"It's like you bought a BMW and now you've got a Yugo," Mr. Schulman said. "Sure, it still gets you from place to place, but you don't know for how long."

HEADLINE: Gains in the Metro-North Settlement

 BODY:
New York City's northern commuters won a reprieve yesterday from the selective strike tactics that plagued the Metro-North railroad last week. A tentative contract agreement with the teamsters local that represents 697 track workers spared riders the daily anxiety of wondering whether the union would pick their rail line for the job action of the day.
The union was wise to test the public's tolerance no further, and to accept at least some modest gains in productivity. 
 Following the wage pattern established in settlements with other Metro-North unions, the track workers agreed to a 10.4 percent rise over four years, lower than the pace of inflation. They won improved sick leave, personal leave and vacation time. Their major concession, allowing the railroad more flexibility to assign night and weekend crews, is the kind of productivity gain Metro-North and its parent, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, need in still greater measure. The M.T.A. has assured both subway riders and commuters that productivity will soften the pain caused by reduced state financing.
By spot-striking portions of the railroad with little warning, the union confounded the workaday lives of passengers and abused its considerable power for a relatively minor bargaining objective, a speedup of an improved vacation package. The union won a partial speedup, but the trauma of those uncertain mornings could lead to a larger benefit for the public.
This brief job action did not cause much of a ripple outside the New York metropolitan area. Nevertheless, Congress should take note and begin giving more serious attention to long-pending proposals to end Federal jurisdiction over labor relations on commuter lines. Jurisdiction would be transferred to the state, allowing New York to treat workers as public employees forbidden to strike. That would produce an even more significant result than the settlement.

HEADLINE: Inching Toward a Budget Deal

 BODY:
The White House and Republicans continue to bicker over the budget. The two sides remain far apart. The White House, though claiming to embrace the Republican goal of balancing the budget within seven years, attacks the Republican deficit-reduction bill for crippling Medicaid, food stamps and other programs for the needy. The Republican leaders accuse the White House of hypocrisy in cynically attacking the Republicans for their cuts while refusing to identify who would lose under White House plans.
The blame game eased a bit last weekend when Democrats and Republicans slipped back from rigid positions. Leaders of both parties began to gravitate ever so slowly toward a compromise plan put forth by a coalition of moderate and conservative Democrats. 
 The coalition would, like the G.O.P., balance the budget in 2002 and cut discretionary spending by almost 30 percent by 2002. But its plan forgoes all tax cuts, choosing instead to soften blows to Medicare and preserve Federal entitlements to welfare, Medicaid and food stamps. The coalition proposes to lower inflation adjustments -- in effect raising taxes and lowering Social Security benefits -- which will only happen if the President joins hands with Republican leaders in announcing collective support.
For all its good sense, the coalition plan cannot pass the House, whose 73 freshman Republicans swear to pass a $245 billion tax cut. That is the gap that the two parties must close. It will not be easy.
Over the weekend, leaders from both parties began groping for compromise. The Senate budget chairman, Pete Domenici, and his House counterpart, John Kasich, signaled that a smaller tax cut and inflation adjustment would be acceptable, as long as the Democrats simultaneously agreed. But even if the tax cut were reduced by half, the compromise plan would be over $100 billion short of balancing the budget.
The Congressional Budget Office will provide some relief when it issues new, probably lower, deficit projections, which could reduce the need to cut spending by between $30 billion and $100 billion. After that, the options are limited. The Republicans appear unwilling to cut needless weapons systems out of the defense budget. The White House, playing to the elderly, appears unwilling to make doable cuts in Medicare. That leaves only two places to find additional savings: non-defense discretionary spending and entitlement programs for the poor. Yet the coalition budget already makes huge cuts in both these areas.
The sobering truth is that Congress will be trapped into a vicious trade-off. Every dollar that Congress gives away in needless tax cuts will be taken from heavily hit discretionary programs or need-based entitlement programs. Here is where President Clinton could display leadership by stepping forward to forswear his own $100-billion-plus tax cut. In return he needs to insist that Congress preserve, at the very least, Federal entitlements to Medicaid and food stamps.
The best plan that will emerge from Congress will not be good. It will make unwarranted cuts in public investments in job training, education and research as well as poverty programs for the arbitrary purpose of eliminating the deficit in seven years. But the damage can be limited if good news from the C.B.O. can be combined with new flexibility by Mr. Clinton and the Republicans controlling Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: When Is 'Paper Money' Not Real Money?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There you go again! Five times you use the phrase "on paper" in discussing the fortune made by Steven P. Jobs from the marketing of stock in his new company, Pixar Animation Studios (front page, Nov. 30). Of course it was "on paper." 
 I first noted your use of that phrase in an editorial in 1992 in which you pooh-poohed the 50 percent decline in the Japanese stock market as being "only on paper," arguing that such a decline in wealth meant little in that huge and vibrant economy. May I remind you that the Japanese economy has been in recession, if not depression, ever since.
Your use of "on paper" to imply "not real" is ill advised, if not silly. Do you think some might have thought Mr. Jobs was delivered sacks of currency yesterday that he could put under his mattress? Or that Microsoft's Bill Gates, reputedly the world's richest self-made man, goes around with $13 billion in cash in his pockets? That money is more likely represented by electronic data and is not on paper.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Agencies, still in a slump, get predictions of stronger spending.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE leading forecaster of advertising spending has slightly trimmed his estimates for 1995 and 1996. Yet he maintains that "the role of advertising is re-emerging" in the American consumer marketplace.
Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at the McCann-Erickson U.S.A. unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, said he expected next year to be the third in a row in which "advertising should significantly outpace" the growth of the economy. Large marketers will continue to shift dollars from promotional efforts aimed at retailers into advertising campaigns directed at shoppers, he added. 
 Those words -- and Mr. Coen's prediction that gains in ad spending would continue to "outpace the economy for the rest of the decade" -- will undoubtedly be welcome along Madison Avenue as agencies strive to emerge from a steep five-year slump.
Mr. Coen spoke yesterday at the opening session of the 23d annual Paine Webber media conference in midtown Manhattan, where he was joined by John Perriss, the chairman of Zenith Media Worldwide, the media services agency owned by Cordiant P.L.C. Both Mr. Coen and Zenith offer predictions every June and December, and both executives presented similar lists of categories yesterday that are helping fuel spending growth, particularly computers and movies.
Mr. Coen is maintaining his optimistic outlook despite reductions in the spending figures he offered six months ago, to reflect the slowing of some advertising activities and adjustments related to the value of the dollar against foreign currencies. Mr. Perriss echoed Mr. Coen's forecasts for 1995 and 1996, but his spectacles were somewhat less rose-colored than Mr. Coen's for the years beyond that.
Mr. Coen, who has been tracking ad spending for 47 years, said that 1995 was expected to end with total ad spending of $161.5 billion in the United States, up 7.7 percent from the $150 billion spent in 1994. A year ago he predicted that 1995 spending would total $159 billion, and six months ago he revised that figure upward to $161.9 billion.
"The last six months are coming in good, but not as good as we thought," Mr. Coen said in a telephone interview after his presentation. One reason was retail advertising in newspapers, he added, "which just can't seem to get off the ground."
Mr. Coen revised his figure for 1995 ad spending outside the United States to $190 billion, up 6.5 percent from $178.4 billion in 1994; that compares with a forecast in June of $193.4 billion. The revised figure puts the 1995 worldwide total at a record $351.5 billion, up 7 percent from $328.4 billion in 1994.
In 1996, total spending in the United States will remain strong, Mr. Coen predicted, at $174.1 billion, up 7.8 percent from 1995. His initial forecast for 1996, made in June, was $175 billion.
Mr. Coen expects the increases next year to be driven by a pair of events that occur every four years, the Presidential election and the Summer Olympics. The "special stimulative conditions should be even greater," he added, because the Games will take place in Atlanta -- the first time they will have been staged in this country since 1984 -- and events on television will be "available for peak prime-time live viewing at premium advertising prices."
"We also expect Olympic-related promotions in other media to further stimulate advertising spending next year," Mr. Coen said.
Mr. Coen predicts that ad spending will total $202.9 billion outside the United States next year -- the first time the $200 billion milestone will be reached, if that occurs. Although that figure is lower than the $210 billion he initially predicted in June, it represents an increase of 6.8 percent from the $190 billion he has predicted for ad spending overseas this year.
Mr. Coen expects spending in the United States and abroad for 1996 to total $377 billion, up 7.3 percent from the $351.5 billion he has projected for 1995.
Mr. Perriss, in offering the latest Zenith forecast, said worldwide ad spending in 1995 would total $353.5 billion, up 6.7 percent from the $331.4 billion spent in 1994. For 1996, he forecast total worldwide ad spending of $378.5 billion, up 7.1 percent from his 1995 figure.
Betsy Frank, executive vice president and director of strategic media resources at the Zenith office in New York, said Zenith, unlike Mr. Coen, is "seeing '96 as being the high-water point in terms of increases" through the rest of the decade."
"We see there are, if not some red lights, some yellow lights that suggest, at least in the United States, the robust ad-spending increases will probably take us through only '96 and might well slow down after that," she added.
A third prediction is closer to Mr. Perriss's than to Mr. Coen's. Jack Myers of Myers Communications in Parsippany, N.J., the publisher of an advertising newsletter, projects an increase of 5.9 percent in domestic ad spending in 1996, which he said would usher in "at least a two-year cycle of sluggish advertiser spending."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slips as Mark Advances, Especially Against the Franc

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday as the German mark rose against other European currencies, scoring its biggest gains against the French franc as a result of labor strikes in France.
"As the situation in France deteriorates, people are buying the mark, and that's an anti-dollar move," said David DeRosa, director of currency trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. 
 When the mark gains against European currencies, it generally rises against the dollar, too, as speculators seek all opportunities to buy marks.
"The mark is strong across the board, and that is hurting the dollar," said Tom Hoge, corporate currency trader at Bank of New York.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4390 marks, down from 1.4460 marks on Friday. It also slipped to 101.20 Japanese yen from 101.25 yen.
A rally in the American bond market, which sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to a two-year low of 6.02 percent, helped the dollar pare some early losses yesterday. Rising bond prices help the dollar because foreigners generally must first purchase dollars to buy Treasury bonds.
The French franc came under pressure as investors became increasingly worried that Prime Minister Alain Juppe would back down from plans to cut Government spending as public transport strikes entered their second week and employees in other state-owned companies prepared to walk out.
The franc was also undermined by heavy selling in the French stock and bond markets on expectations that the Bank of France might raise interest rates to defend the French currency.
"The franc is very much in the headlines now that the strikes have spread from the transport sector to other businesses," said Jurgen Lindemann, foreign exchange manager at Standard Chartered Bank in London. "The franc looks like it could creep above 3.50" francs per mark.
In New York, the mark was quoted at 3.4708 French francs, up from 3.4557 francs on Friday in New York. But the dollar slipped to 4.9950 francs, from 4.9981 francs.
The dollar also fell to 1.1685 Swiss francs, from 1.1772 francs. The British pound rose to $1.5325, from $1.5310. And the Canadian dollar fell to 73.08 United States cents from 73.23 cents.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Are Fueled By Hopes of Rate Reduction

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury bond yields continued to fall yesterday -- actually slipping below 6 percent briefly -- amid continuing expectations of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The yield on the long bond hit its lowest level since November 1993.
The price rally, now in its fourth day, was fueled by short-coverings, when prices of securities, which move in the opposite direction from their yields, broke above some key technical levels. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 29/32 of a percentage point, to 111 23/32 , for a yield of 6.02 percent, down from 6.08 percent on Friday.
Lacking fresh economic data for guidance, the market was left to its own sentiment, which is that "the economy is kind of soft right now," said Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist at ASB Capital Management, a money management firm in Washington D.C. He said that the slower economic growth would eventually bring on an easing. "It's still early December and my feeling at this point is that statistically an ease in monetary policy in December can still be made between now and Dec. 19, when the Federal Open Market Committee meets. That is, if we continue to get the same kinds of soft economic data that we have had over that last few months."
News of slow holiday retail sales for a second consecutive weekend, during a period that normally accounts for nearly half of the year's retail volume, helped to raise the prospects of a Fed easing soon to reinvigorate an economy that is lossing its wind.
The last rate cut was on July 6, when the Fed lowered the target for overnight bank loans a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.75 percent.
Mr. Carpenter said the market was rallying on a number of beliefs, including the notion that one way or another the budget defficit issue may prove to be constructive for bonds in 1996.
Heavy buying was also apparent in bond furtures trading, as the March bond contract hit a new high of 120 31/32 . Some traders reported that Dean Witter was in the market early and bought about 1,000 Treasury bond contracts at prices between 119 31/32 and 120, giving an early lift to trading.
Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson Research of Boston, said an example of the futures market's stength yesterday was that the March Treasury bond contract was at a support level that normally represented the outermost daily resistance. "This is the strongest type of rally you can have," Ms. Mesch said. The low for the day on the contract was 119 25/32 ; at the close it stood at at 120 24/32 .
"New resistance seems to piling up at around 122 22/32 , Ms. Mesch said, "but then again I never though we'd get this far. Very long term, it looks like 126 27/32 can be attained."
Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc., said it was obvious that the market had not lost its focus on low inflation and the negotiations for a balanced budget -- not to mention the ever-increasing expectation of an easing by the Fed.
"The rate cut is already priced in, and while the market is clearly over bought it could go alot further before profit taking kicks in, Mr. Guild said.
He said he was not surprised at the low yields. "I continue to expect new lows, as I have all year," he said. "Some people are now hung up on the false notion that 6 percent is some sort of a resistance point. I think next real resistant is the old low of 5.79 percent set on Oct. 15, 1993."
Interest rates at yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills declined, with the average discount rate for a three-month issue down to 5.29 percent, from 5.32 percent last week, and a six-month issue down to 5.19 percent, from 5.25 percent.
The Treasury is currently operating just under its $4.9 trillion debt limit because the Administration and Congress have yet to agree on a budget plan to fully finance the Government. So in an effort to remain under the debt limit, foreign central banks were prohibited at yesteray's auction from buying any bills exceeding the maturing bills they already held.
On Thursday the Treasury will be selling $18.75 billion of new one-year bills, which by late yesterday had a rate of 5.04 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.663	97.376	Discounted Rate	5.29%	5.19%	Coupon Yield	5.45%	5.42%	High Price	98.668	97.386	Discounted Rate	5.27%	5.17%	Coupon Yield	5.43%	5.40%	Low Price	98.663	97.376	Discounted Rate	5.29%	5.19%	Coupon Yield	5.45%	5.42%	Accepted at low price	70%	43%	Total applied for	$51,936,369	$46,987,136	Accepted	$14,025,069	$14,020,376	Noncompetitive	$1,494,449	$1,274,061	

Both issues are dated Dec. 7, 1995. The three-month bills mature on March 7, 1996, and the six-month bills mature on June 6, 1996.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Foreign Business to Put $6.3 Billion in Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 4

 BODY:
For the second time in a week, President Ernesto Zedillo convened a group of business executives at the presidential mansion today to announce hefty new foreign investments in Mexico.
Last Wednesday, 30 of the heaviest hitters in Mexican business -- men like Carlos Slim Helu of Telefonos de Mexico and Claudio X. Gonzalez of Kimberly-Clark -- announced that their companies would collectively invest $6.2 billion in 1996. 
 Today, more than 100 American, Canadian, European and Asian executives, led by Kenneth C. Brown of General Electric de Mexico, Georg Braunleder of Bayer de Mexico, and Masao Horie Yamachika of Nissan Mexicana, paraded in similar fashion into an auditorium at the presidential residence at Los Pinos. There, Commerce Minister Herminio Blanco announced that the foreign companies had promised to invest $6.3 billion next year.
"The President's people are trying to generate a more upbeat mood toward Mexico's economic performance," said Sergio Sarmiento, an economic analyst and syndicated columnist here. "They think Mexico has a confidence problem, and by bringing together these major investors, they're trying to reassure the markets that if they put money in Mexican bonds and stocks, they'll be in good company."
A few weeks ago, the peso was again under great pressure and Mexican stocks were weak. Both have firmed considerably since then, lifting the economic mood. The orchestrated announcements in the last week of billions of dollars of investments -- though some undoubtedly long planned -- and the executives' expressions of confidence in the economy are meant to sustain that optimistic mood. The total of $12.5 billion represents a prodigious investment in this country's $320 billion economy.
The ceremony with Mexican entrepreneurs last week propelled an already surging stock market. But today, the main Mexico City index dropped 13.84 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,689.58. Analysts said the market had been ripe for profit taking after a rally that lifted the index more than 200 points in two weeks.
Of today's $6.3 billion, about $3.45 billion was pledged by American and Canadian companies, $1.59 billion by Europeans and $1.18 billion by Asians, according to figures released by the Mexican Investment Board, a Government agency.
Some of these investments were included when President Zedillo announced in October in New York that a dozen American and Canadian companies had pledged to invest $12 billion in Mexico over the next five years, the board said.
Mr. Brown of General Electric said in an interview that his company planned to invest $150 million in Mexico next year, much of it in a $650 million natural gas-driven electric power plant at Samalayuca, south of the border city of Juarez. Also investing in that project, Mr. Brown said, were Bechtel, El Paso Natural Gas and Mexico's largest construction company, Empresas.
Among the other foreign companies making commitments today were AT&T, GTE Data Services, Amoco, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Sony, BMW and France Telecom.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Heating Oil Increases in Price As a Large Cold System Arrives

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Heating oil futures prices surged yesterday as a large cold weather system moved into the middle United States and threatened to increase demand for already tight heating oil supplies.
Natural gas futures also gained. Crude and unleaded gasoline futures prices moved higher in sympathy and on lingering concern over the health of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Tony Lerner, an oil analyst at Chase Manhattan, said. 
 "People are looking at the weather for the rest of the week," Mr. Lerner said. "And there's a certain amount of jitters in the market over this medical news of King Fahd."
On other commodity markets, lumber futures climbed the daily limit, while soybeans futures rose. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities jumped 1.37 points, to 243.05
Heating oil for January delivery rose 1.36 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange to settle at 54.03 cents a gallon, the highest for the contract closest to delivery since it settled at 54.25 cents on Aug. 1, 1994.
January natural gas rose 0.51 cent, to $2.12 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Forecasters called for a very cold Canadian air mass to plunge into the middle United States and portions of the Northeast, the two largest heating oil markets, and push temperatures as much as 10 degrees lower.
Forecasters said the extremely cold weather might last only a day or two, but it comes at a time when refiners have been producing much less, said Gerald E. Samuels, ARB oil analyst.
Crude oil and its products also rose on lingering concerns about the health of the Saudi King, who reportedly suffered a stroke. His death could lead to a succession battle among Saudi Arabia's royal family, which has some 6,000 princes. Saudi Arabia produces about 12 percent of the world's oil output.
January light sweet crude oil rose 20 cents, to $18.63 a barrel, and January unleaded gasoline rose 0.54 cent, to 53.56 cents a gallon.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lumber futures prices advanced the daily trading limit as investors bet interest rates would continue falling and would spur renewed home building. January lumber rose $10, to $274.60 for 1,000 board feet.

HEADLINE: America Realizes The Arts Attract Tourists

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
In the competition for tourist dollars, Jonesborough, Tenn., cannot play in the same league with Disneyworld or Yellowstone Park. But in October, Jonesborough (population 3,400) drew about 8,600 visitors from all 50 states and several foreign countries to its annual storytelling festival, generating $5 million worth of economic activity in the region.
Last year, "The Age of Rubens" attracted 234,000 visitors to the Toledo Museum of Art in Toledo, Ohio, more than half of of them from out of state. In August, traditionally considered a dead month for art exhibitions, the Delaware Art Museum in Wilmington opened a two-month show of Pre-Raphaelite art and marketed it to summer vacationers. It pulled an audience from the mid-Atlantic states that raised museum attendance by 434 percent over the same period in 1994. 
 Examples like these have not gone unnoticed by state and municipal officials in charge of economic development or by representatives of the tourist industry, who in the last five years have begun talking to local arts councils and museum officers.
Increasing recognition of the power of the arts to pull in tourist dollars has led to a host of new initiatives, partnerships and pilot development projects across the United States. Most of them are aimed at tapping into the cultural appetites of foreign visitors and the fat wallets of a new kind of American tourist, one who is more likely to seek out an art museum or a music festival than a shopping district or a theme park.
Recent surveys by the Commerce Department, the Travel Industry Association of America and D. K. Shiflet and Associates, a private company specializing in travel research, point to a growing tourist population, with the arts and local history at the top of their agenda.
"For the tourist industry, this is a market that is better educated, spends more time at a destination, spends more money, and is more likely to stay in a hotel than with family or friends," said Bill Moskin, a cultural tourism consultant in Sacramento, Calif., who often works with state arts councils, state tourism offices and convention and visitors bureaus. "For cities, this is a new way of marketing themselves, and for arts organizations, this is a way to diversify revenue."
With an eye to the cultural marketplace, several cities have followed the lead of San Francisco, whose convention and visitors bureau hired a full-time arts officer five years ago. This year, Los Angeles hired one for itself, and San Diego is now searching for one, too. Portland, Ore., and New Orleans, in search of a comprehensive cultural marketing plan, are now putting together consortiums that include representatives from arts organizations, the tourist industry and the local convention and visitors' bureaus.
The mandate is simple. "The purpose is to sell the arts and cultural products that we have to the tourists who come," said Shirley Trusty Corey, the executive director of the Arts Council of New Orleans.
For the arts, increased tourism means increased attendance and ticket sales, a big jump in museum gift shop sales and, in the case of blockbuster events, a gratifying spillover effect, since visitors to a major museum often seek out cultural events at other arts institutions.
But the hurdles are high. Many European countries, especially Britain and France, have long recognized the tourist value of the arts and have marketed them shrewdly. They have also worked hard to develop a tourist infrastructure of information offices, well marked itineraries, printed material in many languages, and small museums that interpret and represent the local culture. The tourist industry and the culture industry work together.
The United States lags far behind, a point made often in late October at the annual White House Conference on Travel and Tourism, which, for the first time, included a daylong session on cultural tourism. The mingling of arts and tourism officials led to some eye-opening encounters.
"Except in isolated cases, there has not been much conversation between these entities," said Edward H. Able Jr., the executive director of the American Association of Museums. "One thing we learned was the vast economic impact of tourism, a $512 billion industry that generates $58 billion in state and local taxes and a $22 billion trade surplus for the United States."
Eduardo Diaz, the director of the San Antonio Department of Arts and Culture, described the culture and tourism industries as ships passing in the night: "We have tended to think of the tourist as the guy with the loud shirt, Bermuda shorts and a camera around his neck, while the tourist industry thinks of artists as unreliable, out-of-it characters, but we have common interests."
In cities that have tried to get the two industries talking, an information void has emerged. "What I heard from tour operators, for example, was that every other potential supplier was in their face all the time, promoting events, but the arts groups didn't do that," said Mary Beth Kavanaugh, the arts and tourism manager of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau.
Tour operators and convention planners, for their part, did not know much about the arts. Robert Barrett, who was recently named the director of cultural tourism of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, is wrestling with the widespread perception of his city as an extension of Hollywood and nothing else. "The majority of people coming here are not coming here for our wide array of cultural attractions, because the wholesalers are not informing people," he said.
New York floats above the fray. It is the grand exception, because culture has always been central to its image. A 1992 study by the Port Authority found that visitors drawn to the metropolitan area primarily by its cultural offerings created $2.3 billion in economic activity.
Yet the city has no arts marketing plan. No one needs to promote SoHo, for example, because images of the neighborhood and the artists who have put it on the map are disseminated throughout the world every day by newspapers, magazines, television and film.
Elsewhere, the arts and tourist industries realize they need to act if they want to exploit a valuable asset. San Antonio has moved more quickly than many cities have, but its experience is fairly typical.
"It's not like San Antonio wasn't promoting its cultural and heritage inventory, but it wasn't focused," said Mr. Diaz. "It was just sort of thrown in with the Alamo and Sea World."
Then two things happened. First, in 1989 the city began financing the arts from the hotel and motel bed tax, a move that got arts officials and the tourism and hospitality industry talking to each other for the first time. Second, in 1991, the blockbuster exhibition "Splendors of Mexico" at the San Antonio Art Museum, produced so much money in state and local taxes -- nearly $8 million -- that the city began looking at culture with newfound interest.
Mr. Diaz now has an employee who works full-time with the tourist industry, and his office has persuaded the regional transportation authority to include arts institutions on its maps and to print brochures showing visitors how to follow special culture routes. With the city's public television station, his office is also producing a weekly arts guide to be broadcast on a television channel in local hotel rooms.
Small towns have also caught on to cultural tourism. This year, the Connecticut Humanities Council obtained a $1 million state grant, financed by the bed tax, to improve the quality of the exhibitions at museums and historical societies, on the assumption that they would draw more tourist dollars. Grant recipients will be required to work closely with their local tourism offices.
In depressed rural and manufacturing regions, the promise of no-pain economic development has made cultural tourism a new buzzword.
In part, the enthusiasm has been fueled by a series of heritage-tourism pilot projects carried out between 1989 and 1993 in 16 areas, all told, in Indiana, Texas, Wisconsin and Tennessee. The program, financed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Endowment for the Arts, created heritage corridors, or communities with a history and culture that can be packaged to appeal to tourists.
The idea is seductive, since it suggests that communities and institutions that would not draw tourists on their own can become attractions when placed on an itinerary.
The example of the Mississippi Delta suggests that work remains to be done. The blues music native to the area, as well as the literature and folk art of the region, exert a strong pull for many Americans and even more Europeans and Japanese, who in recent years have been turning up in large numbers.
Yet so far no one has quite figured out how to handle the situation, which was the subject of much discussion at a recent conference on cultural tourism in Greenville, Miss., attended by state tourism officials and scholars from the four Delta states.
"This just sort of backed up on people," said Robert Cogswell, the director of folk arts at the Tennessee Arts Commission. "Busloads of Japanese tourists began showing up in little towns and asking to be pointed to Robert Johnson's gravestone."
When KLM, the Dutch airline, began direct flights into Memphis this year, the city of Memphis and the Mississippi state tourism office quickly created a promotion called "America's Blues Alley." They printed color brochures with an itinerary through Delta blues country. The convention and visitors bureaus in St. Louis and New Orleans recently published a self-guided driving tour that runs 700 miles from St. Louis to New Orleans. Essentially, however, tourists must fend for themselves.
"Millions are being spent by our state to advertise the Delta as the home of the blues," said William Ferris, the director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. "But should thousands of people descend on the Delta, there is very little, other than a small museum in Clarksdale, to present the culture."
This contrasts sharply with the thoughtful, well developed presentation of Civil War history at places like Vicksburg, Mississippi. The challenge for state tourism officials and arts administrators is figuring out how to bring the blues to an eager audience in the same way.
"We have a culture loved all over the world," said Mr. Ferris, "and now we have to come to terms with it."

HEADLINE: LEADERS OF A.M.A. CRITICAL OF PLAN TO ALTER MEDICAID

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Leaders of the American Medical Association, who endorsed Speaker Newt Gingrich's plans for Medicare eight weeks ago, today expressed grave concern about Republican proposals for Medicaid and said Congress should preserve a Federal guarantee of health insurance coverage for low-income people.
Trustees of the association said they had not endorsed the Republicans' bill, the Medicaid Transformation Act of 1995, submitted to President Clinton last week as part of a wide-ranging measure to balance the budget. The bill would replace the current Medicaid program with lump-sum grants that the states could decide how to spend on health care for low-income people. 
 Mr. Clinton has also asserted that it is crucial to maintain a Federal guarantee of coverage for the poor. He has until next Tuesday to act on the legislation, which he has said he will veto.
Republicans hailed the A.M.A.'s endorsement of their Medicare proposals in October and cannot easily dismiss the doctors' concerns about Medicaid now. Medicare covers 37 million people who are elderly or disabled. Medicaid covers nearly 37 million low-income people, including many children and elderly.
Without specifying a number, and without denouncing the Republicans' proposals, the doctors' group suggested "lowering the level of reductions" in the growth of Medicaid.
Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the medical association, said many doctors wanted to preserve Medicaid as a Federal entitlement, so that certain groups of low-income people would be guaranteed coverage for specific health benefits.
But the Republican bill says that states are not required to cover "any particular items or services," and that Federal law "shall not be construed as providing for an entitlement."
Republicans say the lump-sum payments, known as block grants, would give states new freedom to set eligibility criteria and scope of benefits, so they could run Medicaid programs more efficiently.
Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Republican governors like John Engler of Michigan affirmed their support for Medicaid block grants today. Ed Gillespie, a spokesman for Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican leader, said he welcomed the doctors' views, but did not think they would change many votes in Congress.
"The doctors' ability to deliver care to needy patients will not be diminished," Mr. Gillespie said.
Critics of the proposal say states will be tempted to reduce the number of people covered or the services provided, especially in recessions, when more people apply for help.
The medical association said it had not openly opposed converting Medicaid to a block grant program because Congressional leaders indicated that this change was "non-negotiable." But Dr. Todd said the policy of the association was to encourage more uniformity in state Medicaid programs.
The A.M.A. says the Federal Government should establish "basic national standards of uniform eligibility" and should prescribe a minimum package of benefits that would be available to poor people in all states -- "basic standards of uniform minimum adequate benefits for Medicaid recipients."
The trustees said, "There needs to be an appropriate balance between states' interests in securing increased flexibility, in light of fewer Federal funds for Medicaid, and the very real needs of the people the Medicaid program is intended to serve, most of whom have no other means of access to health care coverage."
In negotiations with Congress, the doctors' group has spent more time on Medicare than Medicaid, even though the proposed changes in Medicaid are bigger. Aides to Mr. Gingrich said that, in meetings on Capitol Hill, the doctors had not explicitly opposed the idea of Medicaid block grants, but had indicated they wanted more money for the program.
Doctors say that Medicaid already pays less than private health insurance, and they fear that some states will cope with block grants by cutting payments even more. Preliminary studies suggest that many states will be forced to restrict Medicaid eligibility and "cut reimbursement to providers," the association said.
The A.M.A. endorsed the House Republicans' Medicare proposal in October, after receiving assurances that Medicare payments to doctors would be cut less than originally planned. The proposal would encourage elderly people to enroll in health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care. It would also create new business opportunities for doctors, allowing them to form their own health plans to serve Medicare beneficiaries.
Dr. Daniel H. Johnson Jr., president-elect of the association, said that reports of the endorsement provoked protests from many doctors who thought "it was a deal over money" rather than health policy.
In an interview today, Dr. Lonnie R. Bristow, president of the association, said: "It was initially reported that the A.M.A. made a deal on Medicare. Doctors all across this country justifiably resented that. If I thought the association were doing something sleazy, I too would resent it. There was no deal. What we did was to go in and explain that an unintended problem in access to care was about to be created, and once the House leadership saw that, they made an appropriate adjustment so as to avoid that."
Leaders of the medical association said their group still preferred the House version of the Medicare legislation, parts of which were dropped from the measure ultimately sent to the White House.
Republicans in Congress would cut projected Federal spending on Medicaid by $163 billion, or 17 percent, over seven years. Although Federal spending on the program would rise to $127 billion in 2002, from $89 billion this year, the annual rate of growth would be cut in half, to 5 percent.
Mr. Barbour, said, "We will have very substantial growth in Medicaid, but we will do it in a context that allows the money to go much further."
In an interview, Mr. Barbour said: "States have proven that for less money you can provide better care. States that have had Medicaid reform like Arizona find patient satisfaction is up, and the quality of care is also up. Governors understand that if you keep the current system, you cannot achieve the savings without endangering the quality of care."
Many state officials say they can save money by enrolling Medicaid recipients in H.M.O.'s and other forms of managed care, which provide a wide range of services for fixed monthly payments. But many doctors are apprehensive.
The policy-making arm of the medical association, the House of Delegates, is meeting here this week. A resolution submitted by the American College of Physicians, representing 85,000 internists, says, "There is considerable concern that restructuring of the Medicaid program and rapid transition to managed care could cause serious disruptions in access to health care or reductions in the quality of health care services provided to eligible recipients."
Dr. J. Harold Morris, an internist from Independence, Mo., told the association that the Republicans' Medicaid proposals "would cut back a program that has been quite successful and could well increase the number of uninsured."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "THE DETAILS: Medicaid at a Glance"
 
WHAT IS MEDICAID? -- Enacted in 1965 in the same legislation that created Medicare, it is the nation's major program for providing health insurance to poor people. It is available to anyone who meets the eligibility criteria.
 
HOW IS IT FINANCED? -- States and the Federal Government share the expenses. States receive Federal support according to the state's per capita income, so that the Federal share is larger in poorer states. The Federal share can range from 50 to 80 percent of Medicaid expenditures. States establish their own eligibility criteria within Federal guidelines.
 
WHO IS COVERED? -- Initially intended to provide health care for welfare recipients, Medicaid has been expanded to include some additional children, and some blind and disabled people, pregnant women and many residents of nursing homes. Nearly 37 million people are covered, about half of them children.
 
WHAT IS COVERED? -- Basic services include inpatient and outpatient hospital services; doctors' services; laboratory and X-ray services; nursing homes and home health care; early and periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment for children under 21 years of age; family planning; prenatal care, and rural clinics.
 
WHAT ARE THE COSTS? -- Federal Medicaid spending quadrupled in the last decade and doubled in the last five years, to $82 billion in 1994. For 1995, the Federal share is estimated at $89 billion and state spending at $67 billion. MONICA BORKOWSKI (pg. B9)

Agency Losing U.S. Aid For Developing Nations

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Dec. 4

 BODY:
The United States announced today that it is pulling out of a United Nations agency whose mission is to encourage industry in developing nations.
The United States supplies about one fourth of the $31 million annual budget of the agency, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, whose annual conference began on Monday. The move is bound to cause a financial crisis. 
 The United States has long complained of inefficiency at the agency, and its withdrawal follows months of pressure in Congress to reduce foreign aid.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Wouldn't Gain From Independence;
World Will Suffer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am writing to commend American journalists like A. M. Rosenthal who point out just how obsequious the United States has been behaving before Communist China (column, Dec. 1). 
 The world will suffer if China gets its way with Taiwan. A Communist occupation of Taiwan will be the beginning of an trend in which the Chinese will reclaim their age-old fantasy of being the world's Central Kingdom.
The Chinese reaction to Taiwan is not, as the Communists claim, a domestic issue. China's desire to blockade Taiwan stems less from nationalistic ideals of unification than from Taiwan's threat as a symbol of success founded on Western ideals of democracy and human rights.
The Communists are aware that if Taiwan succeeds in its first direct popular presidential election in March, the legitimacy of their monopolistic reign on the mainland will be forever threatened.
The West should cease its optimistic belief that China will somehow channel its economic growth toward the institution of Western-style democracy. As any intelligent observer can see, this will never be the case.
There is a clear connection between China's recent anti-Western rhetoric and its escalating verbal condemnation of and military threats against Taiwan. A Chinese blockade of Taiwan is as much a war waged against the legitimacy of American principles as against Taiwan.

Businesses Fight Payroll Tax

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
Business leaders in Jersey City descended on City Hall yesterday with signed postcards from more than 1,000 local businesses opposed to a proposed payroll tax. Peter T. D. Murphy, president of the Hudson County Chamber of Commerce, said local business operators feel "a sense of betrayal" because the city's Republican Mayor, Bret Schundler, supports the tax. But Tom Gallagher, a spokesman for the Mayor, said it is needed because the value of the city's taxable property has declined 18 percent since the Mayor took office in 1992. 
 The payroll tax, which would raise an estimated $20 million a year, comes up for a final City Council vote tomorrow night.

HEADLINE: White House Says It Can Avoid a Debt Crisis for Weeks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said today that the Administration had found new, though legally untested, methods of keeping the Government solvent "at least through January," giving the Clinton Administration considerably more breathing room in its budget standoff with Congress.
While Mr. Rubin would not discuss how long he could drag out his delicate fiscal balancing act, other Administration officials said that Treasury and Justice Department lawyers had been meeting daily to devise a legally defensible strategy for sidestepping the Congressionally set $4.9 trillion limit on Federal borrowing well into the spring. "A lot of it is open to challenge, because the U.S. Government has never had to do this before," one official said. "But we think we've got some ideas that will work." 
 Mr. Rubin declined to say what method the Treasury had chosen to keep the Government paying its bills and the interest and principal due on Government securities. In the past, he has kept his strategy close to the vest, for fear that Congressional Republicans would try to block the Treasury, in their effort to force Mr. Clinton to choose between default and their budget priorities.
So far the Republicans have not launched a court challenge to the Administration's efforts to avoid the debt ceiling, which is set annually by Congress. But Congressional Republicans say they are clearing the path for such a move. "I would be willing to use the threat of default to say, 'Look, you have to come to some agreement on the seven-year balanced budget,' " said Representative Nick Smith, a Michigan Republican who has been one of Mr. Rubin's leading critics on Capitol Hill. Last week Speaker Newt Gingrich accused Mr. Rubin of "looting" retirement funds under the Treasury's control to exceed the debt limit, and he appointed Mr. Smith to head a "House Debt Limit and Misuse of Trust Funds Task Force."
The Republicans have repeatedly accused Mr. Rubin, a former investment banker, of trying to alarm the financial markets with exaggerated warnings about default, in hopes that a sharp market reaction would scare Republican leaders into a budget compromise. Mr. Rubin insists that he is doing just the opposite -- taking emergency steps to keep the markets from plunging if the United States flirted with nonpayment.
Today it was Mr. Gingrich who used the threat of market disaster in the struggle for political advantage in the budget stalemate. In a speech this afternoon to a medical association, Mr. Gingrich said that if a budget deal is postponed "you will see interest rates skyrocket and the stock market crash, because the fact is, they are counting on us keeping our word because they actually believe we are different."
In managing the debt crisis, Mr. Rubin faces a difficult political choice. In the context of the budget battle, the only way to get Congress to act on extending the debt limit -- an automatic step in ordinary times -- is to provoke a crisis and risk the prospect that the United States could default for the first time in its history. But that assumes that Congress will blink at the last minute, a bet no one in the White House is willing to take.
The other option is to continue to find ways to evade the debt limit, as Mr. Rubin did late last month when he orchestrated an elaborate accounting trick with two Government retirement accounts. By manipulating how the funds are invested, he put the Government about $60 billion under the debt ceiling, enough to enable it to borrow the funds to make it through the month of December. Under a decade-old law, civil servants with funds in those accounts are guaranteed full restitution of any lost interest on their retirement funds.
But the more Mr. Rubin uses such techniques, the more he opens himself up to the charge that he has become the Chicken Little of fiscal policy, threatening imminent disaster, then forestalling the day of reckoning. Mr. Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, have repeatedly questioned Mr. Rubin's credibility, charging that he is creating artificial crises and then solving them.
Mr. Rubin responds that it would be irresponsible for a Treasury Secretary to risk default, and the prospect that it would shake confidence around the world in the creditworthiness of the United States. His spokesman, Howard Schloss, said today that Mr. Rubin had been "quite surprised" over the weekend, while visiting Brazil and Argentina, when several officials asked him whether the United States was in any danger of failing to pay its debts.
"These are not the kinds of questions Treasury officials are accustomed to receiving when they visit developing nations," Mr. Schloss said.
The risk Mr. Rubin runs now is that his strategy of sidestepping the debt limit could come under legal challenge. Government lawyers are betting that Federal judges would be unwilling to push the country to the brink of default -- or that a budget deal would make the issue moot by the time it received a full hearing in court.
But the risk for the Administration remains that the balancing act cannot go on forever, and that the Republicans will begin to make an impression on voters with their claims that Mr. Rubin is manipulating retirement funds. "We can't do this indefinitely," one senior Administration official conceded today.

Recruiting In Shadow Of Bosnia

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
UNLESS you know exactly where it is, you can walk past the United States Army recruiting station near Lincoln Center without giving it so much as a glance. It blends into the background at Amsterdam Avenue and 66th Street, dwarfed by Martin Luther King Jr. High School across the street and no more conspicuous than the hairdresser's shop next door.
No sir, said Sgt. First Class Abelito Solis, the station commander, young men and women are not in the habit of dropping in to sign up. He and his three fellow recruiters really have to pursue them at the 12 high schools and 2 colleges in their district. 
 It is a difficult task, requiring endless patience, especially when they come up against principals and guidance counselors who make clear that the only green uniforms they can tolerate are on the Jets.
"A lot of them are old-timers -- from the Vietnam era," said Sergeant Solis, 32, a polite fellow who might have chosen different words had he known he was talking to a Vietnam-era geezer who left his bottle of Geritol home.
"Those are people," he said, "who don't have a good impression of the Army."
Principals notwithstanding, the military has worked hard since the Vietnam era to improve its image, and with fair success. Recruiters had a fairly easy time after the 1991 gulf war. But they are suddenly back in troubled waters as United States peacekeeping troops get ready to pour into Bosnia.
Sergeant Solis, who earned his Combat Infantryman Badge in Iraq four years ago, is well aware that if American casualties pile up, his own job could become painful.
There is just no way now to predict. But to play it safe, the sergeant doesn't let the word Bosnia cross his lips when he talks to young New Yorkers and their parents.
"I'm in the business of putting people in the Army," he said candidly. "I'm not looking for reasons for them not to join. If it comes up, it comes up. We'll deal with it."
Thus far, even in Lincoln Center, recruiters are doing surprisingly well in a town where military tradition for many does not go beyond guessing who is buried in Grant's Tomb.
The New York City Recruiting Battalion, which includes suburban counties, met its quota and then some, ending the last Federal fiscal year tied for first with its counterpart in Jackson, Miss. Its "mission" -- the professionals do not like "quota" -- was to put 3,546 men and women in the regular Army and the Reserves. It signed up 3,843.
THIS year should also turn out well, said Lieut. Col. Anthony Parker, the battalion commander since last June, and Maj. Gregory Penczak, the chief Marine recruiter in the region, is similarly confident. "Young people are receptive to what the Army has to offer," Colonel Parker said yesterday in his spare office at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn. "It offers career development and a way out of New York, if they want that."
Many apparently do.
No doubt, the New York battalion benefits from its own hard work. But as its recruiters acknowledge, it helps to be in a city with an unemployment rate of around 9 percent, well above the national average. The Army tends to look better to civilians when the economy goes flat. And given the prevailing corporate ethic, which to some seems to hold that success is measured by how many people you toss out of work, there is no local shortage of volunteers, even if recruiters elsewhere in the country have seen their numbers drop.
TO many young people, a big draw is the offer of up to $30,000 in college tuition. It was good enough to lure Arundel Hunte, 18, of Bedford-Stuyvesant -- Private Hunte since his high-school graduation last summer. "I thought I'd go into the Army, straighten myself out, earn the tuition but also get some discipline," he said. "If you don't have discipline, you can't do anything."
In a way, recruiting stations provide a snapshot of New York.
The school system's failings are reflected in the large numbers of young volunteers who wash out after they are screened for basic verbal and math skills. And poor neighborhoods, which in theory should produce an ample supply of recruits, struggle with high percentages of teen-agers having criminal records that disqualify them.
"A lot of people have the wrong idea about us," said Sergeant Solis, who was born in the Philippines. "If they can't make it on the outside, they're not going to in the Army."
Of course, financial incentives cannot outweigh the potential harm of a military nightmare in the Balkans. The coming months in Bosnia, Colonel Parker said, may determine Fort Hamilton's success for years. "If it doesn't go well," he said, "if it starts looking like Vietnam, we could have a hard time."

HEADLINE: President, Yielding to G.O.P., Will Offer Plan Erasing Deficit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Acceding to Republican demands, the White House said today that by week's end it would give Congress a proposal to erase the Federal budget deficit in seven years, and offered a detailed description of how it would cut projected spending on Medicare, one of the most crucial elements of the plan.
The development was a genuine if faint sign of movement in a political logjam that has blocked a balanced-budget accord for close to a year. But as budget talks resumed today after a bitter five-day standoff, negotiators on each side continued to charge that the other was blocking progress toward an agreement. 
 In today's talks, the White House said it was ready to provide Republicans written details of the single largest element of its budget proposal: President Clinton's longstanding plan to trim projected spending on Medicare by $124 billion over seven years.
But Republican negotiators -- who had been pressing the Administration for a detailed broader plan, on eliminating the deficit by 2002 -- quickly called that offer insufficient. That led Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, to accuse them of foot-dragging.
"We felt that it was extremely important that we begin to talk about the issues," Mr. Panetta said. "The only way we can begin to understand our differences is start talking about these differences."
Republicans said later that they wanted to see the entire Democratic budget proposal rather than a piecemeal presentation on Medicare. At the same time, they complained that the White House had refused to divulge the economic assumptions behind its Medicare plan, making it impossible to draw any comparison with the Republicans' own proposal to reduce projected Medicare expenses over seven years by $270 billion.
Details of the Administration's Medicare proposal, released publicly by the White House after today's round of negotiations, parallel the Republican proposal in promising beneficiaries new options in health coverage through more managed care plans.
The White House would not, however, allow all the options the Republicans want, like medical savings accounts. Administration officials say this reflects their effort to protect the standard Medicare program.
The Administration also says its plan would keep solvent through the year 2011 the Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills.
And, it says, the plan would achieve its seven-year savings of $124 billion "without undermining the structural integrity of the program or imposing new costs on beneficiaries." The plan also promises a limited number of new benefits, including respite care for families of Alzheimer's patients and expansion of coverage for preventive services like mammograms.
Running disputes over who is and who is not a good-faith bargainer led the glacial budget talks to collapse altogether last week, and on the surface, at least, it did not appear that they were moving any faster today. Republican leaders said the two sides had now put off their next meeting until Thursday, when Mr. Clinton's new budget may be ready.
Congress and the White House have given themselves until Dec. 15, when legislation temporarily financing many Government operations expires, to hash out their differences over annual spending bills for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1.
But prospects for meeting that deadline faded today when the Congressional Budget Office said that it would be unable to produce a new economic forecast, the yardstick by which any budget compromise will be measured, until Dec. 12.
The Democratic leader in the Senate, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said he hoped Congress could enact a budget deal by Dec. 22, the day many here expect legislators to leave for a holiday recess. But one senior Administration official, who insisted on not being otherwise identified, said it was more likely that the debate would still be smoldering when Congress returns in January.
Still, not everyone sounded discouraged. "Despite the fact that we've had four meetings and they've degenerated into nothing but shouting matches," said Senator Jim Exon of Nebraska, a Democratic budget negotiator, "behind the scenes we're making progress."
The Administration's agreement to offer its own seven-year budget plan, meeting the Republicans' central condition for serious bargaining, is one bright spot, he said. Another is the certainty that the Congressional Budget Office's next economic forecast, however belated, will assume lower Federal spending -- and thus lower deficits -- than the current one.
By current reckoning, the White House proposes to spend some $475 billion more over the next seven years than would Republicans in Congress. Both sides in the budget talks are counting on the budget office's new forecast to erase $50 billion to $100 billion of that gap.
In a letter today, the director of the budget office, June O'Neill, declined to make a specific prediction. But she did say that recent data suggested that over the next seven years, inflation would be slightly lower, Medicare and Medicaid spending would rise more slowly, and welfare spending would be less than earlier projections had forecast.
"Although taken individually some of these changes increase the Federal deficit and others decrease it, their total effect is likely to be a more favorable budget outlook," Ms. O'Neill wrote in her letter, addressed to the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico.
The President, meanwhile, is embarking on his third 1996 budget proposal so far this year. The first, issued in February, contemplated deficits averaging $200 billion annually for the foreseeable future. The second, a rough outline made public in June, proposed to balance the budget within 10 years.
Although most details of Mr. Clinton's latest plan have not been disclosed, Mr. Exon said today that in addition to holding Medicare and Medicaid spending at the same levels as in the President's 10-year budget of June, it would focus many remaining cuts on so-called discretionary programs like road-building, defense and housing.
Mr. Exon and others said the White House proposal would include a tax cut for working families of perhaps $100 billion over seven years, well below the $245 billion in cuts that the Republicans propose.
Other money may be found by closing tax loopholes and recalculating the Consumer Price Index, the Federal inflation gauge that is used to automatically adjust Social Security and welfare checks and other benefits, Mr. Exon said. Most economists agree that the index overstates inflation, and the Republican plan would reduce it by 0.2 percentage point.
Mr. Clinton's proposal has been under discussion among House and Senate Democrats for days, and some details were presented to legislators on Monday. Still, Mr. Daschle, the Senate Democratic leader, appeared taken aback today by White House plans to offer it to the Republicans. He told reporters that the President had made clear that the White House's 10-year budget proposal of June "ought to be the basis for a beginning" of negotiations.

HEADLINE: White House Documents Reveal Similarities to G.O.P.'s Plans for Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
The White House proposals to revamp Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, are in some respects remarkably similar to those in the Republican budget bill passed by Congress, according to documents obtained from the Administration.
Both promise Medicare beneficiaries a variety of new insurance options, including coverage through health maintenance organizations and health plans organized by doctors and hospitals. But the White House proposal would allow more growth in Medicare spending than the Republicans would, and President Clinton appears more willing to use Government regulation to protect beneficiaries against erosion in the quality of care. 
 Under current law, Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays hospital bills, is expected to run out of money in 2002. Mr. Clinton said his proposal would assure its solvency through 2011. Republicans said their plan would keep the trust fund going through 2017.
Administration officials met today with Congressional leaders in another effort to see if they could agree on how to balance the Federal budget in seven years.
Ed Kutler, an aide to Speaker Newt Gingrich, said tonight that he could not comment on Mr. Clinton's Medicare proposals because he and other Republicans had not seen them. "Administration officials come in with piecemeal proposals," he said, "but we are waiting for their entire plan to balance the budget in seven years. We will look at the Medicare proposals in the context of the entire plan."
It is difficult to compare the savings that would be achieved by Mr. Clinton against those projected by the Republicans. The White House has estimated the savings from each of its proposals, but most of the numbers were deleted from documents made available tonight.
The White House numbers are based on calculations by the White House Office of Management and Budget. The Republicans' savings were estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. The two agencies have different assumptions about the economy and the effects of various proposals, so their figures are not directly comparable.
Thus, for example, President Clinton said tonight that his proposals would cut projected spending on Medicare by $124 billion over seven years. The Republicans say the President's proposals would actually cut $192 billion from the amounts that would otherwise be spent, according to the projections of the Congressional Budget Office. The Republicans say their own Medicare proposals would save $270 billion.
President Clinton said he would keep monthly Medicare premiums lower than the Republicans had proposed. The monthly premium is now $46.10. Under Mr. Clinton's plan, it would drop to $42.50 in January, then rise gradually to $77 in 2002. By contrast, the Congressional Budget Office says that under the Republican plan, the premium would rise to $53.70 next year, then climb gradually to $88.90 in 2002.
In most years, the monthly premiums would be $8 to $11 higher under the Republican plan.
The idea of offering new insurance options to Medicare beneficiaries was a major part of the Republican plan. Administration officials said they had tried to strike a balance: they would open the program to more H.M.O.'s and other types of managed care, but they ruled out some Republican options on the ground that they could pose a threat to the standard Medicare program.
The Administration criticized the Republican proposal for medical savings accounts. Under this proposal, beneficiaries could use their share of Medicare money to set up tax-free savings accounts to pay routine medical bills, while purchasing a high-deductible, catastrophic insurance plans to pay the rest.
The Administration, like the Republicans, wants to establish a new method of paying H.M.O.'s that enroll Medicare patients. The documents said Congress should "limit the wide geographic fluctuations in H.M.O. payment rates.".
The White House proposed new restrictions on Medicare payments to hospitals, doctors, nursing homes and home health agencies. The cutbacks appear, in many cases, to be more modest than those proposed by the Republicans.
To exploit Medicare's power as a big purchaser of goods and services, the White House wants to establish a system of competitive bidding. In each geographic area, it said, the Government would buy medical equipment, CAT scans and magnetic resonance imaging services from companies that offered the best price and met Government standards for quality.

HEADLINE: Guatemala Journal;
Left's Hero Is Home (but Then, He's Long Dead)

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: GUATEMALA

 BODY:
He was an icon of the Latin American left and an early victim of the cold war. But more than 40 years after being ousted in a coup sponsored by the Central Intelligence Agency, and nearly a quarter of a century after he died in exile, Col. Jacobo Arbenz Guzman has finally come home.
"So that we may advance toward national reconciliation," as President Ramiro de Leon Carpio put it, Arbenz's remains were exhumed from a cemetery in El Salvador and returned to Guatemala and a hero's welcome on Oct. 20. 
 To shouts of "Welcome home!" and "Long live Arbenz!" thousands of people crowded into the streets and National Palace to catch a glimpse of his horse-drawn coffin.
Arbenz had been forced to leave Guatemala in humiliating circumstances in June 1954, stripped to his underwear at the airport by his enemies. The son of a Swiss immigrant pharmacist, Arbenz joined the army as a teen-ager and was elected President in 1950 on a platform of social reform, but was overthrown after trying to carry out a land redistribution program that alarmed the Eisenhower Administration and the powerful United Fruit Company.
For those reasons, the former President's tomb here, a simple white pyramid just to the right of the main entrance of the General Cemetery, has quickly become a magnet for Guatemalans who seek an alternative to the four decades of right-wing rule that have followed.
On a recent Sunday afternoon, the Davila family, four generations strong, was among those who came to pay their respects to the man popularly known as "the Soldier of the People."
"There has never been another like him, with such great ideals," Gerardo Davila, 93, told his great-granddaughter, Ana Lucia Bran, 8. "Since his fall, there has been no progress in this country, only stagnation."
Soon, the Davila family was joined by Matias Perez, 83, and his son and daughter-in-law. Had Arbenz been allowed to remain in power, Mr. Perez said somberly, Guatemala might have been spared its 35-year civil war, still unresolved, in which more than 100,000 people have been killed, mostly by the Guatemalan military.
"In Arbenz's time there were no guerrillas, because he loved the people and worked for them," he said.
Mr. Perez paused, and then began to sob. "I loved him very much," he said, wiping his eyes. "And I hate that other one over there," he added, gesticulating toward a large gray mausoleum about 50 yards away.
There, bunches of wilted flowers and a metal tablet mark the burial place of Col. Carlos Castillo Armas, who was recruited by the C.I.A. to overthrow the Arbenz Government and who ruled until he was assassinated in July 1957. "To the Liberator of Guatemala, Anti-Communist Martyr," the plaque reads.
Those who had a hand in bringing the remains of Arbenz back to Guatemala deny that his placement so close to Castillo Armas was a posthumous act of revenge. But Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso, the Arbenz family lawyer, acknowledged, "There is a certain irony in the fact that Arbenz is on the right when you enter and Castillo Armas on the left."
To the National Liberation Movement, the political party of Castillo Armas, Arbenz's mere presence in the cemetery is an affront. The return of the "cowardly" leader of a "bloodthirsty" Government can only "bring bad results and national discord," complained the right-wing group's longtime leader, Mario Sandoval Alarcon, who took part in the 1954 coup.
But nearly every other political force in Guatemala now seems to be rushing to stake a claim to the Arbenz legacy. Former President Vinicio Cerezo, a Christian Democrat, has just published a largely favorable assessment, and during the recent presidential election campaign the main slogan of the left-wing New Guatemala Democratic Front was a vow to resume the tasks that Arbenz left unfinished.
Somewhat surprisingly, the Guatemalan military has also made an effort to link itself to Arbenz. Gen. Marco Antonio Gonzalez, the Defense Minister, went to the military airport here to receive the remains, made a point of announcing that the former President had recovered his military rank and medals, and sent a cadet to speak at burial ceremonies.
"This is an army that is trying to reinvent itself because it has a terrible image problem and is going to have to find something new to do once peace comes," said a foreign official here. "Arbenz provides one of the few positive memories people have of the armed forces."
Even some of the children of wealthy landowners whose estates were confiscated by the Arbenz Government have found good things to say about their former foe. Business leaders have recently praised him for building a dam, a port and a highway to the Caribbean coast, projects that were intended to break the hold of the United Fruit Company over the Guatemalan economy and are now cited as models of modernization and "nationalist development."
Further efforts to rehabilitate the image of Arbenz are under way. Mr. Ortiz Moscoso intends to organize an Arbenz Foundation to "perpetuate his memory through a center of documentation," and intellectuals are calling for his restoration to the history books from which he has been largely stricken.
"Ours is a country that lacks leaders the people can believe in, that does not have a Washington, a Jefferson or a Lincoln," Mr. Ortiz Moscoso said. "I'm convinced the Arbenz phenomenon is in part an answer to this need to find heroes and symbols -- the deader the better, because then they do not disturb people."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: The Curtain Drops on a Career at Sony;
Trouble at American Entertainment Operations Prompts a Resignation

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
It may have been only a matter of time.
Michael P. Schulhof, the head of the Sony Corporation's American operations resigned under pressure yesterday, apparently unable to inspire confidence in Sony's Japanese management that he was doing enough to revive the company's businesses in the United States. 
 The resignation of Mr. Schulhof as president and chief executive of the Sony Corporation of America unit came almost exactly 12 months after Sony, which is based in Tokyo, took a $2.7 billion write-off to account for losses in its Hollywood film business. Since then, the film division has had only a mixed record and Sony's other major American entertainment holding, its music business, has lost market share. Meanwhile, some new ventures under Mr. Schulhof, including an electronic-publishing business, have suffered relatively large losses.
In the 1980's Sony was among the first foreign companies to make big acquisitions of American entertainment operations -- CBS Records for $2 billion in 1987 and Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion in 1989. And Sony has stayed the course longer than some of its compatriots.
But yesterday, Sony took the unusual step of replacing the head of its American business with Japanese executives who will run the company from Tokyo. Sony's chairman and chief executive, Norio Ohga, who played key roles in acquiring and initially overseeing the American entertainment properties, will add to his titles those of chairman for the Sony Music and Sony Pictures Entertainment units. And Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's president, will add the titles of vice chairman of Sony of America and chairman of its Sony Electronics unit.
"You can think of it a symbolic move," said Daniel Lucas, an analyst who follows Sony for Towa Securities in Tokyo. "The overseas subsidiary have been brought to heel because Sony is trying to become a leaner and meaner organization. When Idei first came in, he said the first thing he would do was take a good look around. I would imagine this is part of his push."
Sony gave no explanation yesterday for Mr. Schulhof's resignation. But several people close to the company said that the lackluster performance of the American operations in the last year, coupled with Mr. Schulhof's propensity for heavy corporate spending and his own extravagant standard of living, grated on executives in Tokyo, where an economic downturn has forced new measures of austerity on Japanese companies. Mr. Ohga and Mr. Schulhof have been colleagues for years, but Mr. Idei, who became Sony's president in April, is said to be highly critical of Mr. Schulhof's spending habits and informal management style.
Sony issued only a brief release, thanking Mr. Schulhof, who had been with the company for 21 years and was its highest-ranking American, for his contributions and saying only that he was leaving to "pursue new business interests." Mr. Schulhof also declined to comment.
Mr. Schulhof was a vice chairman of Sony's American operations when the company acquired the music business in 1987 and ascended in the corporate hierarchy as the Japanese company pursued a strategy of expanding in the American entertainment business.
Mr. Schulhof spearheaded Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures in 1989, a move that first raised the question of excessive corporate spending.
Some critics contended that the $3.4 billion Sony paid for the studio was too much -- a criticism that grew more intense after the company spent $200 million to acquire the film production company of Jon Peters and Peter Guber, paid more than $400 million to buy their contracts with Warner Brothers and then agreed to give them each a salary of $2.75 million to jointly run Columbia.
Mr. Schulhof became president and chief executive in 1993 and since then has operated the company's Madison Avenue headquarters as something resembling a pricey private club. He hired Barry Wines, the founder of the celebrated Quilted Giraffe restaurant in Manhattan, to oversee the headquarter's dining rooms, including a sushi bar that has an artificial stream running through it.
Mr. Schulhof also lives like an entertainment mogul, attracting attention earlier this year when he bought a multimillion-dollar estate in Southhampton, L.I., then decided not to live there and quickly put it on the market again.
Instead, he decided to remain in his existing home in Easthampton, L.I. -- but only after acquiring the house next to it, turning it into a guest house and screening room.
Personal extravagance would probably not have been an issue, industry executives said, if Mr. Schulhof had produced better results with Sony's businesses -- not only movies, but especially on video games, CD-ROM's and other multimedia efforts that several industry executives estimate have perhaps lost as much as $100 million in recent years.
 For many years Mr. Schulhof had the support of Sony's chairman and co-founder Akio Morita. He also had a patient superviser in Mr. Ohga, who as president under Mr. Morita played a more direct role in overseeing the American operation. But Mr. Morita, in poor health after a stroke, retired late last year.
Mr. Ohga subsequently assumed the chairman and chief executive titles and surprised nearly everyone in the electronics and entertainment industries in April by selecting Mr. Idei -- a managing director with experience primarily in advertising and corporate communications -- to become president. And Mr. Idei, analysts and executives said, has been much less patient with the lackluster performance and spendthrift image of the American business.
Some industry executives speculated yesterday that Sony had forced out Mr. Schulhof in a show of fiscal and management discipline intended to attract an entertainment-industry partner to invest in the American business. There was also conjecture that an American executive would soon be found to run the United States business. But several executives close to Sony denied that finding a partner or hiring a new manager were imminent moves.
"Mr. Idei's arrival," said an executive close to Sony, "has made a big difference at the company."


GRAPHIC: Michael P. Schulhof was vice chairman of the Sony Corporation's American operations in 1987, when the Japanese company embarked on an ambitious strategy of combining its strength in the consumer electronics business with American entertainment "software." Despite Sony's problems in successfully implementing that strategy, Mr. Schulhof rose to the top of Sony's entire United States operations -- until resigning under pressure yesterday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pesticide Kills Foreign Fruit Pickers' Hopes

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: NARANJAL, Ecuador

 BODY:
Half a lifetime ago, when Mario Brito Dumas was a young man with a bride and a peasant's head of modest dreams, he tended the lush banana plantations outside Naranjal. If he had any plan, it was the common one that keeps a man toiling through his best years: to make enough money to raise a family.
But a few years after his first son was born in 1972, Mr. Brito's plantation began using a pesticide both miraculous and terrible. It killed off a microscopic worm that would prevent the bananas' export to the United States, but it also killed pigs, frogs, birds and other creatures that drank water running from the field. 
 What Mr. Brito and the other men who worked with this powerful new chemical could not guess was that it was also destroying their chances to have children.
In 1977 the chemical, dibromo chloropropane, or DBCP, was found to cause sterility in men working at an Occidental Petroleum plant in Lathrop, Calif., prompting an immediate ban on its use in California, and sharply restricting its use elsewhere in the continental United States.
But American-based food growers continued to use the fumigant in countries without the United States standard of environmental, legal and occupational protections. And now, emerging from the anger, the ruined marriages and childless houses across the globe, some 25,000 workers from 12 developing countries are suing manufacturers and fruit growers.
 
No U.S. Law Prohibited Export of the Chemicals
Contending that they were exposed to a known hazard without any warning that the pesticide could cause sterility and possibly birth defects and cancer, the workers are suing Dow Chemical, Shell Oil -- a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell -- and Occidental Petroleum, along with Del Monte Fruit, Chiquita Brands and Dole Food.
"Even though they knew the risk of the product -- they didn't use it in their own country," Mr. Brito said, "but they used it here in the third world, despite the damage to humans and animals. The ones who produced this chemical bear absolute responsibility for this disaster."
The manufacturers deny that they sent the pesticide overseas after 1979. They also point out that they followed all United States laws governing the labeling, sale and use of DBCP, rated a probable human carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency.
And that is perhaps the most unbearable element of all for people here, for no American law prohibits exporting chemicals that are banned from use in the United States.
Charles S. Siegel, a lawyer who represents more than 20,000 workers, said that exports of DBCP to Africa and Ecuador continued at least until 1981, two years after the E.P.A. banned its use in the continental United States, and to the Philippines until 1986, he said.
"They sent the product to Latin American countries as if they were a toxic dump, without regard for the health of the people living in them," said Guillermo Touma, an Ecuadorean who organizes farmworkers.
When the forerunner of DBCP was developed in the 1940's, it was hailed as a solution to the pests that were killing many American crops. The Andrews Sisters sang a ditty to the breakthrough pesticide called the "D-D Hop" on rural radio stations.
Scientists at Shell and Dow, which developed DBCP independently, sent the relevant research data to Washington, but suggested in discussions and memos with Federal officials that the effects the chemical produced in laboratory animals -- elevated levels of cancer and shriveling testicles -- would probably not be repeated in humans.
 
Agriculture Department Abandoned Misgivings
The Agriculture Department, which was responsible for registration and labeling at the time, abandoned its misgivings over the new product after the companies provided data that showed no damage to plant employees.
It was not until 1977 that the links between DBCP and sterility prompted restrictions on the chemical's use in the United States. But the makers of DBCP had stocks of the product on hand, and growers still considered it an important tool in the arsenal of pesticides, fungicides and fumigants that produce the unblemished fruits American consumers prefer.
According to documents obtained by lawyers for the banana workers, Standard Fruit told Dow Chemical that halting shipments of DBCP would be considered a breach of contract, and in early 1979 it agreed to indemnify the chemical manufacturer for any damages it would face for selling its stocks to Standard Fruit.
Patrick Nielson, a lawyer for Dole Food, said the food grower had received assurances from Dow that because they were working outdoors, agricultural workers would not face the same risk of sterility as the employees of Occidental, which had begun manufacturing DBCP under license. The indemnity agreement, he said, was demanded by Dow as a condition for providing the DBCP, and Mr. Nielson said that Dole stopped using DBCP in plantations it owned once the E.P.A. banned its use in 1979.
Officials at Dow say the company knew the fruit growers would be using DBCP in Latin America, and printed labels in Spanish that advised using protective gear and warned of the danger of sterility.
"There was a specific understanding between Dow and the customer that the product would be used within these safe handling guidelines," said Gennaro A. Filice, a lawyer representing Dow.
Burt Ballanfant, an attorney for Shell, said the company had stopped selling DBCP to any of the growers or countries named in the litigation well before the 1977 ban, though lawyers for the banana workers have shipping orders showing Shell subsidiaries delivering the product to third-world countries through 1981.
Shell also cited two recently published studies that showed no significantly elevated levels of cancer in workers exposed to DBCP, but other scientists said the research was seriously flawed because one study included employees exposed to many different chemicals, along with those who had worked in administration and other divisions that had no exposure to DBCP, while the other study used only a small sample of workers.
Executives at Del Monte and Chiquita did not answer repeated requests for comment.
 
Protective Gear Was Often Not Used
David Weir and Mark Schapiro, who examined the export of pesticides barred for use in the United States in their 1981 book, "Circle of Poison," said that after the United States ban, DBCP shipments grew more difficult to follow.
When large chemical corporations stopped exporting the fumigant after the 1979 ban, smaller manufacturers stepped in, paying royalties for every shipment sold.
Many growers, similarly, stopped buying the pesticides directly, but continued imposing the use of DBCP on banana plantations where they bought crops from local farmers.
In Hawaii, where DBCP continued legally to be used on pineapples until 1985, the E.P.A. required ample protective gear to prevent the chemical from seeping into the skin or respiratory systems of laborers. But in the plantations where Mr. Brito and others worked, the banana leaves make a thick canopy that traps vapors in the air that workers breathe, and the protective gear and other precautions that American employees use were rarely used here.
Some of the men said they wore only shorts and shoes to work in the searing heat, and many complained of headaches and trouble sleeping when they worked with the product.
"We were thirsty, sweating, our eyes were red and we felt like we had the flu," said Mr. Brito, who said that from 1975 to 1980, he filled enormous injectors with DBCP each day and pumped it into the root systems of banana plants. "Everything I ate tasted bitter, and gave me stomach aches."
On a recent visit to one of the countless banana plantations near Naranjal, there was no sign of basic occupational safety or labor standards. Children worked picking the shriveled black flowers from the bottom of each banana, while shirtless workers carried pesticides in backpack-style sprayers.
A small mountain of rejected fruit grew steadily -- bananas either blemished or too wide, too long or too small for American consumers.
Alejandro M. Garro, a professor of Latin American law at Columbia University who testified on behalf of the banana workers, said that allowing developing countries to import chemicals that are known health hazards presumes that foreign governments have the desire and the mechanisms to protect their citizens.
Barring that, he said, it assumes a court system where people who are damaged by harmful substances can seek redress.
"Without courts that function well, you cannot have a free-market economy functioning well, and this is a clear case where this is reflected," Mr. Garro said. "You will have the big fish eating the small fish, without any kind of fairness or justice being implemented."
While the lawyers representing the workers say they will not abandon their suits, the obstacles to pursuing them will be formidable. Many third-world countries have no laws allowing lawyers to represent clients in exchange for a share of any eventual award -- the usual system for such cases in the United States -- and the courts have little experience dealing with the liability issues the DBCP cases raise.
 
A Victim Trusts God and U.S. Courts
Mr. Brito, now 50 and out of the fields, works renting out a pickup truck he bought a few years ago. He does not hold much hope for redress in Ecuador, partly because of the corruption that seems to permeate every level of government, and partly because multinational companies are so important to the small country's economy.
"Here, you can't believe in our justice system," he said, asserting that judges could be paid off to decide the case in the company's favor.
With his lawsuit ahead of him, Mr. Brito is hoping that some day the companies he blames for erasing the family he could have had will answer for what happened.
"We'll have to trust in God, and in the courts of the United States," he said.
The son born before he began working with DBCP is now 23 and in his fifth year of studying marine biology. Across the generation, Mario Brito can see progress, but he said he still wonders, sometimes, if it had to cost so much.

HEADLINE: With One Disease Nearly Erased, Assault Is Planned on Another

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Armed with a new confidence that it is possible to wipe out diseases that have plagued humans for centuries, international health and development officials announced today a final assault on one debilitating tropical malady, river blindness, even as they celebrated the imminent demise of another, Guinea worm disease.
United Nations health organizations, the World Bank and private groups announced a 12-year international program to control and eventually wipe out river blindness in Africa, an effort they said should save millions from the blindness and disfigurement of the disease formally known as onchocerciasis. 
 The new program is modeled on the highly successful Onchocerciasis Control Program that since 1974 has largely eliminated river blindness as a major health problem in an 11-country region of West Africa. Under the initiative, community treatment programs will be established in parts of 16 nations not included in the original program, officials said.
James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, said several countries and organizations had pledged $20 million of the $124 million needed for the river blindness program.
Former President Jimmy Carter, whose Carter Center in Atlanta is coordinating the effort, said the United States, which is cutting back on foreign aid, refused to contribute.
The new attack on river blindness follows an announcement on Monday that Guinea worm disease, another parasitic condition, should be entirely eliminated within a year.
Guinea worm disease occurs when people drink water containing tiny water fleas that have ingested microscopic Guinea worm larvae. The larvae mate in the intestine and the females move to the outer parts of the body. A year after infestation, mature worms up to three feet long emerge through painful blisters, sometimes causing muscle damage and crippling similar to polio.
Guinea worm disease has been controlled by use of a chemical that purifies contaminated water and by educating infected people not to wade in sources of drinking water.
The Guinea worm has been eliminated in the Indian subcontinent and most of Africa, with remaining cases in Nigeria, Niger and the Sudan.
River blindness is caused by a parasitic worm that is spread by the bites of tiny black flies that breed in fast-moving river water. Larvae produced by adult worms migrate in the skin of humans, causing lesions and blindness when they reach the eyes.
This disease is fought by spraying to kill the flies and treating victims with the drug ivermectin, which kills newly hatched worms with an annual dose. Merck & Company of Rahway, N.J., which developed the drug, has donated it to eradication programs, a contribution Mr. Carter said was worth $250 million over 12 years.

HEADLINE: Man Found Guilty of Raping His Wife

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
Every year, the Manhattan District Attorney's office brings a few dozen cases against men accused of raping their wives. In all but a few cases, the men are not convicted, often because the woman decides not to pursue the case.
But on Monday, one of the cases prevailed, in part because the woman was upset that her husband never expressed any remorse over the attack. 
 The man, Jose Santos, a 37-year-old resident of Washington Heights, was convicted of first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, first-degree sexual abuse and second-degree assault in the May 9 attack, which prosecutors said was so violent that his wife's ankle was broken.
Linda Fairstein, chief of the Manhattan District Attorney's sex crimes unit, said many of the marital rape cases her office handles never go to trial.
"We lose the victims before the trial," Ms. Fairstein said. "The victims withdraw, choose not to prosecute, some because of fear of reprisal, some because of the psychological feelings involved."
Ms. Fairstein, the author of the book "Sexual Violence: Our War Against Rape" (William Morrow & Company, 1993), said that a wife who has been sexually abused or battered approaches the criminal justice system "with a lot of ambivalence," partly because of "societal attitudes."
"I think the perception has been nationally as a result of the Simpson case that these cases don't do well in the system," Ms. Fairstein said, referring to domestic violence cases in general.
She said the victim of a marital rape may have a love-hate relationship with her spouse and still hopes to resume the relationship. Also, she may not want to see the father of her children go to jail, or is fearful of financial hardship if the wage-earner receives a prison sentence.
In this week's case, the victim, a 35-year-old home-care attendant, saw the prosecution through to the end because her husband denied he had done anything wrong and never showed remorse, said Martha Bashford, the prosecutor handling the case.
"I think she got very indignant at that," Ms. Bashford said.
Since the woman was a rape victim, her name was omitted from the court record. The victim has a different last name than her husband.
Mr. Santos, an unemployed guitar teacher, testified that his wife slipped and broke her ankle as she attacked him with a kitchen knife. He said that he delayed calling an ambulance for three hours, even though she claimed to be intense pain, because she was getting dressed and putting on her makeup.
"You know how women are," he said on the stand.
The victim testified that she and Mr. Santos had been married about a year when they became estranged and he moved out. Several days later, after her two young children by another man had left for school, her husband showed up at her door and began choking and pushing her. She fell, her leg folded awkwardly under her, and her ankle broke.
According to her testimony, Mr. Santos grabbed a kitchen knife and began yelling that it was too late for both of them and they both were going to die. He began to rip her clothes off, she said, but when she screamed in pain he ordered her to take them off. Then he sexually abused her. Throughout the ordeal, he was drinking alcohol and talking incoherently about their relationship.
At one point, Mr. Santos tried to stab her but she moved aside and the knife pierced the mattress. Then he broke down and asked her forgiveness. She finally convinced him to call an ambulance about 11:30 A.M., about three hours after she broke her ankle.
At Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, the victim called a friend who worked for the Department of Correction. When the friend arrived, she got Mr. Santos to leave his wife's side and got a hospital social worker to interview the victim, prosecutors said.
"If he had been willing to admit what he had done and expressed remorse, she would have had a different view" about prosecuting, Ms. Bashford said. "But he kept saying it was her fault."
Mr. Santos faces a minimum of 4 1/2 to 9 years and a maximum of 12 1/2 to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced by Justice Franklyn R. Weissberg of State Supreme Court on Dec. 20.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Stay Above 6% on Yield

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday for the first time in five sessions, as yields again tested the 6 percent level but failed to stay below it.
"The market's failure to crack 6 percent was a signal to take profits." said Tony Crescenzi, director of fixed-income trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company, a New York brokerage firm. 
 To crack 6 percent may require more signs of softness in the economy and a cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, traders said. Once that happens, perhaps in a few weeks, the rally will resume, they predicted. In the meantime, yields could remain at these levels, which represent two-year lows.
The 30-year bond fell yesterday by 7/32, to a price of 111 16/32 to yield 6.04 percent, up from 6.02 percent on Monday. The yield was below 6 percent briefly for the second consecutive day but bounced back.
Mr. Crescenzi said that breaking 6 percent and staying there was proving to be a challenge.
He said that not even a weak report on retail sales by Johnson Redbook, which saw a 1.6 percent decline in the works for December from November, was enough to stop the selling. Normally, market participants buy on signs of economic weakness, on the hope for lower interest rates.
"The market needs to see some validation of its current price levels through a rate cut by the Fed and also see the potential for a budget deficit agreement," Mr. Crescenzi said. "Currently the market is a little ahead of itself," he said, with favorable news already priced into the market.
"But that's O.K. when the Fed is lowering rates," he said.
The March 30-year bond contract in futures trading climbed as high as 120 29/32 before sliding back to 120 11/32 at the close when people reversed bets that the rally would continue without interruption. Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson Research of Boston, said there was a possibility that the contract price could fall some more.
Some traders attributed part of yesterday's slide in prices to profits taken before today's release of the Fed's beige book survey of business conditions by region. Traders hope the report will shed light on the central bank's posture ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Dec. 19, when the Fed could lower rates.
However, this week's most important report remains the November employment data scheduled for Friday. According to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg Business News, the data will probably show that the economy added 178,000 nonfarm jobs.
In the municipal market, the good news for investors is that the forward calendar of new issues coming to market, measured by the Bond Buyer's 30-day visible supply, recently hit a 1995 high on Nov. 13 of more than $6.4 billion. "In other words," said Michael S. Appelbaum, a senior vice president at Paine Webber, "investors will have a wider selection of new issues to choose from over the next month than at any point this year."
Mr. Appelbaum said that this big supply of new issues was coming at an opportune time for investors, since municipal redemptions, including interest rate payments, during the combined months of November and December were expected to reach $51.6 billion.
Yesterday, in the week's largest sale, the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority sold $404.56 million in revenue bonds through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Good investor demand allowed the issue to be repriced and restructured, with the yield on a number of maturities lowered as much as 5 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Serial bonds with shorter maturities are priced to yield from 4.40 percent in 1998 to 5.30 percent in 2009. Bonds due in 2012 were priced to yield 5.40 percent and those in 2013, 5.45 percent. A 2015 maturity offers a yield of 5.48 percent, while the longest maturity in 2019 yields 5.52 percent.
The issue is rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard & Poor's, with the exception of about a half-dozen maturities that are insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation and rated triple-A.

HEADLINE: Shift Is Sought In Financing For Hospitals

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
A task force appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday recommended sweeping changes in the way health care is financed in New York State, proposing that the state stop setting the rates that insurers pay hospitals to care for their patients.
The proposal follows a growing trend across the country, as states that had once sought to contain the growth of health-care costs by setting prices have decided to let market forces perform that role. 
 For 25 years, the state has determined -- hospital by hospital and procedure by procedure -- how much insurers should pay for patient care. The formula was based on the actual cost of providing care at each hospital and a comparison with the costs of such care at similar hospitals.
The state has also imposed a surcharge on insurance companies to help hospitals pay for the costs of caring for poor people, a process the task force recommends continuing.
The task force proposed yesterday that hospitals and insurance companies negotiate individually to set rates, saying that such a system would provide economic incentives to contain costs. The State Health Department provided a six-page outline of the group's report, saying the full proposal would be available tomorrow.
Dr. Barbara A. DeBuono, the State Health Commissioner and the chairwoman of the task force, said that such a fundamental overhaul presented a risk to certain hospitals, but she said that the move was necessary to make the health care system more efficient.
"We are now at a point where we need to move on and forward," Dr. DeBuono said.
But health care providers and analysts of the health care industry said they worried that teaching hospitals and hospitals that serve large numbers of uninsured patients would struggle to stay afloat if the transition to the new system were too swift.
"Reforming the system isn't wrong," said Raymond Sweeney, executive vice president of the Health Care Association of New York State, a trade organization representing hospitals. "But in a negotiated rate system, inevitably institutions will be forced out of business, and the ones most at risk are the ones serving populations most at risk."
In addition to the task force recommendations, New York hospitals face proposals in Congress that would significantly reduce the Federal subsidies they get for training doctors and providing care to the impoverished and uninsured.
Under the task force's proposal, the state would continue to provide about $675 million annually in subsidies for graduate medical education, although the money would be gradually diminished over time.
That money would go primarily for the salaries of hospital residents and would be focused on training programs that emphasized primary, outpatient care and those that successfully retained their graduates to work in the state. Now, about half the nearly 15,000 residents who train each year in New York leave the state after their training is completed.
The task force recommended that the state help reduce doctor training costs by cutting the number of residency programs in the state by 30 percent over the next three years. It also said the state should no longer guarantee the indirect costs of training doctors. The state now helps hospitals cover these costs -- like extra lab tests ordered and the supervision of doctors in training -- by setting rates for insurers that take such expenses into account.
Instead, hospitals would have to negotiate those costs -- which last year totaled about $1 billion -- as part of the deals they make with insurers.
Hospital industry officials questioned whether, in an unfettered system, insurers would agree to higher rates to cover medical training expenses.
"Payers looking to reduce their premiums are not easily going to negotiate so that they cover collectively $1 billion in graduate medical education costs," said Kenneth E. Raske, executive director of the Greater New York Hospital Association, an industry group. "This will be like an avalanche overnight. There will be major dislocation."
The task force said that the state would continue to subsidize charity care for the poor and uninsured, but that it would shift its emphasis from compensating hospitals that care for large numbers of such patients to increasing opportunities for the uninsured to get insurance.
Among the programs that would be expanded is Child Health Plus, which subsidizes low-cost insurance for the children of the working poor, and the Employer Incentive Program, which helps small businesses insure their employees.
"Coverage is what's going to get people to see doctors," Dr. DeBuono said, adding that access to preventive care would "ultimately keep them out of the hospital" and reduce health care costs.
The money for such so-called uncompensated care would come from some kind of tax or surcharge to payers, but the task force did not determine the mechanisms for setting and collecting the money.
Money from such a pool -- which the task force estimated at $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion annually -- would also be used to help financially unstable hospitals make the transition to the new market-based system.
The state first began to experiment with the limiting of rate regulation eight years ago, when the Legislature voted to allow health maintenance organizations and other managed care companies to negotiate their rates with hospitals. That move was done to encourage the growth of managed care in the state, which was still at very low levels.
Recent studies have shown that managed care has made significant gains in the state in recent years, with about 25 percent of New Yorkers now covered through such programs.
The task force said that for now, the state should continue to set the rates for Medicaid patients who are not enrolled in managed care programs. But it has recommended that the State Health Department also be allowed to negotiate rates for Medicaid recipients receiving care through the traditional "fee for service" program.

HEADLINE: Charles Gillett, 80, the Creator Of the 'Big Apple' Ad Campaign

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
Charles Gillett, who was credited with creating the Big Apple tourism campaign when he was president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, died on Monday at his home in Great Neck, L.I. He was 80 and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla.
The cause was a heart attack, the bureau said. 
 Mr. Gillett worked for the bureau for more than 40 years and was its president from 1964 until he retired in 1988. He helped to plan such tourist events as the 100th anniversaries of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty, and the bicentennial visit of tall ships in 1976.
He was also involved in negotiations to bring the Democratic National Convention to Madison Square Garden in 1976, the first national political convention held in New York since 1924.
But perhaps his greatest success came with turning the term "Big Apple" into a tourist draw. A jazz fan, he remembered that musicians in the 1920's and 30's had an expression for playing the big time after gigs in one-horse towns: "There are many apples on the tree, but when you pick New York City, you pick the Big Apple." Damon Runyon had popularized the term in the 1920's.
By the early 1970's, New York City was facing a fiscal crisis and nightclub comedians and television talk-show hosts were getting big laughs from jokes about New York. Mr. Gillett started handing out Big Apple lapel stickers.
Soon Tom Snyder, who was a news anchor on WNBC-TV at the time, was wearing one on the air, and the comedian Alan King and the New York Knicks star Dave DeBusschere were passing out the little red pins.
Mr. Gillett's duties as head of the not-for-profit bureau went well beyond cheerleading. He was, in effect, the city's chief salesman for tourism, fighting for conventions and the hotel and restaurant revenues they generate. Sometimes the negotiations for conventions also generated headlines, as when the American Medical Association agreed to return to New York in 1976.
In making his case to the A.M.A., Mr. Gillett had consulted the bureau's files, which showed, convention sponsor by convention sponsor, who made the decisions about where conventions were held, what those people thought about New York and what problems may have kept them out of New York in the past.
When he retired, he received the first New York State Governor's Award. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo cited Mr. Gillett's "long and distinguished service in promoting New York as the premier travel destination in the world" and for moving the bureau into the front ranks of local travel promotion agencies.
He was a former chairman of the Travel Industry Association of America, a past president of the International Association of Convention and Visitors Bureaus and served on the advisory board of the United States Travel and Tourism Administration. He was elected to the American Society of Travel Agents' Hall of Fame, and was a delegate to the 1995 White House Conference on Travel and Tourism.
Mr. Gillett graduated in 1937 from the University of Cincinnati, which in the 1980's gave him its Award for Excellence for developing tourism as a social and economic force. He served as a captain with the Ninth Armored Division in World War II and was awarded the Bronze Star.
He is survived by his wife, Virginia; one daughter, Valerie, of Manhattan; two sons, David, of Mendocino, Calif., and Peter, of Felton, Calif., and one granddaughter.

HEADLINE: School-Lunch Discord Stalls the Welfare Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Republicans today stepped up the pressure on President Clinton to sign their welfare bill but acknowledged that the legislation was now delayed by a bitter dispute among Republicans themselves over the future of the national school lunch program.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said last month that Mr. Clinton would veto the legislation, in part because the President believed that it would cut too much from projected spending on social welfare programs. 
 But today Republicans said the latest version of their bill addressed many of the Administration's concerns. And they said that by vetoing the bill, Mr. Clinton would be killing tough new provisions that would force delinquent parents to meet their child-support obligations.
The House passed its version of the welfare bill in March, the Senate passed a very different version in September, and Republican negotiators from the two chambers announced agreement on a compromise on Nov. 14.
But because of the dispute over the school lunch program, they have still not filed a conference report with the text of their agreement. As a result, neither house has taken final action on the bill.
The House's chief negotiator on the school lunch issue, Representative Bill Goodling, a Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, insists that states be free to design and run their own school lunch programs with fixed amounts of Federal money known as block grants. Under that approach, he said, states would have "substantially greater flexibility" in spending money for child nutrition. Mr. Goodling said Senate staff members had told him that Senate negotiators were amenable to this proposal.
But the chief Senate negotiator on school lunches, Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, and Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, firmly oppose the idea of such block grants. They want to keep the school lunch program as an entitlement, under which Federal subsidies would grow automatically with the number of eligible children.
"We should retain a safety net for child nutrition programs," Mr. Lugar said. "We have not repealed the business cycle. When another recession occurs, states that choose block grants will have serious problems meeting a rising caseload."
Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, said he hoped the dispute would be resolved so that the full House could vote on the legislation, including the tough new provisions on parental child support, by Dec. 15.
But Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, said: "It's not necessary to destroy the social safety net and the entitlement to welfare benefits for poor people in order to improve child-support enforcement. We could pass a separate child-support bill tomorrow."
The Department of Health and Human Services said today that states collected $9.9 billion of child support from delinquent parents in the 1994 fiscal year, a significant increase from $8.9 billion in 1993 and $8 billion in 1992. But that 1994 figure, the department estimates, was less than a third of the amount owed in child support that year.
Under the welfare bill, the Federal Government would establish a nationwide system to match child-support orders issued by the courts or state agencies with employer records showing the locations of all people hired after Oct. 1, 1997. Using such information, a state where a mother and her child live could send to the father's employer an order requiring that employer to deduct child-support payments from his wages.
The bill would also require the states to adopt uniform laws to simplify the handling of child-support cases when mother and father live in different states. States would also have to set up a procedure to suspend or restrict drivers' licenses and professional licenses of parents who refuse to pay child support.

HEADLINE: Making the System Work In Kidney Patients' Favor

SERIES: MISMANAGED CARE: The Perils of Dialysis -- Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
Each time patients receive kidney dialysis at Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles, they see something rarely found in most American dialysis clinics: a doctor.
At other clinics, part-time doctors drop by for a few hours a week, leaving treatment largely in the hands of poorly supervised technicians and low-level nurses. But Kaiser's dialysis unit in Los Angeles is staffed full time by at least two of its six kidney specialists, as well as by registered nurses, dietitians and social workers. 
 And unlike those kidney specialists elsewhere who often have a stake in the profits of dialysis, the Kaiser doctors cannot enrich themselves by cutting back on the amount of money spent on patient care. Instead, most are paid a salary of about $150,000 a year, far less than they might make under the profit-sharing or similar deals struck with the part-time doctors at other clinics.
"Here, you're not driven by how much money you can get from the patient," said Dr. Hock Yeoh, the medical director for the Kaiser unit. "You just do what is best for them."
Kaiser's Los Angeles clinic stands out as but one example of how dialysis could be done better in the United States, a country with an annual mortality rate for dialysis patients that is twice that of Japan and some European nations. With the American annual mortality rate above 23 percent, more than 40,000 of this country's 187,000 dialysis patients will be dead next year.
An investigation by The New York Times of the kidney dialysis business and its leading company, National Medical Care Inc., found an industry that has used equipment and procedures to cut costs and bolster profits often at the expense of patient health. National Medical Care denies that patient care is suffering and says it is committed to quality care.
Among the biggest problems identified by kidney patients, medical experts and Government officials are that patients are kept on the machines for too short a time, that equipment that some experts think should be disposed of is re-used, that companies at times fail to replace outdated machines, and that the duties of doctors and registered nurses have been shifted to employees with less training.
The industry also operates with few standards to assure quality care. And because many dialysis companies compensate their kidney specialists only by paying them a share of any profits, the doctors face a conflict between their own financial interests and providing the best care for their patients.
Some industry executives argue that such payment systems are necessary to hire the best doctors and improve quality. National Medical, which pioneered such profit-sharing arrangements, revised its payment system earlier this year, and now pays its doctors a fee. But that fee is based in part on the doctors' ability to hold down costs, thus creating the same potential conflict of interest.
Kaiser's clinic plays by different rules, with very different results. According to Government statistics, Kaiser patients are hospitalized for less than a third as many days annually as the average dialysis patient in this country. Compared with the average, patients at Kaiser are close to twice as likely to work or attend school full time -- a fact that has won the clinic awards from medical groups.
And, even though Kaiser treats a larger-than-average number of diabetics -- a group with a higher death rate among dialysis patients -- its annual mortality rate is 16 percent, almost a third below the national average for all patients. Indeed, if its percentage of diabetics was in line with the average in this country or overseas, Kaiser's death rates would probably be comparable to the best of rates in foreign countries, medical experts said.
Kaiser's unit departs from most American dialysis clinics in more than just the way it staffs its clinics and pays its doctors. Kaiser patients receive treatments longer than the national average -- and are given extra treatments if needed. Kaiser will not re-use blood lines, as National Medical and others do. In light of some reports of adverse reactions to the first use of new devices, it allows patients to choose whether to be treated with a new plastic kidney, known as a dialyzer, or with a used one that has been cleaned. And it uses some of the newest dialysis machines available, replacing them about every five years.
 
A Possible Model
Tying Payments To Overall Health
Some medical experts say programs like Kaiser's should be a model for efforts to improve the quality of dialysis care in the United States. The key, they say, is that unlike many of the companies providing dialysis, Kaiser has a financial stake in keeping dialysis patients from developing illnesses that lead to hospitalization. That is because Kaiser, as a health maintenance organization, is responsible for all of the medical bills of its members. So Kaiser spends more on care for its dialysis patients, recognizing that in the long run it will save money.
By contrast, companies like National Medical Care do not pay the bill if their dialysis patients end up in the hospital; Medicare and private insurers bear the cost of hospitalization, which accounts for about half the total cost of care for dialysis patients. So the dialysis companies, which are paid a fixed amount by the Government for each treatment and are allowed to keep every penny they do not spend on care, stand to profit if they cut costs, even if patient health suffers.
"The incentives are in the opposite direction from quality care," said Dr. Ramon Hannah, the doctor in charge of dialysis and transplants at Kaiser. "There is no incentive to do the best you can possibly do. All the incentives are doing what you can make the most money off of."
Take the re-use of dialysis equipment that some experts say should best be used only once. That may save money for National Medical Care, but it raises the bill for the taxpayer, experts said.
"The real cost of maintaining a dialysis patient on re-use is higher than it appears, because of the increased number of hospitalizations" that can result when patients get fevers or other side effects linked to re-used equipment, said Dr. Stanley Shaldon, a kidney expert who pioneered the concept of re-use but who now opposes the procedure. "But the providers are not bearing that cost."
To change the financial incentives, some medical experts support creation of a system in which companies that keep their patients healthy would make the most money.
Under such a system, the Government would pay a set amount each year to cover all the medical costs of a dialysis patient. It would cover everything from a patient's dialysis treatment to checkups to hospitalizations. Whatever was not spent, the companies could keep as profit. Providers would then have an incentive to improve their dialysis treatment, to lower their overall costs.
With this approach, known in the medical industry as capitation, or risk-sharing, the dialysis providers would in essence become health maintenance organizations, or would have to team up with an H.M.O.
Some experts suggest that such a system would lead the industry to focus on ways to improve care that have largely been ignored in the industry. "The H.M.O. structure is what should be done," said Dr. John De Palma, chief executive of Hemodialysis Inc., a dialysis provider. "It would lead to patients being instructed on diet and blood pressure. That hasn't happened in 20 years. Instead, the industry just slaps everybody on dialysis and screams about only getting enough money to earn a 25 percent return per year."
As with any health maintenance organization, there is still the danger that patients will be shortchanged in an effort to cut costs. In kidney care, a potential such problem could come from dialysis providers' being reluctant to hospitalize patients who need it. So the industry, possibly with Government involvement, would have to establish comprehensive standards of care that would be reviewed and enforced by the existing Federal system.
The effects of this kind of system are apparent at Kaiser in Southern California. To a degree, Kaiser, with its financial power and millions of members, can be seen as a proxy for the Government in terms of the effects it could have on pushing the dialysis industry toward quality.
In addition to running its own Los Angeles clinic, which treats about 160 people, Kaiser sends almost 1,900 other patients with kidney failure to other dialysis providers in Southern California. And in recent months Kaiser has declared that it will no longer stand for business as usual in the dialysis business.
In June Kaiser announced what dialysis providers said was the first comprehensive effort to establish broad-based standards to measure the quality of care. Those standards, which every dialysis company contracting with Kaiser would have to meet, are based on 450 objective indicators, from blood-pressure level to the amount of urea in patient's blood. The standards are by far the strictest in the industry, providers said. No comprehensive standards have been set by the Government.
While this program has been advanced by Kaiser in Southern California, it has not yet been adopted by its divisions elsewhere.
Dr. Hannah of Kaiser's Southern California division said that a number of university kidney specialists had reacted to the proposed standards with dismay, saying that they were impossible to meet. But at the same time, a number of doctors from dialysis companies have told him they will meet the standards, if Kaiser gives them a contract to serve its patients.
Such a system would almost surely affect the quality of the training and supervision of the dialysis staff, as well as lead to improved education about dialysis for kidney specialists, changes that are sorely needed in the industry, experts said.
 
The American Way
System Promotes Cutting Corners
Of course, increasing the amount the Government pays for dialysis treatments would also have a big effect, experts agree. The United States spends significantly less for each dialysis treatment than do other industrialized nations. Since the early 1970's, the Government, through the Medicare program, has paid 80 percent of a maximum cost it sets for the care of dialysis patients of all ages. But the amount the Government agrees to pay has fallen by more than 70 percent since 1973 (after adjusting for inflation), increasing the incentive to provide treatment as quickly and as cheaply as possible.
Given the budget-cutting pressure in Washington and the profits made by the dialysis industry at the current reimbursement rate, a rate increase is unlikely. But, even without the large-scale change represented by risk-sharing, medical experts say that improvements in quality can still be accomplished by manipulating reimbursement.
For example, by setting a maximum amount -- about $126 -- that it will pay for each treatment, the Government compensation system has created financial incentives to make each dialysis treatment as short as possible, despite growing evidence that longer treatments make patients healthier. Experts said dialysis clinics should be paid at least partly according to how much time each treatment lasts. Japan, which has the lowest mortality rate for dialysis patients in the industrialized world, already does that.
"The Japanese system of reimbursement is what we should be using in this country," said Allan R. Hull, a kidney specialist in Dallas who is the president of the National Kidney Foundation. "That provides the incentives to do what is right for the patient."
There is no better proof of the effect of changing Government reimbursement policies than the dialysis industry's experience with a drug called Epogen, better known as EPO. The medication, a genetically engineered hormone developed in 1989 by Amgen Inc., stimulates the production of red blood cells, helping to alleviate the anemia frequently found in dialysis patients.
When the drug first became available in August 1989, the Government paid a fixed amount for each EPO injection. At National Medical, as well as in the rest of the industry, doctors began using the drug, and saw sharp increases in the levelof red blood cells in patients. Despite the improvement, doctors did not try increasing the dosage given at each dialysis treatment.
Then, in December 1990, the Government changed the compensation policy for EPO, and began reimbursing dialysis clinics based on the amount of EPO they used, instead of the number of injections. Overnight, EPO usage jumped. As of early this year, the amount of EPO used in each treatment had more than doubled, and the patients' levels of red blood cells had significantly risen, albeit at a higher cost.
No one's medical judgment had changed. The doctors were simply reacting to financial incentive. Indeed, some critics contend that doctors may well be overusing EPO now, to make up for the low compensation rate paid for the rest of the dialysis treatment.
Among other changes being advocated, some patients say that dialysis clinics should be consistently required to routinely disclose their annual mortality rates, average days of hospitalization, and other statistical data so that patients can better decide where to go in communities that have competing clinics.
Experts agree that changes in the American system of dialysis are essential. They say that after almost a quarter of a century of Government influence over treatment, the mortality rates and poor health of patients demonstrate a need for an overhaul that will allow this life-saving treatment to finally meet its promise.
"Clearly, there has to be a better way and we have to try to find it," said Perry Ecksel, president of the National Kidney Patients Association, a group organized to improve the quality of care for dialysis patients. "After all, we're talking about people's lives."
 
Questions to Ask
Here are some questions that kid ney patients can ask to compare the quality of care at dialysis clinics:
 What is this clinic's annual standard mortality rate? How does it compare with regional and national averages?
 What is either the clinic's aver age kt/v or its average urea reduc tion ratio, as measured in its pa tients' blood? Those two ratios guage the amount of waste that has been removed from the blood by a dialysis treatment, and are indicators of quality of care. Kidney experts say that a kt/v number should be at least 1.2 and a urea reduction ratio should be at least 60 percent.
 What is the average length of each dialysis treatment? Longer is bet ter, studies show. The American average is about 10 hours a week.
 Does the clinic have full-time doctors? And is the doctors' pay unrelated to the clinic profits?
 What is the ratio of registered nurses to patients? Does the clinic provide dietitians and patient education?
 Does the clinic re-use blood lines? Can patients refuse re-used of dialyzers?
 
More information about dialysis and living with kidney disease is available from the National Kidney Foundation, (800) 622-9010, or the American Association of Kidney Patients, (800) 749-2257.

Graphs: "A Balance of Money and Science"
 The dialysis industry's experience with a drug known as EPO shows how medicine is influenced by the bottom line. After the drug's introduction in 1989, the Government paid doctors a set fee for each injection, regardless of the dose. Despite the drug's success, doctors used only a limited amount. In late 1990, the Government switched to paying doctors based on the amount of EPO thet used. Doses immediately soared, and dialysis patients' concentration of red blood cells improved.
 Graph tracks the average dose of EPO administered by National Medical Care, the nation's largest dialysis company, and the median concentration of red blood cells in National Medical dialysis patients' blood from 1989 through 1995. (Source: National Medical Care) (pg. B15)
 
"A Better Record"
 Kaiser's Los Angeles dialysis clinic treats more than the average number of the hardest-to-treat kidney patients, yet it performs better than the national norm by various measures.
 Graph compares the number of days Kaiser patients spent in the hospital each year with the national average. Also compared is the percentage of Kaiser's dialysis patients who are able to work or study full time with the percentage of patients in Southern California who are able to do so.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Backs Transfer Of State Jobs Out of City

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Other New York City politicians have blasted Gov. George E. Pataki's decision to move up to 500 state jobs out of the city, calling it "geographical patronage" at the City's expense. But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that he had no quarrel with the move, noting that it would save money for the state.
Asked about the plan at a City Hall news conference, the Mayor took the occasion to describe in detail the new cordiality between the two chief executives, who only last fall were at each other's throats. The Governor, Mr. Giuliani said, has surprised him by being eminently fair to New York City and the result has been an unusually cooperative relationship. 
 "The Mayor and the Governor have probably worked out the best relationship that a Mayor and a Governor have had in a long time," Mr. Giuliani said. "We have worked very well together, to help both the city and the state."
Yesterday's kind words by the Mayor marked the latest in a series of political favors the two men have done for each other in the year since Mr. Pataki's election, which Mr. Giuliani openly opposed. Though a lingering personal bitterness makes it unlikely they will ever star together in a buddy movie, their political philosophies and fiscal predicaments are so similar that they have found themselves, as if by accident, on the same side of issue after issue.
When the Mayor needed the Governor to veto a bill that would undermine the merger of the local police forces, the Governor was there. When he needed the Governor to broker an landmark agreement on the city's watershed that would save the city billions of dollars, the Governor was there. When he needed the Governor to support his plan to abolish the Board of Education, he got that, too.
Though the Mayor has not had as much currency to offer Mr. Pataki, he was only too happy yesterday to step out of the way of the jobs-transfer debate. The Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, along with other state legislators and public employee unions from New York City, have pleaded with Mr. Giuliani to join them in fighting the transfer of jobs to the Binghamton area, a move they say is a payoff by the Governor to loyal Republican areas.
But Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that the Governor was well within his rights to make the move.
"It really is the kind of thing that you have to have the flexibility to do, if you run a state or run a city," the Mayor said. "I have to move jobs sometimes from one borough to another, because in fact you can save money, if it's more convenient and agencies are going to reorganize. And to pick on the Governor for this is not the best way to get the kind of help that the city needs."
Most of what the Mayor has provided the Governor has been the praise Mr. Pataki needs in a city that decisively supported his opponent, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Just 395 days ago, the Mayor stood on the steps of City Hall and said that if Mr. Pataki were elected governor, "ethics will be trashed" and the city would be hurt. There followed a brief period when the two men did not speak to each other, but recently the compliments have been unstinting.
"This is a Governor that has grown, I think, in office more than anyone I've seen in a short period of time," Mr. Giuliani said in October. "He understands what it means to be the governor of the entire state."
Yesterday, he went even further, saying he would have predicted a year ago that the Governor would have taken completely different stands on most major issues affecting the city.
"On the big issues, he came through for the city," the Mayor said. "And on the biggest issue of all, the watershed issue, he was able to step beyond the political situation he had been in before. So on balance I would say he's been very fair to the city of New York."
Mr. Pataki has been somewhat more muted in his compliments. Asked yesterday if the two men actually liked each other, Zenia Mucha, the Governor's spokeswoman, paused for a long few seconds before responding diplomatically.
"They have mutual respect for what each is trying to accomplish," she finally said. She went on to acknowledge that they have a good business relationship, agreeing with each other on the need to cut the size of government and stimulate the economy.
Their alliance, however, came as a crushing disappointment to the public employees union that represents many of the state workers who would be transferred upstate.
"Maybe he's been misinformed," said Denyce Duncan Lacy, a spokeswoman for the New York State Public Employees Federation. "Perhaps we can still find a way to change the Mayor's mind."

HEADLINE: Record Rally Continues in Blue-Chip Stocks

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks extended their record-setting rally to a third consecutive session yesterday. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index retreated from the high it set on Monday.
"We are in the middle of replacing leadership," said Louis Ehrenkrantz, president of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, a securities firm in New York. "This proves there is something called the law of gravity." 
 After soaring 52.39 points on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 37.93 points, to 5,177.45, marking its 67th record of 1995. For the second consecutive session, this important indicator advanced at one point more than 50 points, setting off the New York Stock Exchange's collar on computer-programmed trading for the 14th time this year. Such collars are meant to stabilize the stock market.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which increased 6.70 points on Monday, gained 4 points, to a record of 617.68. But the Nasdaq slipped 3.90 points, to 1,065.89.
Advances far outnumbered declines on the Big Board, 1,410 to 979. Trading rose to 437.4 million shares, from 406.8 million shares Monday and the most recent three-month daily average of 362 million shares.
The stock market rally has been bolstered in part by expectations that short-term interest rates will soon be lowered by the Federal Reserve. Those expectations held fast yesterday even as the bond market consolidated after a long run. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond tested the psychologically important level of 6 percent before inching back up to 6.04 percent, from 6.02 percent on Monday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.
A standout stock sector was drugs, which have been steadily gaining momentum in recent sessions. Eli Lilly increased 1, to 100 3/4; Johnson & Johnson rose 1 3/4, to 89 1/2, and SmithKline Beecham advanced 3/4, to 54 5/8.
Shares of Value Health rose 8.1 percent after the company announced that it would buy Medintell Systems, which sells a pharmacy data system, for $28 million in stock. Value Health rose 2 1/8, to 28 3/8.
Major oil companies were also strong players in yesterday's rally. Mobil closed at 109 1/2, up 1 1/2, and Exxon closed at 79 3/4, up 1 1/8.
Once again, Internet-related stocks surprised many analysts by maintaining their sharp ascent. Netscape, which went public on Aug. 9 at 28, spiked 21 1/2, to 171, and Spyglass added 4 3/4, to 114 1/2.
But some of the well-known names in the technology group slumped. Microsoft fell 1 7/8, to 86; Intel lost 3/8, to 61 3/8, and Acclaim Entertainment, which restated its earnings on the advice of its accountants, plunged 6 7/8, to 12 5/8.
Shares of Pixar, which jumped 77 percent on its first day of trading last week, dropped 5 3/4, to 28 1/2, after falling 6 on Monday. The company provided a three-dimensinal computer animation program for the hit motion picture "Toy Story," but some investors are concerned that its next film will not be released until 1998.
Bausch & Lomb declined 2 5/8, to 35 3/8. The company projected that its fourth-quarter profits would be below analysts' forecasts.
On the plus side, International Flavors and Fragrances, perceived as producing big earnings gains next year, rose 1 1/4, to 53 1/2. Hercules, which completed the sale of its electronics and printing division for $130 million, advanced 2, to 58 5/8. And General Motors class H stock, which represents its successful Hughes Electronics unit, increased 1 1/4, to 48 1/2.

HEADLINE: France's Pain

 BODY:
Like the Republican Congress in Washington, the French Government has proposed huge spending cuts to reduce the Federal deficit. Only Paris would accomplish its surgery over about two years, rather than the seven the Republicans plan.
Little wonder, then, that France's public employees have gone on strike, crippling Paris for almost two weeks by shutting down mass transit and reducing telephone and mail service. Yesterday at least 30,000 workers and their supporters marched through the city in an effort to force the Government to back down. 
 French citizens, who have tried to get on with business, are unhappy that the Government they elected to energize the economy and generate more jobs has adopted policies that in the near term are likely to produce just the opposite.
But the truth is that French voters brought fiscal austerity upon themselves when they decided in 1992 to drop the franc and adopt a single European currency by 1999. European Union rules stipulate that countries that adopt the single currency must bring their monetary and fiscal policies under tight control -- for example, reducing their deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product by 1998. France's deficit is now above 5 percent.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe proposes to meet the deficit target by raising taxes, reducing France's high welfare benefits and lengthening the number of years public employees must work before becoming eligible for social security. Over the long term France would need to adopt such measures to control its deficit and to attack unemployment, which hovers around 11 percent.
America has no particular stake in how quickly France deals with its deficit, or even whether the franc survives. America's interest is a prosperous France and prosperous Europe, and the best way to assure that is to knock down trade and investment barriers, which the European Union is already doing. That does not require a single currency.
A common currency does have political appeal. France has long maintained that the best way to keep Germany tied to Western Europe is to imbed it in European institutions, including a European currency that would also replace the German mark. But a common currency also comes with a high price: lost control over monetary and fiscal policy that could otherwise be used to fend off recession.
The dislocation in France may give other countries pause about a common currency and the economic discipline that goes with it. The coalition governing Austria collapsed in October over disagreements about how to cut its deficit. Now President Jacques Chirac of France is under pressure to pull back and reconstitute his Government.
The architects of the European Union underestimated the pain of reaching their goal. But the troubles in France and renewed doubts about a single currency need not unravel the vision of a united Europe. The most important steps are already being taken, and can continue, whatever France and other nations ultimately conclude about their tolerance for the pain of one currency.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
France's Turmoil Center Stage, The Dollar Is Generally Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against leading European currencies yesterday as traders took profits while hoping for a resolution of the broad strikes hobbling France.
Traders lacked significant economic data or other reasons to push the dollar up against the German mark, especially given the reluctance to risk losing profits booked so far this year. The dollar also failed to benefit from a rally in the American stock markets. 
 The dollar meandered in Japanese yen trading, finishing slightly higher.
"In the absence of firm views, people are sitting on the sidelines," said John Rothfield, an international economist at the Chicago office of Nationsbanc-CRT. "You don't want to put on a bet at this time of the year."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 101.26 yen, up from 101.20 yen late Monday. It sold for 1.4338 German marks, down from 1.4390 marks.
Traders kept their attention on the situation in France, where 50,000 people took part in a demonstration in Paris calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Alain Juppe. Other demonstrations took place in Nimes, Lyons and several other big cities.
The strikers want to make sure that the Government does not abandon social spending programs in trimming France's $65 billion budget deficit. A reduced deficit is an important requirement for entry into the European monetary union planned by 1999.
France has been committed to a policy of keeping the franc strong, but it must do so while cutting the deficit or risk undermining plans for European economic unity.
The French commitment to the franc "is stretched to the limit," Mr. Rothfield said.
Still, the franc rebounded somewhat against the mark and the dollar yesterday when Mr. Juppe reaffirmed the Government's commitment to sweeping changes in the health and welfare system.
In New York trading, the mark fell to 3.4561 French francs, from 3.4724 francs on Monday. The dollar fell to 4.9545 French francs, from 4.9950 francs
In other trading, the dollar fell to 1.1664 Swiss francs from 1.1685. The British pound rose to $1.5430, from $1.5325.
"We continue to look for reasons to buy" the dollar, Mr. Rothfield said. "It's very dead, though."

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
The office building in lower Manhattan that housed Delmonico's changes hands for $3 million.

BYLINE: By Mervyn Rothstein 

 BODY:
TIME EQUITIES INC. and a group of private investors have paid $3 million for the 1891 office building in lower Manhattan that was the home of Delmonico's, the restaurant credited with introducing haute cuisine to the United States in the mid-19th century.
The 12,500-square-foot, wood-paneled and elegantly decorated restaurant, at 48-56 Beaver Street, two blocks south of Wall Street at South William Street, is vacant. But Francis Greenburger, the chairman and chief executive of Time Equities, said he hoped to find a restaurateur willing to bring 21st-century cuisine to the once-fashionable 19th-century site, where Charles Dickens dined on such fare as agneau farci a la Walter Scott. 
 Mr. Greenburger said that with the downtown office market still weak -- the building is less than 50 percent occupied -- he planned to transform the office space into 39 residential rental units, at a cost of about $1.5 million. He credited Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Downtown Revitalization Plan, which is to provide tax abatements for converting underused office buildings into residential space, with laying the foundation for the conversion.
Previous owners had spent $6 million in the early 1980's to turn the building, with 62,000 square feet of space, into 30 luxury condominiums. But the residential condominium market turned soft and the apartments were rented as office space. At the same time, Delmonico's was recreated from turn-of-the-century photographs; that restaurant closed about three years ago.
Delmonico's was founded in 1827 by Swiss-born brothers, Peter and John Delmonico. After their original dining spot was destroyed by fire in 1835, they put up a four-story building at Beaver and South William. In 1891, that building was replaced by the current eight-story one, designed by James Brown Lord.
The Renaissance Revival building, of orange terra cotta and brick, is up for landmark designation, and a hearing is to be held Tuesday by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. "It's a beautiful building," Mr. Greenburger said, "and it probably should be landmarked."
 
Brokerage Firm on Move
 Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, an investment bank and brokerage firm, has taken 100,000 square feet on four floors at 590 Madison Avenue, the I.B.M. Building at 57th Street.
The company plans to move in late spring from about 70,000 square feet on eight floors at 540 Madison. It will at first occupy the 33d, 34th and 35th floors, about 75,000 square feet, and will pick up the 32d floor gradually over the first 10 years of the 15-year lease, said Jeffrey Lichtenberg of the Edward S. Gordon Company, who handled the deal for Ladenburg. The lease is valued at more than $80 million. The Gordon company also represented the building.
Just below Ladenburg, Caspian Holdings Inc., a newly established investment banking and securities firm, has taken the 31st floor -- 24,300 square feet -- for its United States corporate headquarters. (It has also opened an office in London.) The 11-year lease is valued at more than $10 million. Bruce Mosler and Andy D. Simon of the Galbreath Company represented Caspian; Scott Gottlieb of Gordon represented the building.
 
City Agency Relocates
 The New York City Financial Information Services Agency, the office that processes checks and payrolls, has leased 130,000 square feet at 450 West 33d Street, between 9th and 10th Avenues.
The agency is moving from about 100,000 square feet at 111 Eighth Avenue, between 15th and 16th Streets. The 20-year deal is valued at more than $40 million. The move is expected by late spring.
Robert Alexander of the Edward S. Gordon Company, who with his colleague, Louis Buffalino, represented the agency, said it was attracted to the site in part because of its 16-foot ceilings and floors larger than 100,000 square feet.
Mr. Buffalino said the space, a former Citibank data center, had a raised floor with many of the systems the city needed already in place.
Richard Karson of Gordon, who with David Levinson represented the owner, the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, said that the 1.5 million-square-foot building was about 70 percent rented.
 
Fitness Center Expands
 The exercise boom continues. The American Fitness Center has leased its third Manhattan site, 22,000 square feet at 200 Madison Avenue, a 26-floor, 525,000-square-foot office building between 35th and 36th Streets. It is expected to open Feb. 1.
Russell Henis, the fitness center's president, said the lease was for 16 years with an average annual rent of $25 a square foot.
Faith Hope Consolo of Garrick-Aug Store Leasing, who handled the deal for the fitness center with her associate, Marc Leber, said the idea was to find a location near both offices and residences. "This space fit their needs by being near the Murray Hill area as well as several major office buildings," she said. The other two centers are at 128 Eighth Avenue and 131 East 31st Street. The 200 Madison Avenue building was represented by Peter Duncan and Matt Coudert of George Comfort & Sons.

HEADLINE: There Is No Blame for Budget Deficits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Quoting selected experts, you say (news analysis, Dec. 3) that neither political party "has clean hands" on the issue of Federal budget deficits. This narrow view of history and public policy is misleading. 
 Deficits and increases in national debt have been chronic since the Great Depression of the 1930's, not merely recent decades. The national debt increased 600 percent during World War II, with annual deficits ranging from 20 percent to 31 percent of national output that finally ended the Depression. The deficits of the 1930's and recent decades are relatively trivial. For the past five decades, moreover, the United States was preoccupied with the cold war.
If the designated experts, members of Congress and the President believe that deficits are a major problem, let them condemn the victories of World War II and the cold war, the real impetus for deficits.
You might also ask them to explain why the budget-balancing and national debt reductions throughout the 1920's produced only economic disaster. In the cold light of history, and contrary to economic myth, there is no blame to assess, and no problem.

HEADLINE: Testifying to the Ravages of Granddad's War

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Twice the age and perhaps twice as wise as when she started writing fiction in the late 1960's, Pat Barker now understands why her first three books were never published. "I was writing things that I shouldn't have been trying to write," she recalled. "I was writing sensitive middle-class lady novels, and it's not what I am."
At the time, of course, she had good reason to believe she had joined the English middle classes. She had a degree in history and economics from the London School of Economics, she was married to a university professor, she was herself a teacher and she had given birth to the first of her two children. Her working-class roots had seemingly disappeared. 
 But a passing contact with the late English novelist Angela Carter nudged her back to her past. She should write about what she knew best, Ms. Carter told her, about the tough working women of northern industrial towns, about her upbringing by her grandparents, about her memories. It worked. "Union Street," a story about assembly-line women, was published in 1982 and three other novels followed.
Then, just as suddenly, Mrs. Barker switched her attention to World War I. With "Regeneration" (1991) and "The Eye in the Door" (1993), she was noticed in London's literary circles. Now "The Ghost Road," the acclaimed final novel in her World War I trilogy, has won her the Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award. It has just been published in the United States by Dutton.
But what, one might ask, was "an ordinary mum from up north," as the 52-year-old writer delights in describing herself, doing writing about British Army officers being treated for shell shock in the Great War? After all, born in 1943 in the northeastern industrial town of Thornby-on-Tees, she was too young to remember even World War II.
Memories, though, were again at work. She was the result of a wartime liaison and never knew her father, who, she was told, died in the war. When her mother married seven years later, young Pat remained with her grandparents. And in that home, it was World War I that mattered. Her grandfather had been a soldier and his war stories seemed all the more real because of a bayonet scar on his back that she was occasionally allowed to touch.
Decades later, through her husband, David, a professor of zoology at Durham University whose specialty is neuroanatomy, she learned about William H. R. Rivers, a psychologist who experimented with new neurological techniques for treating soldiers suffering breakdowns in the horrors of trench warfare in northern France. Armed with the emotional link to her grandfather and extensive research, Mrs. Barker then wrote "Regeneration," which focused on the relationship between Rivers and the writer Siegfried Sassoon, a patient at a hospital at Craiglockhart, near Edinburgh. Reinforcing the literary connection, the poet Wilfred Owen was also at Craiglockhart, although not under Rivers's care.
After "Regeneration," Mrs. Barker realized that her story was not over, that a trilogy would be necessary. In "The Eye in the Door," with the madness of the war again permeating the story, the focus turns to Sassoon and the author's own creation, Billy Prior, a bisexual officer of working-class extraction who is also a Rivers patient.
Finally, "The Ghost Road" becomes Prior's story as he prepares to return for his fourth stint in the trenches, with Rivers eager to know how he will react. Refusing the chance of staying home on medical grounds, Prior is himself no less curious about his own reactions. And he passes the new test of nerves.
Perhaps surprisingly, Prior's recovery from shell shock was not unusual. Using analysis, neurological surgery and electric shock treatment, Rivers and other doctors were often able to eliminate such common symptoms as mutism, paralysis and hysteria. "Most people were cured enough to do something of service to the war," Mrs. Barker noted. "In 1917, when Owen had his breakdown, 80 percent of shell-shock cases were dealt with within sound of gunfire and 80 percent were back in the line within 14 days."
Accompanying Prior's story, Mrs. Barker shows Rivers reliving memories of his prewar work among the headhunters of Melanesia in the Pacific. Based on Rivers's writings, these stories of ritual death and psychological enslavement to evil spirits in turn serve as mirrors of the physical carnage and mental devastation wrought by the set-piece battles of World War I.
Yet while at first sight "The Ghost Road" is an antiwar novel, in many ways it tells more about the dysfunctional nature of British society. And in that sense, Mrs. Barker's fascination with Prior is understandable. Like the author, who raises a rare northern working-class voice in a London-dominated literary world, Prior is an outsider. He is an officer who does not belong to the officer class; he is engaged to be married but is actively bisexual.
"He straddles every possible divide," Mrs. Barker said, sipping a gin and tonic in a Kensington hotel during a brief visit to London. "His chameleon qualities interest me. I think I was mainly interested in the core of identity. He returns to France with the expectation of dying, yet not with the intention of dying. I think even his form of sex is connected with his death. It is mechanized commercial sex in a mechanized commercial war."
Her book also makes clear that Prior chose to return to the front not out of any great sense of duty, but rather because of his aversion to a Britain in which he could find no place for himself. Once again, perhaps this parallels Mrs. Barker's own preference for her orderly life "up north" and her undisguised distaste for the glitter and media exposure of London's literary scene.
"I'm not interested in an international-author type role," she said. "What use are writers to other writers? Really. You can have a good moan about your royalties and your rotten publishers and all the rest of it. That's all they do. Writers talk about money to the exclusion of all other topics, including themselves."
Still, after "The Ghost Road" won the Booker Prize on Nov. 6, beating out novels by Salman Rushdie, Barry Unsworth, Tim Winton and Justin Cartwright, Mrs. Barker was thrust into the limelight. The prize and accompanying publicity also made her book a best seller in Britain. But she was keen to return to Durham, where, she said, her neighbors congratulated her and said "that was nice" and changed the subject, "which is what I would do if anything embarrassing happened to them."
Now her mind is on her next book, which will be set in a rundown housing project where wild young joy riders known as Twockers ("Taking Without the Owner's Consent") rule the night. "They do these marvelous hand-brake turns and, in the evening when they have finished, they burn the cars to destroy the forensic evidence," she said with delight. Evidently, behind her genteel exterior, the subversive in Mrs. Barker is stirring anew.

HEADLINE: PATAKI PROPOSING TO BREAK UP LILCO

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I., Dec. 5

 BODY:
Under a complex plan endorsed by Gov. George E. Pataki, a state utility board has proposed dismantling the Long Island Lighting Company to reduce electric rates by up to 12 percent. Financing would come from a $4.5 billion bond sale, the largest in the history of the municipal bond market.
The Republican Governor's unusual plan, which relies less on government than proposals made by Democrats have, calls for Lilco to sell its natural gas operations and its power plants to private companies. The state utility board, the Long Island Power Authority, would then take over Lilco's transmission lines and hire another company to operate them. 
 The Governor commissioned the plan three months ago in an effort to find financial relief for the 2.7 million residents of Long Island, who pay one of the highest utility rates in the nation, especially since Lilco shut the ill-fated $5 billion Shoreham nuclear power plant in 1989.
A 22-page memorandum describing the plan, however, leaves many critical questions unanswered, and it is unclear whether in the end this solution will be able to provide financial relief to residents of suburban Suffolk County, an important political constituency for the Governor.
Suffolk County now owes $80 million for property tax overpayments that Lilco made on the Shoreham plant, and pending lawsuits could push that figure as high as $500 million. The memorandum does not specify any mechanism for forgiving those payments -- unlike a Democratic plan that called for a state takeover of the company and the writing off of the debt. The report simply says that an "equitable" solution, like imposing a surcharge on Suffolk County residents, should be reached.
Mr. Pataki, who is to formally announce the proposal on Wednesday at a news conference at Adelphi University in Garden City, today described it as a "well-thought-out, detailed long-term plan that is going to provide for a double-digit reduction in utility rates in Long Island."
But even fellow Republicans seemed to respond cautiously. The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J.Gaffney, who had strongly supported the Democratic proposal for a government takeover, declined to comment today. And the chairman of Suffolk's Republican Party, John Powell, a close ally of the Governor's, said that while he was optimistic that the Governor would be able to fill in the details, he was concerned that the proposal fell short of meeting Suffolk taxpayers' needs.
"There has to be something or some mechanism that is built in for the protection of Suffolk County taxpayers," Mr. Powell said. "We should identify it before we approve this plan."
To win final approval, the plan needs the support of the Governor; the State Senate Majority Leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, and the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, who expressed reservations today.
"The local tax issue seems to have been lost in all of this," Mr. Silver said, referring to the tax increase Suffolk would inevitably face if it must pay back the taxes to Lilco. "I think that is critical to the overall plan. There are people who are going to be forced to move if their property taxes rise to reflect the court judgment.
"I'm concerned that there's an attempt to make this proposal the conclusion," he said, adding, "I have a lot of questions."
An important difference between the new plan and another Democratic plan, one offered by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo during last year's election campaign, is how it reimburses shareholders. Mr. Cuomo's plan proposing to buy the company outright for $21.50 a share, or $5 more than the selling price at the time, was warmly greeted by Lilco executives and shareholders.
The plan endorsed by Mr. Pataki makes no offer for the stock. Instead, Lilco would be paid for its assets, such as its power plants and transmission lines, and would then have the option of liquidating itself and paying off stockholders at some unspecified future price. Lilco has made no comment on the new plan.
Lilco common stock closed at $16.50 today, down $1, as details of the report became known.
The memorandum describing the plan was based on the recommendations of Bear, Stearns and Company, which LIPA had hired as its consultant. The chairman of the board, James F. Gill, a Pataki appointee, declined comment today.
One of the unknowns of the new plan is how such a large bond sale would fare. The report notes that Bear Stearns expects a temporary adverse impact on the market for New York tax-exempt bonds because of the size of the offering. Such a large bond offering could drive up the interest rate that the Long Island Power Authority would have to pay to attract buyers.
But Duncan Smith, senior managing partner in charge of trade for Lebenthal and Company, said the market of individual investors, mutual funds and insurance companies would quickly absorb the bond issue.
"The market is starving for them," he said. "There is no question that the market is looking for bonds, and more than just $4.5 billion, I might add."
According to the authority report, the board would issue almost $4.5 billion in tax-exempt debt and assume about $2.25 billion in Lilco's outstanding tax-exempt debt for a total finance package of $6.75 billion.
"This is a big experiment," said Ashok Gupta, an energy economist for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel in New York. "What type of ratings are they going to get? And all this to get a 10 percent rate reduction? It may be politically important, but is this really how you want to spend $4 billion of state financing?"
Also left unanswered in the report was who would manage and operate the utility for the power authority. Two New York utilities, Brooklyn Union and Consolidated Edison, have submitted proposals to the authority in connection with the restructuring. Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment on their role today.
Proposals aimed at increasing competition are among other recommendations in the plan. For instance, Lilco would sell off its power plants in four or five "bundles" to separate companies while offering up its gas operations to a buyer that would not have anything to do with the electric system.
But some utility analysts said they feared that such a system could create small high-priced monopolies on Long Island, where the transmission system is so limited that some areas rely on one generator for power.
"I question how real competition can be on Long Island given the limited capacity of the transmission lines," said James Rothschild, a private consultant on utility financial issues who has advised consumer groups on Long Island. "Competitors who are really the only game in town can end up pressuring a company to pay higher rates than they do now."
Despite such concerns, the political capital from a Lilco restructuring is clearly worth the effort to Mr. Pataki.
As details of the report started to leak out this week, Mr. Gill, the board chairman, continued to insist that its main committee meeting on the issue should be closed to the public.
"I'm going to maintain all the confidentiality that I can," he said. "What's salvageable, I want to salvage."
Lilco, which lost a bitter, decades-long fight to open Shoreham, remains the object of ratepayers' scorn, and criticism of the company is an effective tool for local politicians in search of votes.
Last month, the power authority collected 31 proposals from independent power producers, investment banking firms, citizens groups and management consulting firms interested in participating in a Lilco takeover. Many of them had advised the authority to refinance the debt from Shoreham -- advice it followed in its report. But the authority was silent on suggestions from consumer groups to increase conservation and make the system more efficient.
Mr. Silver said he would like the authority to do a comparison study of the proposals instead of settling on one. "I would like to see an independent analysis and these other plans," he said. "The board received 31 responses, but no one has addressed them. I would like to see what's feasible."
Lilco serves about a million electric customers in Nassau and Suffolk counties and on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens. The electric service territory is 1,230 square miles. The company also provides natural gas to about 442,000 customers.

The Plan

Photo: "Logistics of Pataki's Proposal to Dismantle Lilco"
 The Long Island Power Authority would sell at least $4.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds to buy Lilco's transmission and distribution systems and assume the $4.5 billion debt for the defunct Shoreham nuclear power plant.
 Another energy company, possibly Consolidated Edison, would contract with the authority to manage the distribution of electricity to retail customers. Lilco's power plants would be sold to separate companies, which would sell power to the authority. In addition, Lilco would sell its gas business to another company, most likely Brooklyn Union.
 
The Impact on Rates
 The authority says rates would drop by at least 12 percent. But even with the reduction, Lilco rates would remain among the highest in the nation.
 
The Savings
 A large portion of the savings to ratepayers would come from refinancing the Shoreham debt with tax-exempt bonds at an interest rate substantially lower than what Lilco currently pays.
 In addition, revenue from the transmission and distribution system would be exempt from Federal income taxes because these systems would be owned by LIPA. And dividend payments to Lilco sharelolders and corporate profit-making would also be eliminated.
 The authority believes that competition between the new owner of Lilco's gas operations and the companies that buy the power plants would also produce savings.
 
Lilco's Future
 Lilco would be out of the utility business on Long Island and might be liquidated. Stockholders would be paid off from the money Lilco receives from the authority for the Shoreham debt and its distribution network, as well as the proceeds of the sale of Lilco's gas business and power plants.
 
Lilco's Employees
 Lilco's workers would go to work for the new owners of the generating plants or for the company that contracted to deliver electricity. Some executives and managers would probably lose their jobs.
 
The Hurdles
 The plan faces several formidable hurdles. First, if Lilco rejects the deal, the state would have to condemn the company.
 The plan also requires the approval of the State Public Authorities Control Board, whose three voting members represent Governor Pataki, the State Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and State Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican. Each has veto power, and Democrats, who have criticized the way the plan was drafted, have hinted that Mr. Silver is prepared to block the plan if he finds it unsatisfactory.
 Also, Suffolk County would probably oppose any plan that failed to settle on favorable terms a major tax case involving assessments on the Shoreham nuclear power plant. Lilco is seeking more that $500 million in a current case and won $83 million in an earlier proceeding.
 
The Timetable
 Authority officials estimate the plan could be completed in one to two years, with 18 months the target. (pg. B7)

HEADLINE: PATAKI PLANNING A GRADUAL REPEAL OF A UTILITY TAX

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The Pataki administration and the Republican leader of the State Senate say they intend to push for the gradual repeal of a utility tax that brings the state almost $1 billion a year and adds several dollars a month to the average New Yorker's gas and electric bills, state officials said today.
The gross receipts tax, as it is called, has few if any supporters in the state. A 4.25 percent tax on utility companies' gross sales of power, which is passed along to customers, it is a regressive tax that hits poor New Yorkers especially hard, and large manufacturers say it adds tens of thousands of dollars to the cost of doing business in New York. 
 But the tax brings in about $950 million a year, so Democrats and some Republicans may fight its repeal in 1996 because they worry about the budget cuts that would be required to make up for the tax cut.
Administration officials said that Gov. George E. Pataki did not plan to include the utility tax cut in his budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning April 1, which he will introduce on Dec. 15. Mr. Pataki's aides said that he was concerned about closing a projected $4 billion shortfall next year, and they said it may be politically untenable for the Governor to support new tax cuts now.
But the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, Mr. Pataki's main legislative ally, said he would make eliminating the utility tax, along with several other business taxes, a priority in the coming budget talks. And the Governor's aides said Mr. Pataki could support cutting the utility tax in 1996 provided legislative leaders find savings to make it possible.
In any case, the administration says it definitely intends to push for the tax cut in 1997 if it is not enacted in 1996.
A spokeswoman for the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat of Manhattan who will be Mr. Pataki's main adversary in the budget negotiations, questioned whether it was realistic to propose tax cuts when the state was facing major fiscal problems.
"Every proposal will be judged as part of an overall economic package," said the spokeswoman, Patricia Lynch. "Does it create jobs? And is it affordable?"
Pataki administration officials said they planned to eliminate the tax gradually, phasing in the repeal over five to seven years.
"Whatever else happens, it is clear that New York's gross receipts tax on electric and gas corporations has got to go," said Michael H. Urbach, State Commissioner of Taxation, during a legislative hearing on Tuesday. "It is not a question of whether or if. It is a question of when and how."
Cutting taxes was one of Mr. Pataki's central campaign pledges, and it now seems clear that tax cuts will be a central part of the impending budget talks, which most officials here had already expected to be unusually contentious.
Senior state officials said the Governor had also discussed with legislative leaders the possibility of cutting two other taxes as part of next year's budget: the estate tax and a capital gains tax on real estate transactions of $1 million and more.
This comes as Mr. Pataki already faces a projected $4 billion shortfall for the fiscal year that begins in April 1996, even before accounting for any new tax cuts. He is expected to propose spending cuts nearly across the board to close the gap.
Even with that, there is broad bipartisan support for eventually eliminating the gross receipts tax because power companies pass it directly to their customers, increasing the state's already high utility costs for poor tenement dwellers and wealthy suburban homeowners alike. A person with a $100-a-month gas and electric bill now pays about $5 a month for the gross receipts tax.
The tax is particularly costly for large manufacturers who pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in power bills, and business leaders have long argued that high utility costs are a major reason behind the decline in manufacturing jobs in New York State.
But there is also support among Democrats who represent the urban poor for phasing out the tax. Like the sales tax, the gross receipts tax is passed on by utilities at the same rate to customers of all incomes. That means its impact is regressive: it takes a larger percentage of a low-income person's income than a wealthy person's income.
Advocates for the poor said, however, that the state could not possibly afford new tax cuts next year. Mr. Pataki is already planning to propose deep cuts in welfare and health care programs, and more tax cuts would require further reductions in those programs, they said.
Shelly Nortz, director of state policy for the Coalition for the Homeless, said Mr. Pataki's proposal to place a 60-day time limit on welfare for single adults would increase homelessness. Without more money for shelters, many of those newly homeless people will end up on the streets, she said.
"They enacted an incredibly irresponsible tax cut last year that positions us to have a huge deficit this year," she said, referring to an income tax cut passed earlier this year that will reduce state revenues by $2.2 billion in the 1996-97 fiscal year. "I can't fathom why they think it is prudent policy to add to that."
Aides to Mr. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer County, said he would push strongly in budget talks for gradually reducing the estate tax and eliminating the real estate capital gains tax.
The real estate tax is a 10 percent tax on profits from sales of $1 million or more in real estate. A person who buys a building for $1 million and sells it for a $500,000 profit pays a state tax of $50,000. The tax, which raises nearly $100 million a year, is not imposed on transactions involving the seller's personal residence.
The tax was created in 1983 under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to help close a budget shortfall and has been derisively known as the Cuomo tax ever since. Opposition to it has been led by Manhattan real estate developers who contend it has worsened an already bad real estate market.
Under another proposal supported by Senate Republicans for reducing the estate tax, the state would also raise the minimum level at which it begins imposing inheritance taxes, to $600,000 from $250,000. Now, the inheritors of an estate worth $600,000 pay at least $12,000 in state taxes, state officials said. But under the Republican proposal, they would pay nothing.

HEADLINE: Stocks Reach Record, With Dow Near 5,200

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks continued to set records yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average coming within a fraction of finishing above the 5,200 level during a seesaw session.
With blue chips gaining for the fourth straight trading day, the Dow jumped 21.68 points, to 5,199.13, after crossing 5,200 during the day, notching its 68th record close of the year. It first topped 5,100 on Nov. 29, just eight days after it passed the 5,000 mark. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also achieved a new high, rising 2.50 points, to 620.18. But the Nasdaq composite index, laden with computer-related issues, fell for the second straight day, losing 4.16 points to close at 1,061.73.
"The high-yielding stocks are continuing to outperform the market," said John Hammerschmidt, a partner of Turner Investment Partners in Philadelphia. "People are continuing to move into companies with international exposure."
Mr. Hammerschmidt added that yesterday's stock market followed the bond market, which closed on the up side, although well below its high for the day. The price of the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/32 , sending its yield down to 6.03 percent, from 6.04 percent on Tuesday. It had briefly dipped below 6 percent for the third day in a row.
Analysts noted that market movement was affected by the release of a Commerce Department report for October that construction spending increased a higher-than-expected 2.7 percent, the biggest increase in more than three years. However, Bruce Steinberg, manager of macroeconomics at Merrill Lynch, said that recent housing and retail sales data pointed "to a slowdown in the consumer sector, due to weak job and income growth and heavy consumer debt burdens."
Advancing issues exceeded declines on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,277 to 1,098. Big Board volume dropped to 418.8 million shares, from 437.4 million shares Tuesday.
Nondurable stocks, defensive issues that usually do well in a favorable interest-rate environment, were strong yesterday. Philip Morris increased 1 1/8, to 90 7/8; Coca-Cola rose 2, to 79 3/8, and Procter & Gamble advanced 1 1/4, to 88.
Some energy stocks benefited from favorable crude oil prices. Exxon closed at 80 1/2, up 3/4, and Royal Dutch rose 1, to 131 3/4.
The drug group once more showed that large-capitalization growth stocks with international exposure were attractive to traders. Johnson & Johnson gained 1 1/4, to 90 3/4; Eli Lilly added 2 1/4, to 103, and Abbott Laboratories was up 1 3/8, to 41 3/4.
Microsoft, which plans to discuss its Internet strategy today, climbed 4 5/8, to 90 5/8. And Gucci, which forecast record sales in 1995, surged 1 5/8, to 38 1/2.
However, a number of network service stocks moved lower on profit taking. Cisco dropped 25/16 , to 7913/16 ; Bay Networks fell 3 1/4, to 43, and Cabletron Systems declined 1 7/8, to 77 5/8.
The Dow Jones transportation index slipped 5.50 points, to 2,086.61, with railroad issues participating in the slump. Union Pacific closed at 68, down 1/4, and CSX closed at 87 1/4, down 3/4.

HEADLINE: Such a Doable Deal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
In private, when they are not wailing about Republican cheeseparing or molar-gnashing about Democratic profligacy, some of the parties to the balanced-budget talks on Capitol Hill will concede a secret: If they really tried, they might quickly cut a deal on Federal spending.
So far, they have not really tried. A lot of evidence now suggests that this may be the week in which they finally start. 
 Nobody in Congress underestimates the difficulty of bridging a chasm between Democratic and Republican bargainers that is not only $500 billion wide but as deep as political ideology can run. Still, politics is the art of compromise, and budget experts on both sides already see the elements of a seven-year deal to erase the deficit so clearly that they can almost trace them in the air.
These elements include acceptance by President Clinton of considerably greater savings from Medicare and Medicaid than he currently calls for, and Republicans' acquiescence to a smaller tax cut, less military spending and slightly more money for welfare, education and the environment than they now want.
Throw in a rosier economic forecast and a shrunken inflation factor for Government programs and tax brackets, both of which already appear likely, and voila: The Government is in fiscal balance by 2002.
That this or some other deal has not already occurred is a tribute to politics and ideology, the two forces that drive Federal policy and have worked so far against compromise. Democrats do not just believe fiercely in the programs Republicans seek to restrain; they have had one of their rare field days by asserting that the Republican budget would force old people from their sickbeds and starving children into the gutters.
For their part, Republicans not only have anointed smaller and stingier Government as political gospel, but have tried to wield it to wipe out six decades of Democratic social philosophy.
Common sense says those political and ideological forces will only flow more powerfully as election campaigns heat up and candidates in both parties are forced to calcify their stands on the issues.
But curiously, both currents may have begun shifting in favor of an accord. The first indication came on Tuesday, when the White House decided to propose a seven-year budget like the one Republicans have touted for weeks. By doing so, the Administration scored political points, negating the Republican leadership's main argument against serious bargaining -- that Democrats had no specific ideas.
More important, a Democratic seven-year budget should speed negotiations by offering the first chance for a side-by-side comparison of the two parties' fiscal plans and beliefs.
The second indication of a shift surfaced today, when President Clinton vetoed the reconciliation bill, with its restraints on Medicare and other entitlement programs, that is the Republicans' main budget-balancing vehicle. A veto was no shock; it has been a certainty for months. But as an expression of politics and ideology, it was positively cathartic -- a sort of marker that the President has now laid down, clearing the way for serious dickering to begin.
"Now we've not only said what we're not for," said Senator John Breaux of Louisiana, a member of the Democratic leadership, "but tomorrow or Friday, we'll say what we are for."
Speaker Newt Gingrich raised a third factor on Tuesday when he told a roomful of doctors in a speech that failure to reach a deficit-cutting agreement would touch off a stock market crash and reignite inflation. Market experts say Mr. Gingrich exaggerates; one leading analyst suggested today that a collapse of negotiations would cause a "correction" in the high-flying stock market and raise bond rates by about a half of a percentage point.
But from a political angle, Mr. Gingrich was on the mark. Mr. Clinton's re-election hopes rest in no small part on a healthy economy and low inflation. With signs of a slowdown emerging, the Administration's impetus will be to avoid dragging the economy down any further.
For their part, Republicans have always believed they would gain politically by pressing for a seven-year budget accord. They have succeeded beyond most outsiders' wildest predictions, so far, by taking a hard line against Democrats and moderates on virtually every spending issue.
But that, too, may be changing as the White House's assault on the Republicans' Medicare and welfare proposals has begun to bite. Both Republican legislators and Mr. Gingrich, their ideological leader, would now benefit from a bipartisan agreement that spreads the blame for spending cuts.
Even the 73 Republican freshmen in the House, who rode into office on promises to cut without political favor, face re-election with a choice of delivering a balanced budget or blocking an agreement for reasons of ideological purity.
All these shifts augur well for successful deficit talks, but they hardly guarantee them. Mr. Clinton's new budget would reduce projected spending on Medicare by $124 billion over seven years, and although a direct comparison is difficult now, it is by any measure far from the $270 billion that Republicans want.
Moreover, Mr. Clinton takes a different fiscal course: Much of his savings comes from pinching payments to medical providers, while Republicans would get a healthy chunk of theirs by raising Medicare premiums and placing a cap on annual spending.
The two sides have a deep and fundamental disagreement over how to run the Medicaid program, which is now a Federal entitlement extended to anyone who meets the income and eligibility guidelines. Mr. Clinton would keep it that way. Republicans want to abolish the entitlement and turn the program over to the states with a lump sum of money to spend as they wish.
The White House and the Republican Congress are divided almost as much over taxes. Mr. Clinton and Congressional Democrats would direct about $100 billion in tax relief over seven years to middle-class families. Republicans are adamant in demanding a capital-gains tax cut as well.
Republicans in the House will be loath to give up any military spending. The two sides are probably not far apart on welfare spending, and money for education, job training and the environment are small potatoes as Federal programs go. But they are huge ideological issues with conservatives, who see them as part of a Democratic legacy that must be cut out of Government root and branch.
All the dealmaking must be done more or less at once, for the sake of comity, so that everyone at the bargaining table can see that everyone else is suffering, too. An agreement demands that both sides be able to declare victory, no easy matter in a winter when they all are girding for an electoral battle to the death in 1996.
Yet now that the two sides have engaged, like wrestlers in a ring, they may actually work it out. They may have no choice, for to admit defeat now could lead to a worse political fate than making a less-than-perfect deal.
"If they don't have a substantial progress on a package by Christmas, I think it'd be hard to get one together," said Robert Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the capital's most respected budget analyst.
But he added: "I don't see how they get out of this set of negotiations without some agreement. The only way either the White House or the Republicans can get out is to force the other side to walk away, or blow themselves up."

HEADLINE: Gingrich Made an Issue in a California Race

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Dec. 6

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich is not running for Congress from a district here in the high-tech Silicon Valley. It just looks that way.
Democrats are so determined to make the Speaker an issue in the special election here on Tuesday that they feature him far more prominently in a torrent of campaign commercials than even their own candidate. (His name, for the record, is Jerry Estruth). 
 Eager to tar the Republican candidate, Tom Campbell, as a Gingrich clone, Democrats conveniently overlook the fact that Mr. Campbell is a centrist who balks at the Speaker's social agenda. In fact, when Mr. Gingrich appeared in San Jose recently for a Republican fund-raising event, Mr. Campbell stayed away.
No matter how tenuous it may be, Democrats have found that highlighting a Gingrich-Campbell connection has helped Mr. Estruth attract the donations and the attention to mount a competitive race and chip into the once-intimidating lead of Mr. Campbell, a state Senator and a law professor at Stanford University. The race is to fill the seat of Representative Norman Y. Mineta, a Democrat who resigned in September.
Win or lose, Democratic Party officials say the race here is a warm-up for a nationwide campaign to transform House contests next year into a referendum on one issue -- or one man. Some Democrats are counting on Mr. Gingrich as their best hope in the uphill battle to regain to control of the House next year.
Representative Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said his party had never had a better villain. "We had a group of challengers in for a seminar," Mr. Frost said, "and I told them I have one piece of advice: their opponents' middle name is Gingrich."
Mr. Frost's coaching is certainly evident here. At campaign events, Mr. Estruth, a 52-year-old stockbroker, rarely mentions Mr. Campbell as he opens with this mantra: "Do you want to continue what Newt Gingrich has been doing in Congress? Or do you want to say 'no' to Newt Gingrich's agenda?"
With his sinking poll numbers, Mr. Gingrich is a far juicer target than a previous Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., Democrat of Massachusetts, was in 1978, when the Republicans pushed the slogan "Repeal O'Neill" and tried with little success to transform House races into a referendum on the Speaker's liberal policies.
But even Democrats acknowledge that California's 15th District -- a Democratic-leaning area that sometimes tilts to Republicans and includes southern San Jose and sections of the prosperous, fast-growing Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Counties -- has become the test case for no other reason than that there is no other race.
When Mr. Mineta, a 21-year incumbent, unexpectedly announced that he was resigning to work for a military contractor, the seat looked like a sure bet for Mr. Campbell. He is a former two-term House member who gave up his seat in 1992 for an unsuccessful run in the primary for United States Senate. Mr. Campbell is still a familiar figure in this district, having been elected to the State Senate in 1993.
And Democratic leaders in the district were unable to persuade their first choice, Mayor Susan Hammer of San Jose, to make the race. They settled on Mr. Estruth, a former San Jose Councilman who tells of his ancestors who came to California "in a covered wagon in 1864."
He, like Mr. Campbell, describes himself as a fiscal conservative who is progressive on social issues. Unlike Mr. Campbell, who has a confident command of the issues, Mr. Estruth relies heavily on notes in campaign appearances. "I haven't run for office after office to bring myself up to speed on these issues," Mr. Estruth conceded in a debate on Tuesday night.
But with Mr. Gingrich as their target, Democrats have dispatched heavy hitters like Vice President Al Gore here to campaign, and have pumped money into the race -- all to the consternation of Mr. Campbell.
"I'm about the last Republican in California that would fit a right-wing label," Mr. Campbell, 43, said in an interview. "It's absurd. They chose the wrong target." Hopping off a stool at the close of one debate this week, he asserted, "I've got the right to be judged on my own merits."
Though he supports many of Mr. Gingrich's economic proposals, Mr. Campbell sounds closer to President Clinton -- or even to the left of him -- on most social issues: Mr. Campbell favors abortion rights and homosexual rights. He opposes school-sponsored prayer. He favors gun control and more money for the environment. He says he is the only California Republican to oppose the state's initiative to curtail services to immigrants.
"This guy is not Atilla the Hun," said Jay Marlin, Mr. Estruth's spokesman. "We'd rather run against a more conservative candidate. So if it's Jerry vs. Newt, we have a much greater chance of winning than if it's Jerry vs. Tom Campbell."
To that end, Mr. Estruth seizes on the fact that when Mr. Campbell as in the House, he backed Mr. Gingrich in his successful race for the No. 2 Republican post in 1989, which put him on the path to Speaker. And he asserts that Mr. Campbell voted with Mr. Gingrich 76 percent of the time in his second term in Congress.
Mr. Campbell insists that he would not be beholden to Mr. Gingrich, and that he would vote for "a more moderate" challenger to the Speaker if one ever took him on.
Charles F. Rund, a Republican pollster in San Francisco, said that while he expected the better-financed Mr. Campbell to prevail, Democrats could take heart because "Campbell should have won this thing in a slam dunk."
But Mr. Rund said he was concerned that making the race a national example would be damaging to both sides. "The political parties jumped into this race and they're not talking issues and they're not talking personalities," he said. "They're talking institution vs. institution. And the public is saying, 'Enough!' "
As gleeful as Democrats are that they are waging a vigorous race, Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic Party, cautions his colleagues not to rely too heavily on Mr. Gingrich.
"Using Newt as your lunch ticket for '96 would be a huge mistake," he said. "You've got to have more going for you than that. But what he's done is open up a door. For that, I owe him an eternal debt of gratitude."

HEADLINE: Growth Predictions Cut for Big Industrial Nations

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
These are nail-biting times for the Group of Seven major industrial powers as they watch their economies weaken under the double impact of faltering consumer confidence and self-imposed campaigns to curb their budget deficits.
When they last met in early October, Group of Seven finance ministers publicly congratulated themselves on the "improved outlook" for the world economy. 
 But even then, many private forecasters felt that outlook was starry-eyed. And since then, fresh evidence of weakness in the Group of Seven economies has led some economists to weigh in with even lower projections.
The latest to do so is Salomon Brothers, the New York investment bank, which yesterday issued the results of its annual year-end crystal gazing.
For the Group of Seven countries as a whole, Salomon foresees unchanged low growth at 2.2 percent this year and next with a slowdown in the United States and Europe offset by a speedup in Japan.
Over all, Salomon describes 1996 as a year of "moderate growth." But the chief economist, John Lipsky, cautions that "all the risks are on the downside."
The Japanese economy is forecast to grow by 2.1 percent next year thanks to the latest stimulus package and a weaker currency. The economy is expected to grow only a tenth of a percent this year.
Salomon sees growth slowing in the United States from 2.5 percent this year to 2.1 percent next year, a less pronounced fall than the International Monetary Fund predicted in October when it said growth would slow from 2.9 percent to 2 percent.
German growth is forecast to slip from 2.2 percent in 1995 to 2.1 percent next year although the I.M.F. had foreseen an acceleration to 2.9 percent from 2.6 percent. Similarly, Salomon thinks growth in Britain will decline to 2 percent from 2.6 percent instead of speeding up, as the I.M.F. predicted, to 2.9 percent from 2.7 percent.
France's growth rate is seen by Salomon as dropping to 2 percent from 2.7 percent, a steeper fall than the I.M.F.'s forecast of a decline to 2.7 percent from 2.9 percent. Italian growth is expected to decelerate to 2.6 percent from 3.2 percent, although the I.M.F. predicted a smaller fall, to 2.8 percent from 3 percent. And while Salomon says growth in Canada will pick up to 2.4 percent from 2.3 percent , the I.M.F. thought it would rise more steeply, to 2.7 percent from 2.2 percent.
This Group of Seven forecast assumes a steady easing in monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic next year, with the Federal Reserve lowering its key short-term interest rate to 4.5 from 4.75 percent by mid-1996, while the Bundesbank lowers German rates.
Growth in the United States hit an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the third quarter. But subsequent developments have been mixed, including a drop of five-tenths of a percent in the index of leading economic indicators for October, which was reported yesterday.
This week, the investment firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, which is owned by the Equitable Companies, predicted American growth would slow to a mere 1.3 percent next year and drop under 1 percent in the final quarter.
And problems in Europe, especially the current strikes in France and the possibility that the move toward a single currency by 1999 could falter, may hurt growth.
J. Paul Horne, Smith Barney's Paris-based economist, predicts that the current strikes and stoppages will produce a contraction of 1.3 percent in the French economy in the final quarter of this year.
In October, Germany's six leading economic institutes forecast a slowdown in German growth to 2 percent next year. And September industrial output was 2.9 percent below the level of a year earlier. British third-quarter growth was the slowest for two years.
This midyear slowdown throughout much of the industrial world partly reflects a buildup in unsold inventories reflecting over-ordering during last year's unexpectedly strong recovery. As inventories reach normal levels, merchants should start ordering again and activity will pick up.
But another factor is the generalized attack on budget deficits, with the United States committed to balancing the Federal budget in seven years, while European countries squeeze their deficits to meet criteria for monetary union.
As Mr. Lipsky says: "The good news takes time to work through. In the short run, deficit cutting depresses activity."

HEADLINE: Panel Urges Shift of Focus For School Science Courses

 BODY:
Rather than memorizing the nomenclature of plant families, the anatomy of a frog or the periodic table, long staples of school science courses, students should learn to investigate and question the workings of the natural world, a national panel of teachers and scientists recommends.
Their report, a set of guidelines known as the National Science Standards, is the latest in a series of recommendations for 11 disciplines, including history, mathematics and social studies. Most have been announced; two others, English and economics are still being written. 
 Scientists and educators have long believed that the schools have failed to teach adequately even the most basic scientific concepts and have not done enough to make science an appealing subject.
"We've managed to turn people off of science by making it some kind of rote learning exercise," said Bruce M. Alberts, chairman of the National Research Council, which coordinated the study, and president of its scientific arm, the National Academy of Sciences. "What we're talking about here would be a revolution in science education."
The guidelines, developed over the last three years teachers, scientists and school administrators, say that fourth-grade students should have a basic understanding of the properties of objects and materials, life cycles of organisms, objects in the sky and the use of science and technology in solving simple problems. By eighth grade, students should be able to model scientific inquiry and understand motions and forces, reproduction and heredity, the Earth's history and the history of science. By 12th grade, their understanding should include chemical reactions, natural resources and the nature of scientific knowledge.
Many of the same themes already appear in science curriculums being developed in about half the states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with a greater focus on the bigger ideas of science: energy, evolution, stability, change and equilibrium.
"We were doing a darn good job of training highly skilled specialists," said Eugenie C. Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education in El Cerrito, Calif. "But there were quite a series of sieves we would put people through to get that highly trained elite. And in the process, we lost most of the American public."
While the dense, 250-page document, released yesterday, offers state and local educators more philosophy than prescription, it calls for specific changes like making science a "core" course that students would take every year, starting in kindergarten, and providing all teachers with science training.
While many science teachers said they welcomed the national standards, some were doubtful that states and local districts would have the resources to implement many of the recommendations. For instance, the standards call for extensive teacher training and "more space and time" for classroom exercises.
"It's not good enough to tell people you have to do this," said Carole Greene, who heads the biology department at the Bronx High School of Science in New York. "You have to give them tools. It's not necessarily even the materials because clever teachers know how to keep things cheap. But the labs are extremely crowded and when you've got 34 kids in a 40-minute class, not everyone is going to have the opportunity to investigate and inquire."

HEADLINE: Labor Chief Asks Business For a New 'Social Compact'

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s new president, called yesterday for a new "social compact" between America's corporations and workers, saying he and the labor movement might forgo their rhetoric of confrontation if business adopted what he called a less greedy, more respectful attitude toward the people it employs.
In what was billed as a major speech, Mr. Sweeney told 400 New York business executives and civic leaders that companies were undermining the nation's prosperity by holding down wages and slashing their work forces at a time of record profits. 
 "I want to build bridges between labor and management, so that American business can be more successful and American workers can share in the gains," he said.
But while holding out an olive branch with one hand, Mr. Sweeney did a little table-pounding with the other, voicing the labor movement's frustration, even anger, with low wage increases.
"Our problem is stagnant wages -- America needs a raise," he said. "We are going to take the fight to greedy employers who have been picking our pocket."
Mr. Sweeney, speaking at the New York Hilton to the Association for a Better New York, a business-led civic group, said many American companies seemed to have dropped the practice of "raising the standards of living for working Americans, not just accumulating enormous wealth for a fortunate few."
Referring to a sit-in that low-paid janitors held on a bridge in Washington in September, he said workers were so frustrated about low wages that many felt like blocking bridges rather than building them.
Mr. Sweeney, who had been president of the Service Employees International Union, was elected president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations in October, after spearheading a drive to replace the federation's longtime president, Lane Kirkland, whom dissidents accused of doing far too little to invigorate a languishing labor movement.
Mr. Sweeney's aides say that between now and the 1996 elections, he will focus his energies and speeches on attacking the growing wage gap between the rich and the rest of the country, and on pushing government, business and unions to do more to reduce that gap.
The federation's officials say Mr. Sweeney's strategy of focusing on the wage gap has several goals: to heighten pressure on companies to be more generous in wage settlements, to cause more Americans to warm up to the labor movement and to throw laissez-faire Republicans on the defensive. At the same time, these officials privately fault President Clinton, saying he has not done nearly enough to reduce wage inequities.
"Since 1979," Mr. Sweeney said in his speech, "all of the income growth in our country has gone to the top 40 percent of households, and nearly all of that went to the top 20 percent. Well, that isn't the way America built the world's largest middle class and the world's strongest economy."
Mr. Sweeney said raising wages had become the leading political and economic issue in the country, and he predicted that next year's elections would revolve around who could offer the best ideas for creating jobs and increasing incomes.
Playing on an unofficial motto of Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign, "It's the economy, stupid," Mr. Sweeney said, "Look for smart candidates and their campaigns to hang signs in their headquarters with this slogan: 'It's wages, stupid.' "
After citing a social compact articulated by President John F. Kennedy -- "A rising tide lifts all boats" -- Mr. Sweeney noted that when Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank earlier this year announced a merger that would reduce their combined work force by 12,000, the price of their stock rose.
"Does a rising tide now sink most ships, except for the luxury yachts?" he said.
Mr. Sweeney said it was unfortunate that American business no longer followed Henry Ford's practice of paying his workers enough so that they could afford to buy the cars they built. He said car prices had risen 70 percent in the last decade, while family incomes had risen 40 percent.
"Labor's victories can be yours too," he told the business executives. "With decent paychecks, we can buy your products and services."

HEADLINE: Court Expands Its Monitoring Of the Trash-Hauling Industry

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
In the latest move to rid Long Island's garbage-hauling business of Mafia control, Federal prosecutors said yesterday that six companies with a "healthy share of the market" will come under Federal Court oversight, joining eight companies already under such supervision.
The prosecutors and a court-appointed monitor said the growing court supervision of the business on Long Island had resulted in increased competition among hauling companies in Nassau and Suffolk counties and sharp drops in the cost of commercial-trash collection. 
 In one case they cited, a Seaford diner is now paying one-third what it previously paid to have its garbage carted away. In other instances, they said, carting companies have offered prices that are half what the customer previously paid.
The addition of the six companies to the year-and-a-half-old monitoring program is the latest effort by the authorities to curb mob domination of the private garbage-hauling business in the New York region.
Last week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced plans to create a commission that would regulate and license carting companies in New York City and would have the authority to audit their records, set maximum fees and investigate and fingerprint their executives and employees. Last summer, a state grand jury brought racketeering and other charges against some of the largest garbage haulers in the city, accusing them of using violence to enforce a noncompetitive system.
In the city, private companies pick up garbage at commercial sites while the Department of Sanitation collects residential trash. On Long Island, private companies may pick up residential or commercial trash, depending on the municipality.
The Rand Corporation has estimated that the mob-enforced, competition-stifling system of allocating customers on Long Island, which the court monitoring is intended to curtail, caused businesses to pay 50 percent more for commercial collections, and residential customers 15 percent more, than they would under a competitive system.
The monitor for the Island, Michael G. Cherkasky, was appointed by Judge I. Leo Glasser of Federal District Court in Brooklyn as an outgrowth of a civil suit that Federal prosecutors brought against more than 40 companies hauling trash on Long Island. Litigation is pending to bring more than 25 additional companies under the monitoring.
Zachary W. Carter, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, identified the six companies added to the program as MCM Sanitation, Enviro Carting, Enviro Recycling, Golden Eagle Disposals, Vinnie Monte's Waste Systems and VAM Management.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Justifying Government rules and dumping the dumb ones.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
EASING Washington's regulatory burden is high on the agenda of the Republicans who control Congress. While big changes are not likely to occur until after the 1996 elections, once-settled issues ranging from the preservation of endangered species to tough inspection standards for cars are bound to receive a serious second look. And when they do, those who dare to complicate the debate with facts will have some sobering research by Robert Hahn to draw on.
In an analysis to be published next year by Oxford University Press, Mr. Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, looks closely at 92 health, safety and environmental rules issued by five Federal agencies since 1990. Only 17 of them, he finds, can be justified in the sense that the measurable benefits exceed the costs. 
 The catch, readily acknowledged by Mr. Hahn, a former official in the Bush Administration, is that it is easier to criticize the system than to fix it. Nobody has a sure-fire formula for sparing the cost-effective regulations while dumping the ones that in Mr. Hahn's words are "as dumb as stone." Nor, for that matter, is it clear that those in power really want to contain the excess: Congress has often been content to promise all things to all people, and leave it to the bureaucrats to sort out the mess.
Most Federal agencies are required to conduct "regulatory impact analyses" before issuing new rules. And while these analyses come in assorted shapes and flavors, virtually all provide enough information to compare estimated costs with benefits.
Mr. Hahn applied common methodology to the data behind five years' worth of rules from five agencies to assay their cost-efficiency. Some easily passed the test. For example, the Consumer Product Safety Commission's 1993 standard for child-resistant cigarette lighters is estimated to save lives for less than $1 million each.
But most were of dubious value. A 1990 standard set by the Environmental Protection Agency for handling benzene wastes will cost an estimated $299 million for each life saved. That is 60 times the $5 million a life that research suggests Americans are willing to pay for increased safety.
It is easy to nit-pick Mr. Hahn's conclusions: different assumptions would produce somewhat different results. And it is a bit gruesome to make the philosophical leap required to translate injury and death into finite dollar values. But there is no escaping the choice. And it is undeniable that by the Government's own numbers the cost of most new health and safety regulations far exceeds the benefits.
What's more, there is good reason to believe that Federal agencies generally inflate benefits and deflate costs. Government figures suggested that the clean air amendments of 1990 -- after taking both sides of the equation into account -- would provide a net benefit to society to the tune of $50 billion or so. But an independent assessment by Paul R. Portney, an economist at the non-partisan Resources for the Future in Washington, estimated that they would end up costing roughly $10 billion to $20 billion.
The Senate majority leader (and Presidential hopeful), Bob Dole, proposes to bring rationality to the process by requiring every major rule to pass a cost-benefit test. George Eads, an economist at Charles Rivers Associates who advised President Jimmy Carter on regulation, argues the agencies could often defeat the intent by fudging the numbers. But he says he suspects that the elaborate procedures specified in the Dole bill would "throw sand in the wheels," effectively blocking controversial new regulations for years.
This might be justified on purely pragmatic grounds. Better the train go nowhere than in the wrong direction. But it is an odd way to govern, only reinforcing the view that Washington can never do anything right.
That's why Mr. Hahn leans toward a simpler change in which agencies would be required to compare costs with benefits in systematic ways without making them binding on the rule makers. The idea is to spread the gospel of cost-benefit analysis by making the public aware that economic life inevitably consists of trade-offs. At very least, this would make it harder for Washington to take credit for making omelets without acknowledging the need to break a lot of expensive eggs.
Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, adds that people would be less hostile to the principle if benefits were cast in terms of "reduced risk of injury or death -- not whether little Sally Jones next door will live to attend her high school prom." Once life is personalized, even the prophets of Adam Smith have trouble deciding which ones are not worth saving.
Democracies are unlikely to come up with a one-size-fits-all formula for regulating spotted owls and tailpipe gases. Surely it would be a step in the right direction, though, to get the notion of economic limits on the table. The Government simply cannot do everything people might like to make life better for Americans -- and what it does do almost always has a cost.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Farewell, Red Ink

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
Paris is paralyzed by a strike of workers determined to keep the lavish benefits of France's anachronistic welfare state.
We cannot mock; Washington D.C. commuters were blocked on their way to work this week by "Sweeney's garbagemen," militant A.F.L.-C.I.O. unionists resisting overdue cuts of waste in waste management. 
 Will France stem the tide of red ink that has reached 5 percent of its domestic product? If the U.S. ran such a rate of deficit, we would be borrowing over a half-trillion dollars a year. That way lies national bankruptcy and political upheaval.
Though not in such dire straits as unemployment-ridden France, the U.S. has made the right decision about moving toward balance. We realize that the percentage of our budget paying interest on debt has doubled in the past generation, and -- if President Clinton's original budget went forward -- the interest slice would be on the primrose path to redoubling.
That would mean saddling everybody under 40 today with huge taxes and reduced services tomorrow to pay for our profligacy. Never in history have the young put up with such pocket-picking by the old.
With every year in deficit, future discretionary spending is snatched away. In France, students joining workers on the red-ink ramparts are throwing away their chances as grown-ups; and polls here show most young Americans, their heads in computers, also to be a little slow on the upload.
The under-40 set's inability to see and speak up for its self-interest (justifiable in tots but surprising in thirtysomethings) has given President Clinton license to engage in "Mediscare." This is his shamelessly demagogic campaign to frighten older Americans into thinking that deficit reduction might soon leave them destitute in the snow, and to bamboozle them with pie in the medical sky.
Yesterday came his promised veto of the Republican opening plan; today comes a Clinton counterproposal and negotiation begins. Here's what is likely to happen:
Clinton will continue his poll-directed lurch to the left for at least another month, professing to protect the old folks -- and the poor's Medicaid entitlement -- from those mean, seven-year budget-balancers.
Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office will rosify its projections to come nearer White House optimism. The gap between Clinton and the G.O.P. will be narrowed further by a rejiggering of the Consumer Price Index, which -- don't say this out loud -- in effect reduces the increase in Social Security benefits and also raises income taxes.
The "give" on both sides will be not so much on spending as on taxing. Republicans will come down from their $245 billion cut, and Clinton -- whose $100 billion straddle offends everybody -- will at first take refuge behind the conservative Democratic "Blue Dog Coalition," which will become a media favorite because it calls for no tax cut at all.
In the end, the tax package will probably be: a capital gains cut but not retroactive; a reduction in the G.O.P. child deduction; restoration of the earned income tax credit; plus a token Clintonesque education credit. Total tax reduction: about $170 billion, back-end-loaded, small enough to make the seven-year ball balance on the Presidential seal's nose in time for next month's State of the Union address.
A nagging thought intrudes: How close are any of these varied projections to reality? What if recession strikes or inflation re-ignites or the standard forecast is cockeyed? Aren't we haggling over figures that are imaginary, and subject to change by the economy or the next Congress?
Yes, but. The actual numbers mean little; the direction they represent means much. The Republican impetus toward balance is needed for continued prosperity. The grudging Democratic agreement to end deficit spending -- but to attain it by continuing high taxation rather than substantially reducing the spending growth rate -- clings to liberal philosophy, making compromise easier.
What should America learn from France's budget anguish? In Paris, the Bourse is shaky because the political will is uncertain. In the U.S., investors know that impending budget balance will lower interest rates, and confidence in that has boosted stocks and bonds. Listen to the markets.

HEADLINE: Casinos Are No Solution

BYLINE: By David R. Johnson; David R. Johnson is professor of urban history at the University of Texas in San Antonio.

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO

 BODY:
New York's mayors seem unable to resist casinos. In the 1860's, Fernando Wood consorted with John Morrissey, the city's premier gambler, at Morrissey's posh illegal gambling hall on West 24th Street. Jimmy Walker liked to conduct city business from the elegant Central Park Casino in the 1920's.
In the glory days of the early 20th century, "entrepreneurs" like Richard Canfield and Arnold Rothstein made the city a mecca for high rollers without worrying about whether gambling was a public good. Now, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is weighing whether gambling, in the form of a proposal for floating casinos that sail out of Staten Island to international waters, can be a civic virtue, the fertilizer for economic development. But if there are any lessons from the colorful characters of the past, it is to keep an eye on the bottom line. 
 The prospect of attracting gambling tourists and siphoning their dollars into the city's coffers while creating jobs by building an "entertainment village" on Staten Island has only a superficial attractiveness.
Casinos, whether afloat or on land, have usually generated local prosperity only when nothing else can. Las Vegas owes its spectacular success to the desperation of local businessmen seeking to stave off economic ruin for their isolated and unattractive city. When Atlantic City slid into a deep decline as a resort, gambling was brought in to rescue it. Biloxi, Miss., with its health-spa business long dead, has found temporary relief in riverboat casinos. A few Indian tribes, surviving on reservations that generated little income, have amassed riches beyond their wildest expectations.
But New York is neither a desolate desert outpost nor a dying city. It is difficult to know if gambling might benefit the city because there has been no systematic study of its effects on local economies. That has not stopped the gambling industry from peddling sugarplum visions. Politicians hungry to increase revenues without raising taxes make gullible audiences.
But not all forms of gambling are equally popular or profitable. State lotteries have made money. But, as last month's collapse of a plan to build a huge casino in New Orleans shows, there are limits to this part of the business, even in a city famous for its love of a good time.
At its heart, the floating-casino idea makes little economic sense. The city's lawyers, apparently wishing to avoid conflict with the state law against the possession of "gambling devices," seem to think the casinos would be legal so long as they did not have slots. But slot machines are the heart and soul of a profitable casino. The house's take on slots is enormous and helps compensate for the much narrower odds in poker and blackjack. Where will the big bucks come from -- a gaming tax?
The logistics also seem iffy. Tourists like easy access to entertainment. A ferry ride to Staten Island, the wait to lift anchor and the 45-minute sail into international waters probably would not deter a determined bettor, but the casual bettor -- the one who likes to pop into an Off-Track Betting parlor -- might find it a waste of time.
Mayor Fiorello La Guardia considered slot machines immoral and made a public display of destroying them. Mayor Giuliani has said he has no moral objection to gambling. That's his judgment. But economically, the plan for seagoing casinos seems neither a good business prospect nor a wise exercise in political leadership. Mayor Giuliani should emulate La Guardia and find more productive ways to invest in the city's future.

HEADLINE: Bilingual Education Should Be Goal for All

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Representative Peter T. King's Dec. 5 letter rests on a flawed premise. He implies that mastery of a second language is comparable to an unearned handout, to laziness and sloth. 
 To compare bilingual education to a (Republican) vision of welfare makes no sense.
I have worked as a writer-in-residence at a number of elementary schools in Houston. Students in bilingual classes have taught me a great deal of Spanish while I taught them creative writing.
They are industrious and eager to learn, in spite of the enormous distractions caused by frequently difficult home lives.
By the end of the year, under their teacher's instruction, their English has improved dramatically.
For bilingual education to work, of course, its teachers must be competent.
I am in residence at the Rice School-La Escuela Rise, a K-8 laboratory school created under the auspices of the Houston Independent School District and Rice University.
Part of its mission statement is that every student shall be bilingual, in both English and Spanish, because every student "deserves" mastery of two languages in a global economy.
As the students from many backgrounds in the school learn Spanish, while studying content areas in English, nobody worries that they will be victims of a "separate and unequal society."
I am also astonished at Representative King's naive idea that countries cannot function effectively with more than one official language.
Poor Switzerland! If only the Swiss would come to their senses and speak just English. Maybe their trains would run on time and maybe we could finally count on their banks.

Report by Fed Helps Derail Bond Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve report showing wage pressures helped derail a strong bond rally yesterday, erasing much of the day's price gains.
Earlier, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose as much as 11/32 , pushing the yield below the psychologically important level of 6 percent, to 5.97 percent. Prices and yields move in opposite directions. 
 But bond prices later retreated, settling up 5/32 , to 11121/32 to yield 6.03 percent, down from 6.04 percent on Tuesday.
The early buying was prompted by a Commerce Department report that showed the index of leading economic indicators had fallen by half a percentage point in October. The decline was sharper than economists had expected and was the seventh drop in the last nine months. The data heightened the market's anticipation of a cut in short-term interest rates by the Fed on Dec. 19, when its policy-making committee meets.
"While the accuracy of this index has been questionable at times," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, "its noticeable weaknesss of late should not be ignored, as it seems to be suggesting that the slowdown in economic growth currently taking place in the fourth quarter is likely to extend into 1996 as well."
As a result, Mr. Fine said that he expected the Fed would cut rates on Dec. 19, and that another rate cut was possible in early 1996.
"To a large extent, it is for precisely these reasons that the bond market has rallied."
The early buying was bolstered by coupon purchases by the Fed and rumors that large hedge funds were in the market to buy.
Even surprisingly strong numbers for construction spending in October failed to halt the market's momentum.
The rally lost steam, however, in the early afternoon after the Federal Reserve's report on regional business conditions, known as the beige book, showed tight labor markets and increasing wage pressures in a number of Fed districts.
The beige book, noted Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, is "a big-ticket item for Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan."
" If he needs a reason not to ease, you can be sure that one will get a mention or two during the Dec. 19 meeting," Mr. Burtnick said.
Trading in the March bond contract on the Chicago Board of Trade once again set a contract high, this one at 12112/32 , with a low price of 1203/32 . The contract closed near the lower end of the range.
"The day before yesterday people were saying the market looked tired," said Robin Mesch, chief fixed- income analyst at Thomson Research. "Yesterday they slammed on the brakes. "All this talk of where the top is going to be is the wrong orientation. Good resistance levels are going to have their day in court, but what should be monitored in an uptrend market is the support level, and those continue to hold firmly."

Rallies in U.S. Stocks and Bonds Help to Fuel Gains by the Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday as Wall Street stocks and bonds pushed to fresh highs and the European currencies regained strength against the German mark.
 "The mark gave back a lot of ground against the lira, franc and yen," said Steven Jury, chief dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland. "The result was that the dollar was able to pop up." 
 Strikes and political turmoil rocked France, but French stocks jumped after the Government pledged to press ahead with austerity measures. The Government also indicated that no concessions would be offered to labor unions.
The French franc also rallied on rumors, which were later denied, that the French and German Governments planned to peg their currencies together at a summit meeting today.
The Italian lira gained on prospects that foreign investors, particularly in the United States and Japan, would take renewed interest in Italian debt because a budget amendment eliminated a 12.5 percent withholding tax on nonresidents.
In late New York trading, the dollar surged to 1.1435 marks, from 1.4338 marks on Tuesday, and to 101.37 Japanese yen, from 101.26 yen. The British pound slipped to $1.5425 from $1.5430.
The dollar was also supported by expectations that the German central bank, the Bundesbank, would lower German interest rates in coming months.
"The increasing sentiment for lower rates in Germany and the movement up in the lira is weighing on the mark, which is basically helping the dollar," Seth Cohen, director in foreign exchange sales at Merrill Lynch & Company, said.
Strong gains in American markets bolstered the dollar. The Dow Jones industrial average broke across 5,200-point level for the first time during the session and closed at 5,199.13, its 68th record high close this year. United States bonds also rallied before giving up much of their gains in the afternoon.
"You can't ignore the fact that the bonds have been able to rally in quite a spectacular fashion over the past few days," Mr. Jury of Union Bank said.
Currency traders also said the dollar recovered yesterday because the market failed to push it below key technical trading levels on Tuesday, opening the door to a test higher.
The dollar's strong showing was exacerbated by thin trading conditions nearing the end of the year.

HEADLINE: With Unions Adding Drama, the Season Is On at La Scala

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MILAN, Dec. 6

 BODY:
When La Scala, the grande dame of Italian opera houses, opens its season on Thursday with a gala performance of "The Magic Flute," the sigh of relief from both audience and cast will be almost as loud as the first notes of Mozart's overture.
Until a few days ago, there was a risk that La Scala's traditional St. Ambrose Day opening -- the crowning event of Italy's cultural calendar -- would fall victim to a strike, a tradition that in recent months has become part of the opera's repertory. 
 Union bluffs are as Italian as opera buffa, but twice this year, La Scala's various unions actually made good on threats to stop the show. In June, when the orchestra went on strike moments before a performance of "La Traviata," Riccardo Muti, the conductor at La Scala, went to the piano and in a grand geste worthy of Verdi provided the accompaniment himself.
In October, not even Mr. Muti could salvage six days of scheduled performances of "Lucia di Lammermoor," which were canceled because of the labor dispute. The dispute ended over the weekend with what both sides called a "hypothesis of an accord," which for the moment has put to rest a backlog of labor issues that have dogged La Scala since 1991, when its local union contracts expired.
But the problems witnessed at La Scala run deep and spread across the length of the Italian peninsula to the 11 other full-fledged opera houses that, together with Rome's Orchestra di Santa Cecilia, are subsidized by the Italian Government at an annual cost of around $281 million. While no one argues that the state should stop supporting opera, many now realize that its track record as manager has been dismal and believe that its role should be reduced.
Even Mr. Muti, who usually maintains a discreet distance from La Scala's tangled internal affairs, has few kind words to say about the way the Italian Government treats opera. At the announcement in August of La Scala's 1995-96 season, he admitted that he found working in Italy increasingly difficult.
"After 20 years abroad, when I decided to come back here I felt that it would be a gamble, difficult but do-able," he said. "But now I say that all of us involved with culture in Italy are in serious danger."
Frustrations about the mismanagement of opera in Italy have this year led to a new proposal, now included in the 1996 national budget, to "privatize" opera in effect through the creation of autonomous private foundations described here as "quasi-American." The idea is to encourage private donors to support opera by offering them healthy tax breaks on their contributions, and to allow the opera houses to run themselves as independent entities free of the constrictions of public-employee labor contracts.
"In Italy we must now make an attempt to rationalize the management of the opera houses, to keep the costs within limits, and at the same time try and involve the public to participate in the costs," said Prof. Mario D'Addio, an Under Secretary at the Ministry of Culture.
The budget amendment calls for a new law to be adopted by June that will lay out in greater detail how the new foundations will operate and what kind of tax breaks will be given to opera's private patrons.
La Scala is one of the few opera houses in Italy to have successfully experimented with private sponsorship. The Foundation for the Theater of La Scala, created in 1991, raised $1.625 million in private donations last year, amounting to about 2 percent of the opera's 1994 budget of $83 million. The foundation's president, Jean Rodocanachi, predicts that with significant tax reductions, that amount could grow to $16 million.
La Scala has traditionally enjoyed healthy box-office receipts, bolstered by its reputation for top-quality performances and productions that aim for painstaking excellence. For "The Magic Flute," for example, Mr. Muti had a glockenspiel specially made to Mozart's specifications. The theater's own workshops produce all the sets and costumes, down to the shoes, for the three or four new productions that La Scala usually puts on each year.
Even though La Scala receives first-class treatment by the Government (that is to say, a disprportionate share of state subsidies in recognition of its international reputation), it, too, has been forced to economize. Belt-tightening measures were brought home two years ago by a Government-ordered hiring freeze that has left 108 of La Scala's 812 employees working without a permanent contract. That was a major issue in the recent labor dispute. Currently, eight orchestra members are in so-called temporary positions, a situation that some say could lead top-notch musicians to refuse positions at La Scala for more secure jobs elsewhere.
But the Government's latest proposal, coming after several years of reduced subsidies, has raised fears among management and unions alike that officials are looking to private contributors as a way of shirking the Government's own commitment to opera.
"One of the unions' principal worries is that the state will stop funding us, but that is one of our worries as well," said Maria Di Freda, director of personnel at La Scala. "We agree to having other resources made available, but we don't want the state extracting itself from its role in years to come. Everything is up in the air and until we have certainty, the unions' preoccupation is justified."
A big frustration at La Scala and other opera houses in Italy derives from civil service laws that continue to treat musicians and stagehands on a par with postal workers. Some of these regulations benefit the unions; for instance, ballerinas at La Scala are kept on the payroll until the age of 46, long after the usual retirement age for ballerinas in other countries. But others, like a law forbidding musicians to hold part-time teaching jobs, are widely regarded as obstacles to sensible management.
There are also fears that when more stringent budget mechanisms come into place, artistic considerations -- some might say artistic license -- will be forced aside as managers take an increasingly cold look at the bottom line.
"Italian opera is famous for more than the music," said Sergio Leonardi, a union representative and set mover at La Scala. "Our sets are different from those of the rest of the world and that is why they cost more. Our style of work is old-fashioned, but this care naturally makes for higher quality. In the rest of the world, stages are increasingly electronic, but here everything is still made by hand."
The Italian Government, facing pressure at home and abroad to bring its overall budget deficit under control, is wary of tackling cultural shrines like La Scala. But Government critics, themselves opera lovers, argue that Italy's opera houses still have ways of cutting costs without sacrificing artistic excellence.
"The real problems are of management, of professional capability and personnel," said Professor D'Addio, who estimated that of the 6,000 people working in Italy's 12 opera houses and in the Santa Cecilia orchestra in Rome, probably only 4,000 were really necessary. "Opera is one of the great glories of Italy," he said, "and that is why these problems have not been addressed until now."

HEADLINE: Museums Share More Art to Save Money

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Distinguished youngish medium-size museum in the hinterlands with lots of wall space and ambition to match seeks like-minded partner(s) for art-to-art sharing relationship. Photo a must. (Of the art.)
If it hasn't quite come to this in the once-starchy precincts of American museums, such appeals may not be all that farfetched, not when tough economic times in the arts are making for interesting new institutional bedfellows. With government contributions down and private and foundation giving stretched increasingly thin, museums around the country are seeking ways to cut costs and maximize resources. 
 Sharing art collections is one idea whose time seems to have come. Not just famous museums digging into their storage vaults to lend art to smaller institutions, often for a fee, but museums of like size lending to each other and collaborating on traveling shows by dividing the work and expenses. While lending art is nothing new, museum professionals say, the growing formalization of the process is.
There is, in fact, already a kind of "personals" column for museums looking for partners: the Collections Exchange Newsletter, published by the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art at the University of Florida in Gainesville. The latest semiannual issue lists 110 exhibitions that can be borrowed free from 32 museums from Canada to Mexico.
"The smarter we get, the greater the likelihood that we'll live," said Ellen Harris, director of the Montclair Art Museum in Montclair, N.J., which has joined nine museums of similar size in the Northeast in a consortium to circulate exhibitions of American art from their collections.
The signs of such matchmaking are widespread.
In a major initiative in October, two leading charities, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts, announced the creation of the Museum Loan Network, to be administered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. At least 100 museums have sought information on the program, which is to compile a vast database of artworks available for loans of several years to fill gaps in significant collections.
At the same time, five museums, in Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City, Mo., and Toledo, Ohio, pooled works for their second joint show in five years, "One Thousand Years of American Art." It is wending its way to each museum.
The 10 members of the consortium assembled last January by the Montclair Art Museum do not combine their collections for shows but coordinate efforts to exhibit each other's shows. One recent show in Montclair, "Affinities and Influences: Native American Art and American Modernism," is booked next year at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, L.I., and the Currier Gallery of Art in Manchester, N.H.
Although the approaches vary, the motivation is often the same: a desperation to conserve money while cuts in government aid and slower growth in foundation giving are sending a chill through many arts organizations. In many cases the new fiscal realities are prompting museums to focus more on their own collections for special exhibitions.
According to the latest figures by the Foundation Center, a research organization, art and cultural groups captured a steady 13 to 15 percent of all foundation grant money over the last decade -- an estimated $1.36 billion in 1992, for example -- but the share given to museums has fallen sharply. The trend is also toward larger grants to fewer recipients.
Many of the survival strategies were discussed in New York City last month at a forum of museum directors sponsored by the American Federation of Arts, a museum service association founded in 1909 to funnel art to "the hinterlands."
One speaker, Saralyn Reece Hardy, director of the Salina Art Center in Salina, Kan., urged her fellow directors to view their museum walls as "permeable boundaries" allowing easy give and take -- and cost-sharing -- with the community. "Take a cue from the natural world," she said, urging museums to join forces with other community institutions. "Think of yourselves as part of the cultural ecology."
For example, she said, the art center is collaborating with the Land Institute, an environmental park, on a school study unit built around the ancient elements -- earth, air, fire and water -- to teach pupils about art and nature.
James Cuno, director of the Harvard University Art Museums, argued for a better division of labor among smaller museums. Be a university collection or a community art institute or a public exhibition space, he said, but don't try to be all three.
Collection-sharing came up repeatedly. Generally, experts say, only 5 percent of a museum's collection is on display at a time; the rest is locked away. If more of it could circulate, the sending museum could save storage space and perhaps earn loan fees, while the receiving institution could assemble exhibitions drawing many people at little cost.
At the Montclair museum, founded in 1914, for example, the vaults contain the vast bulk of the 11,000-piece collection, including paintings by John Singer Sargent, John Singleton Copley, George Inness, and Elaine de Kooning, and Native American dolls, beadwork and woven baskets, some no bigger than a pinhead.
Its consortium began modestly a year ago. "People glommed on to a show I was about to do," said Ms. Harris, the director, a former deputy director of the Museum of Modern Art. "Responses revealed far greater enthusiasm and more exhibition options than expected." The Montclair museum acts as a clearinghouse, and the members elected not to charge each other loan fees and to skip formal catalogues.
"It makes sense on many levels," Ms. Harris said. "I get my collection to a broader audience. I stand to get great works. Our name gets out and everybody wins." The other members are the Albany Institute of History and Art, the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., the Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute Museum of Art in Utica, N.Y., the Neuberger Museum of Art at the State University College in Purchase, N.Y., the Hudson River Museum of Westchester in Yonkers, N.Y., the Museum of American Art of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Williams College Museum of Art in Williamstown, Mass.
The pioneers of the consortium approach were mostly in the Midwest: the Toledo Museum of Art, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the St. Louis Art Museum, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City and the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. They grouped in 1985 to plan a joint show on Impressionism. The exhibition, based on works contributed by all, circulated among the members in 1989 and 1990. No fees were charged and members shared the administrative, education and publicity duties.
"One of the basic realities of the art world is that big shows tend to be East Coast, West Coast, and if they make a stop in the Midwest, it tends to be in Chicago," said David Steadman, director of the Toledo Museum of Art. The consortium sought to buck that trend, he said, providing shows "of real solidity just from our own collections."
Increasingly, however, museums are also using their collections to raise money, charging for loans of art, said Serena Rattazzi, director of the American Federation of Arts. "The first time we heard this, we said, 'Oh my God, what are we coming to?' " she recalled. But now, she said, charging for the loan of even a single piece is commonplace and accepted.
With the growth of the sharing movement, a newsletter was all but inevitable. The Harn Museum in Gainesville began publishing a free one in April 1994. It listed 19 shows from 8 museums and was dedicated to "reducing the disparity of the haves and have-nots," said Budd Harris Bishop, the museum's director. A second issue came out that fall and two more this year. "It's grown by leaps and bounds," said Dixie Neilson, the editor.
The latest issue's 110 listings include the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Monterrey, Mexico, and shows ranging from "Star-Struck: Images from Hollywood's Golden Age," an exhibition of vintage photographs from the Columbus Museum in Georgia, to "Recent Czech and Slovak Printmaking" from the Harn Museum.
Beyond one-stop shopping for art shows, Mr. Bishop said, the newsletter "eliminated the need for personal relationships" as a condition of museum loans. "What we are trying to do," he said, "is establish an open exchange."
The initiative of the Knight Foundation and Pew Trusts is yet something else. With a start-up grant of $770,000 for the first year, the charities are establishing a network to track artworks available for long-term loan, perhaps two years. The first 15 or 20 grants are to be awarded in February.
"If a borrower in, say Oklahoma, wants to borrow from the Met, they agree on the objects and the costs, and we pay for all that," said Lori Gross, the director of the loan network, who has held museum posts in Montreal and Madrid.
"We'll be creating a directory of available works, but borrowings are not limited to what's in the directory," she said. She said the sponsoring foundations were committed to the experiment for at least two years "and there's no reason to think they won't go beyond that."
If collaborations are the wave of the future, as Barbara Van Vleet, a spokesman for the Toledo Museum, said, they are hardly a panacea for a budget-troubled museum industry.
"It's just one show out of 15," said Ms. Harris of the Montclair museum, referring to the consortium's show on Native American Art. "It's not going to solve the problem."

HEADLINE: James Reston, a Giant of Journalism, Dies at 86

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
James Reston, former columnist, Washington correspondent and executive editor of The New York Times, died tonight at his home here. He was 86.
The cause was cancer, said his son Thomas. 
 First as a reporter and then, beginning in 1953, as a columnist, Mr. Reston was perhaps the most influential journalist of his generation. In Washington, where he was based, and also in other capitals around the world, he had unrivaled access to the high and the mighty. Yet he retained a wry, self-deprecating personality, free of bombast, and always sought to reduce political complexity to plain language.
"What I try to do," he said, "is write a letter to a friend who doesn't have time to find out all the goofy things that go on in Washington."
Interested in China and the Soviet Union as well as the United States, a student of diplomacy as well as domestic politics, he won two Pulitzer Prizes and dozens of other awards.
Mr. Reston was forgiving of the frailties of soldiers, statesmen and party hacks -- too forgiving, some of his critics later said, because he was too close to them. But his stern moral standards, rooted in the Victorian values of his youth, never wavered. He remained an idealist in a world of cynics.
From his strong-minded mother he inherited a Presbyterian conscience and an abiding sense of duty and responsibility. Work hard, he was taught. Work for large goals that transcend self-interest. Be cooperative. Be modest.
A talent scout of prodigious capacity, Mr. Reston hired and trained many of The Times's best-known journalists, and served as mentor to many more. To each of them, he passed along a lifetime's lessons about craft and country.
Mr. Reston's 50-year association with The Times began when he joined its London bureau on Sept. 1, 1939, the day Hitler's armies marched into Poland, igniting World War II. It was a fitting day on which to start his career at the paper, much of which would be spent recording and reflecting upon the aftermath of that fateful day.
His nationally syndicated column appeared regularly until 1987, when he became senior columnist. He retired from The Times in 1989, without ceremony, on his 80th birthday.
In an interview marking the occasion, he said the two greatest political triumphs in his lifetime had been the common defense system developed by the West after World War II and the improvement in the lot of black people in America since 1960.
Mr. Reston, who was born in Scotland, described the men who met in Philadelphia in 1787 to draft the Constitution as the great heroes in his adopted country's history. The document that they produced, he said, made possible "the triumph of the moderates" over the next two centuries.
A moderate himself, hostile to both fascism and communism, he described journalism's role in their eclipse as "one of the great pleasures of my life."
Asked whom he had most admired, he cited Franklin D. Roosevelt as the finest President he had known and Dean Acheson, Secretary of State in the Truman Administration, as "the key man" who "came to the fork in the road" and concluded that containing the Soviet Union would require a new alliance.
But he chose Jean Monnet, the French visionary who conceived the European Community, as the greatest man he had ever known as well as the person who had most deeply influenced his own thinking. Monnet proved, Mr. Reston often said, that "if you don't demand credit for things, you can push them through."
Mr. Reston thought of himself primarily as a reporter, and he often beat his competitors to be the first to write about major news events. His coverage of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington in 1944, which laid the groundwork for the United Nations, was one of the era's most important exclusives and won him his first Pulitzer, in 1945. Those articles disclosed the substance of secret documents that were then being circulated among delegations from the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China on the structure of the proposed international organization.
Mr. Reston won his second Pulitzer in 1957 for distinguished reporting from Washington. The articles cited were written in June 1956 and analyzed the effects of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's illness on the functioning of the executive branch.
He was also responsible for The Times's publication in 1955 of the documents of the 1945 Yalta Conference. And in 1954 he disclosed that J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had directed the making of the first atomic bomb, had subsequently been denied access to secret documents by the Atomic Energy Commission because of suspicion that he was passing information to the Soviet Union, a charge of which Oppenheimer was later cleared.
One exclusive dispatch came by accident. In 1971, as one of the first American reporters allowed into China, Mr. Reston developed appendicitis. His report, filed from his bed in the Anti-Imperialist Hospital in the capital, ran on the front page under the headline "Now, About My Operation in Peking."
 
'My Own Opinions Aren't That Good'
From the 1950's on, Mr. Reston interviewed most of the world's leaders, often producing major news accounts that were scrutinized at the State Department for their every nuance. The interviews often bore the special Reston stamp: He sought to reveal not only the policies and the politics of the people he interviewed, but also their vision of life and their view of history.
Mr. Reston, who was called Scotty by virtually everyone who knew him, was 5 feet 8 inches tall and had a round and ruddy face, gray-green eyes, an ever-present pipe and an invariably pleasant manner. He was courteous not only to high-level officials but also to the young people who worked for him.
"He believes in hard work, in thrift, honor your parents, woman's place is in the home, play by the rules and live clean," his colleague Russell Baker once said.
Mr. Reston was credited by competitors with having more high-level news sources in Washington than almost any other reporter, although some critics felt that he was too kind in print to some of them. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith, reviewing Mr. Reston's "The Artillery of the Press," a 1967 collection of his talks before the Council on Foreign Relations, suggested that Mr. Reston had learned to his disadvantage "to treat all people in the manner of a newspaperman who must one day go back and see them again."
But in a 1980 article in The New Republic, Mr. Reston was quoted as saying: "If you spend your life as a hatchet man -- and there's something to be said for that -- then eventually you find that everybody's out to lunch when you call. You're left with only your own opinion. I wouldn't like that because my own opinions aren't that good."
Writing his column three times a week, Mr. Reston was a procrastinator, often filing right on deadline, to the dismay of night editors at The Times. A two-finger typist, he regularly wore out typewriters because he banged so hard on the keys, and his desk was a litter of papers, many of which bore tiny black marks where a stream of smoldering matches had landed in the course of a never-ending pipe-lighting ritual.
His columns, laced with quotations from Walter Lippmann, H. G. Wells, Matthew Arnold and Churchill, were a combination of high moral tone, detailed reporting, allusions to sports, impish humor and evocative descriptions of seasonal changes along the Potomac. They seldom offered absolute judgments about people or events; he used the word "maybe" more than most pundits.
His first column, on Oct. 18, 1953, established the Reston style.
"This town is still full of echoes from the days of America's isolation," he wrote of Washington. "It has changed in policy and personnel, more than any other world capital in the last generation. No nation has taken on so much or moved so far in such a hurry. Yet the habits of the past, like the bent figures of homeless former senators, still haunt the capital."
 
Press and Politics: 'Like Cats and Dogs'
He often returned to certain themes, such as the role of the press. In his column of Oct. 30, 1968, when Spiro T. Agnew, soon to be elected Vice President, was denouncing news organizations, Mr. Reston wrote:
"The candidates and the press are fussing at each other again, and this is the way it should be. They have different jobs, and in many ways they are natural enemies, like cats and dogs. The first job of the candidate is to win, and he usually says what he thinks will help him win. The job of the reporter is to report what happens and decontaminate as much of the political poison as he can. The conflict is obvious."
In addition to his two Pulitzer Prizes, Mr. Reston was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1986 and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Award in 1991. He received the Overseas Press Club award for interpretation of international news three times, the George Polk Memorial Award for national reporting and the French Legion of Honor, and was named Commander, Order of the British Empire. He also received 28 honorary degrees.
After retiring, he fulfilled a longtime promise to his wife, Sally, by writing his memoirs. Titled "Deadline," they were published by Random House in 1991.
Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Ronald Steel, author of "Walter Lippmann and the American Century," called Mr. Reston "the quintessential Washington insider."
"Officials used him to test out new ideas on the public or to drop leaks for which they did not want to be held accountable," Mr. Steel wrote. "Because of his high position at The Times and his personal integrity, he was trusted both by those who provided the news and by those who read it.
"But what he did so well and so usefully for so long could not be done today. Journalism and the political world have changed too much."
 
Born in Scotland To Years of Poverty
James Barrett Reston began life about as far from the Washington power center as one could get.
He was born in Clydebank, Scotland, on Nov. 3, 1909, the son of James, a machinist, and Johanna Irving Reston. The Restons migrated to the United States when he was an infant, but Mrs. Reston became ill, and the family returned to Scotland.
There followed years of harsh poverty, of life in a brick tenement where young James and his sister slept crosswise at the foot of their parents' bed. In 1920 the family returned to the United States and settled in Dayton, Ohio. His father worked for the Delco Remy Division of General Motors.
When his parents were naturalized, young James automatically became an American citizen. In 1932, he graduated from the University of Illinois with an undistinguished academic record. He had majored in journalism, skipping the course in governmental reporting but getting an A in sportswriting.
During his high school years he caddied at the Dayton Country Club golf course. His own game became so good that he twice won the Ohio state public links championship and at Illinois was captain of the Big Ten championship golf team in 1932. His father wanted him to become a golf pro. His mother wanted him to be a preacher, which, he was to say later, is really what he became.
In the winters during his school days, he hung around The Dayton Daily News. "When the phone rang, I'd pick it up and take down the scores," he later recalled. "And from that I just moved into newspapering. I never thought of anything else."
 
From the Cincinnati Reds To the London Blitz
Another link to the world of newspapers was Gov. James M. Cox, the Ohio publisher and 1920 Democratic Presidential candidate, for whom young Reston had caddied. Mr. Cox gave him his first job after college on one of the Cox newspapers in Ohio, The Springfield Daily News, where he earned $10 a week as the sports editor.
Later he was hired as traveling secretary and publicity director for the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. In 1934 he moved to New York as a sportswriter for the Associated Press Feature Service.
The next year he married Sally Jane Fulton, a former college classmate who had been president of her sorority, an A student and a Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year. Named Sara but always called Sally, she was the daughter of a judge from Sycamore, Ill., a small town near Chicago.
Mr. Reston once told a University of Illinois graduating class, "I should say in passing that I myself married a recklessly beautiful girl whom I first saw on Wright Street wearing a scarlet coat."
"My Gal Sal," as he called her in the dedication of "Sketches in the Sand," a collection of his columns published in 1967, became his closest confidante, frequent collaborator and steadiest supporter.
They had three sons, Richard, James Jr. and Thomas. Mr. Reston's own happy situation made him a champion of marriage, and he was forever asking his young bachelor colleagues when they were going to wed.
In 1937 The Associated Press sent Mr. Reston to London on a rather loose dual assignment: in summer covering sports events, in winter the British Foreign Office.
In 1939 he joined The Times and became low man on the totem pole in the London bureau, with a salary of $85 a week. He was so little known on the foreign desk in New York that his first byline in The Times had his name wrong -- John instead of James.
Then came the London blitz. The Times's office for much of the war was on the seventh floor of the Reuters Building on Fleet Street, which offered a view of the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. He described this view of the battle in his first book, "Prelude to Victory."
"Before we got better sense, we used to put the lights off in the Times office every night and watch this effort," he wrote. "With uncanny regularity, the German bombers would come over just about 10 minutes after blackout and start dropping incendiary bombs all over this section. About an hour before we could see the flames, we would begin to hear the steady throb of scores of engines along the banks of the Thames; these were the pumps, driving the muddy water from the river up through miles of new hose. . . .
"A little later the sky would begin to change in color from midnight blue to a reddish glow, and soon the great dome of the cathedral would stand out in silhouette against the flames of perhaps a dozen raging fires. Night after night we watched this incredible scene, and morning after morning we marveled at the fact that the fires were somehow put out."
In December 1940 he was reassigned to Washington, and in 1942 published "Prelude to Victory," a call to action to the American people that was acclaimed here and abroad. Its theme was pure Reston: Unless Americans put aside personal aims and materialistic thinking and made sacrifices in a crusade for their country, the war would not be won.
In late 1942, Elmer Davis, head of the Office of War Information, obtained a leave of absence from The Times for Mr. Reston and sent him to London to set up the agency's effort there.
John G. Winant, the United States Ambassador to Britain, recommended him to Arthur Hays Sulzberger, then president and publisher of The Times, who was looking for an assistant. It was the beginning of Mr. Reston's close friendship with the Sulzberger family.
 
After the War Years, Washington for Good
Mr. Reston returned to Washington and was named national correspondent in 1945. He made his mark with his coverage of Dumbarton Oaks, which illustrated a Reston maxim: Seek out the disgruntled party. His theory was that people who were disenchanted were more likely to talk candidly.
In this case, it was the Chinese representatives to the conference who were disenchanted. In his memoirs, Mr. Reston told of having met Chen Yi, one of the Chinese delegates, some years before the war through Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, wife of The Times's publisher. At Mr. Reston's urging, Chen Yi slipped him the complete texts of the proposals.
Instead of writing one long article, Mr. Reston doled out the information, producing an exclusive a day. The Russians thought Washington had leaked the material; Washington suspected the British, and the F.B.I. started an investigation of Mr. Reston.
In 1948 Mr. Reston became diplomatic correspondent for The Times, and in 1953 he became Washington bureau chief, succeeding Arthur Krock.
Mr. Reston continued as bureau chief until 1964, when he voluntarily relinquished the post to concentrate on his column.
In 1968 he was summoned to New York by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who had become publisher, to succeed Turner Catledge as executive editor, in charge of the entire news operation. The internal politics of the news department had received publicity after an unsuccessful effort by editors in New York to exert more control over the Washington bureau. Mr. Reston's mandate was to re-establish peace.
For 13 months he ran the news department while commuting to Washington a few times a week to write his column. It was an almost impossible job. In 1969, knowing that his column was suffering and that he had to choose between it and the editor's post, he gladly chose the column.
Mr. Reston was eminently a Washington man. He loved and understood the capital. Moreover, he had helped shape the Washington bureau. These were his people, and many of them regarded him as a father figure. The New York office, on the other hand, seemed a vast, impersonal beehive, and Mr. Reston never felt totally comfortable there.
During these years the Restons lived in a pleasant red brick house on Woodley Road in leafy northwest Washington and spent weekends at their log cabin in Fiery Run, Va. Mr. Reston often used Fiery Run as the dateline on his Thoreau-like columns about the restorative life in the country.
In 1968 the Restons purchased The Vineyard Gazette, a 122-year-old weekly on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where they vacationed in the summer. The paper has remained in the family; their son Richard is editor and publisher, and his wife, Mary Jo, is publisher and general manager.
 
Two Cuba Episodes And the Pentagon Papers
Mr. Reston played a part in the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 and in two other major news events involving The Times in questions of national security. The others were the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.
In the spring of 1961, The Times was preparing to publish an article by Tad Szulc reporting that 5,000 or 6,000 Cuban exiles who had been training in the United States and in Central America for nine months were about to launch an invasion of Cuba to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro.
The article was planned for page 1 on April 7, under a four-column headline. But Orvil Dryfoos, then the publisher, was troubled by the security implications of the report. On April 6, he and Mr. Catledge, then managing editor, telephoned Mr. Reston, who advised them not to publish the article and cautioned against giving away the proposed timing of the landing as "imminent."
The article was published on April 7 under a one-column headline and with no mention of the invasion's date. The Bay of Pigs invasion took place 10 days later and ended in debacle. President John F. Kennedy, who took full responsibility, said that if The Times had published more about the operation, it might have saved the Administration from making such a colossal mistake.
"If I had it to do over, I would do exactly what we did at the time," Mr. Reston said later. "It is ridiculous to think that publishing the fact that the invasion was imminent would have avoided this disaster."
In 1962 Mr. Reston was apparently the only reporter who had found out that the Soviet Union, then under the leadership of Nikita S. Khrushchev, had secreted nuclear missiles in Cuba, only 90 miles from Florida. When Kennedy realized that Mr. Reston had the information, he telephoned him directly.
Four years later, Mr. Reston recounted the incident to E. Clifton Daniel, then managing editor of The Times.
"The President told me that he was going on television on Monday evening to report to the American people," Mr. Reston recalled. "He said that if we published the news about the missiles, Khrushchev could actually give him an ultimatum before he went on the air.
"I told the President I would report to my office in New York," Mr. Reston continued. "And if my advice was asked, I would recommend that we not publish. It was not my duty to decide."
Kennedy then called Mr. Dryfoos, the publisher, and asked him not to print Mr. Reston's article. Mr. Dryfoos left the matter up to Mr. Reston and his staff, and the article was withheld.
It was a different story, however, in 1971 when The Times obtained and published what became known as the Pentagon Papers, the Government's top-secret documents on the Vietnam War. Seeing this at once as "the story of the century," Mr. Reston was one of the editors who felt that the documents should be published because they were history and that therefore no question of national security was involved.
One of Mr. Reston's contributions to journalism was the corps of young reporters he discovered and developed.
In 1961 he instituted a program of internships for young would-be reporters, modeled on the clerkships at the United States Supreme Court and suggested to him by the late Justice Felix Frankfurter. Each year he would recruit a new college graduate as his clerk and researcher. He paid a price for this program, as time and again the young clerks with lofty journalistic thoughts would mix up his airline reservations or keep the Secretary of State waiting because they had failed to cancel a scheduled appointment.
Linda Greenhouse, who went on to report on the Supreme Court for The Times, recalled that on her first day as a clerk, Mr. Reston asked her to get Ted Sorensen on the phone and suggested she try Paul Weiss in New York. After unsuccessfully calling every Weiss-comma-Paul in the Manhattan phone book, she reported back to Mr. Reston.
"He didn't groan, tear his hair or -- more important, and the reason for my undying gratitude -- laugh at me," Ms. Greenhouse said. "He gently explained that Paul, Weiss was a New York law firm where Ted Sorensen was working, looked up the number and gave it to me."
It was perhaps this quality, this unfailing kindliness, that constituted his special attractiveness. It enabled him to view the faults and frailties of the world with compassion and to carry on in the belief that the best in mankind would eventually win out over the worst.
"Stick with the optimists, Niftie," he wrote in a column in February 1980, welcoming his new grandson, Devin Fitzgerald Reston, to the human race. "It's going to be tough enough even if they're right."
Mr. Reston is survived by his wife; his sons, Richard F. Reston of Martha's Vineyard, James B. Reston Jr. of Chevy Chase, Md., and Thomas B. Reston of Washington; his sister, Joanna Richey of Santa Cruz, Calif., and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Fed Weighs New Evidence Of Slowdown

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Economic growth is slowing in the United States, two new reports said today, putting new pressure on the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates and on Congress and the White House to reach a budget deal.
The Commerce Department announced this morning that its index of leading economic indicators had fallen by half a percentage point in October, the steepest drop since April and the seventh drop in the last nine months. The slide in October was larger than most economists expected and prompted some to warn of a recession if the Federal Reserve did not reduce short-term interest rates soon. 
 The Fed took a slightly more sanguine view in a report released at midday. "National economic activity continues to expand, but at the somewhat slower pace reported in the last" Federal Reserve report on Nov. 1, the Fed concluded today.
Economic growth has clearly slowed in the New York and Ohio regions, and initial holiday sales have been lower than expected in the New York area, the Fed report found. But the Midwest continued to prosper, with manufacturing industries expanding, farm prices rising and wages increasing.
The bond market rallied sharply early in the day in reaction to the drop in the leading indicators, with the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond dipping below 6 percent. The gains came despite another Commerce Department report showing a 2.7 percent surge in construction spending in October. But bonds gave back most of their gains after the Fed report, and the 30-year bond ended with its yield marginally lower, at 6.03 percent. [Page D17.]
With different regions of the country showing varying degrees of strength and weakness, Federal Reserve officials were cautious in interviews today about predicting the direction of economic growth over the next year. Their caution suggested that they would not make up their minds about whether to reduce short-term interest rates at their next meeting on Dec. 19 until after they see further statistics, like the November unemployment figures scheduled for Friday, and observe whether Congress and the Administration make progress in their budget negotiations.
Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, expressed some worries today that the economy might continue to slow. "The economy is throwing off somewhat mixed signals, which is not terribly surprising in a situation where you're expecting something close to trend growth," he said this afternoon. "However, to me the risks continue to look on balance on the downside."
Mr. Blinder declined to comment on whether he thought Fed officials should reduce short-term interest rates on Dec. 19 to stimulate growth. But his concern about the balance of risks suggested that he would be sympathetic to a reduction in rates. Mr. Blinder has frequently been the strongest voice for lower rates since President Clinton named him to the Federal Reserve last year.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve Board governor, was slightly more optimistic. "We're in a period of slow to moderate growth," he said, adding that he expected the economy to avoid a recession in 1996 while growing more slowly than this year.
One key issue of disagreement within the Federal Reserve is the extent to which interest-rate policy should be linked to a budget deal. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has repeatedly urged politicians this year to pursue a balanced budget, a stance that has led many Wall Street analysts to believe that he may be resisting an interest-rate reduction until a deal is struck.
Mr. Blinder said he opposed any linkage of budget policy to interest rates. "I think it is a fundamentally wrongheaded view of the role of the Federal Reserve to put us in the position of judging the budget deal and rewarding if it's a good deal and punishing if it's a bad deal," he said. "Our job is to try to guide the economy."
But Mr. Lindsey said that with Government spending accounting for close to a quarter of economic activity in the United States, it was wrong to ignore the budget debate. "I concur completely with chairman Greenspan that the absence of such a deal would cause a lot of trouble in the markets, probably causing intermediate- and long-term rates to rise significantly and therefore putting the '96 forecasts somewhat into question," he said.
The range of views on the economy at the Federal Reserve finds echoes in the opinions of Wall Street analysts.
Robert V. DiClemente, a senior economist at Salomon Brothers, said that a recession was unlikely because with a steady dollar and low inflation, the Federal Reserve had plenty of room to lower interest rates and rekindle economic growth. Unless further data over the next two weeks show further weakness in the economy, the Federal Reserve is likely to wait at least until January to reduce short-term interest rates, he said, adding, "There's nothing wrong with the economy that lower interest rates won't cushion or minimize."
But a few economists are much more gloomy. Michael P. Niemira, an economist in the New York offices of the Mitsubishi Bank, said today that he now thought a recession was likely late next year or in early 1997. "Even lower rates, unless they're dramatic, may not be enough to thwart the recession," he said.

HEADLINE: Parents Poll Shows Higher Incidence of Child Abuse

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Two studies released yesterday paint a bleak picture of American childhood: One estimated, based on parents' own reports, that more than three million children are punched, kicked or struck with a hard object each year in the name of discipline, and the other, a poll of young people, found that 40 percent of girls ages 14 to 17 said they had a friend their own age who had been hit or beaten by a boyfriend.
The poll on child discipline, conducted by the Gallup Organization in August and September, asked a representative sample of 1,000 parents nationwide how they handle a child who misbehaves. If the poll results were projected to the entire population, it would mean that almost 5 percent of parents punish their children by punching, kicking or throwing the child down, or hitting the child with a hard object on some part of the body other than the bottom. Those acts were classified as abusive in the study, while punishments like spanking, slapping, shouting, cursing or threatening to send a child away were not. 
 The Gallup poll also found that 1.3 million children a year were sexually abused. The poll did not ask parents whether they had sexually abused their children, but rather whether, as far as they knew, their children had been forced to have sex with an adult or older child, had been forcibly touched sexually by an adult or older child, or had been forced to touch an adult or older child sexually.
The Gallup estimates of both physical and sexual abuse are far higher than the Federal Government's official statistics. The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect's 1993 report, the most recent available, said that more than 200,000 children were victims of physical abuse -- one-sixteenth what the Gallup poll projects. According to the Government statistics, 130,000 children are victims of sexual abuse, one-tenth the Gallup numbers.
"The reason for the disparity is that the Federal data represent only those cases reported to public agencies, investigated and confirmed," said Anne Cohn Donnelly, the executive director of the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse, a private group in Chicago. "The Federal numbers will always be much lower than the actual abuse. There are far more children brutalized than we know about."
For example, Ms. Donnelly said, the case of Elisa Izquierdo, the 6-year-old New York girl found dead in her mother's apartment last month, would not have been counted, because the reports of her abuse had not been formally investigated.
There is no single definition of what constitutes abuse. For example, Ms. Donnelly said, in Illinois it would be abusive to rap a child on the knuckles with a fork; in Florida it would not be abusive if the bruises dissipated in three days.
Ms. Donnelly said the use of milder physical punishments, such as spanking, has been declining in the United States. But severe abuse has not: Indeed, the number of children killed by abuse has increased 50 percent over the last decade, she said.
As high as the Gallup numbers are, they probably understate the problem, said George H. Gallup Jr., co-chairman of the Gallup Organization. "Our data are based on self-reporting, and some people probably did not report everything," he said. "In itself, the fact that so many parents were willing to admit using severe physical punishment shows something about social attitudes."
Experts on child abuse said the Gallup numbers were not out of line with their own research.
"Parents are a good source of information," said Dr. Dean Kilpatrick, a psychology professor at the Medical University of South Carolina. "I know there's a general assumption that these events are so horrible that nobody will talk about them, but approached correctly, people are amazingly ready to talk about these things."
The Gallup study found a strong correlation between family income and abuse. The physical abuse rate among families earning less than $20,000 a year is three times that of families earning at least $50,000 a year, and sexual abuse is seven times as common in the low-income category as the high-income category. Both physical and sexual abuse were reported three times more often in single-parent families than in two-parent families.
Generally, mothers reported abusing their children more than fathers, mostly because they are more likely to be the disciplinarians in the family, and more likely to be poor single parents.
The Gallup study examined the theory that child abuse is part of a cycle of family violence, occurring in generation after generation. The survey found, however, that those who said they had experienced corporal punishment or abuse as children were no more likely than those who were never hit to say they use physical punishment or even moderate abuse on their children. But people who said they had been abused as children were overrepresented among those who said they severely abused their own children, burning, choking or beating them.
The Gallup poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, as did the second study released yesterday, commissioned by Children Now, an Oakland, Calif., children's advocacy group, and Kaiser Permanente, a health-care company.
The second study used 1,000 telephone interviews with children ages 11 to 17 and 120 in-person interviews with children ages 7 to 10 to explore a wide range of threats to children's health and safety. Perhaps the most surprising finding was the frequency with which teen-age girls reported having friends who had been hit or beaten by boyfriends.
"We hadn't originally planned to ask about violence by a boyfriend," said Maryann O'Sullivan, the director of special projects for Children Now. "What made us add it was a girl who started crying in a focus group when she talked about how her boyfriend had beat her up and broken her leg. Girls need to know that this is not acceptable, and boys need to know they shouldn't be doing this."
The older teen-age girls were far more likely than boys their age to report that they had friends who had been sexually abused, severely depressed, physically abused by an adult, considered suicide or had an eating disorder.
To avoid putting young people on the spot -- or encouraging them to exaggerate their behavior -- most of the questions did not ask about their own behavior. Instead, most asked what "your 10 closest friends and other people your age, including yourself" had experienced.
Some polling experts suggested that this approach might inflate results: "Asking about a group of friends certainly gives you a feel for what's going on, but you may get some double-counting," said Dr. Kilpatrick, who is himself examining adolescents and violence. "In our study, we have not found 40 percent of adolescent girls beaten up by their boyfriends."
In the Children Now study, which was conducted in October by Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin & Associates, more than a quarter of the boys ages 14 to 17 said they had a friend who had been a victim of gang violence. Nearly 4 in 10 had a friend who had been threatened with a weapon.
Generally, girls were more likely than boys to say they wanted more information on issues like sex, drinking and drugs, and that they wished they had someone to talk to about such issues. The study, which included an oversample of an additional 150 black and Hispanic youths, found that minority children face a rougher world than white children do, reporting greater exposure to gangs and drugs and more fear of violence and crime.
The study also found that young people were more likely to turn to their mothers than to their fathers with their concerns. Among 14 to 17 year olds, 31 percent of boys and 42 percent of girls said they turned to their mothers first. Only 9 percent of boys and 3 percent of girls said they would confide in their fathers. Among the older teen-agers, about a third took their concerns primarily to friends; those facing the most health and safety threats were the least likely to turn to adults.
"What this study says is that our children are living in fear of a wide variety of health and safety threats, and sadly many of their fears are well-founded in statistics," said Lois Salisbury, the executive director of Children Now. "We adults need to take stock of what kind of a job we are doing guiding and teaching our young people to help them get through a dangerous world."

HEADLINE: AS LONG PROMISED, PRESIDENT VETOES THE G.O.P. BUDGET

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton today vetoed the Republicans' sweeping plan to balance the Federal budget in seven years, denouncing it as extreme and wrongheaded. At the same time he promised to present a counterproposal on Thursday for eliminating the deficit by 2002, with less severe spending reductions and smaller tax cuts.
"We must balance the budget, but we must do it in a way that honors the commitments that we all have and that keep our people together," Mr. Clinton said in a brief Oval Office ceremony. "With this veto, the extreme Republican effort to balance the budget through wrongheaded cuts and misplaced priorities is over. Now it's up to all of us to go back to work together to show we can balance the budget and be true to our values and our economic interests." 
 Mr. Clinton had vowed repeatedly to veto the measure, the centerpiece of the Republicans' Contract With America, and in fact negotiations have already begun on an alternative. He acted with the same pen that President Lyndon B. Johnson used in 1965 to sign the amendments to the Social Security Act that created the Medicare and Medicaid programs, both of which Mr. Clinton contends would be crippled by the Republican plan.
Congressional Republicans, who want both sharper spending cuts and bigger tax breaks, were quick to denounce Mr. Clinton's veto and say they wanted to see the details of his latest plan.
"The veto didn't come as a surprise, but some of the rhetoric came as a surprise," said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader. "If he wants to continue down this route, we can't stop him."
But for all Mr. Clinton's heated oratory, the President made what his aides described as an important concession to the Republicans by agreeing to present an alternative proposal for balancing the budget in seven years -- the time frame the Republicans have long wanted and one the Administration denounced just months ago as arbitrary and apt to disrupt the economy.
White House aides said the President's latest budget plan -- the third Mr. Clinton has offered this year in response to repeated Republican attacks -- would contain deeper cuts in welfare, transportation and housing than his last budget proposal, in June, and would have new curbs on tax breaks for corporations. But the aides said it also would call for the same savings of $124 billion from Medicare and $54 billion from Medicaid that Mr. Clinton had proposed earlier, and would maintain his call for about $100 million in tax relief aimed at the middle class.
Mr. Clinton would also raise additional money by adopting the proposal by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to reduce the Consumer Price Index by about two-tenths of 1 percent, because economists believe it now overstates inflation. That would yield some $20 billion, but would have the effect of reducing cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other Federal programs and pushing taxpayers into higher brackets.
Finally, the White House would speed up the planned sale of radio frequencies used by broadcasters.
Speaker Newt Gingrich called the President's use of the L.B.J. pen, which briefly failed to work until Mr. Clinton dipped it in an inkwell partway through the signing, "campaign gimmickry."
"The President has to realize that Lyndon Johnson's Great Society has failed," Mr. Gingrich said.
And Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Mr. Clinton's pen almost did not work because "it was so old," which, he added, was "sort of like a number of the programs the President wants to protect."
Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the tone of Mr. Clinton's veto remarks would make continuing negotiations on the budget more difficult. White House negotiators are to present the President's latest proposal to their Congressional counterparts on Thursday.
"They had better lower the rhetoric if they want this done," Mr. Kasich said. "Don't expect smooth sailing from here. He wants to spend the country into prosperity, and it cannot be done."
Both sides are working against the clock. The temporary spending measure on which the Government has been running since last month expires on Dec. 15, and neither Capitol Hill nor the White House holds out much hope of reaching an agreement on an overall budget bill by then.
White House officials said tonight that Mr. Clinton would ask for another temporary spending measure to keep the Government running through the end of January, since the Congressional Budget Office has yet to even finish revising the economic estimates that will be needed to begin negotiations in earnest.
The White House was quick to portray Mr. Clinton's veto as a mark of his consistency, since he has vowed for weeks to block Republican plans that he says would harm education, the environment, health care, children and the elderly. Aides also said the President had now made clear that if the Republicans did not accept some of his favored programs and priorities, his veto power could assure that none of theirs become law, either.
"This is the most significant act of the year," said the President's senior adviser, George Stephanopoulos. "With this, the Republican budget is dead, the Contract With America is dead. Now let's get to work."
Later, the White House issued a 50-page fact sheet listing 82 reasons for Mr. Clinton's veto, among them the size of the Republicans' tax cuts, their plan for opening the Arctic refuge to oil drilling and a provision that would let corporations tap pension funds to free up other company money for unrelated purposes.
As he has repeatedly in recent weeks, Mr. Clinton framed his disagreements with the Republicans as a battle over fundamental American "values," using that word an even dozen times in his brief speech and accusing the Republicans of seeking to "undermine" or "violate our values," while vowing to "elevate," "protect" and "honor" them himself.
At the same time, the White House took pains to describe Mr. Clinton's proposal as a gesture of good faith to the Republicans, one that will take the sketchy 10-year plan for balancing the budget that the President had offered earlier and condense it, with more detail, into the time frame the Republicans demanded.
"With a lot of scraping and trimming here and there, we basically have followed the structure of the President's 10-year plan and squeezed it into seven," said the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry. "We've had to find a little more revenue and a little less discretionary spending."
But Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said: "President Clinton continues to show a big-government, big-spending approach to solving our nation's problems. I regret very much that the President vetoed the only balanced budget he ever touched."

Japan Account Surplus Fell Sharply in October

 BODY:
Japan registered a much smaller surplus in its broadest measure of trade in October, the Finance Ministry said today. The surplus in the current account, measuring trade in goods and services, plunged to $4.31 billion. That was less than half of the October 1994 surplus of $8.95 billion and of the $10.6 billion surplus of September. 
 Economists had expected a drop, because of Japan's rapidly rising imports from Asia and the slowing pace of exports to the United States. Though imports in the past were mostly high-priced European luxury goods, the trend now is for more imports of low-cost utility items, they said. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Balancing Profits And Principles In South Africa

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

DATELINE: DURBAN, South Africa

 BODY:
IT'S HARD TO pigeonhole Anant Singh, the producer of "Cry the Beloved Country," in the terms one uses to discuss his counterparts in America and Europe.
Major film maker? Not yet, although Miramax, his American distributor, has high hopes for "Cry, the Beloved Country," which opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday. Here in South Africa, the hope is that it will be the country's break-out film, the one that does for the local movie industry what "Breaker Morant" did for Australia's in 1980. 
 To that end, the country's President, Nelson Mandela, was present at a gala screening of the film in New York in October during the 50th-birthday celebration of the United Nations. At that screening -- which was attended by James Earl Jones and Richard Harris, two of the stars of the film, along with Mr. Singh and Hillary Rodham Clinton -- Mr. Mandela said, "Much of 'Cry, the Beloved Country' evokes such strong emotions about the terrible past from which South Africa has just emerged." The film, he added, "for my generation, will evoke the bittersweet memories of our youth."
So, is the 39-year-old Mr. Singh an anti-apartheid film maker? That's too narrow, although several of Mr. Singh's films -- he has produced nearly 40 -- have attacked apartheid. And if "Cry, the Beloved Country" doesn't become the defining anti-apartheid film (a version was made in 1951 by Zoltan Korda), it's at least a Hollywood-scale version of Alan Paton's defining anti-apartheid novel, one that has been read by high school students everywhere since its publication in 1948 and shapes their view of South Africa the way "Huckleberry Finn" shapes foreign views of America.
Some might even call Mr. Singh a schlock film maker, since he has produced his share of kick-boxing pictures, quickies like "Bedroom Eyes II," whose sizzling posters depict large-breasted women in mortal danger, and horror films like "The Mangler," based on a Stephen King story about a laundry-folding machine with a blood lust.
He's no fool: American B-movies that go straight to video are staples of third-world cinemas. And video-rental fees his films earn in America mean serious money here.
Mr. Singh describes himself as a black film maker, although he is Indian; in America he is constantly having to explain this to others, white and black. Since he was denied the right to vote, he tells them, and had to make his living distributing films on the "nonwhite" theater circuit -- and since he wasn't about to call himself "nie-blanke" ("nonwhite'), or Asian, as the Government preferred -- he calls himself black, as do many worldly people here.
One of the freedoms of the new South Africa is not having to submit to stereotypes, whether Afrikaner or American.
Like Mr. Singh himself, "Cry, the Beloved Country" subtly shows the difference between race relations in South Africa and those in America. The plot conforms to the book: a humble Christian priest from Zululand in the hills of Natal (played by Mr. Jones) journeys to the big city of Johannesburg to find his son, who had gone there a year before to look for work and then vanished. A prosperous English farmer (Mr. Harris) makes the same journey, by plane, to bury his son, a white liberal writer killed in a "native break-in" at his home. Inevitably, it is revealed that the priest's son was the panicky burglar who fired the shot, and the two fathers meet.
The central theme of the movie, directed by Darrell James Roodt, is also true to the book: self-congratulatory whites may delude themselves that they "brought civilization" to a culture that didn't even have a written language, but they actually destroyed southern Africa's deeply religious tribes by making their men wage slaves of a mining economy. The film, too, ends with a bittersweet note of reconciliation: two aging fathers can bridge a gap even if their peoples cannot.
It is the details, though, that recall how stark the differences were in 1946, the year in which the story is set, two years before the first apartheid laws were passed. There is a black child's expression of terror as Mr. Harris rides past and simply looks at her. There is the contrast on a train platform between a Lesotho man's straw hat, topped by its anti-lightning charm, and the elegant baggage of the whites in first class.
Mr. Singh, who wasn't around in 1946, is the son of a doctor. He grew up in Durban, an elegant old English and Indian port city with an unhurried world view that is vastly different from that of money-mad Johannesburg, which sprang up atop the gold mines in 1870.

B UT HE STILL UNDERstands. Professionally, he is a creature of apartheid who was oppressed by it and yet profited by outwitting it.
He gave up his teen-age dreams of attending a film school abroad (the only South African one was at a whites-only university) when his father died. He studied engineering but was earning a pittance as a rewinder in a 16-millimeter film-rental shop when the white boss asked whether he wanted to take over the business and buy it out of future receipts. He did, though it stayed in the boss's name, since nonwhites could not own businesses in that neighborhood.
Within nine months, at 19, he had paid off the owner. Astutely, he started buying the South African rights to foreign films, haggling Hollywood studios' demands down from $20,000 to $1,000 or so. His first big success was "Secrets," a forgettable film resurrected only because it featured Jacqueline Bisset minus the wet T-shirt she had just made famous in "The Deep."
Under the country's bizarre censorship laws, Mr. Singh was once jailed for showing the James Bond film "Live and Let Die" to friends. "Yaphet Kotto slapped Jane Seymour around in it," he explains, "so only whites were allowed to see it."
Many American movies his customers wanted were barred, from blaxploitation films like "Superfly" to model-Negro ones like "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." Sometimes he appealed. "The board in Pretoria was six clearly right-wing Afrikaner guys," he said. "The minute I appeared, you could see their arrogance come out."
At first, he never won. Later, when he could afford to hire a white lawyer, he occasionally did.
Sometimes he flouted the law and simply got the film. "It was forbidden fruit," he said. "And you're learning about a culture. For us, there was no other way to see films with black heroes."
In the 1980's, home video replaced 16-millimeter film, and since Mr. Singh's inexpensive contracts for hundreds of films included all video distribution rights, they were worth a fortune. His company, as it grew, turned into a big family business, with his brother a partner and cousins sharing his suite of offices in the hills above Durban. Mr. Singh, an unmarried workaholic, has recently managed to buy a house at the beach.
With his new wealth, he began making films that attacked apartheid. "Place of Weeping," about a brutal white farmer who fatally beats a worker who simply wants enough to eat, was made for $30,000 in 14 days, always on the run.
"Every day, the police would show up at the location where we'd been the day before," he says. On day 15, he flew to London with the negative. The next day, the police arrived at his Durban office, demanding it.
He arranged the film's commercial opening for New York, betting correctly that the Pretoria censors wouldn't risk international humiliation by banning a political film at home that major American critics had praised. Janet Maslin said in The New York Times that the film had "a plain, clumsy style that does nothing to diminish its power."
Mr. Singh, who in 1993 produced an unsuccessful Disney picture, "Father Hood," disdains Hollywood, in part because it wastes so much money: "If you need two production people," he says, "a studio wants 20 because no one wants to make a decision. Then the costs -- hotels, catering -- just compound themselves."
In 1992, he made "Sarafina!" based on the Broadway hit of the same name, with Whoopi Goldberg, for $4 million. And "Cry, the Beloved Country," which has the period sets, costumes, cars and trains that American audiences love so much, along with helicopter shots and original music, cost less than $7 million. (That in an era when the average Hollywood film is about $30 million.)
"He's very cost conscious," said Helena Spring, his associate producer. "But if a project is worth putting more money into, he'll find the money. The crews who work with him come back happy."
Darryl Accone, the editor of Big Screen magazine here, calls Mr. Singh "fairly principled, in ways that often coincide with a chance to make a profit."

G IVEN ITS LOW COST AND early success, "Cry, the Beloved Country" will presumably do that. Local reviews were tepid because the story has no new message for South Africans, but critics admired the performances. And what is unusual is that it is still in 40 theaters here after five weeks; American films like "The Bridges of Madison County," which opened the same weekend, usually chase local films out quickly.
In the United States, Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax, was full of praise for Mr. Singh. "He shot extra scenes for the American version," Mr. Weinstein says. "And when all else fails, he sends me so much South African wine that I agree with everything he says."
Still, Mr. Weinstein acknowleged that the film, which is hardly escapist entertainment, would have to do well in the Golden Globe and Oscar nominations to stay alive.
Mr. Singh is ready. The waiting room of his office building is decorated with framed programs from Oscar ceremonies. Should something more substantial come along, he'll find the money for a niche.

HEADLINE: FILM VIEW;
A Chronicler Of Time's Slow March

BYLINE: By Jennifer Dunning

 BODY:
HOW COULD SUCH A SMALL TREE BEAR SO much fruit, someone asks in "The Quince Tree Sun," a film by the Spanish director Victor Erice about an artist painting the quince tree in his backyard in Madrid. The question might be asked about all of Mr. Erice's films, for they create large landscapes out of the smallest worlds.
Mr. Erice (pronounced a-REE-thay), who, at 55, is considered by many to be Spain's foremost auteur, is surprisingly little known in the United States. But "Spain on Film: Spanish Cinema Now IV," a two-week festival that opened on Friday at the Walter Reade Theater, may help remedy the situation. It includes a retrospective of Mr. Erice's three movies, starting Wednesday, which the director is expected to attend. 
 "Erice is a master of Spanish cinema whose portrayal of the passage of time and the identity of the Spanish people is unique," says Angel Gil, the American film adviser to the Spanish Society of Authors and Publishers, a producer of the festival with the Cervantes Institute, the Spanish Ministry of Culture and the Film Society of Lincoln Center. "He has been very faithful to his art, making only three films in 20 years and doing what he wanted, no matter what."
Mr. Erice's films have had critical successes in this country. "The Spirit of the Beehive," the story of a little girl who becomes entranced by Frankenstein's monster after the James Whale classic is shown in her village, has become a cult movie since its release in 1973. His latest film, "The Quince Tree Sun" (the English title, which Mr. Erice prefers to the American "Dream of Light") won the International Critics Award at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.
But the new film has no American distributor, which is not surprising given that the film depicts the painting of the tree at a slow-moving two hours and 20 minutes. During the French press screening at the hectic French festival, the room emptied quickly not long after the painter Antonio Lopez Garcia, a friend of Mr. Erice's, began painstakingly capturing the tree on canvas through its autumn blooming and winter decay, in what amounted not to a documentary but to a journal of an artist's work and life and a film about creation and life itself.
Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, described the film as "quiet, meticulous and supremely simple." "Mr. Erice's method is modest, yet his film manages to achieve a mesmerizing intensity," she continued. "The purity and breadth of this meticulous study are all the more gratifying in view of its unprepossessing style."
That description would work as well for "The Spirit of the Beehive" and "The South," which was released in 1983. Each film has an almost unnervingly observant little girl as its central character. Both children are effectively alone in the world, loved by mothers who cannot withstand the pain of living with the remote, tormented men who are their husbands and the girls' loving fathers.
Dark magicians in their ways, one man is a beekeeper and the other a water-diviner. Both have chosen to exile themselves and their families in desolate rural areas of Spain, where fields and buildings look like a modernist's flat planes and geometric shapes, where the dark interiors and the people in them resemble those in paintings by Rembrandt or Vermeer, and where cheerful village life teems about the families at a distant periphery.
THAT LANDSCAPE RESEMBLES CARRANZA, the village where Mr. Erice was born and spent his summers as a child. The nearby city of San Sebastian, where he grew up, was a place where he could see films. (There were no movie theaters in Carranza.) "I was forced to live as a spectator, in an atmosphere reflected in 'The Spirit of the Beehive,' " Mr. Erice said in a recent interview from Madrid, where he lives.
His first memories of film, from the age of 4, are of terror. "It is funny, but I have found more than one director whose first contact with film was connected with the feeling of fear," Mr. Erice said. "This makes me think that between the children of my generation and some of the films of that time, there was a relationship that began with a certain trauma. It is not strange. One of the first films of the Lumiere brothers provoked fear, as viewers saw the image of a train entering a station."
After graduating from the University of Madrid with a degree in economics and political science, Mr. Erice studied directing at the Spanish Film School in Madrid. "The Spirit of the Beehive" was his first professional full-length feature.
"The horror movies produced by Universal interested me, but it is not true that I always had the idea of making a film on the myth of Frankenstein," Mr. Erice said. "What happened is that in 1972 I saw again, on television, the movie 'Frankenstein' by James Whale, which made me relive old emotions." Mr. Erice had just been approached by Elias
Querejeta, the noted Spanish producer. "We agreed we both wanted to make a film about the myth."
Mr. Erice kept a still from the Whale movie on his work table. In the picture, the monster and the little girl sit together beside a river. The photograph suggested to him that that first encounter, so important a part of any myth, was the heart of his first film.
"The Spirit of the Beehive" has been described as a parable about Spain under the dictator Generalissimo Francisco Franco, who died in 1975, an interpretation that Mr. Erice agrees is almost inevitable, given the tendency of art to reflect its time. But the dictatorship and Franco's death were perhaps not as great an influence in shaping Mr. Erice's career as the pressures of an unforgiving industry.
His next film, "The South," also produced by Mr. Querejeta, was about another little girl. Mr. Erice intended the film to end with her voyage to the south of Spain, where her father's family lives and which she imagines to be the warm antithesis of her bleak surroundings. But time and money ran out before he could complete the movie to his satisfaction. "For me, 'The South' is an unfinished film," he said.
Again, almost a decade went by before Mr. Erice began work on his next project. He had been participating in the debates about style during his film-school years when he helped to found Nuestro Cine, a journal that supported neo-realism over Hollywood movie making. Between films, Mr. Erice worked as a critic, screenwriter and teacher. He is now a professor of directing at the Spanish Film School in Madrid, which reopened in September after many years. He also made publicity movies for film and television, "a very efficient way to accumulate technical knowledge," he said. And he wrote a book with Jos Oliver on Nicholas Ray, an American director for whom Mr. Erice has great sympathy and admiration.
Ray had his difficulties with American studios. Mr. Erice worries about the problem of making films that do not follow industry models in an era in which all electronic image making is lumped together, at least in Europe, under the popular catch phrase "audio-visual." Film-making is an art and not a commodity, Mr. Erice insists, and must be treated as something different from video or television.
The making of "The Quince Tree Sun," with its measured and luminous unfolding, is a good example of what he is talking about. Produced by Maria Moreno, Mr. Lopez's wife, and a few friends, the movie was shot in single takes over 10 weeks, starting in September 1990. Once, film stock ran out, but Mr. Erice let the movie proceed at its own slow pace, shooting in video for three days, then transferring that to 35-millimeter film. He spent more than eight months editing the movie.
The film grew out of the two friends' talk of night dreams. When the painter told Mr. Erice about his idea of painting the tree through the winter, Mr. Erice decided to make the film, inspired, too, by Mr. Lopez's dream about being a child again, at home, and the only one in a mysterious group of people to notice the dying fruit on a quince tree.
"He arranged for me to come to his garden a few days later," Mr. Erice said. "It was my problem if I wanted to go with a camera, because whatever happened, he was going to be working next to the tree. I had never seen Antonio paint a tree. I didn't really know what might happen. I knew that the quince is an autumn fruit. The idea was to capture the sun of that particular season, which was linked to the dream and its extraordinary image.
"The point of the film is to observe the work of a painter who is trying to represent a tree in a style characterized by tenacity and perfectionism," Mr. Erice said. "The difficulty was not only the position of the sun but also the model."
In the film, which is both comical and poetic, Mr. Lopez marks the leaves and drops plumb lines from the fruit. "The model wasn't fixed," Mr. Erice said. "It was a tree whose leaves and fruit were in motion, in constant and subtle change. We are not talking about dying nature, but about life. The will of the painter to fix that moment of maximum splendor creates a tension. Indifferent to his work, obeying the laws of nature, the tree grows from ripeness to decay, as it has always done, and time is revealed as a central and decisive element of experience."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Of Mondrian, Street Grids And Cities Transcendent

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
UPTOWN, DOWNTOWN, crosstown, our town: long before reaching the painting "Broadway Boogie Woogie," visitors to the Museum of Modern Art's magnificent Mondrian show may find themselves drawn into a New York state of mind. Mondrian's painted grids, of course, fit almost too neatly into the city with the 90-degree soul. And for an architecture critic, the show casts a revealing light on the city itself. It may be entirely coincidental that Mondrian's grids recall the street plan of Manhattan. Even so, the paintings and the city both stand at the intersection of material reality and metaphysical thought.
At the Modern, wall plaques help viewers grasp the idea that Mondrian's abstract forms are not simply a matter of composition or design. For Mondrian, and for those susceptible to the creative process he pursued with such passion, the departure from representation holds a spiritual dimension. Perhaps the show itself can help us perceive the transcendent city outside from a similar point of view. The engineers who designed New York's grid did more than carve out identical plots of land from a bumpy little island. They also defined a metaphysical space, a test ground for the aspirations that the skyline came to symbolize. 
 I have a wandering mind. I confess that while walking through the show, the thought that haunted me was somewhat off the wall: Martha Stewart has bought Gordon Bunshaft's house. I couldn't get that picture out of my mind. Martha Stewart, living in a glass International Style house in East Hampton. Here is a writer (I swear by her book on hors d'oeuvres) who stands for getting back in touch with the physicality of life. She chops vegetables and even grows them, raises chickens, bakes bread and does all this messy, hands-on stuff.
Now she has come to roost in a house that is a classic statement about the increasing abstraction of modern life. If Martha Stewart can't escape the tug of abstraction -- if, in fact, she deliberately chooses to dwell within it -- what hope is there for the rest of us?
Actually, I think it's a tribute to Mondrian's art that the show can put you in mind of something like Martha Stewart. I say something, rather than someone, because Martha Stewart, while a real person, is also an abstraction, a brand name that stands for things like baking bread and raising chickens. She makes a career of dispensing images of these things to people who eagerly devour them because the reality of rising yeast and clucking hens, not to mention the traditional way of life associated with them, has become increasingly elusive.
Stewart, in short, is a brilliant example of what Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has called a "symbolic analyst," the elite worker (including everyone from executives to artists) in today's economy whose task is to "simplify reality into abstract images that can be rearranged, juggled, experimented with, communicated to other specialists and then, eventually, transformed back into reality." But reality, with Stewart, is itself an abstraction; some of her readers choose to grow chickens, yet most consume the printed and televised images of food, hearth and family. That's why she ought to feel at home in Gordon Bunshaft's house.
Symbolic analysts should feel right at home in Mondrian's studio, or rather the reconstruction of it at the Modern show. The walls of the studio are hung with scores of abstract images, which the artist has patiently rearranged, if not precisely juggled. The result of his experiments transformed art. But from what reality did Mondrian initially extract his images?
The modern city was an important source. That is one of the thrilling revelations of the show. In 1915, just before he leaped into abstraction, Mondrian created a group of drawings and paintings based on the cityscape of Paris. The artist was fascinated by half-demolished buildings whose innards had been exposed by the stripping away of their masonry facades. In one painting of 1915, squares of pink and blue represent the painted walls of apartments and the orthogonal interior structure that the facade has covered up. Mondrian's mature work, in other words, traces an arc that lifts from Paris and touches down in New York 30 years later, when the city appears through the lens of abstract form.
The arc parallels the innovations that revolutionized architecture in the 1920's: the stripping away of the masonry facade, the exposure of the building's interior by glass walls, the reduction of the city center to an abstract diagram.
The progressive abstraction of architecture and city planning is one of the principal developments of the modern movement; it is evident in projects like Mies van der Rohe's Friedrichstrasse project of 1921 and in the diagrammatic urban plans of Le Corbusier. These European models transformed New York's architecture in the postwar decades with buildings like the glass skyscrapers that rose along Park Avenue and the high-rise complexes like the Silver Towers on Bleecker Street. By the late 1960's, New York was well on its way to becoming an abstract city, a place that came into its own as the world capital of symbolic analysis, a center for media, information and global finance.
Abstraction had a place in New York long before the Seagram Building was built in 1958. The Manhattan street grid is a piece of engineering, not a work of art. Still, it is an abstraction, a geometric pattern projected on the ground without regard for the city's natural topography. To some extent, the city that arose from that pattern seems to reverse Mondrian: where he progressed from depicting the physical cityscape to creating abstract form, New York has grown from an abstract diagram to the densely built-up metropolis we see today.
But the city's physicality is deceptive. As the architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable once observed, "There is no art as impermanent as architecture." Huxtable was writing about the volatile real estate market and the corrosive pressures it brings to bear on the city's landmarks. Thanks to the preservation movement, which Huxtable heroically championed, those pressures have been partly held in check. Not everything solid is destined to melt into air.
There are other factors, nobler than real estate values, that contribute to the city's persistent impulse toward immateriality. In "The Skyward Trend of Thought," the Dutch architectural historian Thomas A. P. van Leeuwen describes the metaphysical aspirations of the architects who designed this century's early skyscrapers. Inspired by the soaring heights made possible by engineering, architects like Raymond Hood, Cass Gilbert and Hugh Ferris created designs that would lift the skyscraper from the material to the spiritual realm.
The architect's victory over gravity might be made to represent the groping of earth toward heaven. The neo-Gothic spires of Gilbert's Woolworth Building and Hood's American Radiator Building, the dreamy cityscapes rendered by Ferris: projects like these gave form to the utopian idea that a commercial city need not exclude the transcendent; it could pay spectacular homage to it.
TODAY, THAT IDEA MAY strike us as naive or even cynical. The architectural historian Carol Willis is surely correct, in her new book, "Form Follows Finance," to emphasize the crassly material foundations from which the skyscraper city arose. Didn't Cass Gilbert, Woolworth's architect, once call the skyscraper "a machine for making money"? Yet I think that Mondrian was not wrong in discerning that the dynamism symbolized by that skyline has a transcendent dimension all its own.
This is the dimension Mondrian evokes in "Broadway Boogie Woogie." It is not the moralistic dimension of medieval piety evoked by Cass Gilbert's neo-Gothic ornament. Rather, it is the creative realm of the artistic imagination. The painting does not literally represent the city. It remains a work of abstraction. But both the painting and its title inevitably evoke the city's streets; they recall the network of void space that runs throughout the built-up metropolis. That void is the space of creativity, the matrix of movement, of change, of ideas yet unformed, of the city yet to be built.
For me, the lesson of the Mondrian show is that abstraction is not a period style, not a dated mode of painting or designing. It is a contemporary way of being. The show documents an artist's successful struggle to live creatively in the present. The city is the record of such moments.

HEADLINE: James Reston, for Many Years a Nonpareil Among American Journalists, Dies at 86

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.; Reprinted from yesterday's late editions.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
James Reston, former columnist, Washington correspondent and executive editor of The New York Times, died on Wednesday night at his home here. He was 86.
The cause was cancer, said his son Thomas. 
 First as a reporter and then, beginning in 1953, as a columnist, Mr. Reston was perhaps the most influential journalist of his generation. In Washington, where he was based, and also in other capitals around the world, he had unrivaled access to the high and the mighty. Yet he retained a wry, self-deprecating personality, free of bombast, and always sought to reduce political complexity to plain language.
"What I try to do," he said, "is write a letter to a friend who doesn't have time to find out all the goofy things that go on in Washington."
Interested in China and the Soviet Union as well as the United States, a student of diplomacy as well as domestic politics, he won two Pulitzer Prizes and dozens of other awards.
Mr. Reston was forgiving of the frailties of soldiers, statesmen and party hacks -- too forgiving, some of his critics later said, because he was too close to them. But his stern moral standards, rooted in the Victorian values of his youth, never wavered. He remained an idealist in a world of cynics.
From his strong-minded mother he inherited a Presbyterian conscience and an abiding sense of duty and responsibility. Work hard, he was taught. Work for large goals that transcend self-interest.
A talent scout of prodigious capacity, Mr. Reston hired and trained many of The Times's best-known journalists, and served as mentor to many more. To each of them, he passed along a lifetime's lessons about craft and country.
Mr. Reston's 50-year association with The Times began when he joined its London bureau on Sept. 1, 1939, the day Hitler's armies marched into Poland, igniting World War II. It was a fitting day on which to start his career at the paper, much of which would be spent recording and reflecting upon the aftermath of that fateful day.
His nationally syndicated column appeared regularly until 1987, when he became senior columnist. He retired from The Times in 1989, without ceremony, on his 80th birthday.
In an interview marking the occasion, he said the two greatest political triumphs in his lifetime had been the common defense system developed by the West after World War II and the improvement in the lot of black people in America since 1960.
Mr. Reston, who was born in Scotland, described the men who met in Philadelphia in 1787 to draft the Constitution as the great heroes in his adopted country's history. The document that they produced, he said, made possible "the triumph of the moderates" over the next two centuries.
A moderate himself, hostile to both fascism and communism, he described journalism's role in their eclipse as "one of the great pleasures of my life."
Asked whom he had most admired, he cited Franklin D. Roosevelt as the finest President he had known and Dean Acheson, Secretary of State in the Truman Administration, as "the key man" who "came to the fork in the road" and concluded that containing the Soviet Union would require a new alliance.
But he chose Jean Monnet, the French visionary who conceived the European Community, as the greatest man he had ever known as well as the person who had most deeply influenced his own thinking. Monnet proved, Mr. Reston often said, that "if you don't demand credit for things, you can push them through."
 
First and Foremost, A Dogged Reporter
Mr. Reston thought of himself primarily as a reporter, and he often beat his competitors to be the first to write about major news events. His coverage of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington in 1944, which laid the groundwork for the United Nations, was one of the era's most important exclusives and won him his first Pulitzer, in 1945. Those articles disclosed the substance of secret documents that were then being circulated among delegations from the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China on the structure of the proposed international organization.
Mr. Reston won his second Pulitzer in 1957 for distinguished reporting from Washington. The articles cited were written in June 1956 and analyzed the effects of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's illness on the functioning of the executive branch.
He was also responsible for The Times's publication in 1955 of the documents of the 1945 Yalta Conference. And in 1954 he disclosed that J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had directed the making of the first atomic bomb, had subsequently been denied access to secret documents by the Atomic Energy Commission because of suspicion that he was passing information to the Soviet Union, a charge of which Oppenheimer was later cleared.
One exclusive dispatch came by accident. In 1971, as one of the first American reporters allowed into China, Mr. Reston developed appendicitis. His report about his surgery and postoperative acupuncture treatment, filed from his bed in the Anti-Imperialist Hospital in the capital, ran on the front page under the headline "Now, About My Operation in Peking."
 
'My Own Opinions Aren't That Good'
From the 1950's on, Mr. Reston interviewed most of the world's leaders, often producing major news accounts that were scrutinized at the State Department for their every nuance. The interviews often bore the special Reston stamp: He sought to reveal not only the policies and the politics of the people he interviewed, but also their vision of life and their view of history.
Mr. Reston, who was called Scotty by virtually everyone who knew him, was 5 feet 8 inches tall and had a round and ruddy face, gray-green eyes, an ever-present pipe and an invariably pleasant manner. He was courteous not only to officials but also to the young people who worked for him.
"He believes in hard work, in thrift, honor your parents, woman's place is in the home, play by the rules and live clean," his colleague Russell Baker once said.
Mr. Reston was credited by competitors with having more high-level news sources in Washington than almost any other reporter, although some critics felt that he was too kind in print to some of them. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith, reviewing Mr. Reston's "The Artillery of the Press," a 1967 collection of his talks before the Council on Foreign Relations, suggested that Mr. Reston had learned to his disadvantage "to treat all people in the manner of a newspaperman who must one day go back and see them again."
But in a 1980 article in The New Republic, Mr. Reston was quoted as saying: "If you spend your life as a hatchet man -- and there's something to be said for that -- then eventually you find that everybody's out to lunch when you call. You're left with only your own opinion. I wouldn't like that because my own opinions aren't that good."
Writing his column three times a week, Mr. Reston was a procrastinator, often filing right on deadline. A two-finger typist, he regularly wore out typewriters because he banged so hard on the keys, and his desk was a litter of papers, many of which bore tiny black marks where a stream of smoldering matches had landed in the course of a never-ending pipe-lighting ritual.
His columns, laced with quotations from Walter Lippmann, H. G. Wells, Matthew Arnold and Churchill, were a combination of high moral tone, detailed reporting, allusions to sports, impish humor and evocative descriptions of seasonal changes along the Potomac. They seldom offered absolute judgments about people or events; he used the word "maybe" more than most pundits.
His first column, on Oct. 18, 1953, established the Reston style.
"This town is still full of echoes from the days of America's isolation," he wrote of Washington. "It has changed in policy and personnel, more than any other world capital in the last generation. No nation has taken on so much or moved so far in such a hurry. Yet the habits of the past, like the bent figures of homeless former senators, still haunt the capital."
 
Press and Politics: 'Like Cats and Dogs'
He often returned to certain themes, such as the role of the press. In his column of Oct. 30, 1968, when Spiro T. Agnew, soon to be elected Vice President, was denouncing news organizations, Mr. Reston wrote:
"The candidates and the press are fussing at each other again, and this is the way it should be. They have different jobs, and in many ways they are natural enemies, like cats and dogs. The first job of the candidate is to win, and he usually says what he thinks will help him win. The job of the reporter is to report what happens and decontaminate as much of the political poison as he can. The conflict is obvious."
In addition to his two Pulitzer Prizes, Mr. Reston was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1986 and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Award in 1991. He received the Overseas Press Club award for interpretation of international news three times, the George Polk Memorial Award for national reporting and the French Legion of Honor, and was named Commander, Order of the British Empire. He also received 28 honorary degrees.
After retiring, he fulfilled a longtime promise to his wife, Sally, by writing his memoirs. Titled "Deadline," they were published by Random House in 1991.
Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Ronald Steel, author of "Walter Lippmann and the American Century," called Mr. Reston "the quintessential Washington insider."
"Officials used him to test out new ideas on the public or to drop leaks for which they did not want to be held accountable," Mr. Steel wrote. "Because of his high position at The Times and his personal integrity, he was trusted both by those who provided the news and by those who read it. "But what he did so well and so usefully for so long could not be done today. Journalism and the political world have changed too much."
Mr. Reston is survived by his wife; his sons, Richard F. Reston of Edgartown, Mass., James B. Reston Jr. of Chevy Chase, Md., and Thomas B. Reston of Washington; his sister, Joanna Richey of Santa Cruz, Calif., and five grandchildren.
Funeral services will be held at 10 A.M. on Saturday at Saint Albans Church on the grounds of the Washington National Cathedral.
 
Born in Scotland To Years of Poverty
James Barrett Reston began life about as far from the Washington power center as one could get.
He was born in Clydebank, Scotland, on Nov. 3, 1909, the son of James, a machinist, and Johanna Irving Reston. The Restons migrated to the United States when he was an infant, but Mrs. Reston became ill, and the family returned to Scotland.
There followed years of harsh poverty, of life in a brick tenement where young James and his sister slept crosswise at the foot of their parents' bed. In 1920 the family returned to the United States and settled in Dayton, Ohio. His father worked for the Delco Remy Division of General Motors.
When his parents were naturalized, young James automatically became an American citizen. In 1932, he graduated from the University of Illinois with an undistinguished academic record. He had majored in journalism, skipping the course in governmental reporting but getting an A in sportswriting.
During his high school years he caddied at the Dayton Country Club golf course. His own game became so good that he twice won the Ohio state public links championship and at Illinois was captain of the Big Ten championship golf team in 1932. His father wanted him to become a golf pro. His mother wanted him to be a preacher, which, he was to say later, is really what he became.
In the winters during his school days, he hung around The Dayton Daily News. "When the phone rang, I'd pick it up and take down the scores," he later recalled. "And from that I just moved into newspapering. I never thought of anything else."
Another link to the world of newspapers was Gov. James M. Cox, the Ohio publisher and 1920 Democratic Presidential candidate, for whom young Reston had caddied. Mr. Cox gave him his first job after college on one of the Cox newspapers in Ohio, The Springfield Daily News, where he earned $10 a week as the sports editor.
Later he was hired as traveling secretary and publicity director for the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. In 1934 he moved to New York as a sportswriter for the Associated Press Feature Service.
The next year he married Sally Jane Fulton, a former college classmate who had been president of her sorority, an A student and a Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year. Named Sara but always called Sally, she was the daughter of a judge from Sycamore, Ill., a small town near Chicago.
Mr. Reston once told a University of Illinois graduating class, "I should say in passing that I myself married a recklessly beautiful girl whom I first saw on Wright Street wearing a scarlet coat."
"My gal Sal," as he called her in the dedication of "Sketches in the Sand," a collection of his columns published in 1967, became his closest confidante, frequent collaborator and steadiest supporter.
They had three sons, and Mr. Reston's own happy situation made him a champion of marriage. He was forever asking his young bachelor colleagues when they were going to wed.
In 1937 The Associated Press sent Mr. Reston to London on a rather loose dual assignment: in summer covering sports events, in winter the British Foreign Office.
In 1939 he joined The Times's London bureau, with a salary of $85 a week. He was so little known on the foreign desk in New York that his first byline in The Times had his name wrong -- John instead of James.
Then came the London blitz. The Times's office for much of the war was on the seventh floor of the Reuters Building on Fleet Street, which offered a view of the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. He described this view of the battle in his first book, "Prelude to Victory."
"Before we got better sense, we used to put the lights off in the Times office every night and watch this effort," he wrote. "With uncanny regularity, the German bombers would come over just about 10 minutes after blackout and start dropping incendiary bombs all over this section. About an hour before we could see the flames, we would begin to hear the steady throb of scores of engines along the banks of the Thames; these were the pumps, driving the muddy water from the river up through miles of new hose. . . .
"A little later the sky would begin to change in color from midnight blue to a reddish glow, and soon the great dome of the cathedral would stand out in silhouette against the flames of perhaps a dozen raging fires. Night after night we watched this incredible scene, and morning after morning we marveled at the fact that the fires were somehow put out."
In December 1940 he was reassigned to Washington, and in 1942 published "Prelude to Victory," a call to action that was acclaimed here and abroad. Its theme was pure Reston: Unless Americans put aside personal aims and materialistic thinking and made sacrifices in a crusade for their country, the war would not be won.
In late 1942, Elmer Davis, head of the Office of War Information, obtained a leave of absence from The Times for Mr. Reston and sent him to London to set up the agency's effort there.
John G. Winant, the United States Ambassador to Britain, recommended him to Arthur Hays Sulzberger, then president and publisher of The Times, who was looking for an assistant. It was the beginning of Mr. Reston's close friendship with the Sulzberger family.
 
After the War Years, Washington for Good
Mr. Reston returned to Washington and was named national correspondent in 1945. He made his mark with his coverage of Dumbarton Oaks, which illustrated a Reston maxim: Seek out the disgruntled party. His theory was that people who were disenchanted were more likely to talk candidly.
In this case, it was the Chinese representatives to the conference who were disenchanted. In his memoirs, Mr. Reston told of having met Chen Yi, one of the Chinese delegates, before the war through Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, wife of The Times's publisher. At Mr. Reston's urging, Chen Yi slipped him the texts of the proposals.
Instead of writing one long article, Mr. Reston doled out the information, producing an exclusive a day. The Russians thought Washington had leaked the material; Washington suspected the British, and the F.B.I. started an investigation of Mr. Reston.
In 1948 Mr. Reston became diplomatic correspondent for The Times, and in 1953 he became Washington bureau chief, succeeding Arthur Krock. He continued as bureau chief until 1964, when he elected to step down to concentrate on his column.
In 1968 he was summoned to New York by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who had become publisher, to succeed Turner Catledge as executive editor, in charge of the entire news operation. The internal politics of the news department had received publicity after an unsuccessful effort by editors in New York to exert more control over the Washington bureau. Mr. Reston's mandate was to re-establish peace.
For 13 months he ran the news department while commuting to Washington a few times a week to write his column. It was an almost impossible job. In 1969, knowing that he had to choose between his column and the editor's post, he gladly chose the column.
Mr. Reston was eminently a Washington man. He loved and understood the capital. Moreover, he had helped shape the Washington bureau. These were his people, and many of them regarded him as a father figure. The New York office seemed to him a vast, impersonal beehive.
During these years the Restons lived in a pleasant red brick house on Woodley Road in leafy northwest Washington and spent weekends at their log cabin in Fiery Run, Va. Mr. Reston often used Fiery Run as the dateline on his Thoreau-like columns about the restorative life in the country.
In 1968 the Restons purchased The Vineyard Gazette, a 122-year-old weekly on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where they vacationed in the summer. Their son Richard is now editor and publisher, and his wife, Mary Jo, is publisher and general manager.
 
Two Cuba Episodes And the Pentagon Papers
Mr. Reston played a part in the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 and in two other major news events involving The Times in questions of national security. The others were the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.
In the spring of 1961, The Times was preparing to publish an article by Tad Szulc reporting that 5,000 or 6,000 Cuban exiles who had been training in the United States and in Central America for nine months were about to launch an invasion of Cuba to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro.
The article was planned for page 1 on April 7, under a four-column headline. But Orvil Dryfoos, then the publisher, was troubled by the security implications of the report. On April 6, he and Mr. Catledge, then managing editor, telephoned Mr. Reston, who advised them not to publish the article and cautioned against giving away the proposed timing of the landing as "imminent."
The article was published on April 7 under a one-column headline and with no mention of the invasion's date. The Bay of Pigs invasion took place 10 days later and ended in debacle. President John F. Kennedy, who took full responsibility, said that if The Times had published more about the operation, it might have saved the Administration from making such a colossal mistake.
"If I had it to do over, I would do exactly what we did at the time," Mr. Reston said later. "It is ridiculous to think that publishing the fact that the invasion was imminent would have avoided this disaster."
In 1962 Mr. Reston was apparently the only reporter who had found out that the Soviet Union, then under the leadership of Nikita S. Khrushchev, had secreted nuclear missiles in Cuba, only 90 miles from Florida. When Kennedy realized that Mr. Reston had the information, he telephoned him directly.
Four years later, Mr. Reston recounted the incident to Clifton Daniel, then managing editor of The Times.
"The President told me that he was going on television on Monday evening to report to the American people," Mr. Reston recalled. "He said that if we published the news about the missiles, Khrushchev could actually give him an ultimatum before he went on the air.
"I told the President I would report to my office in New York," Mr. Reston continued. "And if my advice was asked, I would recommend that we not publish. It was not my duty to decide."
Kennedy then called Mr. Dryfoos, the publisher, and asked him not to print Mr. Reston's article. Mr. Dryfoos left the matter up to Mr. Reston and his staff, and the article was withheld.
It was a different story, however, in 1971 when The Times obtained and published what became known as the Pentagon Papers, the Government's top-secret documents on the Vietnam War. Seeing this at once as "the story of the century," Mr. Reston was one of the editors who felt that the documents should be published because they were history and therefore no question of national security was involved.
One of Mr. Reston's contributions to journalism was the corps of young reporters he discovered and developed.
In 1961 he instituted a program of internships for young would-be reporters, modeled on the clerkships at the United States Supreme Court and suggested to him by the late Justice Felix Frankfurter. Each year he would recruit a new college graduate as his clerk and researcher. He paid a price for this program, as time and again the young clerks with lofty journalistic thoughts would mix up his airline reservations or keep the Secretary of State waiting because they had failed to cancel a scheduled appointment.
Linda Greenhouse, who went on to report on the Supreme Court for The Times, recalled that on her first day as a clerk, Mr. Reston asked her to get Ted Sorensen on the phone and suggested she try Paul Weiss in New York. After trying every Weiss-comma-Paul in the Manhattan phone book, she reported back to Mr. Reston.
"He didn't groan, tear his hair or -- more important, and the reason for my undying gratitude -- laugh at me," Ms. Greenhouse said. "He gently explained that Paul, Weiss was a New York law firm where Ted Sorensen was working, looked up the number and gave it to me."
It was perhaps this quality, this unfailing kindliness, that constituted his special attractiveness. It enabled him to view the faults and frailties of the world with compassion and to carry on in the belief that the best in mankind would eventually win out over the worst.
"Stick with the optimists, Niftie," he wrote in a column in February 1980, welcoming his new grandson, Devin Fitzgerald Reston, to the human race. "It's going to be tough enough even if they're right."

HEADLINE: Clinton Asks Crackdown On Tax Deals

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Challenging aggressive Wall Street deals that it contends have improperly stretched the tax law, the Clinton Administration proposed today to limit the deductibility of various innovative financial practices.
The limits would raise nearly $6.5 billion in the next seven years as part of a $28 billion list of initiatives included in President Clinton's budget plan that he sent to Congress today. They are intended to curb corporate subsidies and to close loopholes involving activities ranging from the issuance of 100-year bonds, to farming, to manufacturing pharmaceuticals in Puerto Rico. 
 While accounting for less than 25 percent of the total revenue at stake, much of the focus concerning the plan was on the securities industry and its role in the increasingly blurred distinction between debt and equity. Equity, or ownership interest, is often disguised as debt to generate tax deductions that issuers of debt can claim on interest they pay.
"These are abusive transactions designed to take advantage of uncertainty in the tax system," Cynthia G. Beerbower, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, said. "These are not normal things that companies do."
The proposal is likely to meet with stiff opposition in the Republican-controlled Congress, and Wall Street reacted angrily.
While some of the practices are arcane, most have become popular enough to no longer be considered unusual to Wall Street and have provided lucrative business for investment banks. On Monday, for example, Morgan Stanley & Company advertised four separate issues of 100-year debt, the latest in a string of supermaturity securities inspired largely by the drop in long-term interest rates.
The Treasury proposes to deny deductions for interest paid on debt of more than 40 years, arguing that since "few companies survive" for a century, the debt may never be paid, and the money raised is perhaps better regarded as nondeductible equity.
Another initiative would deny interest deductions to companies whose money-raising transactions are tailored so that the interest or principal is paid not in cash but in the stock of the company or a related party. By calling the instrument debt -- until it is paid off in stock -- the company can entitle itself to a tax deduction.
The Treasury proposed that most of the changes take effect today.
A. B. Krongard, chairman of the Securities Industry Association, a trade group, declared, "This gives the appearance of sort of being slapped onto the tax package to achieve gains in the same way that when you finish making a salad, you might say, 'What the heck,' and throw in a couple of pieces of grapefruit."
Walid A. Chammah, an architect of many 50- and 100-year bond deals for clients at Morgan Stanley, said the industry would work hard for reconsideration of the 40-year limit. He argued that the supermaturity securities should not be treated like equity because companies were obliged to make interest and principal payments regardless of business conditions, whereas dividends on stock could always be eliminated.
Other major losers would be Goldman, Sachs and Merrill Lynch. Goldman is the creator and biggest underwriter of monthly income preferred stock -- subordinated debt, either bonds or notes, that has been repackaged as preferred stock bearing a monthly or quarterly interest payment that is tax deductible for the issuer.
In seeking to curb these securitities, the Treasury complained that they were set up to be treated by companies as debt for tax purposes, while shown on the company balance sheet as equity.
Issuers of securities, the Clinton Administration argued, should not be able to obtain the best of both stocks and bonds.
Wall Street, however, noted very quickly that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin was formerly the co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs.
Another proposal attacks the practice of issuing securities labeled debt but with very low interest rates or other features that in effect force their conversion into stock. The Treasury seeks to defer the deduction until maturity or to eliminate it if the instrument is converted before then.
Following are other Administration proposals involving securities:
Companies that own less than 20 percent of another company's stock can now deduct 70 percent of the dividends they receive from that stake. The Administration proposes to cut that deduction to 50 percent, reducing the incentive for "tax arbitrage."
Companies making stock purchases with the intent of qualifying for a deduction on the dividends received from that stock would be compelled to honor the 46-day holding period "at a time proximate" to each dividend to insure that the company runs market risk on its holding, or else the company would fail to qualify for the deduction.
In corporate reorganizations, the Administration proposes several rules intended to prevent shareholders of target companies from deferring gains for tax purposes if they no longer maintain a continuing interest in the surviving company.
In contrast to these financial proposals, which Ms. Beerbower described as "brand new," various of the Administration's other revenue-raising proposals have been addressed repeatedly.
One of the more contentious, tax breaks for companies doing business in United States territories, would extend limitations enacted in 1993. The proposal of the Republicans on this issue is less severe.

HEADLINE: CLINTON OUTLINES ALTERNATE PLAN TO HALT DEFICIT

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Hoping to get budget negotiations with Congress off the ground, President Clinton today offered a new plan that he said would balance the budget in seven years, but it was immediately assailed by Republican leaders.
Following a 90-minute negotiating session in the Capitol this afternoon, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said of the President's new proposal: "We think it works. We think it's credible. We think it's defensible." 
 But Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, declared: "I am as disappointed as I can be. They do not in any way bridge the gap."
And his counterpart in the House, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, said that the Democrats were "not just a day and a dollar short -- they're 17 days late and $400 billion short."
It was impossible to tell how much of this reaction was political theater and how much was genuine disgust with the President's position. Whatever the case, the negotiators from both sides agreed to resume meeting on Friday.
Participants said today's session had few of the angry exchanges and sharp recriminations that had characterized previous negotiations.
"For the first time in five meetings," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, "we actually started turning pages and talking about policy. We weren't shouting at each other, and that hadn't happened before."
Today's proposal amounts to the third budget President Clinton has offered this year. It differs only on the margins from the one he put forth last June that was supposed to balance the budget in nine years.
The main change was the President's offer to make cuts averaging 5 percent in some domestic programs, which he did not specify. He said high-priority programs would not be trimmed.
One new proposal today, trivial in budget terms but important on Wall Street, would crack down on various aggressive or innovative financial practices that turn on stretching the tax law farther than the Administration believes is acceptable. [Article, page D1.]
What is important is that both sides now have their opening offers on the table. Neither offer -- today's proposal by the White House and the mammoth budget legislation approved by Congress last month and vetoed by the President on Wednesday -- will ever become law, but they mark the starting points for the negotiations.
Under the agreement that ended last month's partial shutdown of the Government, funds will run out again on Dec. 15 unless all the spending bills are approved or a new temporary extension of spending authority is adopted.
Mr. Clinton suggested today that Congress allow more breathing room by approving a temporary spending bill that would run through January. Mr. Kasich assessed the chances of Congress's accepting that as between "slim and none."
The biggest hurdle to be overcome is that the two sides are operating from different economic assumptions. The Administration's forecast, prepared by the Office of Management and Budget, is slightly more optimistic than the one Congress uses, which was done by the Congressional Budget Office.
But the slight differences mushroom when they are stretched to cover seven years. The result is that Congress, using its figures, had to find $812 billion in savings over seven years to have the budget in balance by 2002, while the Administration needed only $465 billion to make its figures balance.
The Congressional Budget Office plans to provide a recalculated forecast next week that is expected to narrow the difference somewhat, but the two sides will still be hundreds of billions of dollars apart.
Mr. Panetta suggested that these differences would become moot if the negotiators could agree to some kind of enforcement mechanism that would lock in a balanced budget whatever the state of the economy turned out to be. But though he repeated the term over and over, Mr. Panetta did not describe what such a mechanism might look like.
Still, the main obstacle in the way of compromise seems to be not so much the dollars as the principles. The Republicans are determined to shrink the size of the Federal Government and reduce its place in the lives of Americans, while the Democrats in most instances want to keep the Government's influence and control.
The new proposal does not fundamentally change the extent to which the President wants to preserve Federal assistance to poor people and the Republicans want to diminish it.
This basic dispute flared briefly in today's closed-door negotiations, participants said. White House officials insisted that Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, must remain a Federal program that would serve everyone who met Federal eligibility requirements. Republicans said that was out of the question and demanded that the program be turned over to the states to administer as they want.
Mr. Clinton's new plan suggests spending about $140 billion less over the next seven years than did the plan he put forward in June.
About a quarter of that would come from adopting the Bureau of Labor Statistics' new method of calculating inflation. The new calculation would lead to smaller annual cost-of-living increases in Social Security and other benefit programs and to higher tax revenue.
Another sizable chunk would come from selling Government assets, including Governors Island in New York Harbor, and from a new auction of space on the broadcast spectrum.
But the biggest single share, $64 billion, would result from unspecified savings in domestic programs.
As described by Administration officials, spending on most Government programs would be cut by an average of 5 percent below current levels. The cuts would not affect benefits called entitlements, military programs or programs the Administration calls high-priority investments. The cuts in the other programs would amount to 20 percent after adjustments for inflation, the officials said.
The officials would not specify what they consider investments except to say that the term included education, job-training, technology and environment programs. Spending on these programs, the officials said, would not be cut and in some instances might be increased.
They suggested that the reductions would fall in areas like housing, energy and transportation.
This offering is quite similar to President George Bush's proposal several years ago for a "flexible freeze" on Government spending, an idea that Democrats ridiculed at the time for its lack of specificity.
The President made no changes in the proposals put forth in June for Medicare, Medicaid or tax reductions, and these remain the biggest points of departure between his budget and Congress's.
Congress found $270 billion in savings from Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, and $163 billion in Medicaid. The Administration countered with $124 billion from Medicare and $54 billion from Medicaid.
Congress would cut taxes by $245 billion; the Administration, by $98 billion. By the Administration's reckoning, 47 percent of the Republicans' tax cuts would be realized by taxpayers with incomes over $100,000, while that would be true of only 15 percent of Mr. Clinton's tax reductions.
In addition to the usual budget items, the Administration's proposal today included an increase of the minimum hourly wage to $5.15 from $4.25 and a line-item veto, which would allow the President to veto specific items in spending bills. These proposals were seen more as bargaining chips than as measures Congress was likely to accept.
While most of the attention was on the budget negotiations, Congress took further action on two spending bills. One would dismantle President Clinton's program to get more police officers on the street. The other would reduce funds for the Environmental Protection Agency. The President has vowed to veto both.
By essentially party-line votes, the Senate approved money for the Departments of State, Justice and Commerce, and the House approved a measure for the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
An intriguing proposal by the President today would raise $15.3 billion over seven years by selling off rights to an invaluable parcel of the nation's airwaves now being used by television broadcasters.
The idea is certain to meet intense opposition from broadcasters, a politically powerful force, and it could indeed wreak havoc for television viewers about 10 years from now. For those reasons, its approval by Congress is extremely doubtful.
Under the Administration proposal, the Federal Communications Commission would force all broadcasters to speed up their transition to new digital transmission technology that would make it possible to transmit sharper pictures and multiple programs over a single channel.
Then, between the year 2000 and 2002, the agency would force broadcasters to give up their television channels and would auction off those licenses to the highest bidders.

HEADLINE: Christians Against Welfare Cuts Are Arrested in Capitol

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
In a barely noticed counterpoint to the budget battle, 55 evangelical Christian preachers and their followers were arrested today in the Capitol Rotunda as they sought to speak up for the poor and to confront lawmakers with biblical verses against retreating from society's duty to help the needy.
"Woe to the legislators of infamous laws," the demonstrators recited in unison. In paraphrase, the words of the prophet Isaiah boomed about the Capitol dome as the police moved in and the demonstrators lambasted Republicans and Democrats alike for variously demonizing and bureaucratizing the poor. "Woe to those who issue tyrannical decrees, who refuse justice to the unfortunate." 
 The demonstrators sought arrest under the Capitol ban on public demonstrations in order to dramatize the fact that while competing budget plans would drastically reshape and crimp the Government's welfare obligation, virtually no ideas had been sought from the impoverished communities where the Christian groups help the more-resilient poor run self-help programs.
"The poor don't have a voice here," said the Rev. Jim Wallis, editor of Sojourners magazine, stressing that the preachers' roots are in neighborhood evangelical and Pentecostal churches, not the Christian Coalition and other groups that regularly lobby lawmakers in the name of God and religion. "The poor don't have the clout. They don't have the special interest."
No lawmakers were at the scene to watch as the Capitol police obliged the demonstrators, gently handcuffing them as they knelt and sang hymns before statues of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
But a passing group of eighth-graders from St. Luke's Roman Catholic School in McLean, Va., was transfixed at the unexpected display of peaceful protest in the heart of Government. They broke into applause to hail the demonstrators as the latter were marched off as they sang, "Lead me, Oh Lord, to Thee."
"I think it's good, what they did," Eamon Eager, 14, told a St. Luke's classmate. "They got their point through."
The youngsters' social studies teacher, Mary Ellen Sawyer, found that the demonstrators offered a timely lesson.
"Personally, I'm proud of the fact that our Government takes care of the basic human needs of its people." Ms. Sawyer said, "and I'm ashamed to think that we would be withdrawing that support."
With both houses caught up in debating other issues, and Democratic and Republican budget negotiators elsewhere, the demonstrators barely made a ripple as they gathered by the East Capitol steps, near two other protests, one for AIDS research and the other for gun controls.
"Hope is slashed and dreams are burnt alive," the Rev. Graylan Scott Ellis-Hagler shouted, rallying the demonstrators up the Capitol steps.
"Say it, brother!" a preacher responded. "We are being pushed to economic non-existence by the debate going on in there."
The religious demonstrators, acting in an association known as Call to Renewal, urged legislators to visit church self-help programs across the country to get first-hand guidance about their determination to end welfare dependency. They criticized Democrats as overrelying on Government to be the welfare mechanism while being wary of church-state partnerships in charity. And they criticized the Republicans as making a wholesale retreat on welfare in the name of deficit reduction.
"To simply slash and burn and dismantle all systems and safety nets without anything in their place is immoral," Mr. Wallis said. "It's a sin, and we reject it."
The demonstrators, which complained that Congress turned too often to the religious right for political blessings, run a variety of local programs for the poor, including clinics, after-school care, job training, housing loans and construction agencies.
Mr. Wallis said that Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, met with the group's leaders last spring and expressed an interest in what they were doing, but that he then produced a budget plan that would gut programs like the earned income tax credit for the working poor.
So, resorting to demonstrating in behalf of the poor, they renounced what one speaker termed the pro-affluent "flat-earth fundamentalism" that often passed for Christian activism in the Capitol. They proposed instead a "partnership" social program for the poor and urged lawmakers to remember Jesus' words to the effect that what one had done to the lowliest person one had done to him as well.
"The only big housing program in the last 10 years has been mandatory sentencing," declared the Rev. Ellis-Hagler of Washington, underlining his complaint that Congress preferred to see a convict costing society $27,000 a year rather than to invest less money in him earlier in education and jobs.
The preachers complained that budget plans included provisions to help the rich with tax breaks while reducing benefits for the poor. The speakers repeatedly resorted to Scripture in shouts of advice.
To all those in power in Washington, they offered some divine anger by way of Isaiah: "What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor?"

HEADLINE: Leader Calls Cutbacks Vital For French Role in Europe

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The French Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, made some remarkably candid comments on Tuesday about why the French Government is determined to endure the worst unrest in a decade -- fear that France will permanently cede economic leadership in Europe to Germany.
"Either we will play in the first division or we will continue to be weighted down by deficits, and we slip back to the second division," Mr. Juppe said in a speech to Parliament. "In short, we will have moved over to the path of decline, slowly but surely." 
 Though he did not name France's mighty neighbor on the other side of the Rhine, no one doubted the reference was primarily to Germany.
Long the country of low inflation, a stable currency and industrial strength, Germany has emerged as the dominant force in Europe economy and the leader in moving the Continent toward greater integration, free trade and a single currency in the 21st century.
But whether France will be part of that is still a big question.
France's budget deficits have ballooned in the 1990's. Its currency has fluctuated widely, repeatedly becoming the target of market speculators. French interest rates have been far above those in Germany, driving away corporate investment. And France has developed an economy so top-heavy with Government employees reaping generous benefits, that its private-sector has struggled unsuccessfully to create new jobs that would ease a stubborn 13 percent unemployment rate.
"The French Government has been seized by a sense of emergency, prompting it to push reforms at an unusually high pace and frequency," said Jean-Francois Mercier, a French economist for Salomon Brothers in London. "There are worries that if France is not ready to join Germany in a single currency in two years, it may never be ready."
And it grates on both French politicians and business leader that Germany has emerged so dominant. For years, France has lived in the shadow of German economic might. Its has had to devalue its currency several times against the German mark. It has yet to shake its reputation of a high- inflation country. And its industry has lagged that of Germany.
"The French-German relationship is skin deep, there is real animosity there," said one French economist who insisted on anonymity. "French businessmen often blame their problems on the Germans."
But if France can put its house in order, it stands to benefit considerably: lower interest rates, a more stable business environment and more of a say in European economic policy.
Mr. Juppe's path to new credibility and a voice for France in European economic affairs is a series of five reforms over the next two years that in their totality would raise taxes and slash Government spending by more than $55 billion.
In American terms, that is more ambitious than if President Clinton and Congress agreed to balance the United States budget over the next two years, instead of the seven years currently being debated.
By far the most onerous reform is the proposed overhaul of the French state health system, which runs an annual deficit of $12 billion and has accumulated debts of $50 billion. Mr. Juppe plans a series of new taxes and other measures to eliminate them.
These include imposing a 10 percent surtax on corporate profits and raising social security taxes to 2.9 percent of taxable income, from 2.4 percent currently. Last summer, Mr. Juppe increased France's value added tax to 20 percent from 18 percent.
"This has angered France's white-collar union leaders, because their principal power base is among workers in the health system and they see this as possibly eroding their power," said Paul Horne, chief international economist for Smith Barney Inc. in Paris.
Transport workers are upset because of cutbacks proposed for the nation's train system, which is running deficits of $2.4 billion a year and has an accumulated debt of more than $35 billion. Mr. Juppe has said that in return for the state assuming a large chunk of the debt, the rail system has to close 3,600 miles of uneconomic track and lay off workers.
A third plan that has disturbed civil servants is a plan to increase the retirement age to 65, from 60, and increase to 40 years from 37 years the time a worker has to contribute to the system in order to get the highest benefit.
Finally, Mr. Juppe has promised to get France's privatization plan back on track for France Telecom, the country's telephone system, and Air France, its national airline. But this is likely to mean a loss of jobs, which has union leaders steaming.
Though many have predicted the Government will backtrack, the markets seem to believe in the resolve of both Mr. Juppe and Jacques Chirac, the French President. After a swoon last week, the French stock market has rebounded this week, the franc has firmed, and the Bank of France today lowered a key interest rate.
Mr. Chirac today repeated his commitment to the reforms. After a meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany, with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he told a news conference, "our budget constraints have been approved by Parliament; there is no question of putting them into question."
What is making the current reforms particularly difficult is that the deadline is fast approaching when European governments must decide which countries have shown the budget discipline to be part of the first group of nations that make up the new European currency.
That decision will be made in early 1998, based on economic performance in 1997. Under the Maastricht Treaty that established the push towards a single currency and a single European market, governments must have budget deficits of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product, as well as fulfilling other criteria on inflation, total accumulated debt and interest rates.
Currently only Germany and Luxembourg meet all the tests. France's annual budget deficit is approaching 6 percent of G.D.P. this year, twice the Maastricht level.
While Mr. Chirac denied today that Maastricht was dictating the pace of his reforms, almost across Europe, governments are cutting their budget deficits in order to meet the treaty's standards.
France is also handicapped by a rapidly slowing economy and may entering the a recession.

HEADLINE: Feldman Vows to Renegotiate

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from last night's statement by Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, after the defeat of the proposed teachers' contract. 
 Understandably angered at their terrible conditions, the two-year wait for salary increases to kick in and the general lack of regard for education and educators in this city, teachers are sending us back to the bargaining table.
Although I believe it will be extremely tough to do any better in this economic climate, we will certainly do our damndest. Hopefully, the message teachers have sent to the Mayor will encourage more flexibility on the city's part.
Let me say that I fully understand the disappointment that New York City's teachers have shown with this contract proposal. While it did reach a top salary of $70,000, offer job security for what looks like a turbulent next three years and provide a wide range of professional improvements, teachers are most angry at having to wait two years for a salary increase. That anger was exacerbated by the Mayor announcing pay increases for himself and other political and management people just before the voting began.
It's bad enough that our teachers are forced to work under the most horrendous conditions in the state, with overcrowded and jam-packed classrooms, with school buildings that are literally falling apart and often without even the most basic supplies, such as paper, chalk, textbooks and science equipment. The Mayor's proposal for pay raises for politicians and managers, while asking teachers to wait two years, was just plain insulting.
We now face great uncertainty as we go back into bargaining. . . . But we will be going back to the table for teachers. We will do so with renewed determination and will fight hard again for an agreement that is acceptable to our 68,000 teachers -- who I firmly believe are the best in this nation.

HEADLINE: Budget-Busy Capital Now Fixes Gaze on Bull Market

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Politicians in Washington are always wary of the financial markets, an unpredictable force playing by shifting rules that few in this city pretend to understand. And the markets never quite know how to measure the odd political dynamics of budget battles.
Now, however, anxiety about a link in the fates of the budget talks and the nation's soaring stock and bond markets has begun to rise here among Democrats and Republicans alike. 
 Almost everyone says the sky-high markets are sky high in part because there is a worldwide assumption that a budget deal will be struck, the deficit will come down, and low interest rates will sink lower still. And in subtle and unsubtle ways, everyone from Speaker Newt Gingrich to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin is beginning to question what will happen to the markets -- and who will bear the blame -- if the result of the negotiations is a prolonged struggle or a total breakdown. Hardly a day goes by in which someone does not jockey for position, ahead of the disaster they all say must be averted.
Mr. Gingrich is the most blatant in using the fear of a market sell-off as a weapon to win his way. Earlier this week he warned that "you will see interest rates skyrocket and the stock market crash" if Republicans fail to deliver on their promises. Naturally the Democrats were quick to call his comments irresponsible.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, who makes a science of cryptic pronouncements, has been far less apocalyptic than the Speaker but has said that if there is "a shattering of expectation," the market's reaction "could be quite negative." Mr. Greenspan defined that reaction for Congress recently as an increase in long-term interest rates that would push mortgage rates higher -- always a way to get a politician's attention as an election year approaches -- and that could send "interest-sensitive areas of the economy into trouble."
Then there is Mr. Rubin, perhaps the most circumspect of all, because his status as Washington's most prominent Wall Street veteran gives his opinions special weight. At a recent strategy session at the White House, he talked at some length about the quirky way in which markets can ignore bad news in good times and fixate relentlessly on the same news in bad or nervous times. He laid out a "probability curve" of what would happen if the budget talks failed, ranging from "a chance nothing will happen" to the markets, to "a chance of a mild reaction, and a chance of a very big one."
Mr. Rubin did not offer any odds on those alternatives, people who attended the meeting say, but called them "all realistic probabilities." The danger, he said, is that the markets could miss a political cue by focusing on budget negotiators' narrowing numerical differences, which might lead Wall Street to think a deal was imminent, instead of on ideology that divides the two parties.
On several occasions since arriving in Washington three years ago, Mr. Rubin has remarked that Wall Street executives little understand the politics of putting together a Federal budget -- a comment that only he could safely make, because he used to be one of those executives.
"The Delta shuttle only flies 250 miles, but this is a case where New York and Washington seem a thousand miles apart," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs & Company, who travels often between those two worlds. "The disconnect between the two cities may be wider than ever now."
Ordinarily, Wall Street is pretty good at discounting the daily detritus of Washington's machinations. On any given day, 10-day car sales or the index of leading indicators has a lot more to do with the movement of the markets than do predictions about what the Federal debt will look like in 2002.
But these are not ordinary times. The high level of the markets has made a lot of people nervous that the end of a remarkable run is approaching. And that nervousness in itself means that blips in the budget process that might be shrugged off when the markets are behaving more modestly can quickly become what one of Mr. Rubin's confidants calls "the brick that pushes over the whole load."
Budget and market optimists alike say this is an exaggerated concern. No matter how the negotiations turn out, they say, the long-term trend will be toward smaller deficits, and the markets will ignore the details.
In any case, the markets are betting for now that the budget talks are taking on a momentum of their own that will ultimately carry the negotiators toward a deal.
"Who would win if that doesn't happen?" Senator William V. Roth, the Delaware Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee, asked today at a breakfast with several reporters. "No one knows. It is possible both sides could lose, and that could spur a third party" to enter the 1996 Presidential race.
What seems certain is that each side will be walking a thin line in coming weeks, trying to intimidate the other with forecasts of how the markets might react to failure while carefully trying to avoid anything that might bring on that reaction. Mr. Rubin has warned that America's standing abroad will suffer if the nation seems perpetually only one step ahead of default because of Congress's refusal to approve an increase in the Government's borrowing authority. That is another way of saying the United States could be left with paying slightly higher interest rates on its debt.
Mr. Gingrich, meanwhile, will continue to argue that Mr. Rubin is manipulating the markets. Recalling one instance in which Mr. Rubin warned of the possibility of default -- which the Secretary has avoided by using techniques that the Speaker has condemned -- he said Mr. Rubin "held his breath; his face turned red."
No one can remember that actually happening. But if the Administration cannot keep up its current balancing act -- high standing in the polls, high markets, some movement toward compromise -- it could start any day.

HEADLINE: In Package Deal, Greenspan May Stay On at Fed

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Passing up a chance to reshape the Federal Reserve for fear of a political battle with Congress, the Clinton Administration is leaning toward reappointing the central bank's top two officers as a package deal.
Administration officials hope that Senate Republicans' fondness for the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, will persuade them to accept another term for the vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder. 
 The Administration is also planning to try to fill a third, already vacant seat on the board as part of the package of nominations, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
While no decision has been made on reappointing Mr. Greenspan, White House officials have operated for months on the assumption that President Clinton will name him to a rare third term. Such a move would reflect the White House's respect for his success in controlling inflation and an acknowledgment that any other choice might alarm the markets and run into opposition in Congress.
President Ronald Reagan appointed Mr. Greenspan, a prominent Republican economist, to his first term in 1987, and George Bush reappointed him early in 1992. But there are ample precedents for a President to reappoint a Federal Reserve chairman of the other party -- most recently in Mr. Reagan's first term, when he redesignated Paul A. Volcker, a Carter appointee.
Mr. Blinder, since being named vice chairman last year, has pushed his colleagues to allow slightly lower short-term interest rates in hopes that the economy can grow a little faster with little if any extra inflation. The Administration wants to keep him at the Federal Reserve, and hopes that packaging him with Mr. Greenspan will allow them to avoid their worst-case scenario: confirmation of Mr. Greenspan, while the nominations of Mr. Blinder and another Clinton appointee languish in the Senate or are rejected.
Even if the Administration proposes three nominations at the same time, the Senate is not obliged to consider them together. But Mr. Greenspan's influence and visibility might allow less strenuous opponents of inflation to win approval.
However, Mr. Blinder's willingness to remain in Washington is in some doubt. "I am genuinely undecided about whether to seek a second term, and because I don't know, nobody else can know," Mr. Blinder said in an interview this week. He had previously planned to return to Princeton University, where he is an economics professor.
Mr. Blinder had become disenchanted with the job last summer, prompting Administration officials to ask Richard Syron, head of the American Stock Exchange and a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, whether he would like to become vice chairman. But in recent discussions with Administration officials, Mr. Blinder has expressed more enthusiasm
"We'd much rather he stay on," said an Administration official who requested anonymity.
At least two people are under consideration for the other vacancy. They are Sheila L. Tschinkel, research director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and Eugene A. Ludwig, Comptroller of the Currency, the nation's top regulator of Federal-chartered banks.
Ms. Tschinkel declined comment today. Mr. Ludwig, responding to a brief message asking about his plans for any job changes, Mr. Ludwig left a message on Wednesday night saying that "I have no plans to leave my job as comptroller." Today, he declined through a spokeswoman to comment specifically on the Federal Reserve position.
Interest-rate policy at the Federal Reserve is made by a committee composed of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four presidents of the 11 other Fed regional banks, who rotate on the committee.
One seat on the board has been vacant since the retirement last spring of John P. LaWare, a New England banker. Mr. LaWare strongly urged in his resignation letter that another banker be named to succeed him, in keeping with a tradition that one of the Federal Reserve Board governors always be a former banker because the Fed regulates bank holding companies and many large, state-chartered banks.
Ms. Tschinkel is a former vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank, where she managed the bank's portfolio of domestic and foreign securities. Mr. Ludwig is a former law partner at Covington & Burling in Washington, who represented many big banks. He attended Oxford University and law school at Yale University with President Clinton.
Several officials said it was unclear whether Mr. Ludwig would consider one of the seven seats on the Federal Reserve Board to be a promotion. He currently oversees an agency regulating 3,000 banks.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The U.N.'s Master Juggler;
An Accountant Copes With Deadbeats and Bad Debt

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 1

 BODY:
It sounds like a chief financial officer's nightmare: a multinational corporation with no cash reserves, with no authority to raise capital or write off bad debts and with its most influential customer a chronic deadbeat who cheerfully admits that the billion or more dollars he owes will not be in the mail soon.
Joseph E. Connor doesn't need to imagine such a nightmare. For the last year and a half, he has lived it as the United Nations Under Secretary General for Administration and Management, trying to impose financial sanity on an organization tottering on the brink of insolvency, thanks to the refusal of member countries -- most notably the United States -- to pay their dues. 
 Few financial managers as seasoned as Mr. Connor would risk their reputations trying to rescue an organization whose finances have the characteristics of a Ponzi scheme. "I've never seen anything so precariously balanced at this scale," he said in his office on the 27th floor of the Secretariat building overlooking midtown Manhattan. "There's no capital and no reserves."
What abounds are lots of headaches: dues paid late or not at all, forcing bookkeeping sleights of hand such as dipping into emergency peacekeeping funds to finance routine expenses; a staff that cannot be reduced, at least for now, because there is not enough money for buyouts; the inability to borrow money, even from the World Bank, and sinking esteem in the United States and elsewhere.
While most people assume the United Nations will somehow limp along, as it has done for the last half century, Mr. Connor is not convinced. As a certified public accountant, he bases his analysis on hard numbers, not politics. He speculates that 1996 could be a year of reckoning as peacekeeping missions are scaled back and member assessments drop, generating too little money to repay what was borrowed to finance the regular budget.
Member countries, he predicts, will provide only $500 million of the $1.2 billion in assessments due in February, barely enough to carry the organization through next spring. "The expedient financial improprieties that we progressively adopted suddenly come home to roost," he said.
The 64-year-old Mr. Connor's descent into the financial chaos of the United Nations follows an accounting career of proven probity. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, he earned a master's degree in business from Columbia University and worked for 37 years for Price Waterhouse, retiring as its chairman in 1993. He taught at the Georgetown University School of Business before Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked him to take his current job on May 1, 1994.
At Price Waterhouse, Mr. Connor handled the books for the Exxon Corporation and other blue-chip companies like Allied Signal Inc., Young & Rubicam Inc. and the Hewlett-Packard Company. The United Nations, by contrast, "is the type of company that we wouldn't have accepted as a client," he said with a smile.
The United States is by far the biggest delinquent, owing $1.23 billion of the organization's total arrears of $2.7 billion. It is perpetually nine months behind because in 1982 the Reagan Administration began delaying its payments from the February due date to the beginning of Washington's fiscal year the following October.
Few other counties meet the February deadline either, but now the Republican-controlled Congress has carried American backsliding a step further by slashing appropriations for both ordinary expenses and the cost of United Nations peacekeeping missions around the world.
Because of the unpredictable cash flow, Mr. Connor said, "We manage our finances imprudently because we have to." He called his job a juggling act, adding, "It really requires a lot of attention to keep the organization from foundering."
Performing some of his most inventive juggling, Mr. Connor has raided payments earmarked for peacekeeping to pay salaries and other routine bills. This has meant postponing reimbursements to the countries that send troops to the world's hot spots at $985 or more per soldier per month. By the end of the year, the United Nations expects to owe $1 billion to such contributors.
Mr. Connor has also used new peacekeeping payments to work off some of the United Nations' most pressing debts. And to find $20 million to finance the tribunal in The Hague that is investigating war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia, he dipped into the regular budget.
"In the textbooks it's called a Ponzi scheme: use current cash to pay past bills," said Mr. Connor, who did not hide his distaste. "We had to shout from the rooftops, 'This is what we were doing,' and no one said, 'Stop.' "
What is to be done to plug the deficit? Right now, Mr. Connor is pushing for much earlier payments for peacekeeping missions. He has also come up with a series of inventive money-raising ideas.
One is borrowed from the world of retailing, where overdue bills are a way of life. "Every day on Seventh Avenue, when a retailer can't collect, he factors them by selling them at a discount to intermediaries," Mr. Connor said. Similarly, he said, the United Nations could convert its mounting arrears into cash by selling overdue obligations at a discount.
Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs (International) and a former assistant secretary of state for economic affairs in the Reagan Administration, called the idea interesting but said it needed a lot of work. "I think Wall Street would probably be interested, but at a substantial discount," Mr. Hormats said in a telephone interview. He went on to wonder if a government would feel less obligated to pay if the debt was transferred into private hands.
Mr. Connor has floated some other imaginative proposals, to no avail. Earlier this fall, he suggested that the United Nations be allowed to borrow from the World Bank. The bank rejected this, however, because it is only allowed to lend to sovereign nations.
And at Mr. Connor's behest, Mr. Boutros-Ghali took a novel solution to the leaders of the wealthy industrialized nations at their meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, earlier this year. He proposed creating a kind of bond that would assign debts of member countries in arrears to other member countries that were owed money. The proposal met with silence. There is no provision in the United Nations Charter to raise money on the financial markets.
Mr. Connor also started to reduce the work force of 14,380 employees at the organization's New York headquarters. But his buyout plan was never carried out for lack of $10 million to compensate 165 employees who agreed to retire early.
He estimated that perhaps 15 percent of expenditures could be saved by eliminating overlap in the sprawling operations of the United Nations. But dispensing with duplication is difficult because the Secretary General lacks control over the numerous semiautonomous agencies, like Unesco and Unicef.
"The organization has the narrowest type of executive line of authority," Mr. Connor said. "By contrast, there's no question about who's in charge of I.B.M."
In another move inspired by Mr. Connor, Mr. Boutros-Ghali instituted a cash conservation program on Sept. 12. It included freezing the recruitment of new employees and curtailing staff overtime and travel. About $60 million was saved to meet the next payroll; Mr. Connor describes it as only a Band-Aid.
Mr. Connor has trimmed operating costs to produce a biennial budget for 1996-97 that he says will be 4.2 percent less in real dollars than the present one. But anticipated savings may be mostly offset by the weakness of the dollar, the official denomination of the United Nations, against the Swiss franc, which is the working currency for the group's operation in Geneva.
Even the cost-cutting that Mr. Connor has brought to the United Nations has real limits. Many expenses are mandated by the Security Council or General Assembly, whose members show little interest in folding up projects that outlive their usefulness. And executives at the United Nations lack the sort of management skills taken for granted in private business.
"In my first year at Price Waterhouse, I was reviewed five times," Mr. Connor said. "Here that doesn't happen." The United Nations gets around to its evaluations every three years, which Mr. Connor described as "ridiculous."
He is not the first high-powered American to despair over the sad state of the United Nations' books. Dick Thornburgh, a former United States Attorney General who held Mr. Connor's post in 1992 and 1993, remarked in a report at the end of his tenure that "the term 'financial crisis' has become so overworked as to be a permanent description of the organization's financial status."
Today, Mr. Thornburgh remains pessimistic. "It's an impossible job if the leadership of the organization is not committed to reform," he said in an interview. "I think there is an obvious devotion to the status quo at the upper levels of the U.N."
For all his frustration, Mr. Connor says he has no regrets about taking his job. He said he felt he could not refuse the Clinton Administration's request, but added that he jumped at the challenge, in part because of a life-long interest in politics. "Frankly, I like what I'm doing," he said.
To bail the United Nations out of virtual bankruptcy, he said, the countries that owe money must commit themselves to a payments timetable, as Russia recently did; systems must be created for writing off bad debts and for turning commitments into cash quickly, and the scale used to assess members must be reviewed to make countries more willing to pay.
Otherwise, Mr. Connor said, "when we run out of regular budget cash, we'll close the door, because there's nothing else we can do."
"It's an easy management decision," he added wryly.

Chart: "Midlife Crisis"
 As the U.N. turns 50, these are its most pressing financial problems:
 
1. NO LIQUIDITY -- The organization suffers from a chronic shortage of cash. A $250 million reserve fund was cleaned out long ago.
 
2. INABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL -- The U.N. lacks standing in the financial market; the World Bank says it cannot lend to the U.N.
 
3. UNPREDICTABLE CASH FLOW -- A majority of the 185 member states have stopped paying their dues on time.
 
4. NO WRITE-OFF BAD DEBT -- The biggest member, the United States, owes more than $1 billion and will not pay.
 
5. DECLINING REVENUE -- Smaller peacekeeping assessments cannot cover unpaid expenses or reimbursements to countries that contribute troops.
 
6. LACK OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE -- The U.N. does not have an executive training program. Hiring and promotions are sometimes guided by politics instead of management skills. (pg. D1)

HEADLINE: In Primary Season, Big Question Is, Who's On First?

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
It is not as threatening as plummeting hog prices or widespread corn blight. But a move in Louisiana to hold Presidential caucuses ahead of those in Iowa has infuriated top Republican officials in Iowa who feel proprietary about their first-in-the-nation standing.
This week, Iowa's Governor and House Speaker held news conferences to denounce the idea, which has been proposed by Louisiana Republicans. One of Iowa's United States Senators has asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Louisiana's plan violates Federal civil rights laws. And the state's Republican Party has asked all Presidential contenders not to campaign in Louisiana. 
 "Iowans feel very passionate about their first-in-the-nation status," said Brian Kennedy, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. "It's something we take very seriously. I think people in other states have a hard time appreciating this."
Among those that do not seem to get it is the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee, which earlier this year switched from a Presidential primary in March to caucuses now scheduled for Feb. 6, one week before the Iowa caucuses.
Louisiana Republican officials say the change was made to give a state in the South -- an area of growing Republican strength -- a voice in the early primaries. And they hope that Louisiana's culinary and climatic inducements will lure candidates and journalists to their state.
"We offer gumbo instead of Iowa snow," said Rhett Davis, a consultant for the Louisiana Republican Party.
The dispute between Iowa and Louisiana is not the only example of electoral rivalries among states. Having fended off efforts by Arizona to hold the country's first primary, New Hampshire officials are now upset by Delaware's plan to conduct a Presidential primary four days after the one in their state. Such an occurrence would violate a New Hampshire law requiring that its primary be seven days before a "similar contest" in any other state.
Officials in Iowa and New Hampshire say that if Louisiana and Delaware do not alter their plans, they will move up the dates of their contests to make sure they remain first by a sufficiently wide margin.
State officials in Iowa and New Hampshire evoke tradition to defend the status quo, even though the predictive value of some of these early Presidential contest has been dubious at best. Since 1976, no winner of a hotly contested Iowa caucus has gone on to win the Presidency.
Nevertheless, Iowa and New Hampshire officials, fearful that too many states may be tempted move the primary and caucus dates close to or ahead of theirs, continue to spurn efforts to share the limelight.
"If other states like Louisiana look to move ahead of Iowa, and others look to move ahead of Louisiana, it will have a snowball effect," said Ron Corbett, Speaker of the Iowa House of Representatives. "We're concerned that if other states move ahead of us, our role in winnowing the field will be diminished."
But to party officials in other states, the arguments put forward by Iowa or New Hampshire seem silly.
"Gosh, we're not challenging them to be first; we're coming after," Basil R. Battaglia, chairman of the Delaware Republican Party, said of New Hampshire's protestations over his state's plan to hold its primary on the Saturday after New Hampshire's. "I don't know what's so magical about seven days."
The fight is about economics as well as magic. Campaigns produce large infusions of cash for the economies of small states every four years as the candidates' entourages and the army of reporters and photographers that follow spend freely on everything from rental cars to hotel rooms to meals and telephone service.
"When these things become popular, some other states are saying, Hey, they're making money up there; we ought to have it, too," said Bill Gardner, New Hampshire's Secretary of State.
Top state officials in Iowa and New Hampshire say they suspect that the hand of Senator Phil Gramm of Texas is behind these efforts to challenge the primacy of their contests. These officials, who tend to be supporters of Senator Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner, say Mr. Gramm -- who sees his support eroding in New Hampshire and Iowa -- has pushed plans for contests in other states where he might have a better shot at winning.
But the Gramm campaign and party officials in Louisiana and Delaware deny the accusation, noting that the agitation to change the dates of their states' caucuses and primaries began years earlier.
Nevertheless, Iowa and New Hampshire are fighting back. Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Louisiana's change in its election law violates the Federal Voting Rights Act. The act, intended to protect black voters, requires that Louisiana get approval by the Justice Department for any changes in its election procedures that might dilute minority voting strength.
"The Justice Department needs to take legal action to prevent them from doing this," said Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, also a Republican.
Justice Department officials say it might be necessary for Louisiana to get approval for the changes in its election law regarding the switch to caucuses. But officials declined to say how soon they would make that decision.
In the meantime, Iowa Republican officials have demanded that all Presidential candidates sign a pledge not to participate in Louisiana's caucuses. So far, nearly all have, except for Mr. Gramm, Patrick J. Buchanan and Alan Keyes. "We haven't heard from Alan Keyes and we can't find him," Mr. Kennedy said of the former State Department official.
The refusal by the three to shun the Louisiana caucuses has become a campaign issue in Iowa. Mr. Dole's campaign has been faxing a blizzard of statements to the press deriding Mr. Gramm's "insult" to Iowa voters. And former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is battling Mr. Gramm and Mr. Buchanan for second place behind Mr. Dole in Iowa, hastily replaced radio commercials proclaiming the candidate's support for term limits with advertisements proclaiming that he was the first to sign the pledge.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Remarks by German Bank Chief Are a Boon to the Dollar's Value

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark yesterday after the president of the Bundesbank said that a weak mark and a strong dollar would be good for his country's economy.
The official, Hans Tietmeyer, made his remarks as new economic figures showed a further slowdown in Germany. His comments, combined with the economic data, further convinced analysts that lower German interest rates were imminent. 
 The improvement by the dollar against the mark helped pull it up against other leading currencies, as well. The dollar ended higher against the Japanese yen, drawing support from news of a lower Japanese trade surplus.
The dollar was also helped by American traders' squaring their positions ahead of today's report on November employment. Currency movements were exaggerated yesterday by thin trading, with dealers trying to hold on to the year's gains.
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 101.47 Japanese yen, up from 101.37 late Wednesday. It sold at 1.4467 German marks, up from 1.4435. The British pound slipped to $1.5325 from $1.5425.
Earlier, in Asian and European trading, the dollar had been weaker.
"The dollar had declined against the mark in overseas trading on a weakening U.S. economy and a widespread belief that the U.S. Federal Reserve is going to lower interest rates" at its Dec. 19 meeting, said Dan Ascani, editor and publisher of Global Market Strategist, an advisory firm in Gainesville, Ga. Lower interest rates typically make investments denominated in a country's currency less attractive.
But the dollar strengthened on continued speculation about a German rate cut. Such speculation was heightened when the German Government released data showing no growth in the third quarter and the unemployment rate rising slightly, to 9.3 percent.
Later in the day, Mr. Tietmeyer said he hoped that the weakening of the German currency, "especially versus the dollar, will go further soon," and that the "excessive appreciation" of the mark against currencies of Germany's trading partners had weighed on the economy.
The dollar got some support after Japan reported that its trade surplus umbled 51.8 percent in October, compared with October 1994, the biggest such slide in nearly five years.

Wheat Soars to 15-Year High As Europe Puts Tax on Exports

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Wheat prices jumped to a 15-year high on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday after the European Union adopted a tax aimed at restricting wheat exports, forcing importing nations to pay higher prices or look elsewhere.
On other commodity markets, copper and heating oil prices rose. The reformulated Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodities gained 0.61 point, to 244.2. 
 The European Union, collectively the world's largest wheat exporter, set a tax of 25 European Currency Units a ton, or about $32, on wheat exports. A partial reduction in the tax, which is the first in 20 years, may be available to exporters through direct application to the European Commission, the union's executive agency. The agency could allow sales based on internal European wheat prices.
The tax "should funnel a lot of business to the U.S.," said Joel Karlin, vice president of Everen Securities Inc. in Chicago. "That really gave the market a boost."
Wheat for March delivery rose 5 cents, to $5.06 a bushel. December wheat gained 8.25 cents, to $5.16 a bushel, the highest for a contract closest to delivery in 15 years.
The tax comes amid soaring demand from importing nations and a smaller American harvest. Exports of wheat from the United States, normally the world's second-largest exporter, are running 15 percent above last year. Europe's action is intended to stop an exodus of wheat to the world market and head off food inflation in Europe by insuring adequate supplies.
Copper prices rose for the first time in eight days amid signs of stronger demand.
Copper stockpiles held in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange of New York resumed their decline after a brief increase during November, falling 748 short tons, to 3,262 tons, a report showed Wednesday.
Traders said demand from manufacturers was still strong as spending on construction rose 2.7 percent in October, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday. Construction is the single largest source of demand for copper.
March copper rose as much as 2.6 cents, to $1.2165 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange.

Fear the Fed Won't Cut Hurts Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of bonds dropped yesterday as nervous investors sold amid concern that the economy might not be slowing fast enough to warrant an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
The 30-year bond fell by 25/32, to a price of 110 28/32 to yield 6.08 percent, up from 6.03 percent on Wednesday. The yield of a bond moves in the opposite direction of its price. 
 Traders and investors, who have been pricing in expectation of a rate cut with each weak economic report, were unnerved by comments made by Susan M. Phillips, a Fed board governor, in an interview yesterday with the Dow Jones wire service. Ms. Phillips said she was "reasonably optimistic" that the economy would stay on a moderate growth track well into 1996, and that was not what the market wanted to hear.
Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International in San Francisco, noted that Ms. Phillips had cited a tight labor market putting pressure on wages and suggested that the housing sector remained in good shape.
"These statements suggest she may not argue strongly for a rate cut at the upcoming meeting," Ms. Rupert said.
Selling was also attributed to some investors who were holding more long-maturity securities than they wanted to ahead of today's employment report.
Another negative for the market was a mediocre one-year bill auction yesterday, at which the average rate declined to 5.06 percent, the lowest since June 1994. Despite this, the auction saw a lessening of interest by small investors, suggesting that large institutional investors dominated buying at this auction.
Traders and investors are waiting to see if today's employment report will offer convincing evidence that economic growth is slow enough to keep inflation from accelerating, thus allowing the Fed an opportunity to ease. The data are seen as perhaps crucial to the Dec. 19 meeting by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm.
It was obvious that the market was a little disappointed in some of the data released yesterday, including the Commerce Department's factory orders report for October, which fell by three-tenths of 1 percent. Forecasts had put the drop at four-tenths of 1 percent. The previous month's data were revised to show a gain of 1.4 percent.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said that including yesterday's orders report, "the trend continues to fit with a manufacturing sector that is continuing to expand, albeit at a very slow pace."
But the market quickly recovered on a higher-than-expected jobless claims report for the week ended Dec. 2, which showed a gain of 14,000 in those filing for unemployment insurance for the first time, to 377,000. Many economists had expected a gain of 7,000.
Ms. Schaja said that despite the bounce in the weekly data, the four-week moving average remained around 370,000 for the last several weeks, "indicating a moderate deterioration in the labor market relative to last year."
Traders noted some institutional buying ahead of the data, and local short-covering, lending some strength to the market, but most players were on the sidelines as the latest data failed to cause any real buying.
Looking to today's data, Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said: "the payroll numbers could certainly modify market expectations, but these November statistics are subject to a statistical quirk that is very likely to bias the overall payroll number upward, all other things being equal."
He said this year there was a five-week interval between sampling periods, while in the recent past there were only four-week intervals in this time period.
"The seasonal factor doesn't know about the extra week, and will therefore 'underadjust,' " Mr. Fine said. "On the other hand, employment growth this year is slower than last year, which will likely act as a partial offset to the seasonal adjustment problem."

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's Budget

 BODY:
President Clinton, as the price he paid to open shuttered Government offices, promised the Republicans that he would agree to their demand to balance the budget in seven years in accordance with estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. The plan that Mr. Clinton released yesterday to balance the budget does not really meet that goal, since he used his own budget office's figures. By Congressional Budget Office standards he is still perhaps $300 billion short of the mark. Even so, the new Clinton budget is becoming perilously like the G.O.P. version. What the revised budget plan shouts out is that seven years of budget-cutting will be a very ugly process.
For example, the previous Clinton budget would cut welfare programs -- food stamps, cash assistance for the disabled and aid to legal immigrants -- by $38 billion. His revised budget would subtract an extra $8 billion. The previous White House plan would have taken $186 billion out of discretionary programs -- reducing these, as a percentage of total economic activity, to their lowest level since the early 1960's. Now Mr. Clinton could cut an additional $64 billion. His plan includes steep reductions in Medicare payments to hospitals that treat the poor and train medical students. If he closes the $300 billion shortfall, then he will be forced to make mammoth additional cuts in these and all other programs. 
 To his credit, Mr. Clinton tried hard to protect the needy and the public investments that lie at the core of his economic agenda. For example, unlike the Republicans, he would preserve federally guaranteed health insurance for the poor under Medicaid and reduce poverty programs much less than the G.O.P. Yet his best was not good enough, and there are ways for him to improve his plan.
He proposes to cut wasteful farm subsidies by only $5 billion, instead of the $12 billion that the Republicans propose. He plans to nick corporate giveaways by only about $25 billion, the same as the G.O.P. Some estimates put needless subsidies to corporations at $75 billion or more a year. The White House says its plan would insulate education, training and research initiatives. But the claim does not amount to much because it is the Republican-controlled Congress that decides how money for discretionary programs is spent.
So if Mr. Clinton is to take a real shot at proposing a gentler plan, he needs to make two major changes, both politically hazardous. First, he would need to discard his ill-conceived $100 billion plan to cut taxes on non-needy families. The danger is that the Republicans would continue to wave their $245 billion tax cut before voters. Second, he proposes raising Medicare premiums for the non-poor elderly. Here the Republicans have provided some political cover for the President because their budget already correctly proposes such increases.
The Administration knew it would come under heavy criticism for substituting its budget projections for those of the Congressional Budget Office. Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, says the issue is moot because the White House will propose a procedure by which spending would be automatically cut if its budget estimates proved optimistic. But the purpose of proposing alternative budgets is candor. Voters deserve a side-by-side comparison of Republican and Administration budgets to see which they like better. By stopping the budget-cutting hundreds of billions short of the mark, the Administration has short-circuited this vital comparison process.
The moment Mr. Clinton agreed to a seven-year bloodletting based on Congressional Budget Office numbers, he guaranteed that any budget he signed would look almost as unforgiving as the one the Republicans have passed. He can fight hard to make it gentler at the margins. But yesterday's plan shows how much the G.O.P. has already won.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Fall as Consumer Debt Surges

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Factory orders declined in October, but consumer debt surged, according to Government reports issued today.
While the consumer spending gives the economy a temporary shot in the arm, economists fear that consumers will soon pull back under the weight of their heavy debts. Thus the economists interpreted both reports as evidence that the economy was likely to start the new year on a sour note. 
 "I don't think a recession is in the cards," Jill Thompson, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., said of the drop in factory orders. "But I'm a little worried about the first quarter."
Weaker demand for aircraft and autos, as well as industrial and capital goods, accounted for much of October's three-tenths of 1 percent decrease in factory orders, the Commerce Department said. That followed a 1.4 percent gain in September, revised from an earlier estimate of a 1.5 percent advance.
Another part of the Commerce Department report showing that factory inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent in October suggests manufacturers may have overestimated demand. It implies "slow growth ahead until surplus stocks are sold off," said Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.
The Federal Reserve said consumer borrowing rose sharply in October. That indicates there is a growing bubble of household debt that may inhibit spending and domestic economic growth next year.
Consumer installment credit rose $10.6 billion for the month, to $1.004 trillion, the Federal Reserve said. That is more than twice September's increase and well above the rise of about $6 billion that economists had expected.
Credit card use alone rose $5.1 billion in October, and auto-related borrowing also increased.
So far in 1995, credit card balances have risen by 14 percent, while incomes are rising only at about 3 percent annually, according to Ruth Susswein, executive director of the Bankcard Holders of America. That gap suggests a growing mountain of debt, and may spell trouble for economic growth in 1996. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of United States economic activity, is not likely to surge if Americans are stuck with large outstanding debts.
Moreover, analysts said that dismissals associated with corporate restructurings would continue, putting personal incomes at risk.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cutbacks Paralyzing Mobile's Transit System

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: MOBILE, Ala., Dec. 5

 BODY:
When Congress cut aid to transit systems by $310 million, the Mobile Transit Authority cut 22 percent of its bus service. And that is how Kenny Williams ended up waiting an hour and 45 minutes today for a bus to take him to a doctor's appointment.
The round trip is about six miles, but to make the journey, Mr. Williams said, "you make a day of it, basically." 
 Nearly every transit system in the country is pulling in its belt these days to absorb a Federal cut. This year aid to transit operating budgets will be $400 million, down from $710 million in the year that ended Sept. 30. And it will probably drop substantially again next year if Congress continues with its plan to gradually eliminate operating assistance over the next few years.
But Mobile, which was in trouble before the Federal cuts, has had to go further than most in trimming its service. The manager brought in three months ago to get the system on its feet, David Warren, said with a touch of bitterness that Mobile "is on the cutting edge in transit."
For the riders, who are mostly too young, too poor, too sick or too old to drive, the decline in service is making it harder to get where they need to go, including to work. And local leaders say that because the riders are mostly black, the cuts raise broad issues of social justice.
"Now," said the Rev. Clinton Johnson, the City Council president, "the question is not, can you ride in the front of the bus. The question is whether you can have a bus to ride on."
Mobile is, in fact, testing just how small a bus system can get and still be a system. Alabama does not offer any support for public transit, and no taxes specifically pay for the Mobile system, which gets only what the city and the Federal Government give it.
As a result, Mobile Transit has been in a spiral of service cuts for years and has lost half its riders since 1986, down to about 4,500 a day now. Fares went to $1 this year and will be $1.25 next year. Beginning in July, the system shut down for six weeks because expenses were running about $4.2 million and revenues were only $3.7 million.
But what was merely a half-million dollar gap turned into a $900,000 gap on Oct. 1, when the Federal fiscal year began, and Washington cut the subsidy to $400,000, from $800,000. So this fall frequency on some routes was cut, while other routes were rearranged. Mr. Warren had planned to cut Saturday service by 50 percent but settled for 25 percent.
During the shutdown this summer, several black churches in town offered their own vans to transport the stranded around Mobile, just as 30 years ago black churches in Montgomery helped transport people boycotting the segregated bus system. But this being the 1990's, fears of liability suits got in the way, and the churches stopped running the vans. Eventually, the school board volunteered its buses for four weeks, with the city government paying the drivers.
Over the years the bus system here has tried to raise revenue by selling advertising space on the sides of the buses to companies like Roto-Rooters and Wendy's. But most businesses are no longer willing to pay the $400 a month, Mr. Warren said.
"Why would you pay?" he asked, explaining, "They know we can't afford to repaint them" to remove the advertisements. Recently, the system did scrape together enough money to paint the buses white, with a restrained stripe and logo.
For some, the Federal cuts raise questions about how government will provide for poorer people who depend on public transportation. Chip Bishop, a spokesman for the American Public Transit Association in Washington, said in an interview that public transit systems were "part of a balanced national transportation policy."
He added: "Washington spends $20 billion a year building roads; it spends billions a year underwriting the cost of airports for air travel. It is not unreasonable in a pluralistic society like ours that we also have support for public transportation."
But the problem in Mobile, as Mr. Warren sees it, is that the bus system is used mainly by people who have little influence -- service employees, like fast-food restaurant workers and maids. These workers earn little and cannot afford cars, which in Alabama is poor indeed, because the state has no insurance or inspection requirements.
The people who work for Mobile's big employers -- paper mills, chemical plants and a shipyard -- generally drive to work, he said, and those large employers do not press for public transportation.
At the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, James M. Apple, the vice president for economic development, said that in luring new companies, he used to say he could get the bus system to add a route to their front door. He no longer bothers to mention this, he said, because the companies are not interested.
If the buses disappeared tomorrow, Mr. Apple said, "99.5 percent of the work force of the Mobile area could still get to work."
Mr. Warren said he suspected that many bus riders were near the edge economically, so much so that by the end of each month they could not afford bus fare. He said farebox revenues were $2,700 on Nov. 30 but jumped to $3,500 on Dec. 1, after many people received monthly checks.
To the people who rely on buses, the cuts have nothing to do with transportation policy or the economics of business development. They simply make it tough for people to get where they need to go.
The other day, Mr. Williams, who is 24 and works at a fast-food restaurant, sat in a little smoked-glass shelter from 8:50 A.M., when one bus dropped him off after a five-minute ride, until 10:35, when another picked him up.
When Mr. Williams first started riding the buses here four years ago, he said, he could make the trip without changing buses.
Michael A. Williams says the buses are all right when they run. But Mobile Transit ran out of money in mid-July and shut down entirely for six weeks, cutting him off from his job tending bar and setting up for events at the Convention Center here. He walked a few times, and when he had the money he took a taxi, paying $8 each way. He said he missed work entirely on a few days.
Andrea Moore, 16, a high school senior who works after school and on Saturdays at an A & W Root Beer restaurant miles from her home, does not wait nearly so long for a transfer. But she usually cannot work evening hours, because her bus does not run after about 6:30 P.M. On Sundays, it does not run at all.
Ms. Moore, who earns $4.25 an hour, says she spends more than an hour traveling to work on the two buses she must take. And to get to her job on time, she sometimes has to arrive an hour or even two early, she said.
Of course, she is not always early. "Sometimes I'm late, and that cuts into my pay," she said.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Waiting an hour and 45 minutes for a bus is hardly unusual in Mobile, Ala., where Federal budget cuts have led the city to severely curtail transit service. The cuts have mostly affected those who are too young, too poor, too sick or too old to drive. Many have had difficulty getting to work. (G. M. Andrews for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
Uneasy Rests the Village That Wears the Crown

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: ESSEX, Conn.

 BODY:
THE last bad news in town was pretty much of a shock: some of the oldest, most treasured buildings on the oldest, most treasured streets were lying about their age!
Residents said it just couldn't be that so many houses were younger than everyone had thought. Not here, where the first warship in the Continental Navy was built in 1775. But research proved it. A Federal-style house on Middlesex Turnpike was built not in 1764, but 1801. The Henry Champlin House on Champlin Square, one of the most admired homes in the community, was built not in 1765, but 1818. And so on. 
 Thank goodness the scandal the local historian uncovered last summer blew over. People in this Connecticut River seaport don't take to too much change, too fast. This is why it took two referendums to get a new firehouse approved, why Groundhog Day is a major occasion, and why Main Street looks as though the elevator was never invented.
It also helps explain why the latest big news, which seems very good, is making residents rather nervous. After all, until last week, Essex (pop. 5,790) was minding its pretty business, content to be 35 miles from a major population center (New Haven) and a good 5 miles from the nearest mall. Then, boom. There it was, on the cover of "USA Weekend," No. 1 in a book on the "100 Best Small Towns in America."
As soon as the news was out, Town Hall began fielding calls. From Iowa. From California. From reporters.
State officials started talking about garnering major national publicity. Residents started worrying about how their small town might change.
"People are proud, but there's a lot of concern," said Doug Paul, 41, a lifelong resident. "People are concerned about preserving the town's character."
THE cautionary tale that has begun spreading is of Elko, Nev., which was small town No. 1 when the first edition of "The 100 Best Small towns" was published (by Macmillan USA) two years ago. After the book came out, Elko's population, which was 14,800 in the 1990 census, grew to 18,000. This makes it too big to fit the definition of a small town (from 5,000 to 15,000 residents), according to the book's author, Norman Crampton.
Mr. Crampton, who gave Essex the No. 2 spot in his book's first edition, said people here were worried about publicity even then.
"They were typical of people in the small towns I visited," he said. "Pretty much the reaction was this is a hidden gem." Some townsfolk, like the retired Essex postmaster, Charles Doane, said Essex was already getting spoiled. "Any time after lunch until midnight," Mr. Doane said, "cars are bumper to bumper on both sides of Main Street, and not 1 in 20 you recognize."
Mr. Crampton's reasons for giving Essex top honors are predictable: low crime and unemployment, a healthy percentage of residents (28.2) with bachelor's degrees or higher, steady growth rate (1 percent), good schools and healthy per capita income ($26,590).
He also included bank deposits per capita ($23,860) and factored in intangibles. "Essex has a large reservoir of local residents who are willing to volunteer their time and their talent for the good of their community," he said. (The Fire Department is all volunteer. The town's gazillion annual parades are organized largely by volunteers, and with a police force of one, citizens pretty much police themselves.)
OF course, one man's best small town to live in is another person's nice place to visit. Essex, like most of the towns in the Top 100, is not exactly ethnically diverse. It is largely white, and despite its well-publicized soup kitchens, largely well-to-do. It is beautiful, with its marinas and boat clubs and old houses on winding roads and hills. But for someone who thrives on the action of city life, Essex may be a little too picture-perfect.
Busloads of tourists already come to town -- its steam-powered railroad is one of the state's major attractions, and the Groundhog Day parade on Main Street is a regional event -- but Essex is probably in little danger of getting overrun by new residents. The town is two hours from New York City and two hours from Boston, which is too far for it to worry about becoming a major commuterville.
Mr. Paul, for one, is not worried about the town's losing its identity. "People are very sensitive to keeping things the way they are," he said. As a co-owner of the Griswold Inn, the first three-story building in Connecticut and the town's centerpiece, he counts himself among them. (The Inn's sign says it opened for business in 1776, but the historical society has some doubts.) The Griswold, with 27 rooms, is usually booked on weekends. Mr. Paul doesn't expect much to change now.
"In 40 years, I could say I've noticed some changes here," Mr. Paul, 41, said. Some houses on Main Street, for instance, have become businesses, he said. What else? "Well, the number of kids is now about the same when I was growing up," he said. "When I think about it, a lot hasn't changed at all."

HEADLINE: Richard Haydock, 82, Legal Service Chief

 BODY:
Richard Haydock, who organized the legal referral service of the New York City bar association in 1947 and headed it until his retirement in 1984, died on Nov. 23 at Tally-Ho Manor in Boonton Township, N.J. A 43-year resident of Mountain Lakes, N.J., he was 82.
Mr. Haydock, a native of New York City, was an economics graduate of Harvard University and received his law degree from Columbia University Law School in 1937. He worked for the Legal Aid Society before forming the Legal Referral Service of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, taking the position of executive director. It was one of the first such services in the country for people unacquainted with the law or with lawyers, and provided legal help for a modest fee. 
 What started as a one-man operation taking just four calls in July 1947 has since grown to an organization that handles more than 100,000 calls a year. Its clients range from prison inmates to big corporations, although most calls come from middle-income people with ordinary legal problems.
Mr. Haydock is survived by two sons, Roger, of Eugene, Ore., and William H., of Mountain Lakes, and three grandchildren. His wife, Katherine Snyder Haydock, died two years ago.

Director Dismissed
Peter Masterson was at a loss over his dismissal. "I don't understand it," he said over the phone from Plano, Tex. "You do a play and it wins a Pulitzer Prize. The production is always praised. I am totally surprised." 
 Mr. Masterson was let go this week as director of "The Young Man From Atlanta," by Horton Foote, which won the Pulitzer for drama this year after it ran Off Broadway under Mr. Masterson's direction. His dismissal was the latest upheaval for the play, clouding its prospects for Broadway in the spring. A couple of weeks ago a producer, Anne Strickland Squadron, resigned.
David Richenthal, the lead producer, would not say why he jettisoned Mr. Masterson, whose wife, Carlin Glynn, was one of the play's stars; she will leave the project as well. "We're going to have another director direct the production for New York," Mr. Richenthal said, adding that the play's future was unclear.
Putting a serious play on Broadway is a tricky business these days, and riskier still when it is not a star vehicle. A recent Boston tryout of the Masterson production made everyone nervous after it received a tepid response from audiences. And while some in the theater world say the play really belongs where it began, Off Broadway, Mr. Richenthal and Mr. Foote have their hearts set on a big Broadway house.
Oddly, Mr. Masterson's show will go on. The play is scheduled for the Alley Theater in Houston in February, with Mr. Masterson as director.
 
 
 
Looking to Spring
 The troubles for "Young Man" are further proof that short of a California quake, nothing is shakier than planning a Broadway season. Spring held the promise of a bumper crop of new (well, newish) straight plays on Broadway, but the usual assortment of setbacks and changes of heart is shifting the theatrical landscape daily.
Here's where other pending productions that could compete for the Best Play Tony now stand:
*Steppenwolf's production of "Buried Child," by Sam Shepard, which won a Pulitzer in 1979, has been talked about for Broadway in the spring but now looks iffy at best. Frederick Zollo, the producer, says that Ethan Hawke, who was in the Chicago production, would not come with the play to New York. Though his part was not one of the biggest, he was the "name."
*"Getting Away With Murder" (formerly "The Doctor Is Out") is in. The comedy thriller by Stephen Sondheim and George Furth is to begin performances in February at the Broadhurst.
*August Wilson's "Seven Guitars" opens in March at the Walter Kerr, but it, too, has seen turmoil in recent weeks. Zakes Mokae, the South African actor ("The Blood Knot"), was let go in San Francisco, where it is playing. Benjamin Mordecai, the producer, said that Mr. Mokae was "having difficulty" adapting to Mr. Wilson's language. "One of those situations emerged where what Zakes as an artist brought to the role was not working," he said. Mr. Mokae's agent in Los Angeles did not return calls.
 
 
 
An Oldie Is Dropped
 The lineup of old plays is changing, too. Officials at the cash-strapped Circle in the Square have dropped plans for "The Petrified Forest" after "Holiday," which has been extended to Jan. 7. In its place: a revival of "Bus Stop." ("Petrified" has 22 roles, "Bus Stop" 8.)
 
 
 
Cat and a Therapist
 Carol Burnett is living the high life of a New York actress. She has found a posh hotel, a good physical therapist and a cat. The cat, named "Roxie," came from a shelter. The therapist came from her friend Julie Andrews. The kitty is company. The therapist is survival.
It's the nightly workout on an inclined stage -- in heels yet -- that has Ms. Burnett running for a hot tub filled with Epsom salts. "They said to me, 'These raked stages were traditions for hundreds of years,' " the actress said, sipping chardonnay in her hotel. "I said, 'Well, so were sweatshops!' "
Nevertheless, Ms. Burnett has re-upped with "Moon Over Buffalo," agreeing to stay until March. One change: Tuesdays off. She'll do seven performances instead of the usual eight.
"I don't like long commitments," she said. Still, she has done many New Yorky things, like attending workshop productions and spending time with Ms. Andrews, who invited her for Thanksgiving.
"When Julie and I first started, we talked about men," she said. "Later on we talked about children. Then it was, how do we keep in good shape? Now we talk Metamucil."
 
 
 
Foreign Intrigue
 For Brian Friel, the Irish playwright, who is in New York to direct his play "Molly Sweeney" at the Roundabout's second stage, getting here was more than half the battle.
Emanuel Azenberg, a co-producer, says the directors' union, the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, threatened to block the playwright's visa. They demanded that Mr. Azenberg make an up-front payment to Mr. Friel of $13,000 -- $5,000 more than the normal director's minimum advance for an Off Broadway production -- before sanctioning Mr. Friel's work.
"It was an outrage," Mr. Azenberg said. "They are supposed to judge him on artistic merit. This was done because of arbitrary economics."
Barbara B. Hauptman, the union's new executive director, said the demand was made after the union learned Mr. Azenberg and the Roundabout were paying the two foreign actors in the play, Catherine Byrne and Alfred Molina, on the higher pay scale of a Broadway production contract. "To me, this was all about a principle," she said.
Mr. Azenberg, who eventually agreed to pay the money, said that while Actors' Equity had negotiated the issue of pay for foreigners working here, the directors' union never had.
 
 
 
Bridey the 'Brit'
 Simon Jones has been a New Yorker for over a decade, but onstage he's never taken for one.
"I'm still usually the Brit," Mr. Jones said in his perfect English accent. He is one of those English expatriate actors -- he is married to an American -- who seem effortlessly sophisticated on the New York stage. This time, he's more devious than debonair, as the hypocritical Sir Joseph Surface in the Broadway production of "The School for Scandal," which closes this month.
Although he has worked steadily in New York, he is still best known as Bridey, the pompous scion of "Brideshead Revisited." In fact, he remains so well-known for the television series that when he is invited to do so, he does a behind-the-scenes slide show on making "Brideshead."

HEADLINE: U.S. Tests Border Plan In Event of Mexico Crisis

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: NOGALES, Ariz., Dec. 7

 BODY:
Sudden ly, a vast flood of illegal immigrants Mexicans driven to desperation by some unspeakable and unspecified social catastrophe -- surges across the Southwest border, inundating entire communities as it washes north into the American heartland.
That was the scenario driving three days of field exercises here this week, in which the Clinton Administration's top immigration policy-makers tested new plans to control the border in case Mexico's financial and political problems worsen dramatically. Their field radios crackling through a border canyon here, scores of Border Control agents practiced erecting cyclone-fence corrals, herding immigrants through them for emergency processing, and loading them onto bus convoys for travel to mass detention centers. 
 The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Doris Meissner, who is here overseeing the exercises, said that although last year's mass migrations of Cubans and Haitians demonstrated anew how foreign events can trigger sudden immigration emergencies, the chances that a breakdown in Mexico's social order could unleash an immigrant stampede remained distant.
"I think its remote," she said in an interview. "But this is part of our world. We must be certain we can handle emergencies if they arrive."
Just as schoolhouse nuclear drills projected, and at times aggravated American terrors during the cold war, the "enhanced border control plan" practiced here this week underlined the fears currently associated with uncontrolled immigration in the American imagination.
Ms. Meissner said the exercise was not intended to send threatening messages to Mexico City. And a Mexican official who asked not to be identified characterized relations between the Clinton Administration and the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo as cordial. But the official said of the exercise, "We don't see this as appropriate or prudent."
For his part, Juan Rebolledo, Mexico's under-secretary of foreign affairs, speaking in a telephone interview from Mexico City, said that the cyclical flow of migrants into the United States in search of work has become a permanent condition of the North American labor market.
"Conditions in Mexico, with all its problems, are stable," he said. "So I view an invasion of thousands of Mexicans across the border to be, as you Americans say, far-fetched."
Several Border Patrol agents participating here said that they could not remember their agency carrying out any similar exercises for at least two decades, perhaps ever. But the Arizona exercise was the third this year; the Immigration and Naturalization Service walked through similar practice emergencies in June in Orlando and last month in McAllen, Tex.
Dutch Steenbakker, an assistant chief Border Patrol agent, said there were no specific scenarios for Mexican catastrophe written into the exercise.
"We decided it would be a mistake to start tailoring it around a particular situation," Mr. Steenbakker said in a briefing for reporters at a barbed-wire corral erected in a scrub oak campground in the Coronado National Forest six miles from Nogales on Arizona's southern border. "It could be a natural disaster, or the economy collapses, or the military attacks the Government, or any number of other situations."
Mr. Steenbakker called the corral, bathed in floodlights and equipped with five olive-drab army campaign tents, water tanks, and portable toilets, a "temporary collection point." During a border emergency, agents would ferry in migrants, read them their rights, which include seeing a lawyer and appearing before an immigration judge, and separate them according to their next destination: immediate voluntary deportation back at the border, or an emergency detention center set up about 60 miles north in Tucson.
There, immigrants might be held for 30 days or more, transferred to prisons, county jails or military bases and if all of those facilities were overwhelmed, held semi-permanently in "soft-cover detention" -- tent villages like those established last year in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Intelligence agents would participate in the interviewing of immigrants during an emergency in an effort to establish the cause of the immigrant invasion, Mr. Steenbakker said.
"If its all of a sudden we're getting inundated, we want to find out what's causing it and maybe the U.S. Government can help solve it," he said.
In one of the tents, Kevin W. Oaks. a Border Patrol supervisor, gestured toward a bank of telephones, fax machines, computers and two-way radios. "This is the command and transportation center," Mr. Oaks said. "We'd be shifting around a lot of vehicle assets, maybe we'd have 15 vans moving masses of people out to the detention centers."
If so many immigrants crossed the border that the Nogales border station ran out of busses, more could be brought down from Tucson or Phoenix or even from neighboring states, he said.
"Say we're tapped out of people," Mr. Steenbakker said. "We could call in other resources, the sheriff's department or the national guard."
If these exercises had a certain military air to them, it was because the Immigration and Naturalization Service requested military help in its preparation, Ms. Meissner said. "They're very good at formal contingency planning and we wanted to tap some expertise," she said. The help came, she said, in the form of Army Col. Richard Coffin, whom the Pentagon had lent to immigration office.
Part of the exercise involved role-playing, in which Washington-based officials pretended to be law-enforcement officers recruited from afar to serve during the hypothetical emergency. Ms. Meissner, who during the exercise acted the role of an out-of-state F.B.I. agent detailed to coordinate transportation, said she had learned during a string of immigration emergencies since the 1980 Mariel exodus from Cuba that careful planning was essential.
"Planning makes the difference between an effective response and just dissembling," Ms. Meissner said.

Sony of America to Widen Its Executive Committee
The Sony Corporation of America, reorganizing itself after the departure of its chief executive, Michael Schulhof, said it would broaden its executive committee, adding the heads of its main operating divisions.
Nobuyuki Idei, president and chief financial officer of Sony, the Japanese parent, said he would oversee the committee, which will include the heads of the electronics, films and record businesses. [Page 39.]
 
Specifications Set for Videodisk
Nine companies working on a new type of digital videodisk announced specifications for the medium, which would resemble today's compact disk or CD-ROM, but would be able to store far more music, video or data in a common format. The companies agreed in September to work together after a heated standards battle between companies led by Sony and Philips Electronics on one side and Toshiba on the other. They hope to avoid a repetition of the videocassette format wars of the 1970's. [39.]
 
A Surprise Resignation at Citicorp
The outsider hired by Citicorp two and a half years ago to help the bank, the nation's largest, become more efficient and productive, resigned unexpectedly. The role of Christopher J. Steffen will be assumed by a 23-year veteran of the bank, Victor J. Menezes. [39.]
 
Dow Falls, but Nasdaq Rises
Stock prices were mixed as a rise in the jobless rate to 5.6 percent showed a slowing economy. The blue-chip Dow industrials eased 2.53 points, to 5,156.86, but technology issues led the broader market higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 1.31 points, to 617.48, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 9.24 points, to 1,064.41. [41.]
 
Employment in New York dipped by 35,000 last month, but unemployment fell to 6 percent, from 6.3 percent in October. In New Jersey there were 36,000 fewer jobs but the jobless rate rose to 6.1 percent, from 5.8 percent in October. [38.]
 
Treasury Bond Prices Rally
Prices of Treasury bonds rose in a rally induced by a weaker-than-expected employment report, but closed off their peaks, after the Fed's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, said that traders were overly optimistic about an easing of interest rates this month. The long bond's yield slipped to 6.05 percent. [40.]
 
Westinghouse Plans to Repay Debt
Westinghouse said that it planned to sell its arms business and a smaller unit, said to be the Knoll Group, which makes office furniture. With the proceeds, it expects to repay $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion of the $5.4 billion in debt that it incurred in buying CBS Inc. by the end of the second quarter of 1996. [41.]
 
Diamond Agrees to Buy Arethusa
Diamond Offshore Drilling said it planned to take over Arethusa Ltd., a smaller but fast-growing competitor, as an operator of deep-water oil drilling rigs, for $516 million in stock. Combined, the two companies would have 30 semi-submersible rigs, far more than any competitor. Deep-water drilling has become of prime interest among major oil companies. [40.]
 
Belli Firm in Bankruptcy Filing
The law firm of Melvin Belli filed for bankruptcy protection, attributing its problems to Dow Corning's bankruptcy filing. The firm represents 800 women who received silicone breast implants made by Dow, and Mr. Belli said he had spent $5 million on their care but could now recover nothing. [6.]
 
California Overhauls Insurance
California moved to overhaul its homeowners' earthquake insurance market, replacing insurance companies. Morgan Stanley was chosen to lead securities firms in an innovative $1.5 billion bond sale that would be part of a $10.5 billion package to pay claims. [40.]
 
Sparring Resumes in Budget Battle
President Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders reverted to casting aspersions and drawing lines in the sand only a day after the President submitted revisions to his budget, and a slight thaw appeared. [10.]

HEADLINE: Treasury Bonds Rally on Weak Jobs Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds moved higher yesterday in a rally induced by a weaker-than-expected employment report, but closed off their peaks.
The soft jobs numbers lifted investor hopes for a cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, bringing in buyers and reversing the effects of Thursday's selloff. Then, news services reported that the Fed's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, had said that the markets were overly optimistic about an easing in December, and trading chilled. 
 The 30-year benchmark bond rose 15/32 , to a price of 111 11/32 to yield 6.05 percent, down from 6.08 percent on Thursday.
The Labor Department reported that 166,000 nonfarm jobs were added to the economy in November, after a revised increase of 66,000 in October. The department also reported that the unemployment rate for November rose to 5.6 percent from 5.5 percent.
Another Government report yesterday showed that home sales were weak in October, but Treasury securities made no further gains and that troubled some investors, inducing some profit taking. Traders said it appeared that 6 percent was a difficult barrier for the long-bond yield to fall below.
P. Christopher Leary, senior vice president and portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management, said the economic numbers confirmed "the market's perception of further weakness in the economy, which will further support a Fed easing in December and begin to raise questions about growth in early 1996."
Mr. Leary said the trailing three-month average of nonfarm payroll numbers was half that of early 1995, suggesting a weakening labor market. He said it indicated that there was no increase in wage pressures.
"We also saw today a continuing decline in the Columbia Leading Inflation Index to 103.3 versus a revised 104.4," Mr. Leary said. "The economic data support the continuation of a soft landing, and that should be good to the market." He also expressed optimism that Congress and the Administration would resolve their differences and balance the budget.
Michael Krauss, chief technical strategist at Chemical Securities Inc., described the session as choppy. "The bottom line is that technicals have been friendly since August, but early this week we reached a risk level," he said.

HEADLINE: First Lady Officially Sets Off Clinton Race

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., Dec. 8

 BODY:
Stepping back onto the campaign trail and abandoning her self-imposed lower profile, Hillary Rodham Clinton officially registered her husband as a candidate in the nation's first primary state today. She lost no time in accusing Republicans of making budget proposals that would "knock down the ladder of opportunity after they themselves have reached the top."
With scores of reporters and camera people shoving each other to catch a glimpse of her, Mrs. Clinton stood at an antique desk in the office of the New Hampshire Secretary of State to submit the papers that officially begin President Clinton's re-election campaign. 
 "There weren't very many other people here when I was here before," she said, remembering what little notice she had received when she submitted the same forms in 1991.
Mrs. Clinton quickly put to rest any idea that her departure from the spotlight after the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994 and her focus on more traditional activities for a First Lady, like receiving the White House Christmas tree, meant that she would not be a force on the campaign trail in 1996.
"I'm going to continue to do what I've done for more than 20 years of marriage, which is support my husband," she said, when asked what her role would be in 1996. "I believe very strongly in what he's doing."
Mrs. Clinton crisscrossed the state in her first full campaign day, speaking at a Portsmouth apartment complex for the elderly, the University of New Hampshire in Durham and at a fund-raising reception for the State Democratic Party in Manchester.
Shortly after Mrs. Clinton left the Secretary of State's office, Senator Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner, showed up there to enter his party's primary.
"It is a race between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole," said Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader, acting as if he had already the nomination.
Mr. Dole, who chugged into town on a train called The Balanced Budget Express, was greeted at the station, in subzero temperatures, by a small group of supporters headed by Gov. Stephen Merrill
The Dole and Clinton camps coordinated their schedules to avoid a direct meeting between the two. As he signed up for the primary, Mr. Dole was asked about Mrs. Clinton's criticism of Republican plans for Medicare and education, and took the opportunity to suggest that the President was not serious about balancing the budget.
"The President has done nothing but play politics" trying to frighten people, Mr. Dole said. He called Mrs. Clinton's remarks "more politics as usual."
The President is using education and Medicare to define the difference between himself and the Republican-controlled Congress, and Mrs. Clinton stumped hard today against Republican budget proposals for savings in both.
Distancing herself from partisan battles of Washington, Mrs. Clinton never mentioned Republicans directly, simply referring instead to "some people" and "the other side."
Still, her message was unmistakable. Discussing Medicare with a selected group of the elderly people arranged around her before an audience at the Margeson Apartments, she mused about "the idea some people have that we don't really need a system like Medicare for everybody."
This she called, "really, a kind of survival of the fittest mentality -- if you are healthy and you can take care of yourself and you've had enough during your lifetime, then good for you, and if you're not, then you should have done something different along life's way."
At the University of New Hampshire, she criticized Republicans for proposals to make savings in student loan and education programs. "Today there are some among us who are willing to knock down the ladder of opportunity after they themselves have reached the top," she said. "That is not the American way."
As the next Presidential election approached, Mrs. Clinton said, the nation has to decide how it will provide its citizens with the skills to earn a living, "no matter where they're born, no matter to whom they're born, no matter what their income." She added, "I believe we do not answer that question just by talking about family values. We do it by valuing families."
In 1992, Mr. Clinton's Presidential dreams almost foundered in New Hampshire because of questions about his purported marital infidelity and his draft status during the Vietnam War. He fought his way back to a second-place finish in the Democratic primary, calling himself the Comeback Kid.
This time aides say that New Hampshire is already Mr. Clinton's first victory. He is the first Democratic President since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 not to face a primary challenge here. Still, the Clinton campaign opened an office here this week and wants to maintain a presence in the state to counter the expected deluge of attacks on the President as Republicans vie with each other to win their party's nomination.
Mrs. Clinton, who sought to expand the role of the First Lady, has become a lightning rod for conservatives and a target for the Congressional committee investigating the Whitewater real estate deal. Nonetheless, Democratic strategists call her one of the President's best campaign assets, a sure draw for the liberals, women and minorities whose votes Mr. Clinton needs.
Tonight, as Democrats brandished the season's first "Clinton-Gore 96" banners, Mrs. Clinton reminded them of the recession that haunted the state the year Mr. Clinton defeated President George Bush.
"America and New Hampshire are in better shape than when my husband came here seeking the nomination," she said.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Issues Off a Bit, But Technology Stocks Rise

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday in lackluster trading, amid indications that the economy was continuing to lose momentum. Blue chips fell, while computing issues led the broader market higher.
"There has been a definite shift in the mood of the equity market," said E. Wayne Nordberg, equity partner of Lord Abbett & Company. "You've got a lot of nervous holders out there looking for the slightest hole in the dike to run for cover." 
 The market tone was set by the Labor Department's report early in the morning that the United States unemployment rate in November rose to 5.6 percent -- its first increase in four months. Later the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes dropped 2.7 percent in October, the third consecutive monthly decline.
The Dow Jones industrial average eased 2.53 points, to 5,156.86, for its second consecutive decline. But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 1.31 points, to 617.48, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 9.24 points, to 1,062.41.
Advancing and declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange were almost even, with declines totaling 1,152 and advances equaling 1,132. Big Board volume slipped to 327.9 million shares, from 381.5 million shares on Thursday.
Many technology stocks turned higher as analysts pointed to their strong fundamentals. Microsoft gained 4, to 94 1/2; it was upgraded by a handful of brokerage houses yesterday after William H. Gates, the chairman, discussed the company's strategy on Thursday. Sun Microsystems increased 6 5/8, to 99 3/4; Hewlett-Packard advanced 4 5/8, to 86 7/8; Oracle Systems rose 2 3/8, to 46 5/8, and Intel was up 1 3/4, to 63 1/4.
Oil issues, which have predictable earnings growth, again rallied. Exxon rose 7/8, to a new high of 81 3/4, and Mobil increased 2, to 110 1/2.
Shares of companies involved in consumer nondurables were in demand because traders consider them to have less exposure to economic uncertainty. For example, Gillette closed at 53 1/4, up 1 1/8, and Warner-Lambert closed at 94 1/4, up 1 1/2.
However, with a slackening in demand for certain types of economically sensitive paper products, a number of companies in this field moved lower. International Paper fell 1/2, to 37; Westvaco dropped 5/8, to 26 1/2, and Willamette Industries declined 3/8, to 58 3/4.
Chemical stocks also were down. Dow Chemical closed at 71 1/8, off 3/4, and Union Carbide closed at 39 5/8, off 1/4.
Some heavy-industry issues declined, apparently because of prospects that corporations might be spending less on expansion in 1996. Alcoa fell 7/8, to 56, and Ingersoll-Rand dropped 1/2, to 36 1/2.
Among the special situations, Neuromedical Systems jumped 5 1/8, to 20 1/8, on its first day of public trading. Mobile Telecommunication Technologies surged 2 1/4, to 22 3/8, after one of its units announced that it would sell pagers in retail stores. Incomnet increased 7/8, to 7 3/8, after the Nasdaq small-capitalization market decided that the company would be allowed to keep its listing on the market.
Earlier yesterday, Japanese stocks ended weaker. The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 125.35 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 19,286.97, after adding 532.79 points in the last two days.

HEADLINE: Report Shows Little Job Growth, Improving Odds for Rate Cut

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Job growth was modest in November and the unemployment rate edged up to 5.6 percent, the Labor Department reported today, raising the likelihood that the weak economy would cause the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates this month.
"All the way through it was a very soft report," said Donald E. Maude, an analyst in New York for Scotia McLeod, an investment firm. He raised his estimate of the odds of a rate cut this month to 50-50 instead of 70-30 against a cut previously. The markets have already moved in anticipation of a reduction. 
 Factories shed 32,000 more jobs in November, bringing the total lost since the most recent peak in factory employment, in March, to 220,000.
A second Government report today showed that sales of new single-family homes fell 2.7 percent in October, a third straight decline in a period when mortgage rates have fallen sharply, and one more report in a long string showing the economy had slowed markedly since a brisk summer. "Housing activity has probably peaked," Edward E. Yardeni of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C. J. Lawrence told clients.
The Clinton Administration, which admits to no fear that the recent sluggishness could deteriorate into an election-year recession, nevertheless fretted today about some aspects of the economy.
"Manufacturing continues to be troubling," said Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, referring to the loss of factory jobs last month. "It's directly related to a large pileup of unsold goods."
Mr. Reich also said he was "concerned" by a slight decline in hourly earnings last month. The decline left the 12-month increase at 3 percent, barely above the latest 12-month inflation rate. This, he suggested, implies that workers -- many of them heavily indebted -- are unlikely to do enough shopping to lighten overstocked shelves.
Others, however, took solace in the low inflation and in the improved prospects that the Fed will lower interest rates when it holds a policy meeting on Dec. 19.
Among 11 large industrial states, California saw its jobless rate jump a full point, to 8.8 percent, despite a smaller work force. The rate was 7.2 percent in September.
In New York, the rate improved to 6 percent from 6.3, but in New Jersey it increased to 6.1 percent from 5.8 in October.
Although the national payrolls expanded over all by a moderate 166,000, about what analysts expected, the gain was significantly exaggerated by special factors. One was that the department's survey period lasted five weeks, rather than the usual four, because of a quirk of the calendar. The survey thus picked up 25,000 more retailing and other seasonal jobs than the adjustment process allows for.
And 44,000 jobs resulted from the introduction of updated seasonal factors that will be applied from November through April.
Today's figures were unaffected by the midmonth furlough of "nonessential" Federal workers during the budget impasse, because they remained on payrolls. Nor did the furlough make the data significantly less accurate, since surveyors and processors were able to catch up with their work on overtime once they returned, Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said.
Strength in the payroll survey was confined largely to health services, which added 37,000 jobs; to transportation, and to a finance industry that posted its biggest job gain -- 14,000 -- in two years.
The loss in factory jobs was evenly divided between the durable and nondurable goods industries, with nearly half of the decline reflecting automotive layoffs. A number of auto plants have been shut down because of excessive inventories of vehicles.
The department's survey of about 56,000 households, which is more erratic than the payroll survey of 390,000 employers, showed a hefty 389,000 drop in employment. But this was accompanied by a 206,000 decline in the labor force, which has grown exceptionally slowly this year.
As a result, the unemployment rate moved up just a tenth of a point in November, a change deemed statistically insignificant.
Among demographic groups, joblessness among adult men jumped four-tenths of a point, to 4.9 percent, but this caused no alarm because it followed a drop by that amount in October.
In addition to California, other industrial states that had big increases in unemployment were Pennsylvania, up 1.2 points, to 6.3 percent, and Ohio, up 1.1 points, to 5.8 percent.
For lack of money to conduct sufficient sampling, the Government will discontinue publishing these figures for the 11 states, beginning with the Feb. 2 release covering January. Officials said they were considering the substitution of a list of four states -- New York, California, Texas and Florida -- whose samples will remain adequate. But Commissioner Abraham said that all four would need to agree to participate and that this was not assured.
Today's report also showed that the index of aggregate weekly hours, derived from the number of people at work and the hours they spent on the job, slumped to 133.3 in November from 133.8. That implies that industrial production fell for a second straight month. And only 43.2 percent of manufacturing industries added workers last month, down from 49.6 percent in October, the report found.

HEADLINE: Thaw in Budget Talks Freezes Over a Bit

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
A day after President Clinton submitted revisions to his budget and a slight thaw seemed to have developed in the budget negotiations, the President and Republican leaders in Congress reverted today to casting aspersions and drawing lines in the sand.
With further formal negotiations put off until next week, Mr. Clinton called reporters to the Cabinet Room at the White House before a meeting with Democratic governors to say he would stand firm against the Federal Government's relinquishing control of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. 
 Republicans want to end the 30-year-old Medicaid system under which everyone who meets Federal eligibility standards is entitled to whatever medical treatment or nursing home care they need. The budget legislation approved by Congress last month and vetoed by the President this week would cut deeply into projected spending for the program, give what Federal money was left to the states in the form of block grants with few strings attached and allow the states to set eligibility.
The White House has clearly decided that this is an issue on which to take the firmest possible stand.
"The Republican budget," the President declared, "would be a disaster for the states and for the people who depend on Medicaid."
"So I just want to be clear about this," he said. "I very much want to work with the Republican Congress to get a balanced budget, but I will not -- I will not -- permit the repeal of guaranteed medical coverage for senior citizens or disabled people, for poor children and pregnant women. That would violate our values."
Later, the White House publicity machine was switched on, and assistants spread word of how serious the Medicaid issue was to the President.
But Republicans said they too intended to insist on their Medicaid position.
"This isn't about values, and it isn't about money," said Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia, chairman of the House Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid. "No, this is about power," Mr. Bliley added, speaking in the Capitol at a news conference he had called to respond to the President. "This is about whether the states will be given the flexibility they need to meet the needs of their own citizens or whether they'll continue to have their hands tied by a huge, distant, inflexible Federal bureaucracy."
The revised budget Mr. Clinton submitted on Thursday would save $54 billion in the Medicaid program over the next seven years, only a third as much as the Republican plan would save.
The Republican legislation would set rigid ceilings on the Federal money that the program would make available to the states each year. Mr. Clinton, in contrast, would impose a limit only on the average amount that would be spent each year for each beneficiary. That approach would allow increases in total spending as Medicaid enrollment grew, a particular likelihood in times of recession.
The President's demand that Medicaid remain an entitlement is in contrast with his position on welfare. There, he has accepted the Republican argument that the main Federal welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, should be turned over to the states and that poor families with children should no longer be guaranteed Federal assistance.
On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office is scheduled to issue its latest economic projections and spending forecasts. But it is unclear whether that will be the moment for serious negotiations on the budget to begin or whether the two sides will continue, as they have for the last two weeks, merely to jockey for political position.
The agreement between the President and Congress that ended the partial shutdown of the Government last month expires next Friday. With no progress made in the negotiations this week, there seems little chance of a budget agreement before the deadline.
Mr. Clinton asked Congress on Thursday to approve another temporary measure that would extend the Government's spending authority through much of January, but Republicans in the House of Representatives have been resistant.
This afternoon the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, and Speaker Newt Gingrich sent a letter to the White House asking the President to submit a new budget next week with $400 billion in lower spending, the amount needed to match the Republican savings.
In a letter of response, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, did not directly address the request but urged the Congressional leaders to agree to temporary legislation that would prevent another partial Government shutdown.

HEADLINE: Melvin Kranzberg, 78, Historian of Technology

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Melvin Kranzberg, a scholar who helped establish the study of the history of technology and explained its impact on society, died on Wednesday at his home in Atlanta. Dr. Kranzberg, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, was 78.
The cause was cancer, said August Giebelhaus, a professor of history at Georgia Tech and a longtime colleague. 
 Dr. Kranzberg co-founded the Society for the History of Technology in 1958. From then until 1984, he was the editor of its quarterly journal, Technology and Culture.
"His life's work was to assert the autonomy of this discipline," Professor Giebelhaus said. "It was not just applied science, and it was not just a minor part of economic history, but it was a discipline in itself.
Dr. Kranzberg argued that technological development could not be understood without seeing how it was linked to society.
He wrote or edited 11 books and wrote more than 150 scholarly articles; he also popularized his field in newspaper articles.
In a 1968 article, he wrote: "Engineers, in general, live in the suburbs, vote Republican and mouth the cliches of conservatism. Actually, if unwittingly, they are greater social revolutionaries than many wild-eyed political radicals.
"Without necessarily meaning to, they invent new products, processes, systems and devices that produce profound socio-cultural transformations."
The automobile self-starter, he wrote, freed women and children to see the world and electric washers, driers, vacuum cleaners, supermarkets and telephones freed women for "drinking, loafing, heavy thinking about issues like Vietnam and even jobs, the same as men."
"Radicals" like the inventors Watt, Fulton, McCormick, Edison and Marconi, he said, changed the face of the world.
Early in the computer era, he foresaw immense social upheaval, but he remained optimistic, as he generally was about technological change.
Writing more than 25 years ago, he said, "There is no doubt that many individuals will be thrown out of their jobs by automation, and the process will accelerate with every passing year. At the same time computers are speeding and extending the advance of science and technology at a pace never before witnessed in history. This, we know, will create new lines of productivity, new and better jobs, new professions and untold wealth."
Dr. Kranzberg was born on Nov. 22, 1917, in St Louis. He studied history and economics at Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1938. At Harvard University he earned a master's degree in 1938 and a doctorate in 1942.
During World War II, he served in the Army in Europe as a sergeant in military intelligence, fought in the Battle of the Bulge and interrogated German prisoners on the front lines. He won the Bronze Star for finding crucial enemy gun emplacements.
Originally a specialist in modern French history, Dr. Kranzberg taught at Harvard, the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., and Amherst. In 1952 he joined the faculty of at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. There, while developing a history course for engineering students, he shifted to the history of technology.
He was appointed a professor at Case in 1959, and left in 1972 to become the Callaway Professor of the History of Technology at Georgia Tech. When he retired in 1988, he became a professor emeritus, and the institute named a professorship in the history of technology in his honor.
His awards included the NASA Apollo Achievement Award, the Roe Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the State of Israel's Jabotinsky Centennial Medal for eminence in science and letters, the Olmstead Award of the American Society for Engineering Education and the Bernal Award of the Society for Social Studies of Science.
Dr. Kranzberg is survived by his wife, the former Louise Lester of Atlanta; two sons by a previous marriage, John and Steven, both of St. Louis; a brother, Maurice, also of St. Louis, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A New Safety Net Is Created For Homeowners in Quakes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
California took a big step yesterday toward overhauling its homeowners' earthquake insurance market to create a new financial safety net for homeowners, replacing insurance companies.
After a heated competition among 40 securities firms, the state said firms led byMorgan Stanley & Company would handle an innovative $1.5 billion bond sale that would be part of a $10.5 billion package to pay homeowners' claims. 
 The plan also calls for homeowners to absorb much more of the risk from earthquakes because new policies will provide less coverage than existing policies.
After the Northridge earthquake in January 1994, which resulted in $12.5 billion of insurance losses -- $8.2 billion from homeowners, most insurance companies stopped accepting new customers, putting California officials under pressure to change the market.
"This plan makes insurance more widely available," said Chuck Quackenbush, California's Insurance Commissioner, adding that it also answered concerns about the solvency of many companies after a big quake.
Under the new mini-policies that will go on sale Jan. 1, homeowner premiums will be about the same as those for existing earthquake policies, but the new policies will provide less coverage. The two largest cutbacks are a $5,000 limit on coverage for a home's contents and a $1,500 limit on living expenses paid if a home is uninhabitable.
If the new mini-policies had been in place for the earthquake at Northridge, near Los Angeles, claims on homeowner policies would have been cut in half, insurers say. California Insurance Department officials expect the mini-policies to cost about the same as old policies, where premiums currently range from about $1.50 per $1,000 of coverage in a low-risk areas, to $4 per $1,000 in high- risk areas.
Although insurance companies will sell the new mini-policies and handle their claims, the $1.1 billion in annual premiums will go to the California Earthquake Authority, not the companies. The authority will use the premiums to pay for its expenses and for the $10.5 billion insurance plan.
The $10.5 billion plan taps many sources to pay homeowner claims, starting with $1 billion in cash contributed by insurance companies. The next $3 billion in claims would be covered by funds that insurance companies promise to provide if needed. The next $2 billion of coverage comes from reinsurers, followed by $1 billion from tax-exempt bonds that would be sold after an earthquake. The next $1.5 billion of claims would be covered by investors in the Morgan Stanley bond issue to be sold early next year, with another $2 billion available from an assessment on insurance companies.
Insurers and securities dealers close to the financing are optimistic that reinsurance can be bought for not much more than $300 million a year, or more than 15 percent of the coverage offered. Interest rates on the bonds would average slightly less than the reinsurance cost, but would vary widely depending on how much risk investors took.
Some investors, who agree that they would lose only part of their interest after an earthquake, might earn interest rates comparable with those of medium-quality corporate bonds, while others who could lose all of their interest or principal could earn rates more than 10 percentage points higher than Treasury notes.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Leaps in Early Trading But Falls Back on Profit Taking

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar soared in early trading yesterday to an 11-week high against the German mark, but then European traders took their profits and the currency ended little changed.
Currency traders said the dollar's ascent was set off by a rally in United States Treasury bond prices, which caused traders to push the currency through important technical levels. 
 Treasury bonds jumped after the release of a weaker-than-expected employment report for November improved the odds of lower interest rates ahead.
"The market bought the dollar because the bonds were rallying," said Joe Viola, a manager at Credit Suisse. "But after that there was no follow-through and the market sold it back down."
The dollar hit a high of 1.4550 marks, and soared to a 17-month high of $1.5205 to a British pound.
But once the bond rally stalled, European corporate traders, particularly from Germany, cashed in their dollar holdings.
"The dollar made some nice new ground on the top side, and we had some Friday afternoon profit taking," said Richard Vullo, dealer at Bayerische Hypobank. "That brought us down off the highs, but I don't think it changes the overall bullish tone."
The dollar continued to be supported by comments on Thursday by the president of the German central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, who said he hoped for a stronger dollar against the mark. Traders said the comments suggested that the central bank, the Bundesbank, could soon lower interest rates.
And the dollar was helped as French markets continued to perform strongly in the face of a crippling national strike by public-sector workers, but some economists said investors might be too optimistic. The French franc's resilience against the mark makes the dollar more attactive relative to the mark.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.4475 German marks, up from 1.4467 marks on Thursday. The British pound ended unchanged at $1.5325. The dollar slipped to 101.30 Japanese yen from 101.47 yen.
"It was really just magnified by thin conditions," said David Solin, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics. "There has really been no net change on the day."

HEADLINE: Data Show Fewer Jobs in New York Region

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Employment in the New York City metropolitan region dipped in November as a national slowdown continued to spill over into sluggish hiring across New York City, New York State and New Jersey.
According to the Federal Government's monthly employment report, there were 35,000 fewer jobs in New York State in November than in October, a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent. The loss was concentrated in New York City, where there were 46,000 fewer jobs in November than in the previous month, a 2 percent decline. 
 In New Jersey, the report said, 36,000 fewer people were employed in November than in October, a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent.
The unemployment rate, a measure of the number of people who are actively seeking jobs but unable to find them, improved slightly in New York State, to 6 percent, from 6.3 percent in October, and in New York City, to 7.8 percent, from 8 percent in October. But the rate rose in New Jersey, to 6.1 percent, from 5.8 percent in October.
John L. Wieting, the New York regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issued the report, said the slowdown reflected a decline in hiring across the nation. The report covered employment in the 11 largest industrial states; Connecticut is not among the 11 surveyed.
"The forces of the national slowdown filtered into the region in November," he said. Among those forces, he said, was a downturn in manufacturing that was particularly sharp in the Middle West, but also undermined employment in the region, particularly in New Jersey.
The dip in November came after a slight improvement in October, when both New York and New Jersey had employment gains, and reflected a series of small monthly gains and losses that have left the regional economy sluggish, but on a largely even economic keel, since the beginning of the year.
Among the strongest sectors of the regional economy in recent months have been tourism, restaurant sales and the entertainment industries.
"The numbers are still somewhat encouraging," Mr. Wieting said. Although the New York region lagged behind most of the nation in the economic recovery of 1993-94, he said, it did not experience the downturn suffered by other regions in the last 11 months.
"We are holding our own," he said.

HEADLINE: New York Welfare Limits Will Prove Costly

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You detail (front page, Dec. 3) Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed overhaul of New York's welfare system, but its effect on the state was not addressed. 
 The 60-day time limit on employable home relief recipients will result in 180,000 New Yorkers being without cash assistance within months. Even assuming these recipients are employable, which many are not, where are the jobs into which they are expected to move?
In the past year, the Albany area had a net gain of only 100 jobs. The Governor's proposed time limits will result in an additional 1,500 capital district residents in need of immediate unsubsidized employment.
New York City gained only 8,800 jobs in the past year. Yet with time limits, more than 149,000 New York City residents will soon be cut off from benefits and in need of work.
In states like Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania, the results have been the same: former recipients have not been able to secure employment at a living wage. Instead, the terminated population has experienced increased homelessness, hunger and health problems.
Time limits, like many simple solutions to complicated problems, will be costly in economic as well as human terms. If New York is interested in a welfare-to-work approach, start creating jobs.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
With No McDowell, The Focus Is on Cone

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
The Yankees made a last-ditch attempt to maintain dialogue with Jack McDowell by asking him to reject salary arbitration if they offered it to him by Thursday's deadline. Not surprisingly, McDowell refused this proposal because it would have heavily favored the Yankees. Thus, they relinquished their negotiating rights to the pitcher and essentially terminated any possibility of re-signing him.
If McDowell had accepted the proposal, he would have rejected their arbitration offer by Dec. 19, meaning that the Yankees would not have had to pay him as much as $6 million in 1996. Then the Yankees could have still discussed a more economically feasible contract with him and held his rights until Jan. 8. 
 Since McDowell never even received a preliminary offer from the Yankees, did not want to be played against David Cone, a fellow free agent, and did not want another team to be forced to surrender draft choices to the Yankees if he signed elsewhere, he rejected the idea.
"That wouldn't have done us any good," Jim McDowell, McDowell's brother and agent, said about a practice that is not unusual in baseball.
Without McDowell, the Yankees seriously desire Cone. They already have Mariano Duncan, they want Mickey Tettleton and they should not neglect Roberto Alomar. Welcome to the Yankees' hectic off season, in which they are competing with Baltimore for Cone and Alomar and where they won a smaller skirmish over the Orioles by signing Duncan, a utility infielder, to a two-year, $1.5 million contract yesterday.
By severing ties with McDowell, the Yankees have made it even more imperative that they sign Cone to anchor the pitching staff. Since Cone had a positive meeting with General Manager Pat Gillick and Manager Davey Johnson on Thursday and told an Oriole official that he wants his wife to visit the Baltimore area next week, the Yankees could wave goodbye to two former Cy Young Award winners in a brief time span. Still, the owner George Steinbrenner is not panicking.
"If we don't sign Cone or one of the other free agents, we could be short," Steinbrenner said. "But Cone's not the only one out there."
General Manager Bob Watson said Cone is expected to respond to a three-year, $15 million offer early next week, but Cone's price tag probably escalated when the Yankees parted with McDowell. The Orioles, who have not yet made an offer, figure that Cone wants a three-year, $18 million contract, and they are concerned about the Yankees outspending them because New York does not have a safety net in McDowell.
"As I look at it, it puts them in a tenuous position with Cone," said Jim McDowell. "I assume they feel pretty good about their chances of signing him. But if they don't sign him and they've given up on Jack, then who knows?"
McDowell was 15-10 with a 3.93 earned run average for the Yankees and was first in the American League in complete games and third in innings pitched. He is durable, but the Yankees privately expressed concern about back spasms that sidelined him last season and about a congenital condition in his right hip. Despite the hip condition, McDowell is routinely among the league leaders in starts, innings and complete games.
"Maybe more pitchers should have a hip like Jack, and then they would be able to pitch as well as him," Jim McDowell said.
Watson, who did not return telephone calls, signed Duncan yesterday to try to replace Randy Velarde. Duncan, who hit .287 with 6 homers and 36 runs batted in for the Phillies and Reds last year, accepted New York's offer to be a utility player over Baltimore's one-year offer to be a second baseman.
Since the Orioles told Duncan he would play second, what about their interest in Alomar? Not to be outmaneuvered, Gillick quickly contacted Jaime Torres, Alomar's agent, yesterday. Gillick said the Orioles can afford Cone and Alomar, who had told the Orioles he wanted a three-year, $23 million contract. But Gillick said it would be difficult to sign the duo and also snare a high-priced closer like Rick Aguilera or Jeff Montgomery.
Alomar's proposal to the Yankees was three years for $25 million, and Torres has not heard from Watson since last week. Watson's chief priority is signing Cone, but Torres will not wait for the Yankees because several teams are interested in Alomar.
"If Roberto Alomar is down on their list of priorities, that would indicate to me they are not that interested in him," Torres said. "We will not hold back in analyzing and deciding on other clubs to give the Yankees time to come around and discuss more seriously with Roberto."
The Yankees have made an undisclosed offer to Tettleton, who they want to use as a designated hitter and as a shaky backup at catcher, first base and in the outfield. But Tettleton has three other offers and would rather return to Texas.
After sporting one of the best one-two pitching punches in baseball with the durable Cone and the more durable McDowell, who combined to go 24-12 for the Yankees last year, they might not have either in 1996. Steinbrenner said the decision on McDowell was a blend of baseball and financial considerations. His former manager might have acted differently.
"It's not my money, but I'd bring both of them back," Buck Showalter said in September. "Where else are you going to find guys like that?"

HEADLINE: Lots of Russian Jews Still Seek to Emigrate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A Dec. 3 news article paints a rosy picture of the future of Russian Jewry. You say "Jewish emigration from Russia is dropping sharply" yet cite no statistics. Almost 70,000 Jews have emigrated to Israel this year, a rate higher than last year. And the United States has no problem filling the Jewish part of its quota of 64,000 visas for the former Soviet Union. You say emigration is confined largely to the elderly, yet Israeli statistics show a normal age distribution of Russian immigrants coming to Israel. 
 Your bright depiction of Russia's future would amaze Russian Jews (and Russians in general) tormented by economic realities, an unraveling political system, gangster-ridden cities and a war in the Caucasus.
Russian Jewry's rebirth would be welcome. Until then, most Russian Jews would continue to prefer Israel and the United States for political stability, security and prosperity; poverty-stricken, historically anti-Semitic Russia has little to offer by contrast.

HEADLINE: Treasury Bonds Rally on Weak Jobs Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds moved higher yesterday in a rally induced by a weaker-than-expected employment report, but closed off their peaks.
The soft jobs numbers lifted investor hopes for a cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, bringing in buyers and reversing the effects of Thursday's selloff. Then, news services reported that the Fed's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, had said that the markets were overly optimistic about an easing in December, and trading chilled. 
 The 30-year benchmark bond rose 15/32 , to a price of 111 11/32 to yield 6.05 percent, down from 6.08 percent on Thursday.
The Labor Department reported that 166,000 nonfarm jobs were added to the economy in November, after a revised increase of 66,000 in October. The department also reported that the unemployment rate for November rose to 5.6 percent from 5.5 percent.
Another Government report yesterday showed that home sales were weak in October, but Treasury securities made no further gains and that troubled some investors, inducing some profit taking. Traders said it appeared that 6 percent was a difficult barrier for the long-bond yield to fall below.
P. Christopher Leary, senior vice president and portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management, said the economic numbers confirmed "the market's perception of further weakness in the economy, which will further support a Fed easing in December and begin to raise questions about growth in early 1996."
Mr. Leary said the trailing three-month average of nonfarm payroll numbers was half that of early 1995, suggesting a weakening labor market. He said it indicated that there was no increase in wage pressures.
"We also saw today a continuing decline in the Columbia Leading Inflation Index to 103.3 versus a revised 104.4," Mr. Leary said. "The economic data support the continuation of a soft landing, and that should be good to the market." He also expressed optimism that Congress and the Administration would resolve their differences and balance the budget.
Michael Krauss, chief technical strategist at Chemical Securities Inc., described the session as choppy. "The bottom line is that technicals have been friendly since August, but early this week we reached a risk level," he said.

HEADLINE: First Lady Officially Sets Off Clinton Race

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., Dec. 8

 BODY:
Stepping back onto the campaign trail and abandoning her self-imposed lower profile, Hillary Rodham Clinton officially registered her husband as a candidate in the nation's first primary state today. She lost no time in accusing Republicans of making budget proposals that would "knock down the ladder of opportunity after they themselves have reached the top."
With scores of reporters and camera people shoving each other to catch a glimpse of her, Mrs. Clinton stood at an antique desk in the office of the New Hampshire Secretary of State to submit the papers that officially begin President Clinton's re-election campaign. 
 "There weren't very many other people here when I was here before," she said, remembering what little notice she had received when she submitted the same forms in 1991.
Mrs. Clinton quickly put to rest any idea that her departure from the spotlight after the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994 and her focus on more traditional activities for a First Lady, like receiving the White House Christmas tree, meant that she would not be a force on the campaign trail in 1996.
"I'm going to continue to do what I've done for more than 20 years of marriage, which is support my husband," she said, when asked what her role would be in 1996. "I believe very strongly in what he's doing."
Mrs. Clinton crisscrossed the state in her first full campaign day, speaking at a Portsmouth apartment complex for the elderly, the University of New Hampshire in Durham and at a fund-raising reception for the State Democratic Party in Manchester.
Shortly after Mrs. Clinton left the Secretary of State's office, Senator Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner, showed up there to enter his party's primary.
"It is a race between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole," said Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader, acting as if he had already the nomination.
Mr. Dole, who chugged into town on a train called The Balanced Budget Express, was greeted at the station, in subzero temperatures, by a small group of supporters headed by Gov. Stephen Merrill
The Dole and Clinton camps coordinated their schedules to avoid a direct meeting between the two. As he signed up for the primary, Mr. Dole was asked about Mrs. Clinton's criticism of Republican plans for Medicare and education, and took the opportunity to suggest that the President was not serious about balancing the budget.
"The President has done nothing but play politics" trying to frighten people, Mr. Dole said. He called Mrs. Clinton's remarks "more politics as usual."
The President is using education and Medicare to define the difference between himself and the Republican-controlled Congress, and Mrs. Clinton stumped hard today against Republican budget proposals for savings in both.
Distancing herself from partisan battles of Washington, Mrs. Clinton never mentioned Republicans directly, simply referring instead to "some people" and "the other side."
Still, her message was unmistakable. Discussing Medicare with a selected group of the elderly people arranged around her before an audience at the Margeson Apartments, she mused about "the idea some people have that we don't really need a system like Medicare for everybody."
This she called, "really, a kind of survival of the fittest mentality -- if you are healthy and you can take care of yourself and you've had enough during your lifetime, then good for you, and if you're not, then you should have done something different along life's way."
At the University of New Hampshire, she criticized Republicans for proposals to make savings in student loan and education programs. "Today there are some among us who are willing to knock down the ladder of opportunity after they themselves have reached the top," she said. "That is not the American way."
As the next Presidential election approached, Mrs. Clinton said, the nation has to decide how it will provide its citizens with the skills to earn a living, "no matter where they're born, no matter to whom they're born, no matter what their income." She added, "I believe we do not answer that question just by talking about family values. We do it by valuing families."
In 1992, Mr. Clinton's Presidential dreams almost foundered in New Hampshire because of questions about his purported marital infidelity and his draft status during the Vietnam War. He fought his way back to a second-place finish in the Democratic primary, calling himself the Comeback Kid.
This time aides say that New Hampshire is already Mr. Clinton's first victory. He is the first Democratic President since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 not to face a primary challenge here. Still, the Clinton campaign opened an office here this week and wants to maintain a presence in the state to counter the expected deluge of attacks on the President as Republicans vie with each other to win their party's nomination.
Mrs. Clinton, who sought to expand the role of the First Lady, has become a lightning rod for conservatives and a target for the Congressional committee investigating the Whitewater real estate deal. Nonetheless, Democratic strategists call her one of the President's best campaign assets, a sure draw for the liberals, women and minorities whose votes Mr. Clinton needs.
Tonight, as Democrats brandished the season's first "Clinton-Gore 96" banners, Mrs. Clinton reminded them of the recession that haunted the state the year Mr. Clinton defeated President George Bush.
"America and New Hampshire are in better shape than when my husband came here seeking the nomination," she said.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Issues Off a Bit, But Technology Stocks Rise

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday in lackluster trading, amid indications that the economy was continuing to lose momentum. Blue chips fell, while computing issues led the broader market higher.
"There has been a definite shift in the mood of the equity market," said E. Wayne Nordberg, equity partner of Lord Abbett & Company. "You've got a lot of nervous holders out there looking for the slightest hole in the dike to run for cover." 
 The market tone was set by the Labor Department's report early in the morning that the United States unemployment rate in November rose to 5.6 percent -- its first increase in four months. Later the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes dropped 2.7 percent in October, the third consecutive monthly decline.
The Dow Jones industrial average eased 2.53 points, to 5,156.86, for its second consecutive decline. But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 1.31 points, to 617.48, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 9.24 points, to 1,062.41.
Advancing and declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange were almost even, with declines totaling 1,152 and advances equaling 1,132. Big Board volume slipped to 327.9 million shares, from 381.5 million shares on Thursday.
Many technology stocks turned higher as analysts pointed to their strong fundamentals. Microsoft gained 4, to 94 1/2; it was upgraded by a handful of brokerage houses yesterday after William H. Gates, the chairman, discussed the company's strategy on Thursday. Sun Microsystems increased 6 5/8, to 99 3/4; Hewlett-Packard advanced 4 5/8, to 86 7/8; Oracle Systems rose 2 3/8, to 46 5/8, and Intel was up 1 3/4, to 63 1/4.
Oil issues, which have predictable earnings growth, again rallied. Exxon rose 7/8, to a new high of 81 3/4, and Mobil increased 2, to 110 1/2.
Shares of companies involved in consumer nondurables were in demand because traders consider them to have less exposure to economic uncertainty. For example, Gillette closed at 53 1/4, up 1 1/8, and Warner-Lambert closed at 94 1/4, up 1 1/2.
However, with a slackening in demand for certain types of economically sensitive paper products, a number of companies in this field moved lower. International Paper fell 1/2, to 37; Westvaco dropped 5/8, to 26 1/2, and Willamette Industries declined 3/8, to 58 3/4.
Chemical stocks also were down. Dow Chemical closed at 71 1/8, off 3/4, and Union Carbide closed at 39 5/8, off 1/4.
Some heavy-industry issues declined, apparently because of prospects that corporations might be spending less on expansion in 1996. Alcoa fell 7/8, to 56, and Ingersoll-Rand dropped 1/2, to 36 1/2.
Among the special situations, Neuromedical Systems jumped 5 1/8, to 20 1/8, on its first day of public trading. Mobile Telecommunication Technologies surged 2 1/4, to 22 3/8, after one of its units announced that it would sell pagers in retail stores. Incomnet increased 7/8, to 7 3/8, after the Nasdaq small-capitalization market decided that the company would be allowed to keep its listing on the market.
Earlier yesterday, Japanese stocks ended weaker. The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 125.35 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 19,286.97, after adding 532.79 points in the last two days.

HEADLINE: Report Shows Little Job Growth, Improving Odds for Rate Cut

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Job growth was modest in November and the unemployment rate edged up to 5.6 percent, the Labor Department reported today, raising the likelihood that the weak economy would cause the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates this month.
"All the way through it was a very soft report," said Donald E. Maude, an analyst in New York for Scotia McLeod, an investment firm. He raised his estimate of the odds of a rate cut this month to 50-50 instead of 70-30 against a cut previously. The markets have already moved in anticipation of a reduction. 
 Factories shed 32,000 more jobs in November, bringing the total lost since the most recent peak in factory employment, in March, to 220,000.
A second Government report today showed that sales of new single-family homes fell 2.7 percent in October, a third straight decline in a period when mortgage rates have fallen sharply, and one more report in a long string showing the economy had slowed markedly since a brisk summer. "Housing activity has probably peaked," Edward E. Yardeni of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C. J. Lawrence told clients.
The Clinton Administration, which admits to no fear that the recent sluggishness could deteriorate into an election-year recession, nevertheless fretted today about some aspects of the economy.
"Manufacturing continues to be troubling," said Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, referring to the loss of factory jobs last month. "It's directly related to a large pileup of unsold goods."
Mr. Reich also said he was "concerned" by a slight decline in hourly earnings last month. The decline left the 12-month increase at 3 percent, barely above the latest 12-month inflation rate. This, he suggested, implies that workers -- many of them heavily indebted -- are unlikely to do enough shopping to lighten overstocked shelves.
Others, however, took solace in the low inflation and in the improved prospects that the Fed will lower interest rates when it holds a policy meeting on Dec. 19.
Among 11 large industrial states, California saw its jobless rate jump a full point, to 8.8 percent, despite a smaller work force. The rate was 7.2 percent in September.
In New York, the rate improved to 6 percent from 6.3, but in New Jersey it increased to 6.1 percent from 5.8 in October.
Although the national payrolls expanded over all by a moderate 166,000, about what analysts expected, the gain was significantly exaggerated by special factors. One was that the department's survey period lasted five weeks, rather than the usual four, because of a quirk of the calendar. The survey thus picked up 25,000 more retailing and other seasonal jobs than the adjustment process allows for.
And 44,000 jobs resulted from the introduction of updated seasonal factors that will be applied from November through April.
Today's figures were unaffected by the midmonth furlough of "nonessential" Federal workers during the budget impasse, because they remained on payrolls. Nor did the furlough make the data significantly less accurate, since surveyors and processors were able to catch up with their work on overtime once they returned, Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said.
Strength in the payroll survey was confined largely to health services, which added 37,000 jobs; to transportation, and to a finance industry that posted its biggest job gain -- 14,000 -- in two years.
The loss in factory jobs was evenly divided between the durable and nondurable goods industries, with nearly half of the decline reflecting automotive layoffs. A number of auto plants have been shut down because of excessive inventories of vehicles.
The department's survey of about 56,000 households, which is more erratic than the payroll survey of 390,000 employers, showed a hefty 389,000 drop in employment. But this was accompanied by a 206,000 decline in the labor force, which has grown exceptionally slowly this year.
As a result, the unemployment rate moved up just a tenth of a point in November, a change deemed statistically insignificant.
Among demographic groups, joblessness among adult men jumped four-tenths of a point, to 4.9 percent, but this caused no alarm because it followed a drop by that amount in October.
In addition to California, other industrial states that had big increases in unemployment were Pennsylvania, up 1.2 points, to 6.3 percent, and Ohio, up 1.1 points, to 5.8 percent.
For lack of money to conduct sufficient sampling, the Government will discontinue publishing these figures for the 11 states, beginning with the Feb. 2 release covering January. Officials said they were considering the substitution of a list of four states -- New York, California, Texas and Florida -- whose samples will remain adequate. But Commissioner Abraham said that all four would need to agree to participate and that this was not assured.
Today's report also showed that the index of aggregate weekly hours, derived from the number of people at work and the hours they spent on the job, slumped to 133.3 in November from 133.8. That implies that industrial production fell for a second straight month. And only 43.2 percent of manufacturing industries added workers last month, down from 49.6 percent in October, the report found.
