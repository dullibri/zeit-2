HEADLINE: Those Illegal Farm Subsidies

 BODY:
America's lavish handouts to its farmers harvest poverty throughout the developing world. And they are illegal as well. That's the conclusion of a World Trade Organization panel that heard Brazil's challenge to the cotton subsidies that belie this nation's commitment to free and fair trade. 
 Cotton is far from the only crop that American farmers are able to dump on the international market at low prices thanks to federal subsidies. But it is one of the most outrageous cases. Brazil was wise in choosing it as the first target in the developing world's challenge of the roughly $1 billion a day in subsidies that rich nations dole out to their farmers. If the preliminary ruling stands, as expected, it may mean the beginning of the end for European and American practices that provide their farmers an unfair advantage.
 In addition to Brazil, an agricultural superpower, some of the world's poorest nations, including the West African republics of Mali, Benin and Burkina Faso, are vindicated by the W.T.O.'s decision. Cotton is West Africa's cash crop, the one economic activity in which the region has a competitive advantage. By underwriting much of the costs of America's 25,000 cotton farmers with checks that can total $3 billion a year, Washington erases that advantage. Aided by American experts who are critics of this warped system, Brazil convincingly argued that in the absence of subsidies, the United States would have produced and exported substantially less cotton than it did in recent years. Consequently, growers elsewhere would have enjoyed greater market share and higher prices.
 The glaring contradiction between American farm subsidies and the principles underlying the global trade system has long posed a moral and political problem for Washington. Now it is also a legal problem. Instead of digging in its heels and spending years appealing the panel's ruling, the Bush administration needs to seize upon it as a reason to negotiate the surrender of rich nations' trade-distorting farm subsidies.
 The administration has a mixed record on this issue. It offered proposals to start weaning corporate farmers off their subsidies two years ago -- admittedly after approving a farm bill that exacerbated the problem. Then it backed away in the face of strong opposition from Congress and the European Union. That retreat not only hurt the poor nations' farmers, but also American taxpayers, consumers and most business interests, including more competitive farmers. 
 The W.T.O.'s talks on the further liberalization of trade faltered over the subsidy issue at Cancun last year, but this week's ruling will vastly strengthen the position of Brazil and others advocating the dismantling of agricultural subsidies that distort trade. The sooner they prevail, the better.

HEADLINE: Companies Owned by Women Set the Pace in Small Business

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27 

 BODY:
Companies owned by women are growing at double the rate of all small businesses in the nation, spending $550 billion a year on payroll and benefits, according to figures released Tuesday by a research group.
 This year, women own a 50 percent or larger stake in 10.6 million privately held companies, the Center for Women's Business Research said. This is almost 48 percent of the country's privately held businesses. Companies owned by women have $2.46 trillion in sales and employ just over 19 million people nationwide, according to the latest data from the center, which is based in Washington. 
 ''We estimate that women-owned firms are growing at close to twice the rate of all privately held firms, 17 percent versus 9 percent,'' said Myra M. Hart, a Harvard Business School professor and chairwoman of the center.
 ''These businesses are a critical component of the economy,'' she said, ''not only in terms of their influence but also in terms of their economic impact.''
 That impact is often little noticed, said Deborah Davis, 41, who owns four dry cleaners in the Los Angeles area called Cleaner By Nature. 
 ''It's happened so fast,'' said Ms. Davis, who has 18 employees. ''When I was born, women didn't usually own their own businesses. It's a tremendous change in one generation.''
 Also, said Ms. Davis, ''women often find niches in the marketplace where men aren't, so they don't have as high a profile.''
 The study estimated that employment at companies owned by women increased 24 percent in seven years, compared with 12 percent at all privately owned companies.
 ''There is a perception that women-owned businesses are smaller,'' said Nina McLemore, who runs a women's executive clothing business in New York. Compared with businesses owned by men, she said, ''Yes, they are still a bit smaller, but not significantly so, and they don't stay smaller.''
 When Ms. McLemore's business began 13 months ago, she was its only worker; it now has 13 employees. In its first year, her company had $1.5 million in revenue, reflecting another trend noted in the study: estimated revenue for companies owned by women is increasing rapidly. Since 1997, revenue at companies owned by women has risen 39 percent, compared with 34 percent for all privately owned companies.
 ''These firms are driving growth in the American workplace,'' said Joy Ott, spokeswoman for the Women's Business Services program at Wells Fargo & Company, which paid for the study. 
 According to the study, businesses owned by women are found in all industries, but 45 percent, or 4.9 million, are service companies; 16.4 percent, or 1.8 million, are in retail; 9 percent, or 966,662, in finance, insurance or real estate; and 6 percent, or 652,807, in construction. 
 The construction business has experienced a major increase in the number of companies owned by women. From 1997 to 2004, the study found, the number of construction companies owned by women increased 30 percent.
 In transportation, communications and public utilities, growth in the number of businesses owned by women was 28 percent, and agricultural services grew 24 percent. 
 The No.1 state in 2004 for companies owned by women was California, followed by Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois and Ohio. The rankings were based on a combination of factors.

HEADLINE: A Texas Jury Rules Against A Diet Drug

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON and JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
A jury in a state court in Beaumont, Tex., ruled yesterday that the pharmaceutical company Wyeth should pay $1 billion to the family of a woman who died from lung disease that the plaintiff's lawyers said was caused by a diet drug the company made in the 1990's.
 While the verdict may well be reduced by the judge or on appeal, making it unlikely that the company will have to pay anything near that sum, the size of the award threatens the company's efforts to put behind it the liability from the diet drug, fen-phen, analysts and plaintiffs' lawyers said.
 While Wyeth has battled tens of thousands of claims from people saying they suffered heart valve damage after taking fen-phen, this is the first verdict against the company involving a case that asserted that the drug caused lung damage. 
 Lawyers for Wyeth said they planned to appeal the verdict and criticized the judge for excluding evidence they said would have bolstered their case. 
 ''There is absolutely no basis in the record for the amounts awarded,'' Bill Sims, a lawyer representing Wyeth, said in a statement. 
 But analysts said the verdict was likely to frustrate Wyeth's attempts to resolve its liability from the diet drug. Noting that Wyeth had already set aside $16 billion ''and counting'' to cover the cost of litigation arising from the drug, Hemant K. Shah, an analyst in Warren, N.J., said it was more ''negative news in the saga of diet drugs.'' 
 Plaintiffs' lawyers say Wyeth faces dozens of such lawsuits and assert that the company will now find resolving those cases much more difficult and expensive. 
 ''There's no question that it will have an impact on what plaintiffs' lawyers are willing to take, and it's going to embolden more plaintiffs' lawyers to try more of those cases,'' said Peter Kraus, a lawyer at Waters & Kraus in Dallas. Mr. Kraus said he represents 11 fen-phen plaintiffs with heart valve damage. ''It's a huge win,'' he said.
 Other lawyers said there are many plaintiffs with lung disease that they say was caused by the diet drug. ''My office has over 100 cases similar to this one, and we anticipate that many of these will be filed by the end of this year,'' George Fleming, a lawyer at Fleming & Associates in Houston, said in a statement from a group of lawyers representing people who say they were harmed by fen-phen.
 Wyeth said the vast majority of these cases have already been resolved. ''The company has settled all but a handful of those cases,'' said Tim Atkeson, one of Wyeth's lawyers.
 Mr. Atkeson also asserted that the amount that might actually be paid in the case would probably be much lower than yesterday's verdict. ''These numbers are going to come way down,'' he said.
 Under Texas law, lawyers said, punitive damages are limited to twice the amount of economic damages -- like the cost of medical care and lost wages -- and an additional $750,000. In this case, the jury awarded $113 million in compensatory damages, which include economic damages, and $900 million in punitive damages, the plaintiff's lawyers said. The trial court judge or an appellate court has the power to reduce the punitive damage award. 
 Yesterday's verdict resolved a case brought by the family of Cynthia Cappel-Coffey, who died as a result of primary pulmonary hypertension, a disease that destroys the lungs and that has been linked to fen-phen. 
 But Wyeth said that Ms. Cappel-Coffey's condition might have been caused by something other than fen-phen. In the company's statement, Mr. Sims said that Ms. Cappel-Coffey ''did not develop P.P.H. symptoms until more than four years after she stopped using'' one of the two drugs that make up fen-phen, sold under the name Pondimin. He continued, ''There are no studies that demonstrate an association between Pondimin use and an increased risk of P.P.H. that long after cessation of use.'' 
 Mr. Sims also said in the statement that the court had not permitted the company to present evidence that might have suggested that the damage to her lungs had been caused by another diet drug. The court excluded evidence that Ms. Cappel-Coffey used four other diet drugs after she took Wyeth's Pondimin, he said. 
 ''The court's decision to preclude all mention of the risks of other diet drugs in this case will be a significant issue on appeal,'' Mr. Sims said. 
 Wyeth has tried to close the door on its fen-phen liability, in part by financing a $3.75 billion trust to pay those who suffered heart valve damage from the drug. The company has set aside nearly $17 billion to cover its liability. 
 While the company asserts that it has no plans to add to money it has set aside to cover these claims, analysts said Wyeth might not have a choice. Exactly how much may need to be added is unclear -- analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company said the amount could be $2 billion to $20 billion.
 Wyeth reported net income of just more than $2 billion on annual revenue of $15.9 billion in 2003. The company's stock closed yesterday at $39.27 a share, down 23 cents. The verdict was announced after the market closed.

HIGHLIGHTS

PLAYWRIGHTS IN CONGRESS -- Arthur Miller, Wendy Wasserstein, left, and Stephen Sondheim are to appear today before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington to testify in behalf of a bill to pave the way for playwrights to negotiate with producers on a new standard contract. The bill, the Playwrights Licensing Antitrust Initiative Act of 2004, is sponsored by Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, the committee chairman, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. The bill would create an antitrust exemption that would enable playwrights as a group and producers as a group to bargain collectively on a new contract, said John Weidman, who wrote the book for Mr. Sondheim's musical ''Assassins'' and is the president of the Dramatists Guild of America. ''The contract has not been systematically revisited since 1982, so it is woefully out of date,'' he said. Mr. Weidman said the legislation ''seems like an essential step if we are all to receive the outcome we want, which is a healthy theater, particularly here in New York City but around the country as well.''

FILM: IRANIAN HIT -- An award-winning Iranian film comedy that pokes fun at the conservative Muslim clerics who run the country is a hit after escaping a ban by Iran's zealous censors, Reuters reported yesterday. The film, ''The Lizard,'' directed by Kamal Tabrizi, tells the story of a thief, Reza Marmoulak (Reza the Lizard), who escapes from a prison hospital disguised as a cleric and takes up the life of a holy man. His straightforward language proves inspirational to worshipers, who come flocking to mosques, and Reza undergoes a moral transformation. Theaters showing the film have added late-night screenings after regular performances were sold out days in advance. ''It's unprecedented in Iran's cinema history,'' said Nasser Shabani, manager of the Fardis-e Barin film distribution company. Although the film won the audience prize in February at an international festival in Tehran, its release was delayed for more than a month while censors debated its fate. ''The Lizard'' was cleared for distribution after four scenes totaling one minute were cut, Reuters said. But in the northwestern shrine city Mashhad, where most of the action is set, the film was banned by the local judiciary, the IRNA news agency said yesterday.

WQXR AND ABC'S NATIONWIDE PLANS -- WQXR, the classical music radio station of The New York Times, and the ABC Radio Networks are exploring the creation of a nationally distributed classical radio network. An announcement yesterday said the potential new programming, produced by WQXR (96.3 FM in New York) independent of its current programming, would be intended for a national audience and for markets without commercial classical stations. Tom Bartunek, the president and general manager of WQXR, said, ''Many classical listeners have been disenfranchised, and the current economics of local radio ownership make it difficult for middle- and small-market stations to establish the format on their own.'' ABC Radio Networks distributes 10 24-hour formats and other programming to 4,500 radio stations. Traug Keller, president of ABC Radio Networks, said WQXR's expertise in classic music radio ''is the key element to this new product.'' The the new service is to start early in 2005.

ELTON PLAYS THE MUSIC HALL -- Elton John, left, is to make his Radio City Music Hall debut with five concerts in July, when he and his band will be accompanied for the first time in North America by a full symphony orchestra and a choir featuring students from the Royal Academy of Music in London and the Juilliard School. The proceeds from the opening night concert, on July 13, will support the Elton John Musical Scholarship established last year at his alma mater, the Royal Academy, and will finance a scholarship at Juilliard. Tickets for the concerts, including those on July 14, 16, 17 and 18, go on sale through TicketMaster at 10 a.m. Monday. The event will be filmed for a Bravo television special to be broadcast during the holiday season.

CONCERT ABANDONED -- The Dave Matthews Band has abandoned plans for a festival in the New York region on the July 4 weekend, said a Reuters-Billboard report. The event was reportedly to be held on Governors Island, accessible only by ferry. Instead the group has added shows on July 2 and 3 at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

FOOTNOTES

The Hartford Stage Company, the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey and the Yale Repertory Theater are among 22 theater companies chosen by the National Endowment for the Arts to take part in the second phase of its Shakespeare in American Communities Initiative. The companies will receive matching funds to take Shakespeare productions to students from at least 10 schools in their communities during the 2004-5 school year. . . . Ingrid Bergman (1915-1982) will be the subject of a tribute at Scandinavia House, where the exhibition ''Here's Looking at You, Kid: Selections From the Ingrid Bergman Collection'' (May 1-July 17) will be complemented by the Wednesday film series, ''Ingrid Bergman: From Sweden to the World,'' next Wednesday through June 30.

HEADLINE: British Boom Driven by Personal Debt

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, April 27 

 BODY:
In recent weeks, two snapshot events framed the evolving saga of Britain's booming economy, one of the fastest-growing in the industrialized world.
 First, in early March, the widow of Stephen Lewis, a 37-year-old engineering worker earning about $39,000 a year, revealed that he had taken his own life after running up $117,000 in debt on 19 separate credit cards. The debt left him facing monthly interest payments in excess of his pretax earnings -- a parable of Britain's growing dependence on credit.
 Then, a month later, word emerged from the other end of the wealth spectrum that Lakshmi Mittal, an Indian-born steel magnate living in Britain, had agreed to spend around $126 million to buy a house in central London -- an emblem, if ever there was one, of the soaring cost of real estate. 
 But this is not a tale of rich and poor, even though an annual survey by The Sunday Times of London found that the very uppermost crust of British residents had become richer by an average of 30 percent over the last 12 months -- roughly 10 times the average pay raises of the citizenry. (Mr. Mittal ranked fifth on the rich list with an estimated $6.3 billion; first was the Russian tycoon Roman Abramovich with $13.5 billion.)
 Rather, it is a story that illustrates why Britain's economy keeps on growing, and the perils that set it apart from the economies of continental Europe. While major European countries like France and Germany are stalled, forecasts of the British economy say it will grow 3 to 3.5 percent this year, much of it driven by consumer spending as manufacturing, once the cornerstone, struggles.
 At one end of the scale, ever higher house prices -- illustrated in Mr. Mittal's purchase of a huge spread in Kensington -- have sent the average value of a home in Britain soaring by 50 percent since early 2002, to $331,000, the highest figure on record and 5.3 times the average income of homeowners.
 Despite frequent forecasts of a slowdown, moreover, the average increase is running at up to 18 percent a year, according to Halifax, the mortgage lender, far outstripping consumer price inflation of 1.1 percent. Even the International Monetary Fund sounded a warning recently that the main risk to Britain's economic outlook ''is the possibility of an abrupt correction in the housing market.''
 A collapse could have dire consequences, since the large increase in real estate values has persuaded more and more people to increase their mortgages to fuel a boom in consumer spending. (In Britain, consumers can add to their mortgages to finance home improvements and other types of spending using their home, at a higher assessed value, as collateral. In contrast to the United States, interest on mortgage payments is not deductible for tax purposes. ) 
 As Mr. Lewis's debts showed, much of the spending is on credit cards issued by companies like Capital One, MBNA and the major British banks. So fierce is the rivalry to lure customers that issuers compete with low- or no-interest introductory offers that soon give way to much higher annual interest rates.
 Those higher rates have not deterred consumers.
 In the last quarter of 2003, British borrowers added a total $28.8 billion to their mortgages, the highest quarterly figure on record, pushing up spending on cars, stereos and other consumer goods. Credit card debt stands at over $80 billion -- around 5 percent of Britain's annual economic output -- and grew $1.3 billion in January alone, according to the Bank of England. Britain's total consumer debt, including mortgages is estimated at $1.8 trillion.
 But does it matter?
 Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer who has steered the economy towards a heady mix of steady growth coupled with low unemployment and inflation, shrugged off the I.M.F.'s criticism when he spoke in Washington last weekend.
 ''While house prices have certainly risen, people's mortgage payments as a share of their income, particularly for new owners, are still far below what they were 10 years ago,'' he said. Mr. Brown also noted that interest rates are 4 percent compared with ''10 percent for four years in the last world downturn.''
 The next question, then, is how long rates will stay that low if untrammeled consumer spending threatens to push up inflation? And, if rates do rise, how long will it take for repayments on mortgages to become too onerous a burden, depressing the very house prices that sustain much of the economic edifice?
 That is where economic prophecies come to resemble multiple-choice questions.
 Tony Dye, a hedge fund operator once nicknamed Dr. Doom for his forecasts in the late 1990's of a crash in technology stocks, said Britain was ''probably near the end'' of its housing boom, meaning that prices would fall 30 percent over the next five years.
 ''Everyone is hoping for a soft landing but, no, we don't have soft landings in things like this, ever,'' he said in remarks that echoed other gloomy assessments. The housing boom, he said, would ''end in tears'' as in the late 1980's and early 1990's when a housing market bust left many Britons paying off high-interest mortgages far in excess of the deflated value of their properties.
 That is the national nightmare evoked by the prospect of high interest rates. Twice since last November, the Bank of England has increased rates by 0.25 percentage point, reversing a three-year trend toward lower rates that pushed the benchmark borrowing rate to 3.5 percent. Rates now stand at 4 percent and economists are widely expecting a further modest increase, possibly in May.
 But, compared with the last bust, according to Mr. Brown, mortgage repayments account for about 7 percent of household income -- compared with 15 percent at the time of the last bust -- and interest rates are well below the double-digit levels once associated with the British economy, meaning that the economy is more cushioned than in the early 1990's.
 Nonetheless, Ian Stewart, the chief European economist at Merrill Lynch here, said that the housing market would probably begin to slow as first-time buyers were forced out by high prices. At a conference last week, he forecast that prices would rise 12.5 percent this year then begin to tail off.
 ''It's more likely to end with a general petering out of house prices,'' he said in an interview. ''Some people say that all booms end with a bust, but that isn't the case.''

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Voice Doom and Gloom On W.T.O. Ruling

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27 

 BODY:
Lawmakers from major farm states, shaken by a preliminary World Trade Organization ruling against the government's multibillion-dollar subsidies to the cotton industry, warned on Tuesday that the action could deal a severe blow to agribusinesses and farmers nationwide.
 ''This has the potential to have extraordinary consequences up and down every main street in rural America,'' Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said of the W.T.O. decision, which ruled in a case brought by Brazil that the subsidies paid to the United States cotton industry violate global trade rules.
 The ruling calls into question the 2002 farm bill, which increased subsidies to $19 billion a year for the country's biggest farmers who grow commodity crops like cotton, corn, rice, wheat and soybeans. The United States said such direct payments did not distort world trade. Brazil successfully argued that because they were underwritten by taxpayer money, American farmers grew more crops that flooded world markets, brought down world commodity prices and undercut farmers in Brazil. 
 As lawmakers demanded serious action to respond to the ruling, the White House said that it would not make any unilateral concessions but instead would work with Congress and the agriculture sector to defend the United States' farm interests.
 The case eventually could compel Washington to cut farm subsidies and force the United States, Europe and other wealthy economies to make greater concessions to poor countries at global trade talks. 
 Policy makers and officials were on the defensive, saying it was unfair for Brazil to single out the United States for its cotton subsidies when other countries have their own unfair trading practices like high tariffs and different scientific standards for agricultural imports. All those issues, they said, should be the subject of negotiations, not cases before the W.T.O.
 In a show of bipartisanship, Representative Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, and Representative Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas, the ranking members of the House Agriculture Committee, said the decision had to be appealed.
 ''Changes to countries' agricultural policies should come through the give and take of negotiations, not through decisions that do not appear based on W.T.O. rules,'' they said.
 But Brazil filed its case against the United States precisely because its officials said they were frustrated that global trade talks aimed at reducing or eliminating agricultural subsidies of wealthy nations had been blocked.
 Spreading the pain, Brazil has also filed a case at the W.T.O. against the European Union for its sugar policies. Over the last two weeks, the Europeans have been debating how to reform their policies, and reduce their subsidies in advance of any negative ruling against them.
 The ruling on cotton has revived the debate in Congress over whether to pay farmers for producing food or for conserving the environment. If the preliminary ruling holds, conservation payments could become the best way to support farmers without breaking trade rules.
 Seeking to calm worried farmers and agribusinesses, Richard Mills, the spokesman for the United States trade representative's office, said on Tuesday that there would be no immediate effect on farm policies.
 He also said the administration's response would be to press ahead with global trade talks, which broke down in Cancun, Mexico, last year, in part because of the United States stance on cotton subsidies.
 ''The best way to address any distortion in global cotton markets,'' he said ''is through the W.T.O. agricultural negotiations.''
 But lawmakers were also asking whether the United States should remain in the W.T.O. if it continued to make rulings that call into question domestic programs. 
 Allen F. Johnson, the chief agriculture negotiator for the trade representative's office, said Tuesday that if the ruling did hold it ''would have a negative effect on how officials see the W.T.O. and free trade in general.''
 Proponents of Brazil's actions said the ruling should enhance the standing of the W.T.O. by proving that developing nations could win a case against the United States.
 ''We think this is a real sign that global trade rules can work,'' said Gawain Kripke, senior trade adviser for Oxfam America, an advocacy group. ''We in the United States have to play by the same rules as everyone else does.''
 While some lawmakers worried that other nations would follow Brazil's example, it is unlikely because the litigation has already cost $1 million, a sum that is prohibitive for the poor nations that suffer the most harm from cheap subsidized imports.
 In their annual spring meetings last week, economists at the World Bank said that 144 million people could be lifted out of poverty if rich countries reduced or eliminated the $300 billion rich nations pay their farmers in subsidies and support.

HEADLINE: Required Costs Weigh Heavily On City Budget

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Deep in the back of the $46.9 billion budget proposal Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg released on Monday is a chart showing this year's hefty surplus giving way to multibillion-dollar deficits each year into the foreseeable future.
 Driving these persistent imbalances are what city officials portray as the hidden threat to the city's future fiscal health: the ''nondiscretionary'' costs, mostly for Medicaid, employee pensions and interest on municipal debt, that the mayor says are largely beyond his control. The extent to which City Hall is powerless over some of those rising expenses is debatable.
 But what is not in question is that these costs are making it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap between what New York takes in and what it spends each year. The nondiscretionary portion of the budget surpassed all other spending categories in 2002, and Mr. Bloomberg's fiscal plan estimates that it will swell to $22.3 billion in the 2008 fiscal year from $16.1 billion this year. 
 For all the good news in the latest budget, these rising nondiscretionary costs portend larger deficits in the future if revenues do not grow significantly. The mayor is projecting deficits of $3.8 billion in the fiscal year that starts in July 2005, and $4.2 billion the year after that as these costs rise. 
 As a result, the mayor says he is forced to rein in spending over those areas he does have control over: union contracts, the size of the city's workforce and other discretionary spending by city agencies. Except for periods of robust economic growth that make it easier to close the gaps, the overall trend of restraining discretionary spending, while lobbying for more federal and state aid, seems likely to continue.
 Speaking yesterday at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, where he noted that the city was spending $200 million to make up for a decrease in state aid to city hospitals, Mr. Bloomberg said the city needed to keep its priorities in sight when dealing with the deficits.
 ''We've got to find ways to keep the drastic alternatives of cutting services from having to be implemented, because people's lives and futures are at stake here,'' he said. ''We do not want to close any hospitals, and I'm confident that we will not have to close any hospitals.''
 City officials blame outside forces for most of the increases in municipal spending. They say that the state, for instance, has shifted responsibility for financing much of Medicaid to the city, which has had its Medicaid-related expenditures increase by $1.5 billion since 2000.
 Also, cost-of-living adjustments to employee pensions, mandated by the State Legislature several years ago, have added millions to the budget. Annual pension costs, which are determined by labor agreements reached between the city and its unions, are expected to nearly double, to $4.3 billion, by the 2007 fiscal year.
 While many of these nondiscretionary costs are difficult, if not impossible, for the city to curtail, there are steps the city could take to mitigate the impact, said Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the Independent Budget Office.
 Among them, he said, is continuing to seek a less costly pension formula for new employees, and rethinking expensive projects that increase the city's debt burden, which is expected to rise to $4.2 billion in 2008 from $3.4 billion this year. Mr. Bloomberg has said that he is trying to change the pension system for municipal workers and that the city has taken advantage of low interest rates to ease the cost of its debt.
 The projections of large deficits in the years ahead, particularly in light of an improving economy, has alarmed analysts on both sides of the political aisle.
 Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed group, said the mayor's plan to use $250 million to provide property tax rebates of $400 to homeowners was ''the wrong tax cut at the wrong time,'' given the future deficits that need to be closed.
 ''What the mayor is saying is that they're caused by these escalating nondiscretionary expenditures,'' Ms. Fortuna said. ''But at some point, somebody's got to get a handle on those expenditures or the city's not going to be able to function.''
 Another organization, the Budget for a Livable New York City Coalition, made up of labor, religious and community groups, found itself in an uncommon agreement with the Citizens Budget Commission. It released a statement on Monday saying that any tax cuts at this time ''are premature and fiscally irresponsible.''
 Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group, said the continued deficits were evidence that ''the city tries to do too much, and it has got a government that's bigger than it can afford.''
 Pressed on Monday during his budget presentation about his plans to close the projected deficits, Mr. Bloomberg offered few clues. Politically, it could be difficult for him to take drastic steps next year, like significant spending cuts or tax increases, because he will be seeking re-election in November 2005.
 Saying that his administration has already cut more than $3 billion from city agencies since taking office in 2002, the mayor seemed to indicate that no matter what he intended to do, a major reduction in city services would not be high on his list of options. He pointed to budget figures showing that discretionary spending in many city agencies has remained flat and, in some instances, actually decreased if adjusted for inflation.
 ''There is a point at which you get down where there is no fat anymore, if there ever was fat there,'' he said. ''Eventually, everybody agrees all that's left is bone, and those cuts are very painful. We have provided better services, but it gets harder and harder every time when you face the same problem.''

HEADLINE: Innovative Boston-Area Buildings at a Green Standard

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 27 

 BODY:
Last week, the Genzyme Corporation officially opened its $140 million, 300,000-square-foot headquarters here. Last week, in Boston, construction started on a $53 million, 160,000-square-foot science laboratory, the Biosquare Research Building D. 
 Both are among a growing crop of ''green'' projects in the Boston area -- buildings designed, engineered and built for the efficient use of energy and natural resources that have been encouraged by public incentives and demand from private companies. 
 Another green building will be inaugurated next week, when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology opens a $300 million, 713,000-square-foot classroom and office building designed by Frank O. Gehry & Associates to let in as much sunshine as possible. Even its auditorium has a sliding roof with a skylight. Next month, Manulife Financial of Toronto, will complete construction of Boston's largest green office structure to date -- a $140 million, 420,000-square-foot tower with a landscaped roof and double glass skin. 
 These developments join housing, office buildings, public and cultural facilities that reflect a growing eagerness among property owners and developers to build in a new way with special materials and specially trained professionals. 
 The green inclination is driven by an economic rationale, said Robert M. Dickey, managing director of Spaulding & Slye Colliers, the developer of Biosquare, which has leased 50 percent of its space so far. ''Green building is a new market phenomenon, and our interest is to capture the value it creates,'' he said. 
 ''From the outset of a project,'' Mr. Dickey said, ''building green changes the cost-benefit analysis,'' adding that it ''requires assembling a team of the owner, designers, engineers, contractors, brokers who are educated, experienced and make green building a top priority.''
 ''They need to understand that some decisions can take longer and cost more,'' he added. 
 The aims of green building are to minimize the use of energy, water and open space; to use sustainably produced materials; recycle waste; and have access to public transportation or car pools. As the buildings consume less energy and resources, they also strive to maximize the advantages of nature: fresh air, sunlight, views and outdoor access. 
 To qualify as ''green,'' a building registers with the U.S. Green Building Council, a nonprofit advocacy group, which issues Leeds ratings (leadership in energy and environmental design) at various levels. The top award has been given so far to only five projects in the United States and one in India. Since 2000, about 100 buildings have been certified and 1,200 more are going through the process. 
 California, with 13 green buildings and 200 in the pipeline to certification, ranks first among American states. Massachusetts is sixth, with 3 certified and 53 in the pipeline, including Genzyme, which is seeking a top rating, according to the council.
 Green buildings may cost 1 percent to 16 percent more to design and build, but advocates say that their bottom line can be better than those of conventional buildings. ''Their value can be enhanced,'' said Thomas J. Hamill, a vice president at Spaulding & Slye, ''because they lease better, have less expensive mechanical systems that cost 20 to 40 percent less to operate and, therefore, a higher effective rent over time.''
 For Genzyme's chief executive, Henri A. Termeer, the 16 percent premium his biotechnology company paid to develop its new headquarters is an investment in capital, environmental and human assets. The glass structure, built on a once-contaminated site, will use 38 percent less energy than a traditional building and 32 percent less water. The building is composed of materials with 75 percent recycled content and brings sunlight into 75 percent of employee work spaces. 
 Mr. Termeer said the building's green design would burnish Genzyme's corporate identity, culture and work force. ''Biotechnology is still a mysterious industry,'' he said. ''We created a very open building that says it's O.K. to see what we're doing. Our work is a sustainable enterprise about life sciences, about working at the highest level.
 ''The business case is that our return comes from the productivity of our people, and the building helps us hire and retain those who can make the right decisions.'' 
 M.I.T., one of the largest property owners and developers in Cambridge, has also embraced green design. In 1999, its president, Charles M. Vest, began a $1.4 billion effort to build 2.2 million square feet of new and renovated space in 14 structures, all of them to green standards. The Gehry-designed building to be opened next week, the Ray and Maria Stata Center for Computer Information and Intelligence Sciences, is among the first five of these to be completed.
 ''Over the long haul, they'll cost less to operate and maintain,'' Mr. Vest said. ''Furthermore, by practicing what we preach, we're teaching our students to be innovative professionals who use green standards.''
 In Cambridge and some other Massachusetts communities, using green building elements helps get through the stringent permit process. A 2001 Cambridge zoning ordinance requires that developers of buildings larger than 50,000 square feet align their plans to Leeds standards, although they do not have to win certification. By 2010, the city wants to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 20 percent compared with 1990 levels. Over all, the commercial and industrial structures here emit 60 percent of those gases, the city's environmental planner, Susanne Rasmussen, said. 
 For a decade, Boston city planners have favored projects with green features. But since January, they have required major commercial projects to state their green building strategy, said John M. Dalzell, the city's senior architect. By fall, a task force of ''skeptical stakeholders'' appointed by Mayor Thomas M. Menino -- property owners, developers, architects, engineers, contractors, lawyers and doctors -- are to recommend a comprehensive green building policy for all commercial, industrial and residential development in Boston, Mr. Dalzell said.
 ''Few other cities have taken the time to create such a comprehensive strategy for the whole spectrum of development,'' said Steven R. Fedrizzi, chief executive of the Green Building Council.
 But green building requires adjustments, said Frederick M. O'Neill, a vice president at the Suffolk Construction Company, which is building the Manulife Tower. He also conducts training sessions for real estate professionals. To qualify for Leeds certification and the tax incentives or utility rebates available in Massachusetts, a Leeds-certified professional team should work on the project every step of the way, starting with early estimates that include the project's upfront and life-cycle costs.
 Integrating green performance with site selection, how a building sits on a site, design and construction are part of the process, said Christopher G. Leary, vice president of Stubbins Associates, which designed Biosquare. For the architect, ''the aesthetic is tied to function,'' he said. ''Windows in a traditional building are designed for appearance, but in a green one they may differ on each side depending on what they need to accomplish as the sun moves through the sky.''
 Sometimes, Mr. O'Neill said, the green building payoff goes beyond environmental gains. ''How can you estimate the benefits Genzyme will reap in advertising and recruiting,'' he asked, ''when everyone in Cambridge is trying to hire engineers?''

HEADLINE: Send Jobs to India? U.S. Companies Say It's Not Always Best

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Even as the prospect of high-skilled American jobs moving to low-wage countries like India ignites hot political debate, some entrepreneurs are finding that India's vaunted high-technology work force is not always as effective as advertised.
 ''For three years we tried all kinds of models, but nothing has worked so far,'' said the co-founder and chief technology officer of Storability Software in Southborough, Mass. After trying to reduce costs by contracting out software programming tasks to India, Storability brought back most of the work to the United States, where it costs four times as much, and hired more programmers here. The ''depth of knowledge in the area we want to build software is not good enough'' among Indian programmers, the executive said.
 If it sounds like ''Made in the U.S.A.'' jingoism, consider this: The entrepreneur, Hemant Kurande, is Indian. He was born and raised near Bombay and received his master's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology in that city, now known as Mumbai. Mr. Kurande is not alone in his views on ''outsourcing'' technology work to India. As more companies in the United States rush to take advantage of India's ample supply of cheap yet highly trained workers, even some of the most motivated American companies -- ones set up or run by executives born and trained in India -- are concluding that the cost advantage does not always justify the effort. 
 For many of the most crucial technology tasks, they find that a work force operating within the American business environment better suits their needs. 
 ''Only certain kinds of tasks can be outsourced -- what can be set down as a set of rules,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of Global Insight, a forecasting and consulting firm based in Waltham, Mass. ''That which requires more creativity is more difficult to manage at a distance.''
 Another Indian executive in the United States who has soured on outsourcing is Dev Ittycheria, the chief executive of Bladelogic, a designer of network management software with 70 workers, also in Waltham. Bladelogic, which has a client list that includes General Electric and Sprint, outsourced work to India within months of going into business in 2001. But it concluded that projects it farmed out -- one to install an operating system across a network, another to keep tabs on changes done to the system -- could be done faster and at a lower cost in the United States.
 That was true even though programmers in India cost Bladelogic $3,500 a month versus a monthly cost of $10,000 for programmers in the United States. ''The cost savings in India were three to one,'' Mr. Ittycheria said. ''But the difference in productivity was six to one.''
 Bladelogic's chief technology officer, Vijay Manwani, born and educated in India, predicts that once the ''hype cycle'' about Indian outsourcing runs its course, projects will come back to the United States ''when people find that their productivity goals have not been met.'' 
 The upshot is that high-technology corporations are likely to ship more and more business functions to India to take advantage of its well-trained work force. However, even as they do so they will keep many essential tasks here. 
 For instance, Storability Software, which designs systems to manage data storage and has 25 employees in the United States, first tried to outsource some core programming tasks to a big software contractor in India. When that did not work, it tried a more specialized boutique. When this company did not deliver up to Storability's specifications either, the company hired four programmers in the United States to help rewrite the code. 
 But Storability also stuck to India, setting up its own small shop in Pune late last year, where its 25 programmers perform noncore tasks. ''We essentially realigned our motivations,'' Mr. Kurande said. ''We were able to figure out areas of our engineering that suited them.''
 The Indian entrepreneurs in this country -- business executives with the cultural affinity and local connections that might be most conducive to making offshore partnerships work -- do not fault the work ethic of the programmers in India. But they say the geographic distance and the differences in business contexts can be difficult to bridge. 
 A typical challenge is the difficulty of finding programmers overseas who can go beyond following well-known procedures to the next steps of identifying problems and creating new solutions. 
 For instance, ConnecTerra, a Cambridge, Mass., company that designs software to manage data from electronic devices like new radar-based ID tags that companies use to track inventory, tried programmers in India last year. But ConnecTerra, which has 30 employees in the United States, ultimately gave up on outsourcing because the Indian company that it worked with could not deal with the fast-changing requirements. 
 Murali Menon, an Indian-born executive who was ConnecTerra's vice president for engineering at the time, dealt with the recruitment of the Indian company. He said the Indian programmers required more detailed instructions to write the software code than would a programmer here, who would be more familiar with the customer's needs. 
 This slowed the process, a major drawback in a technology that is new and changing very fast. Ultimately, the product that the Indian programmers delivered was unwieldy, with software code written in one big chunk rather than the more flexible modules that top programmers use now.
 No one questions the dedication of Indian programmers. ''They worked hard,'' Mr. Menon said of the programmers in India, ''but couldn't keep up.''
 (Executives at Bladelogic, Storability and ConnecTerra declined to divulge the names of the companies they have worked with in India, saying that to do so might damage potential business relationships for other work in the future.)
 In the end, many say the advantages of keeping some of the most sophisticated work in the United States are related to the factors that draw technology entrepreneurs from India and elsewhere to this country in the first place: Indian engineers and software designers in this country know that the businesses whose needs are driving technological innovation are mostly in the United States. It comes down to being where the customers are. 
 Bassab Pradhan, the senior vice president for worldwide sales for Infosys Technologies, is one defender of the programming industry in India. Infosys, based in Bangalore, is India's largest software services company. Of its revenue of $1.06 billion last year, about two-thirds came from American corporate clients including Visa International, Boeing and Cisco Systems; it provides them with services like data entry, programming and customer technical support. 
 Mr. Pradhan, who is Indian-educated, disagrees with critics who say that Indian-trained workers lack creative ability. When outsourcing fails, he said, it is typically because ''less disciplined'' businesses try to farm out projects that are not properly defined.
 But Mr. Pradhan agreed that the need for proximity to the final user of the technology does place limits on what types of tasks can be outsourced. ''Whenever the pace of innovation is very rapid,'' he said, ''is when the work should be done closer to the client.''
 In the future international division of labor, Mr. Pradhan said, the production of the technology will be done in places like India, which can deliver it reliably at a low cost. What cannot be sent to India, he said, is the invention of new business processes and technologies. 
 Conceiving inventory-management software that helps a retailer make the best use of electronic product tags, for example, might be something best done by system designers in the United States working closely with the retailer. Once such a system and its tasks have been mapped out, though, the software code could be written by programmers in India.
 Such distinctions are why even the champions of India's programmers-for-hire industry are trying to do more work within the United States. This month, for instance, Infosys announced that it would spend $20 million to set up a consulting company in the United States. It has already hired top consultants from companies including Deloitte Consulting, Cap Gemini, Ernst & Young and E.D.S., and plans to recruit others.
 Innovative business processes result from ''an understanding of the business that happens when people get into a room and talk to each other,'' Mr. Pradhan said. ''That is very difficult to outsource.''

HEADLINE: Kerry Turns Tables on Bush and Cheney Over War Records

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, April 27 

 BODY:
As he spent a second day touring hard-hit industrial areas to highlight recent job losses, Senator John Kerry and his campaign escalated their attack on the Bush administration over the military records of the president and vice president.
 After an hourlong rally in Youngstown, Ohio, where Mr. Kerry hammered President Bush on the economy, his aides offered reporters a provocative four-page handout headlined, ''Key Unanswered Questions: Bush's Record in the National Guard.'' By afternoon, Mr. Kerry himself had stoked the fire. 
 ''I think a lot of veterans are going to be very angry at a president who can't account for his own service in the National Guard -- and a vice president who got every deferment in the world and decided he had better things to do -- criticizing somebody who fought for their country and served,'' Mr. Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, told a reporter for The Dayton Daily News. ''I think it's inappropriate.'' 
 He echoed those attacks in an interview in Cleveland for the MSNBC program ''Hardball'' and was still talking about it on Tuesday night at a fund-raiser here that raised $800,000.
 ''I did what my conscience told me to do,'' Mr. Kerry said on ''Hardball.'' ''I'm proud I stood up and fought against it. And I think it is remarkable to me that so many years later the Republicans want to go back and argue about something, particularly when so many of them chose not even to be involved in it, not even to have an opinion about it.''
 At the fund-raiser, indignant about Bush television ads attacking his votes on military spending, Mr. Kerry declared: ''I've defended our nation. I'm prepared to stand up and defend it as president and forever.'' 
 The comments came a day after an article in The New York Times and a report on the ABC News program ''Good Morning America'' highlighted a 1971 interview with Mr. Kerry that raised questions about whether he threw away his war medals in a protest after his combat tour. Many Democrats believe that any attention to his military background helps his cause, and they are eager to let voters compare how Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney spent the war years.
 Mr. Bush served in the Texas Air National Guard from 1968 to 1973, but there is some dispute about how he got a coveted pilot spot and about missing attendance records. Mr. Cheney received deferments from the draft because he was a student and an expectant father.
 The Kerry handout, reviving questions that swirled around the White House earlier in the year, asked why Mr. Bush missed a medical exam while enrolled in the National Guard in 1972; why he requested not to be sent overseas for duty; how he got in over other applicants despite low scores; and where various records are. Mr. Kerry said on ''Hardball'' that he had not seen the handout.
 Nicolle Devenish, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush's re-election campaign, declined to address the substance of the questions, saying they had been ''asked and answered.'' She pointed to Mr. Kerry's statements about attacks on President Bill Clinton in 1992 that promised not to ''divide America over who served and how.''
 ''John Kerry has not detailed a credible alternative to President Bush's decisive leadership in the war on terror, and his record on defense and security measures raises serious questions about his judgment,'' Ms. Devenish said in a statement. ''Instead of explaining his record, John Kerry has turned to political attacks on the president.''
 The White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, denounced the National Guard comments as a ''political attack'' even as he juggled questions over the medals controversy and the fallout from Mr. Cheney's highly politicized speech on Monday at Westminster College. Dismayed at some of Mr. Cheney's rhetoric, the president of the college, in Fulton, Mo., has arranged for Mr. Kerry to visit his campus on Friday.
 ''The president is focusing on the policy differences, not what happened 30 or 40 years ago,'' Mr. McClellan told reporters. 
 The back-and-forth on decades-old military experience overshadowed for a second day the ''Jobs First'' bus tour that Mr. Kerry had intended as the kickoff of his general election campaign. Rolling through the electoral battleground of Ohio, he focused on the 170,000 jobs lost in Ohio since 2000, many in manufacturing.
 ''I believe that manufacturing should not and must not be a part of America's distant past; it has to be part of the present,'' he told a large crowd in Youngstown, not far from shuttered steel mills. ''This administration is standing by while the jobs are being outsourced, the jobs are going overseas, and it's time for us to stand up and fight back for working people in this country.''
 While nearly three million jobs disappeared in the last three years, Mr. Kerry said, ''it is not a stretch to say that George Bush has been busy clearing brush, and I think we need a president who creates jobs.''
 Later, at a forum with five Ohio mayors, an audience member again changed the subject, criticizing Republicans for bringing up ''what you did with your medals and your ribbons when their candidate was doing God knows what.''
 Mr. Kerry also met at a hotel here with former Vice President Al Gore, who endorsed a rival, Howard Dean.

HEADLINE: Second Time Around, Bush Is Forgoing a Visionary Agenda

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27 

 BODY:
George W. Bush ran for president four years ago on a platform of meaty domestic policy ideas, including tax cuts of historic proportions, the creation of Social Security investment accounts and a demand that school systems document their performance through increased testing of children.
 This time around, in his race against Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, Mr. Bush has so far offered little in the way of major new proposals. The few efforts he has made to set out a fresh, visionary agenda, like his call in January for a manned mission to Mars or his plan to overhaul the immigration system, have disappeared from his own speeches and hardly show up on the national radar screen. 
 What he is left with is a list of proposals that he has been trying for the last several years to push through Congress, like his energy bill and his plan to restrict lawsuit awards against doctors and corporations, plus smaller-bore ideas that, however important and worthy, are hardly the kind that define a presidency.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Bush traveled to a Veterans Affairs hospital in Baltimore, where he spent 37 minutes encouraging doctors and hospitals to use information technology to improve health care through steps like putting patient files into electronic form. 
 ''We're coming up with more innovative ways to save lives and to treat patients,'' he said. ''But when you think about the provider's side, we're kind of still in the buggy era.''
 In a speech in Minnesota on Monday, Mr. Bush focused on that topic and two others: research into hydrogen-fueled vehicles and making sure that rural areas as well as cities and suburbs get high-speed broadband Internet access. A White House that had gone to great lengths to distance itself from anything smacking of the previous administration found Mr. Bush's new focus on a ''think small'' agenda suddenly being described with what for many Republicans is the most stinging possible adjective: Clintonesque.
 ''This time he doesn't have a clear strategy, theme and message to deal with issues like homeland security, job loss and health care,'' said James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. ''He's all over the place, but so is Kerry.''
 Mr. Bush's basic approach, Mr. Thurber said, has been to keep his conservative base happy on his signature issues like tax cuts, rely heavily on his reputation as a strong leader on national security and then ''go after swing voters with things like more money for community colleges.''
 Mr. Bush hardly lacks for compelling and defining themes as he campaigns. He is, after all, a wartime commander in chief facing a treacherous battle in Iraq and the challenge of the broader fight against Islamic terrorists. And he is trying to portray himself as having shepherded the economy through a recession and other troubles into a tentative but strengthening recovery.
 Terry Holt, Mr. Bush's campaign spokesman, said the president could point to a long list of substantial domestic policy accomplishments, including tax cuts, adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare and making it easier for religious organizations to get federal financing for their social welfare programs.
 ''The president has articulated a vision for the future of the country through the policies he has proposed in the first four years,'' Mr. Holt said.
 To some analysts -- never mind his Democratic opponents -- Mr. Bush's reliance on domestic policy plans that in many cases were first laid out more than four years ago speaks to two of the White House's biggest challenges: governing in an era of large budget deficits, which limit the room for new programs or tax cuts, and its need to recharge its batteries for a second term should Mr. Bush win in November.
 ''The policy development process in this White House is very, very weak,'' said Bruce Bartlett, an economist and conservative commentator who served in the Reagan White House. ''You can get by for a year or two on what you ran on in the campaign, but after a year or two those issues are resolved one way or another. Then you need a system for generating new ideas, and I don't really see that in their case.''
 Mr. Bush, Mr. Bartlett said, has tended to push out aides who push new ways of thinking, like Paul H. O'Neill, his first treasury secretary. And he has assembled a cabinet and a White House staff whose primary responsibility is to sell existing policies, not make new ones.
 There is no shortage of available ideas. Conservatives have been pressing Mr. Bush to tackle big projects like overhauling the tax code, while some members of Congress have been pushing the White House to come up with a plan to control the costs of health care and insurance. 
 The danger to Mr. Bush of not running on new issues of major import, Mr. Bartlett said, is less to his re-election prospects than to his ability to get his way with Congress should he be re-elected.
 ''If the president doesn't run on something substantive in his re-election campaign, he has no mandate to do anything in a second term,'' he said. ''Presidents tend to run out of things to do in a second term, and that's when they get in trouble.''

HEADLINE: Star of Spring Auctions May Fetch $100 Million

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Every few years a collection comes up for sale that eclipses all the other art being offered during the two heady weeks in spring and fall when the New York auction houses sell important Impressionist, modern and contemporary works. This season it is the fabled paintings that are now part of the Greentree Foundation, the star of which is Picasso's ''Boy With a Pipe.'' Dealers and experts are betting that it could fetch as much as $100 million next week, eclipsing the world record set in 1990 when van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' sold at Christie's in New York for $82.5 million.
 The collection was formed over two generations by Payne and Helen Whitney, heirs to a fortune made from oil, tobacco, street railways and real estate, and later by their son, John Hay Whitney, the sportsman, financier, publisher and ambassador to Britain. During their 46-year marriage, he and his wife, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the New York socialite and philanthropist, amassed a world-class collection of art by masters like Picasso, Manet, Sargent and Braque, many of which are now in major American museums. 
 The sale of 34 paintings and drawings at Sotheby's York Avenue headquarters on Wednesday night is expected to bring $131 million to $157 million. Experts at Sotheby's, which has put a $70 million estimate on ''Boy With a Pipe,'' shiver at the mention of $100 million for the work, saying all the spin is scaring away potential bidders. But just how much the 1905 image brings is likely to reflect the large amounts of money that people have made in recent years and their willingness to spend it on great art. 
 News of the sale was both a coup for the auction house and a lure to other collectors eager to sell their art in such company. A result is a season of paintings, drawings and sculptures from institutions like the Museum of Modern Art, which is selling nine works at Christie's, and from collectors like Elizabeth Taylor; Peter Brant, the newsprint magnate; Francois Pinault, Christie's owner; and Irving Blum, the dealer. The anticipated success of the Whitney collection is expected to boost confidence in a market that moves as much at the whim of the herd instinct as by economic buoyancy.
 When Mrs. Whitney died in 1998 (her husband died in 1982) she left more than $300 million worth of art to four museums: the National Gallery of Art and the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Yale Art Gallery in New Haven. 
 ''Boy With a Pipe,'' painted when Picasso was 24, soon after he settled in Montmartre, is considered by experts to be one of the finest examples of his early work. It depicts a Parisian boy known as ''P'tit Louis,'' who hung around Picasso's studio. He is crowned by a garland of roses. The Whitneys bought it in 1950. 
 Besides art, the Whitneys also owned some of this country's great racehorses. Their two passions intersected in an important group of paintings. Among the best is Manet's ''Races at the Bois de Boulogne,'' from 1872, a scene of spectators watching a horse race at Longchamps, with the artist's friend, Degas, shown in the lower right corner of the canvas. Sotheby's believes it could sell for $20 million to $30 million. Two Degas paintings also in the sale, ''Before the Race'' (1882-88), and ''Hacking to the Track'' (1892), are each estimated to bring $5 million to $7 million. Proceeds of the sale will go to the Greentree Foundation, named for the Whitneys' Long Island estate, which was established to further international relations. 
 Christie's, too, was able to score some impressive works. As the Museum of Modern Art prepares to reopen its greatly expanded West 53rd Street home, curators have been reassessing its permanent collection, selling some works by artists that it has better examples of or rarely shows.
 On May 4, for example, the top lot of Christie's Impressionist and modern art sale will include an early metaphysical painting by de Chirico, estimated to sell for $7 million to $10 million. Surrealist paintings have been commanding high prices recently, and the Modern already has 15 other de Chiricos. Which may explain why it is selling ''The Great Metaphysician'' from 1917, once owned by Philip L. Goodwin, one of the architects who designed the Modern's original 1939 building.
 ''It's a rare opportunity to buy something at the pinnacle of early modernism,'' said Christopher Eykyn, head of Christie's department of Impressionist and modern art. On May 11 the auction house will sell another work from the Modern, Pollock's ''No. 12'' (1949), a classic drip painting, which is estimated to bring $5 million to $7 million. 
 Aside from the Whitney collection, modern art dominates the sales, since fewer Impressionist paintings remain in private hands. Riding on the back of ''Boy With a Pipe'' are a noticeable number of Picassos from nearly every period. On May 6 at Sotheby's main sale of Impressionist and modern art, ''The Rescue'' (1932), a group of bathers on the beach, is estimated to bring $10 million to $15 million. 
 At Christie's on May 4 ''Dora Maar With a Straw Hat'' (1937), is expected to fetch $4 million to $6 million. Sotheby's sold it in London in June 2001 where it brought $4 million. Also from the 2001 London auction season and being sold at Christie's is ''The Bottle From Malaga'' (1919), which is now on offer for $1.8 million to $2.5 million. In 2001 it sold for $1.7 million.
 Years ago late Picassos were ignored, but recently they have become all the rage. ''Prices have been escalating, which always brings more to the market,'' said David Norman, co-director of Sotheby's department of Impressionist and modern art worldwide. At Sotheby's ''Seated Nude,'' from 1959, Picasso's large, sculptural image of a woman with her legs apart is expected to bring $3 million to $4 million. Christie's has three paintings from the 1960's, two with a $2 million to $3 million estimate and the third with a $1.4 million to $1.8 million estimate. 
 Greater interest in postwar and contemporary art is also evident this season. For the second year Christie's postwar and contemporary art sale, on May 11, is expected to bring more money than the usually higher Impressionist and modern sales. This is a particularly strong auction, with top examples of artists like Richter, Warhol, Pollock and Koons. 
 Twenty percent of Sotheby's contemporary art sale on May 12 is made up of works being sold by Mr. Brant. Executives at Sotheby's say he is selling to raise money to buy a paper mill. Paintings by Warhol, Lichtenstein, Basquiat and Maurizio Cattelan, many of which have been up for sale within the past few years, are expected to bring $13.9 million to $19.7 million. (The overall estimate of the sale is $46.8 million to $65.3 million.) 
 Christie's owner, Mr. Pinault, is also selling several outstanding works by artists like Rothko, Warhol and Mondrian, together estimated to bring $17 million to $25 million. 
 When it comes to newer contemporary art, Phillips, de Pury & Company dominates the market. Sotheby's and Christie's do not much bother because it does not make the kind of money that the earlier works do. The struggling auction house has put together a surprisingly strong group of art from the 1980's and 1990's, including works by popular figures like Keith Haring, Maurizio Cattelan, Damien Hirst and Felix Gonzalez-Torres which are being sold on May 13. Many are from an entity identified in the catalog as the Pisces Trust, put together by Simon de Pury, the Phillips chairman. 
 Though Phillips's buyer tends to be younger and hipper, that auction house will also be affected by the outcome of the Whitney paintings. ''Any time there's a huge sale that's a success, it casts reassurance on the rest of the market,'' said Mr. McGinnis, head of Phillips contemporary art department. ''The better the others do, the better it is for us at the very end of the season.''

HEADLINE: Hyundai Near Top of a Quality Ranking

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 28 

 BODY:
For the first time, new-car buyers ranked Hyundai, the South Korean automaker, higher in initial quality than any domestic or European manufacturer, according to a survey released on Wednesday by J.D. Power & Associates
 The result was a coup for Hyundai, which has been trying hard to upgrade its image from cheap to classy, or at least respectable, and close the gap between it and Toyota Motor and Honda Motor. 
 ''A decade ago, as Korean manufacturers struggled with a universally poor reputation for vehicle quality,'' said Joe Ivers, executive director of quality and customer satisfaction at J.D. Power, a research firm, ''no one would have predicted they could not only keep the pace, but actually pass domestics and other imports in terms of initial quality.'' 
 As a company, Toyota ranked first, followed closely by Honda and Hyundai, tied for second. 
 There are caveats, however. Hyundai's Kia brand continues to be a subpar performer in the initial-quality rankings. And in J.D. Power's most recent study of long-term reliability, which many in the industry consider to be a more important barometer, the Hyundai brand ranks near the bottom of the industry and Kia is dead last. 
 Chris Hosford, a spokesman for Hyundai, said improvements in initial quality inevitably contribute to longer-term improvements.
 ''One leads the other,'' he said. ''We really want people to see us as a great value automobile. Part of value is price. Part of value is getting a lot of features and equipment for what you spend. And part of it is definitely having a great quality car.''
 So what, exactly, is initial quality? In February and March, J.D. Power asked 51,000 buyers of new cars and trucks in the United States whether they had experienced any of 135 problems during the first three months after purchase. 
 The most common complaint was wind noise audible inside the car. Poor fuel economy was a top 10 complaint, but less so than in last year's survey, even though gasoline prices are higher now than in 2003. 
 ''It suggests consumers are adjusting to higher fuel prices,'' said Brian Walters, J.D. Power's senior director of vehicle research.
 The annual survey data is closely watched by the auto industry, though the differences between the best and worst automakers have narrowed in recent years. 
 ''Because it's so darn close, I don't think it has the same importance it had 10 or 20 years ago,'' said Louise Goeser, vice president for quality at Ford Motor.
 The range is much wider in long-term reliability, which affects how automobiles retain value. Still, the initial-quality report is an important reflection of how well new cars and trucks live up to customer expectations. 
 As a group, Japanese brands scored best in the latest survey, averaging 111 problems for each 100 vehicles. Korean brands were next, with 117; European brands had 122; and domestic brands 123. In 1998, the Korean brands were worst, with 272 problems for each 100 vehicles, and European brands best, with 156.
 Problems declined 11 percent industrywide in the new survey from a year earlier.
 Measured companywide, the Big Three all ranked slightly below the industry average, but there were big differences from brand to brand. The General Motors Hummer, though improved markedly from last year, was still the most problem-prone single nameplate, while the company's Cadillac brand was second only to Lexus from Toyota.
 Hyundai's results did not include Kia. J.D. Power is considering changing that in the future. 
 Entirely new products often have teething trouble, and the effects were visible in the rankings. Both Porsche and Volkswagen declined; each company introduced its first sport utility vehicle last year. Porsche plunged from among the best to among the worst. 
 ''This performance is due almost entirely to the Cayenne,'' the new Porsche S.U.V., said Mr. Walters of J.D. Power. By contrast, the Porsche 911 was the top-ranked premium sports car, and the company led the most recent long-term dependability survey.
 Martin Peters, a spokesman for Porsche, said, ''We are disappointed with the results for the Cayenne, but the majority of the problems were related to features and controls,'' rather than mechanical or structural defects. Nissan Motor also came in below the Big Three in initial quality, partly because it introduced its first large pickup, the Titan, and its first large S.U.V., the Armada. Even Toyota was dented by a debut: its new youth-oriented Scion brand landed near the bottom of the charts.

HEADLINE: In a Space This Sacred, Every Square Foot Counts

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
Almost since the first dawn after the attack, the watchwords in Lower Manhattan have been remembrance and reconstruction. That is easy to vow in a speech, harder to achieve in a blueprint. As plans for downtown projects become more specific in coming months, the tension between these two goals is sure to grow.
 Indeed, it seemed until yesterday that the two were about to collide in Battery Park, at Fritz Koenig's ''Sphere for Plaza Fountain.'' This 25-foot bronze sculpture was once the centerpiece of the Austin J. Tobin Plaza at the World Trade Center. 
 Dented, cracked, pierced by jagged holes and torn as if made of fabric, the sphere -- indomitable and instantly recognizable -- now stands in the park as an official interim memorial, with a flame burning before it.
 To judge from maps prepared by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, it appears that a subway tunnel leading to the planned new South Ferry terminal would come close to the sphere, suggesting strongly that it may have to be relocated.
 The authority acknowledged that about 40 trees in Battery Park would be affected by construction. It has pledged to replant or replace them.
 But little was said publicly about the fate of the sphere until the State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who represents much of Lower Manhattan, was quoted yesterday in The Staten Island Advance as criticizing the South Ferry proposal.
 In a transcript of a news conference released by his office, Mr. Silver said: ''The expansion of that particular subway entrance and platform would require the dismantling of what is now the temporary memorial to the 9/11 victims of the World Trade Center attack. On that basis, we don't think that there is an appropriate plan before us that warrants support.''
 The transportation agency said that this was simply not so.
 ''We have committed to protect that 9/11 memorial during construction,'' said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the authority. ''The M.T.A. is committed to not moving it.''
 That is not to say there will be no disruption around the sphere during the three and a half years of construction on the South Ferry terminal. But as for the memorial itself, Mr. Kelly said, ''It would be visible and visitable.''
 Coincidentally, the federal Advisory Council on Historic Preservation announced yesterday that it had signed an agreement with the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation setting some safeguards on the structural remnants of the World Trade Center and on artifacts taken from the site that may return one day. Including the sphere.
 Last week, readers of Blocks were promised an answer to the question of whether the World Trade Center site was, in fact, 16 acres.
 That number has been appearing in news accounts for at least 40 years and is customarily used without a second thought. But so much about the trade center site warrants extra scrutiny that it seemed appropriate to put acreage to the test.
 Why does it matter? In part, because the site's size is used to gauge the relative density of planned development and the proportion of open space.
 Of course, the site can be measured in many ways: with or without sidewalks, with or without streets, with or without the 7 World Trade Center block. So there really is no one right answer.
 However, a precisely defined World Trade Center parcel, without streets or sidewalks, can be seen on an official map maintained by the topographical bureau of the Manhattan borough president's office. It shows a 21-sided polygon between Liberty, Vesey, Church and West Streets. The sides range from 11.56 feet to 624.76 feet. There are many unexceptionable right angles, but some intersections simply defy this column's ability to calculate: 91 degrees 8 minutes 25 seconds, for instance, or 252 degrees 5 minutes 38 seconds.
 Hubert L. Bray, an associate professor of mathematics at Columbia University, was game to give it a try. He noted that someone following the directions given by the lengths and angles on the map would end up within 0.01 feet of the starting point. ''This would seem to suggest that the polygon data is quite accurate,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. He used a computer program he wrote that automatically breaks up polygons into triangles, then computes the area of each triangle.
 ''This method is equivalent to a standard method used by mathematicians to find areas of regions using the two-dimensional divergence theorem applied to the vector field v = (x,y)/2, which has divergence equal to one at each point,'' he explained. ''Then by the divergence theorem the area of the region equals the flux of v through the boundary of the region.'' His result was 637,450 square feet.
 Or 14.634 acres.

HEADLINE: Chinatown Says Police Parking Makes Its Streets Too Tight

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
Jan Lee would rather spend time anywhere but in the driver's seat of his pickup truck, circling the block on Mott Street in Chinatown where he owns an antique shop, hoping to find a place to park and unload his boxes. 
 On a good day, he will circle three or four times, trying to find a place not taken by an illegally parked car. On a bad day, it takes him hours, and sometimes he just gives up. So do other truck drivers with cargo headed to Sinotique, his store. He cannot call the police, because most of the cars parked in Chinatown's loading zones are in fact owned by police officers. 
 ''Multiply my problem by literally hundreds of people in Chinatown,'' Mr. Lee said, ''and you'll get an idea of what it's been like here for the past few years.''
 Even though the attack on the World Trade Center happened two and a half years ago, residents and business owners in Chinatown say their neighborhood, just a short distance from ground zero, has not recovered. Because of the security measures imposed on the nearby police headquarters and other government offices, they say, conditions in their part of Lower Manhattan have actually grown worse.
 Streets have closed. Traffic patterns have changed. Buses have been rerouted. Several checkpoints for cars remain. 
 Parking conditions are the worst, moving from bad to unbearable, Mr. Lee and others say. Correction and police officers and other government employees have turned to the streets of Chinatown for long-term parking, a process that started before 9/11 when a municipal garage under police headquarters closed for renovation. The reopening of the garage has been delayed since the attack by changes in plans. 
 ''This law enforcement illegal parking is a major, major, major problem,'' said City Councilman Alan Gerson, who represents the area. ''They park on sidewalks, by fire hydrants, in no-standing zones. It's total parking anarchy, and it's disruptive and dangerous to people trying to walk.''
 A random survey of parking recently showed that people in Chinatown were left with a meager amount of street space after various law enforcement officials had parked for the day.
 On Bayard Street between Baxter and Mulberry Streets, 18 of 19 parked cars displayed dashboard placards from the Police or Correction Departments. On Bayard Street between Mulberry and Mott Streets, all 15 cars parked displayed Correction or Police Department placards although they were in no-standing zones. And on Mulberry Street between Bayard and Canal, the scene was much the same: 21 of 29 cars parked in restricted zones also displayed law enforcement placards. 
 The Police Department has conceded that the security measures are inconvenient but insists that the changes are necessary to protect the concentration of government buildings near Chinatown. Police and city officials say they do not see the parking situation in the dire terms used by neighborhood merchants.
 Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne said officers should not use the streets for all-day parking. He did not acknowledge that they were, and he did not comment further. The narrow streets that form the heart of Chinatown (and that formed the notoriously chaotic Five Points before it) have been bustling for centuries. People in the area say, however, that since 9/11, the intensity of congestion has been unusual even by their standards.
 After the attack, several blocks of Park Row, a major north-south artery for the area, were closed to unauthorized traffic, as were parts of smaller streets in the Chatham Square area. Some residents still have to present identification at checkpoints around One Police Plaza in order to get to their apartment buildings. 
 Justin Yu, who owns a shop in Confucius Plaza near the Manhattan Bridge on-ramp and is also the building's co-op board president, places orange barrels outside his storefront just to keep the police away. 
 ''They took our sidewalk, our front,'' Mr. Yu said. ''They park all over the place -- the real police, fake police, correction officers, police from out of town. We don't have anything left.''
 Paul J.Q. Lee lost his family's 113-year-old gift shop at 32 Mott Street in October because of what he called the lingering effects of 9/11 on the neighborhood's economic vitality. ''The war on terrorism seems to be a war on Chinatown,'' he said. ''What's hurtful is that we are now being treated like the enemy.''
 In 2002, residents of two Chinatown co-ops, along with Mr. Gerson and other elected officials, sued to stop the city and the Police Department from closing streets and leaving police officers' cars in a neighborhood park, James Madison Plaza.
 Last year, Justice Walter B. Tolub of State Supreme Court ruled that it was time for the police to take the first steps toward removing security blockades and ordered them out of the park by April 15. In February, the police offered a declaration to the court based on its assessment of how the department's security measures have impinged on the neighborhood, saying they have had ''no significant effect'' on Chinatown.
 ''While these security measures may be perceived as inconvenient, they are necessary to protect the city, state and federal facilities in the area and would not result in an adverse impact to the overall character of the neighborhood,'' the statement read.
 A lawyer who handled the case for the city, Janet Siegel, an assistant corporation counsel, said this week that the department had fully complied with the court's orders and was interested in working with Chinatown, not against it. ''The Police Department is continuing to work with the community to see that all concerns are addressed,'' Ms. Siegel said. 
 Still, people in Chinatown say they are not being heard.
 Danny Chen, a software engineer who lives in Chatham Green, a 21-story co-op on Park Row that sits just inside a police barricade, describes the period after 9/11 as the city's ''reign of anti-terror.''
 ''They look at Chinatown and say, 'Hey, we need parking, so let's take it from the Chinese. Oh yeah, it's for security,''' Mr. Chen said. ''I can't express how angry I get when I think about how they think of us.''
 While Mr. Chen and others celebrated the return of James Madison Plaza to community use, they say they will not be content until Park Row is open and the parking issue is solved.
 A Police Department spokesman said that the municipal garage should be open soon, but that its capacity would be limited. 
 ''Clearly the reopening of the lot will be a big help,'' Mr. Gerson said, ''but there needs to be a master parking plan developed for Lower Manhattan to assure adequate parking for residents, workers and visitors.''
 Mr. Gerson is urging support for the Park Row bill, which he has introduced to establish guidelines to address the issue of street closings, including providing for adequate public input. A hearing on the bill is scheduled before the City Council on May 3.
 ''The point is, we need a process to assure communities that their needs are not ignored,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fuel Economy Barely Rises; S.U.V.'s Are Blamed

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 28 

 BODY:
The fuel economy of new cars and trucks ticked up slightly in the 2003 model year, but has remained stagnant over the last five years, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's annual fuel economy report, which was released Wednesday. 
 On average, new cars and trucks get significantly fewer miles to the gallon today than in the late 1980's. Improvements in engine technology and car design have been more than offset by the continuing preference of Americans for sport utility vehicles and other light-duty trucks over cars. 
 As vehicles become larger and heavier, they are also getting faster. 
 In the 2003 model year, an average vehicle could reach 60 miles per hour from a standing stop in 10.2 seconds, which is down from 14.1 seconds two decades ago. 
 ''Fuel economy peaked in 1987, and since then, S.U.V.'s and light trucks have increased in popularity,'' said Margo T. Oge, director of the E.P.A.'s Office of Transportation and Air Quality. New technologies like hybrid electric vehicles and cleaner diesel engines may eventually help, she said, but they do not yet sell in large enough numbers to make an appreciable impact. 
 Daniel Becker, a global warming expert for the Sierra Club, said: ''We're guzzling dramatically more gas than we were in the 1980's, so no one should be surprised that we're paying more at the pump, in hock to OPEC, and poisoning the atmosphere. Our government and the auto companies need to turn this situation around.''
 Domestic automakers, and particularly General Motors, have resisted raising fuel economy standards for years, arguing that tighter rules would put them at a disadvantage because they build more trucks than foreign rivals. 
 ''If we address this issue by adding a lot of cost to vehicles, or by forcing consumers into vehicles they don't really want to buy, let's face it -- we're going to sell fewer cars and trucks, hurt our own competitive position and hurt the U.S. economy,'' said Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, in a speech earlier this year. 
 The average car or light-duty truck got 20.7 miles to the gallon in the 2003 model year, compared with 20.6 miles in 2002. The E.P.A.'s report last year put the 2002 figure at 20.4 and projected a rise to 20.8 in 2003; the new report uses updated sales data. 
 The agency now expects 20.8 miles per gallon for the 2004 model year. 
 All these figures exclude the largest and least efficient S.U.V.'s, like Hummers, which are so heavy that they fall outside government fuel economy rules.

HEADLINE: Among Democrats, a Rush To Challenge a Former Star

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
For more than two decades, State Senator Olga A. Mendez has been something of a political star in East Harlem. The first Puerto Rican woman elected to a State Legislature in the continental United States, Ms. Mendez has been consistently re-elected since her first victory 26 years ago, usually by huge margins.
 But in December 2002, Ms. Mendez changed her registration to Republican from Democrat, complaining that the Democratic Party had done too little to benefit her constituents, most of whom are Hispanic or black. And in doing so, she created a great sense of uncertainty about her own political fortunes in a district where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by about 10 to 1. 
 That switch in party affiliation has led to a highly spirited competition among several aspiring candidates who see Ms. Mendez's Republicanism as a fertile opportunity for a challenger to take that seat. But the Democrats themselves caution that too vigorous a competition might undermine their chances in the general election in November.
 At the moment, there are four Democrats in various stages of unfurling their candidacies. One is Nelson Antonio Denis, a former assemblyman who spent the last two years working on an independent film. Another is John Ruiz, a district leader and firefighter. And there is also Felix Rosado, who has run against Ms. Mendez twice, and City Councilman Jose Marco Serrano, who represents parts of the Bronx.
 For the Democrats, the seat is particularly important because they see it as a crucial piece of their strategy to win back the State Senate. While the Republicans now enjoy a 38-to-24 advantage, Democratic leaders say they feel they can win the 7 seats needed to regain the majority.
 ''We don't look at winning them all at once,'' said State Senator David A. Paterson, the Democratic leader. ''But we have to win a couple seats in one election, a few in the next. And this is an important part of that effort.''
 And for the moment, there is a buzz of activity in the district to determine precisely which Democrat will face Ms. Mendez. Mr. Denis, 49, announced his candidacy nearly a month ago and has already established a campaign office.
 Mr. Rosado, 50, said he was meeting with his supporters to determine whether he could raise the money for a race. After being lobbied by politicians and supporters in the Bronx, and some in Manhattan, Mr. Serrano said this week that he had in fact decided to enter the race, too.
 Mr. Paterson and other Democrats say they fear an expensive race fought along geographic lines. After the 2000 census, the 28th State Senate District changed from an exclusively northern Manhattan district to one with nearly 60 percent of its residents in the Bronx. That has set the stage for some intense Bronx-East Harlem rivalry.
 ''I believe that the seat should stay in East Harlem,'' said Mr. Ruiz, 50, who has opened a campaign office. ''I know that the Bronx is going after it. But it's always been a seat held by someone from East Harlem, and it should stay that way.''
 Furthermore, the tone has already become quite fiery. Mr. Denis, in particular, has lost no time taking jabs at his likely rivals for the nomination. He has criticized the candidacy of Mr. Serrano, whose father is a United States congressman from the Bronx, saying that the district ''does not need a father-and-son team from the Bronx.'' And he has described Mr. Ruiz, who has been supported by Congressman Charles B. Rangel, as a product of ''political puppetry.''
 Mr. Serrano, 31, said he was initially reluctant to run for the Senate seat, having been elected to City Council just three years ago.
 ''The fact of the matter is that there is a need,'' he said. ''I talked with the leadership of the party in the Bronx and with several leaders in Manhattan and at the state level. So I have decided to do it.''
 What all the candidates do have in common is their denunciation of Ms. Mendez; they portray her as a political turncoat who has ignored the concerns of the district. They also say that she has played no significant role in boosting economic development and education in the district.
 Another point on which the candidates agree is that the race is likely to be expensive. Mr. Denis said he had pledges of $80,000. ''But our target is at least $200,000. And I think we will come close to that.''
 Mr. Serrano said he would have to raise far more than that to be competitive with Ms. Mendez, should he win the nomination. ''I think I would have to raise between $500,000 and $750,000,'' the councilman said. ''I'm sure that she will be well financed.''
 In fact, Ms. Mendez said she hoped that the campaign committee for Senate Republicans would help her raise money.
 ''But, to be honest, I'm so used to running without money,'' she said. ''In the past, I've never had enough money even to do a decent mailing.''
 Furthermore, the senator said she felt confident of a victory this year. She said that since changing parties, she has brought resources to the district that would not have been available in her days as a Democrat.
 ''Once the voters realize what it could mean to them by not returning me to Albany, they will vote for me,'' she said. ''The decision is up to the people. They are the ones entitled to hire me or fire me. And so far, they have been good to me.''

HEADLINE: Debate Stirs Over Tiny Loans for World's Poorest

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: GORMA, Bangladesh 

 BODY:
Nearly every woman in this village seems to have gotten tiny loans to invest in a miniature business. 
 None has made better use of the cash than Firoza Akhter, a shrewd, flinty young mother who put her profits from four loans into cows, goats, land, a sturdy house and private tutors for her daughter. ''I can make money out of anything,'' she boasted in her wheezy voice, a gold, flower-shaped stud glinting in her nose. Hers is a shining success story for microcredit. 
 But while she came from humble origins, she was not among the poorest of the poor. Like many of the 50 million people who take part in microcredit programs, she hovered at the upper fringe of poverty. 
 Today there is a growing push for the nonprofit groups and banks that run such programs to reach deeper into the ranks of the poor, though there is little rigorous evidence juding whether the very poor benefit from microcredit, economists say. 
 Since 1988, the United States Congress has appropriated $2 billion for such programs. In new rules to take effect next year, it has put teeth into a requirement that half of American aid for these loans -- defined as $1,000 or less in Europe and Eurasia, $400 or less in Latin America and $300 or less in the rest of the world -- go to the very poor living on less than $1 a day. 
 The new rules have stirred strong opposition from other donors and a range of microfinance institutions, which contend that the industry may grow faster and ultimately help more very poor people by aiming at a wider pool that ranges from people who are struggling but not poor to those much further down the economic ladder. 
 ''This limbo dance to serve the poorest is a distraction from a much broader issue of trying to reach a billion people who have no access to credit or a safe place to save their money,'' said Elizabeth Littlefield, a former managing director at J. P. Morgan who now heads the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, an association of donors. 
 Researchers for this country's largest microlender, the Bangladesh Rural Action Committee, or BRAC, have found that people near the poverty line are the main users of microfinance and are more likely to get more and bigger loans and build successful microenterprises.
 By contrast, BRAC has found that the very poor are more likely to drop out of microcredit programs.
 But the group's leaders say the microcredit industry needs to try new approaches to help the poorest people. They have coupled small loans with skills training and grants of food. And they are experimenting
with giving the poorest people cows and goats to raise, rather than loans to buy the animals.
 When the dynamic Ms. Akhter got her first loan, for $50, she said she already had $250 saved from working as a cook and raising chickens, the family trade. ''I thought I could increase my capital by taking the loan,'' she said. She invested it in a calf she later sold for $100. Her next $80 -- borrowed at 27 percent interest -- she loaned out at more than triple that rate. Today her skillful investments have helped her become relatively prosperous, despite having left her husband in disgust after he took a fourth wife. ''She was always enterprising,'' said her father, who gave her chicks to tend when she was just a girl.
 Since the 1980's, wealthy nations and international organizations have provided billions of dollars for microcredit programs. The idea that small loans enable millions of poor people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps has captivated liberals and conservatives alike.
 But there are still no stringent evaluations of microcredit programs generally viewed as credible by experts. ''Energetic, entrepreneurial people do well with microcredit,'' said Jonathan Morduch, an associate professor of public policy and economics at New York University. ''But others who are less skilled and trained, how do they do? Can very poor households get decent returns or not? That's the big question policy-wise.''
 At a time when the United Nations is pursuing the eradication of extreme poverty as the world's top development goal, advocates of the new congressional rules fear that the poorest people are too often neglected. They have mobilized elected officials from the United States to Britain and Japan to petition the World Bank, the largest provider of microfinance funds, as well as the African, Asian and Inter-American development banks, to adhere to the same emphasis on the very poor that was adopted by the United States Congress.
 ''It's a myth that you can't reach the very poor,'' said Sam Daley-Harris, a musician-turned-advocate who founded the Results Educational Fund, which lobbied Congress for the new rules. He points to Share Microfin, an Indian lender, as evidence that the very poor can be helped with microcredit.
 In the village of Gorma, the experience of Bina and Kanu Sarkar, a gaunt couple with anxious eyes, illustrates the complexities of escaping poverty, even where microcredit is available.
 Here, the paddy fields are alive with barefoot men delicately planting tender rice seedlings and oxen lazing in the sun. The landscape is a gentle, quilted patchwork of scratchy brown burlap and soft green silk, but the life it supports is hard. 
 Before microlenders arrived, the poor had little choice but to become deeply indebted to moneylenders who charged exorbitant interest rates of 120 percent or more a year. Microfinance institutions in Bangladesh generally charge from 20 to 50 percent.
 Mrs. Sarkar last year became one of BRAC's 3.5 million borrowers. She used the $50 to buy her husband a rickshaw, which will save him 35 cents on the daily rickshaw rental fee once the loan is paid off. But even with the extra earnings, the Sarkars, both illiterate, will be desperately poor. They and their sons, Badal, 12, and Akash, 6, struggle to get by on the $1 a day that Mr. Sarkar earns pedaling his rickshaw. Now even that meager livelihood is threatened by an ulcer that doubles him over in agony. ''The choice is whether to see a doctor or buy food,'' he said, laying out the pitiless arithmetic of poverty. ''The government doctors don't check us properly because we don't pay them money. Even if they prescribe medicines, we can't afford them.''
 If his strength continues to seep away, the rickshaw will be no use to him, he explained. The evening before, after miles of hard pedaling, he was forced to forfeit a fare when his stomach pain grew unbearable. He had to ask his passengers to get down.
 As he related the story, Akash clambered into the rickshaw and pedaled out of the dirt courtyard. His father leapt up to chase the boy in a panic, fearing a crash would destroy the one asset he needed to feed his family.
 ''If I can't work for even a day, my wife and children go unfed,'' he said, clutching his belly.
 Some lenders here in Bangladesh, the heartland of the microcredit movement, are experimenting with new ways to reach the poorest of the poor. For years, BRAC has offered some poor women free wheat and training along with micro loans.
 But now it has entirely dropped the use of loans in one pilot program for ''ultrapoor'' women. BRAC gives them goats or cows to raise, coupled with training and health care, rather than burdening them with debts they cannot repay.
 None of the poverty-stricken women who sat under a palm tree in Mochahata village on a recent morning had ever dared to apply for a microloan. One woman's pierced nose hole was empty because she had already been forced to sell her gold stud for money. Another's 9-year-old son pedaled a rickshaw for 50 cents a day to keep the family fed.
 But they eagerly joined BRAC's new program -- and were pleased to see their fast-breeding goats multiply. They were still so poor that their bodies seemed little more than collections of bones beneath worn saris, but their new assets offered hope.
 ''I had nothing, nobody,'' said Mina, who worked as a maid for payment in rice after her husband abandoned her. ''I was scared to become a member of BRAC. I was too poor to repay a loan. But now that I'm getting goats free, I'm interested.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the debate over whether microcredit loan programs should focus more on people at the upper fringes of poverty or on the poorest misidentified an organization that lobbied Congress to make sure the loans benefit the world's poorest. Its name is Results. (The Results Educational Fund is the group's research and educational arm and is not allowed to lobby Congress.)

HEADLINE: Pastel Clouds, Smelling of Honey

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER

 BODY:
THE crab apple trees are in full bloom along the Hudson. They look like pink clouds floating down Riverside Park. They are blooming all over New York City, in shades of carmine, pale pink and white.
 For about two weeks, the air smells like honey. 
 ''I shouldn't say this, but these low branches make this one perfect to climb,'' Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe said last week. He patted a wide branch on a tree standing near the entrance to the park at Riverside Drive and 99th Street. Bumblebees were hovering over pink buds that were just breaking open to reveal satiny white petals and yellow stamens.
 Mr. Benepe, 47, stuck his nose in a blossom. ''That perfume,'' he said. ''And they're so comforting to sit under.'' He used to play under this tree with his little sister, Jennifer, when they lived in a big apartment building across Riverside Drive.
 ''When it was time to go home, my mother would lean out the window and call us,'' he said. She liked to sit on a bench and breathe in the fragrance when all the trees were blooming along the river. When she died three years ago, just before Sept. 11, her family planted a young crab apple opposite her favorite bench.
 It has long been Mr. Benepe's ambition to restore the city's vintage crab apple collection, comprising thousands of trees of many different varieties first planted in the 1930's. These are the old-time trees with multiple trunks that branch low to the ground. They have developed broad arms with age and spreading canopies as wide as the trees are tall.
 ''Not like these lollipops everyone plants so they can mow under them,'' Mr. Benepe said. Many of the originals have succumbed to disease, pollution or old age. Others are so hardy that the Parks Department plans to propagate them from cuttings or even tissue culture. Last spring, it began a restoration program that will replace hundreds of trees in the next few years.
 Some of the most venerable beauties are now blooming in the Conservatory Garden in Central Park, near Fifth Avenue and 105th Street. Crab apple allees -- two double rows -- flank the formal lawn that sweeps up to the wisteria arbor with its clipped hedges of white spirea. If you duck into one allee, where park benches sit beneath the craggy trunks, you enter a mystical world, where the jagged branches of the old trees appear to dance, as if inhabited by joyful spirits. The satiny flowers, blooming against dark wood, form a scrim against the blue sky. The only thing to do is sit down on a bench and just breathe for a while.
 Another crab apple worth worshiping in the Conservatory Garden stands to the south, in its own Secret Garden, named after Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic children's book. The tree has multiple trunks about five feet in diameter, with a wide branch that stretches clear across the little pool where Mary and Dickon, Burnett's characters, have been immortalized -- or arrested, it almost seems -- in a bronze fountain.
 This tree is a mystery even to Fiona Watt, the chief of forestry and horticulture at the Parks Department, who has researched the city's crab apples with the passion of a green Sherlock Holmes. ''It's not a floribunda,'' she said, looking up at the pale pink buds and white petals. Its three trunks all swing low to the ground, then form branches going this way and that across the sky.
 ''This is clearly a great specimen and probably one of the originals planted in 1937,'' Ms. Watt said. ''We will be taking cuttings or reproducing it clonally.''
 The city has lost about half of the crab apples that were originally planted. ''And when we started to replant, we realized the replacements didn't look anything like the originals,'' Mr. Benepe said.
 Nurseries rarely carry these old-time clumping varieties, with wide spreading habits. So Ms. Watt, who has a master's in forestry from Yale, has been doing a little digging. For a year, while attending to her other duties, she pored over plans and planting lists at the Olmsted Center in Queens, discovering not only the astounding number of varieties the city used, but also how big they were when planted. ''Many of them were 10 to 12 feet tall with an 8- to 10-foot spread, with a 42-inch root ball,'' she said. Those titans were planted in the Depression era by the Works Progress Administration, when Robert Moses was not only commanding armies of otherwise unemployed tree planters but also building an entire arboretum and a lake in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park for the 1939 World's Fair.
 Though most of this forest was obliterated by the Van Wyck Expressway, a fragment still exists along Park Drive East, down a steep embankment overlooking the highway. Last week, Ms. Watt pointed out a few of the original crab apples, stretching their branches toward the light. Their blooms are sparse from neglect and lack of sun.
 But in the tall weeds between woods and highway, hundreds of crab apple trees have self-seeded in the field. Their flowers are white, pink or deep rose. Their leaves vary from grass-green to purplish bronze. Some have upright branches, while others appear to weep.
 ''What we have here is a genetic melting pot,'' Ms. Watt said. ''It's our own little Kazakhstan.'' The mountains of Kazakhstan, in central Asia, are home to both wild apples and wild crab apples, like the ancestors of Rosybloom, now flowering in the Conservatory Garden.
 So who knows what some enterprising botanist, mixing the genes of these wild trees seeding themselves along the Van Wyck Expressway, might produce?
 Meanwhile, the old crab apples are calling -- in Riverside and Central Parks, in the New York Botanical Garden and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, perhaps in your own backyard. Like life, their moment is fleeting, so wake up and smell them before it's too late.

Under a Spreading Crab Apple Tree
 MANY nurseries do not sell the old-fashioned wide-branching or clumping crab apple trees that grace Riverside Park. In replacing trees, Fiona Watt, the chief of forestry and horticulture for the New York City Parks Department, made this list of some that do:

ARBOR VILLAGE -- Holt, Mo.; (816) 264-3911 or www.arborvillagellc.com.

HEADLINE: Once Again, Reforms Miss Real Problem

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
A PANEL of college presidents is expected to approve a reform package today that ties scholarships and postseason appearances to the academic progress of athletes. The central feature of the N.C.A.A. legislation is a mechanism to monitor semester-by-semester progress to make sure athletes are working toward degrees, not taking courses merely to remain eligible. Some may transfer, some may leave for the pros, but if the athletes are in good academic standing, the programs won't be penalized.
 Myles Brand, the N.C.A.A. president, was ecstatic yesterday morning over the prospect of the legislation being passed. ''These are the first swells of a sea change,'' he said in a telephone interview, expanding on what he had said two days earlier over lunch in Manhattan. 
 He said that the new measures, combined with eligibility standards the N.C.A.A. passed last fall, constituted ''the pinnacle of the academic reform movement under way right now.''
 ''It represents all the planning and effort of the university presidents and the N.C.A.A. to put in stronger academic standards that ensure that student-athletes get a genuine education and a legitimate opportunity to graduate,'' Brand said.
 I'm not nearly as optimistic as Brand.
 In the past, graduation rates have served as a convenient whipping post -- ''Casablanca's'' usual suspects -- to be rounded up and hauled in to assuage the public outcry between playing seasons. But the lack of academic progress is not what's wrong with intercollegiate athletics, and Brand knows it.
 ''It's more complicated than just graduation rates,'' Brand said. ''They are important and it's one good measure. But they don't cut to the heart of the problem. The heart of the problem is ensuring that student-athletes have a genuine opportunity for a first-class education. That there are no artificial barriers put in their way by the system, by coaches -- anything at all that prevents them, not just from taking courses, but getting a real education.''
 I've seen parades of initiatives since 1983, when Proposition 48 was introduced in an effort to set academic requirements for incoming freshmen. The N.C.A.A. manual has grown into a voluminous book of spells and a measure, more than anything else, of how little N.C.A.A. members trust each other.
 The manual reflects the unbridled zeal, in many cases the need, to win -- something more insidious than any apparent lack of academic progress.
 Last season the University of Washington softball team had a 100 percent graduation rate. Now it is embroiled in a scandal that has resulted in the dismissal of the team's doctor and coach, and the resignation of its trainer. The university said the doctor and trainer were overmedicating the athletes, while the coach was routinely pushing her players past the 20-hour-a-week limit set by the N.C.A.A. Academic success is not necessarily an indicator that a program is problem-free.
 ''What needs to be reformed is the sense of the role of athletics within a college education,'' Brand said. 
 The real reason for the quagmire in intercollegiate athletics is that college presidents treat the enterprise like a university brothel -- a money-making (and public relations) apparatus that is appreciated but not respected. Athletics are kept on the periphery of a university's academic life.
 The most encouraging part of the proposed N.C.A.A. legislation is not the academic-progress adjustments, but a long-overdue initiative to drag intercollegiate athletics into the academic mission of the institutions.
 Most athletic departments stand alone. Brand wants to have universities control the budgets and turn the athletic directors into facilitators who take what they are given and make the most of it.
 As you would expect, there is resistance from the athletic side. But there is also resistance from academics who think very little of athletics as a part of higher education.
 ''I think it's undervalued because most faculty members disapprove of those activities that focus on the body rather than the mind,'' said Brand, who was the president at Indiana University before becoming the N.C.A.A. president. 
 College presidents should be leading the crusade to make intercollegiate athletics an academic discipline. Instead, they raid each other's athletic conferences to get new members but keep the athletic departments at arm's length. Some critics advocate reducing varsity athletics to club sports.
 ''Some faculty members believe that athletics should be taken entirely off campus and made professional and not be part of the university,'' Brand said. ''They are pushing not just to make it an auxiliary, but to turn it into a minor league -- rent out stadiums and license the logos. I think that way of thinking is destructive to athletics and destructive of the educational process, because I believe strongly that athletics has educational value, and once you push it off campus, it's like pushing the school of journalism off campus.''
 I've clashed with Brand on numerous issues, but I agree with him on this, primarily because I believe in the athletic scholarship, especially at a time when access to quality education for the economically disadvantaged is shrinking.
 I'm not convinced that the presidents and chancellors who run universities will ever get beyond their cash-register mentality when it comes to intercollegiate athletics. When it comes to enlightened thinking, the graduation rate among this group is the most dismal of all.

HEADLINE: Shares Decline on Worries Over Rates, Iraq and China

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks sank yesterday as concerns about rising interest rates and heightened tensions in Iraq, along with worries about China's efforts to cool its red-hot economy, overshadowed investors' recent enthusiasm about strong corporate profits.
 Shares of metals and mining companies were the hardest hit, led by the aluminum producer Alcoa Inc., on concerns that credit restrictions in China could slow its growth and cut its appetite for raw materials.
 First-quarter earnings have shown solid improvement over the last year. But concerns are mounting that the market may already reflect corporate America's rapid recovery. 
 ''The good earnings news we're getting was the reason for last year's big rise, so most of this earnings news is priced in,'' said Edgar E. Peters, chief investment officer at PanAgora Asset Management. An announcement from Nortel Networks that an investigation had revealed deeper accounting problems also affected Wall Street's mood.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 135.56 points, or 1.29 percent, to 10,342.60. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 15.70 points, or 1.38 percent, to 1,122.41, and the Nasdaq composite fell 42.99 points, or 2.12 percent, to 1,989.54.
 About 1.9 billion shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange and 2 billion traded on the Nasdaq.
 Prices of industrial metals like aluminum and copper plunged yesterday as China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, said his country might move forcefully to slow its economy, likely limiting money for steel and aluminum projects.
 Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum producer, fell $1.29, or 4 percent, to $31.01. U.S. Steel lost $2.82, or 8.5 percent, to $30.56, while Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold slid $2.30, or 7.2 percent, to $29.50.
 Speculation that the Federal Reserve may soon increase short-term interest rates to limit inflation put investors on guard. A Fed policy-setting meeting is scheduled for next week and gross domestic product data is due on Thursday.
 Investors are likely to pay particular attention to the gross domestic product deflator figure, a broad measure of inflation, for clues to the timing of the Fed's next move.
 Nortel Networks, the maker of telecommunications gear, was the most heavily traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, losing a quarter of its value as it fired its top three executives and forecast a 50 percent drop in 2003 earnings. Nortel's New York-listed shares slid $1.59, or 28 percent, to $4.05. 
 Comcast Corporation rose 23 cents to $30.20 after withdrawing its $48.4 billion bid for the Walt Disney Company. Disney fell 23 cents, to $23.95. 
 Boeing Company kept a lid on the Dow's losses after it posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings and raised its profit and revenue forecasts. Its shares rose 48 cents, to $44.03.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Bloomberg News
 Treasury prices fell yesterday, before a government report on Thursday that is expected to show first-quarter growth acceleration, adding to speculation that the Federal Reserve will lift its important interest rate as soon as September.
 Investors are hesitant to buy Treasuries because of concern that the supply of government debt is increasing when the economy is growing and inflation may quicken.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note fell 26/32 to 96 3/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.50 percent, from 4.39 on Tuesday.
 The Treasury Department's $26 billion sale of two-year notes was met with the weakest demand in three months. Here are the auction results:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
High Price -- 99.961
High Yield -- 2.270

Medicare Starts Web Site To Compare Drug Prices
Medicare is starting a Web site to help millions of older Americans compare prices of their prescription drugs. The site is the first big-league test for DestinationRx, the little-known company that Medicare hired without competitive bidding to create and run the system.
 If it works as advertised, Medicare enrollees will be able to visit the site to find prices of their medications at nearby stores that will accept Medicare-certified drug discount cards. They could then use the information to decide which card would help them most. But the program has attracted skeptics. [Page C5.]

HEADLINE: Jumping Out of Sick Bay

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
So I come to Tokyo to get away from it all, and what do I discover but more bad news for the John Kerry campaign. Not only does the U.S. economy appear to be headed for at least a burst of recovery around election time, but so does the world's second-largest economy, Japan, which should also help buoy the U.S. recovery. It's more evidence, to me, that Mr. Kerry may have to run in the most difficult of all environments, and exactly the opposite of the one Democrats had hoped for: an environment where the U.S. economy is rebounding, and Iraq is reeling.
 As I lie awake in my Tokyo hotel, jet-lagged out of my mind and having my Bill Murray ''Lost in Translation'' moment, I am clicking back and forth between CNBC and CNN on the television. All the news on CNBC seems to be about how Asia's economies are now on fire, and all the news on CNN seems to be about how America's Humvees in Iraq are now on fire. 
 Maybe that will change in the months ahead, and maybe American voters will develop a different reaction to those contrasting images, should they continue. But for the moment, judging from many polls, it seems that Mr. Bush is being rewarded for the economy's tentative recovery more than he is being punished for Iraq's troubling slide. I'm sure the Kerry camp was hoping for the opposite -- a stable Iraq and a slumping economy that would start to recover only after November -- because it would play much more to Mr. Kerry's strength with voters. But, for a lot of reasons, that doesn't seem to be what's happening, and the Kerry folks had better start positioning their candidate for the world we're in.
 I wish I had some smart advice. Alas, all I have is information. Even through my jet lag, I can see that the sick man of Asia, otherwise known as the Japanese economy, just jumped out of bed and is now running laps around the hospital. Everyone in the neighborhood is watching, wondering whether the sick man has really gotten healthy or just an injection of Chinese steroids and will soon stumble again -- as happened before, in the 1990's. No one in the neighborhood is quite sure, even the sick man himself, but everyone is enjoying the show, especially the sick man.
 There is evidence to suggest that, maybe, this Japanese recovery is real, is not just based on government spending and will last longer than previous wind sprints. I went to a briefing that Wal-Mart put on with its Japanese partner, Seiyu, a local store chain, about opening the first Wal-Mart-like big-box stores in Japan. No one ever believed that Japan's rigid, small-shop economy would tolerate a discount big-box approach like Wal-Mart's, where wholesalers get squeezed and everything from employees' pens to paper gets rationed.
 But Japanese consumers, many so spooked by their faltering banks that they stuffed money in their mattresses, seem to be suddenly spending again -- their confidence bolstered by recent bank restructurings and better leadership from the Japanese central bank. The Nikkei 225 stock average jumped 47 percent in the fiscal year that ended on March 31.
 Because Japan (much more than the U.S.) has been able to hold onto a sophisticated manufacturing base -- like high-end steel, machine tools, cutting-edge electronics and industrial robots -- it's been exporting like crazy to China's start-up factories. This year, Japan's trade with China surpassed its trade with the U.S.
 ''Two-thirds of the reason for [Japan's] recovery is China,'' says the Japanese management consultant Kenichi Ohmae. China, and new Japanese plants in China, are sucking in so many Japanese exports there aren't enough ships to bring them over fast enough. China is literally dragging Japan out of its slump.
 ''There is [also] much more attention [in Japan] to restructuring than there was in the past,'' adds Jeffrey Young, Tokyo economist for Nikko Citigroup. ''Companies are improving their efficiencies.'' And Japan's workers have proved more adaptable, in hard times, than commonly believed.
 The big test is: Can Japan continue to grow, based on domestic consumer-led demand, if and when the overheating Chinese economy starts to cool? Domestic wages and productivity are still lagging. And how does Japan deal with its huge fiscal deficit and still-weak banks, which will probably require more taxes from an aging, shrinking work force to sort out?
 Only when we see that will we know whether the sick man has it in him to do anything more than run laps around the hospital.

Pentagon Attributes Bombs To Hussein's Secret Service
A Pentagon intelligence report has concluded that some bombings against Americans and their allies in Iraq, and the more sophisticated of the guerrilla attacks in Falluja, are organized and often carried out by members of Saddam Hussein's secret service, who planned the insurgency before the fall of Baghdad.

HEADLINE: Time Warner's Profit More Than Doubles in Quarter

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
Time Warner said yesterday that its first-quarter profit more than doubled, led by solid performances in its film and cable operations and improved results at America Online.
 Saying that the company had outperformed its own expectations, Richard D. Parsons, the chairman and chief executive, added, ''These results demonstrate the individual and collective strength of our businesses and put us comfortably on track to meet all of our 2004 financial targets.''
 For the quarter, Time Warner had net income of $961 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $396 million, or 9 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 9 percent, to $10.1 billion from $9.24 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $9.51 billion. 
 Operating income before depreciation and amortization in the film division rose to $427 million, compared with $251 million in the period a year earlier, in part because of increased worldwide license fees for the third cycle of television syndication for ''Seinfeld.'' And big increases in profits at the cable and network division left analysts impressed as well.
 ''The economy is recovering, and Time Warner is experiencing the benefits,'' said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''The cable networks did great because of a recovery in ad revenues, and paid search at AOL did very, very well. They have done a very good job operating these businesses.'' AOL is paid by advertisers to give links prominent placement in search results for subscribers.
 The positive results led to speculation from analysts that the company might be interested in a stock buyback or a large acquisition. Mr. Parsons said there would be no stock buyback in the near term. And although there has been speculation among analysts that the company would buy all or some of Adelphia Communications, the nation's fifth-largest cable operator, with 5.4 million subscribers, or Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the film company, Mr. Parsons declined to be specific about any possible acquisitions. 
 While the results suggest that Time Warner has largely overcome the discord caused by the merger with America Online, it still faces investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department into accounting and disclosure practices at the time of the merger.
 The issue was not addressed during the conference call, but in its notes to the financial statement released yesterday, the company said that ''it was the preliminary view of the S.E.C. staff that the company's accounting for two related transactions between America Online and Bertelsmann A.G. should be adjusted.'' In the notes, the company said it continued to believe that its accounting was proper. Still, the prospect of the investigation and the shareholder suits that might result could limit the company's appetite for new properties.
 ''It is unclear how they can go shopping until they get some of these issues resolved,'' Mr. Wolzien said. ''And they did not make any predictions about when that was going to happen.''
 Without saying so specifically, Mr. Parsons made it clear that the surprisingly strong financial results at AOL meant that Time Warner would not be selling the division anytime soon. 
 ''We have a lot of confidence that this is a business that has a lot of upside, that it is recatching its stride and has growth potential going forward,'' Mr. Parsons said.
 The division lost 237,000 subscribers in the quarter as narrowband customers migrated to broadband providers and advertising declined 5 percent because of a loss of $31 million in intercompany revenue, but big revenue from paid search ads -- $27 million -- and network costs that were $132 million lower than they were in the period a year earlier allowed the company to show better earnings.
 The division's operating income before depreciation and amortization rose 21 percent, to $489 million, on revenue of $2.19 billion, which was about the same in the period a year earlier.
 Don Logan, chairman of media and communications, said the company was encouraged by the consumer demand for the bring-your-own-access product, which allows customers to use the service regardless of the Internet provider.
 ''AOL has a number of businesses with attractive growth profiles,'' said Mr. Logan, who added that the $1 billion in free cash flow the business produced continued to make it a good property to own.
 Net debt at the end of the first quarter was $18.8 billion, down from $22.7 billion at the end of the previous quarter, with most of the debt reduction coming from the sale of the Warner Music Group for $2.6 billion.
 On March 31, the company also completed the sale of its professional basketball team, the Atlanta Hawks, and its hockey team, the Atlanta Thrashers.

HEADLINE: Bush Rejects Labor's Call to Punish China

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
With unusual fanfare, the Bush administration rejected on Wednesday an American labor organization's demand that China be punished for gaining trade advantages by violating the rights of workers. 
 Four cabinet members -- Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao and Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative -- held a rare joint news conference where they repeatedly berated the petition, filed last month by the AFL-CIO, as ''economic isolationism.''
 With China routinely facing accusations of taking jobs from the United States, the decision may have political ramifications in several battleground states in the presidential campaign. The trade petition was endorsed by Senator John Kerry, the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, who has spent this week criticizing President Bush's trade policies as failing to protect American jobs and American workers. 
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O. petition said China violated the rights of its workers by suppressing strikes, banning independent trade unions and not enforcing minimum wage laws. 
 When asked if the subtext of the news conference was partisan politics, Mr. Evans demurred and sidestepped the question. ''We've always been very clear that free, fair and open trade is important for the American economy,'' he answered.
 Business leaders were pleased with the administration's decision.
 Tom Donahue, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, said that workers' rights should never be included in trade agreements.
 ''Had the administration accepted the petition, there would have been a number of negative consequences.'' Mr. Donahue said. ''We would have married forever human rights and trade, and that would have been a huge mistake.''
 But union leaders expressed dismay. ''President Bush proves himself to be, once again, the servant of his corporate donors,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''It is the multinational corporations who benefit from the artificially low wages and repressed rights of Chinese workers.''
 Mark Levinson, the chief economist of Unite, the apparel union, said that the administration's action underscored a clear division between big business and labor that could help the Kerry campaign.
 ''The concern out there about losing jobs is big,'' Mr. Levinson said. ''The signal this sends to China and any other country is they can do whatever they want to cut labor costs, even if it hurts American jobs and American competitiveness.''
 Ms. Chao said that rather than condoning China's labor policies, the United States had agreed to a new effort with China to ensure that it met its international labor commitments.
 Mr. Evans said that ''good, high-paying American jobs depend on trade with China.''
 The administration officials said that if China cooperated in this effort to improve labor rights and moved toward a more flexible currency exchange, the United States would consider designating China a market economy -- an elevation in its trade status that would include measures like protecting it from the current high penalties it faces in antidumping trade cases.
 ''The tool we have is the designation of China as a market economy,'' Mr. Evans said. 
 Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said that argument was ''lame.''
 ''They can't seriously believe that China will give their workers the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining in exchange for being eligible to be called a market economy,'' Mr. Levin said. ''I call that a callous disregard for workers in China.''
 The administration officials also said they would reject a proposed trade petition by a coalition of American manufacturers making a similar complaint about China's currency rates. The manufacturers argue that by pegging its currency to the dollar, China is keeping the prices of its exports artificially low, to the disadvantage of American companies. 
 Mr. Zoellick, the trade representative, did not reject the A.F.L.-C.I.O. petition's contentions that China represses workers' rights. But he said the administration preferred a cooperative approach.
 ''Accepting these petitions would take us down the path of economic isolationism, and that is a path we will not take,'' he said. Critics point out that Mr. Zoellick's office has often filed what they see as similar petitions, seeking action against countries to protect intellectual property rights, for example. The A.F.L-C.I.O. petition was the first case brought under the Trade Act of 1974 that seeks penalties for violations of workers' rights. 
 Peter Morici, a professor of international business at the University of Maryland, said the petition made a strong case by seeking enforcement of international labor standards and not those of the United States.
 ''The labor complaint is something China and its lawyers should worry about,'' Professor Morici said.

HEADLINE: Kerry Outlines His Jobs Program in Swing Through Midwest

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich., April 28 

 BODY:
Wrapping up a three-day swing through a swath of the country that is both economically sinking and able to swing November's election, Senator John Kerry vowed Wednesday to revive the moribund manufacturing sector with high-tech, high-skilled, high-wage ''jobs of the future.''
 ''I believe that the best days of the industrial Midwest are not behind us; I think they're ahead of us with the right leadership,'' Mr. Kerry told a crowd of several hundred here at Washtenaw Community College. ''We just need to harness the skills, energy and forward thinking in this room and on factory floors all across America.'' 
 Billed as his last of three major economic speeches since Mr. Kerry locked up the Democratic presidential nomination, the 45-minute presentation revisited proposals he has been promoting daily on the campaign trail, with two new ideas. He said he would create what he called Manufacturing Business Investment Corporations, modeled on the Small Business Investment Companies, to provide venture capital, and add $200 million in government money to the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and to the Advanced Technology Program, which help speed adoption of new technologies.
 He argued that the region's economic problems need not be permanent. ''I believe this is a setback if we treat it properly, and just that, a setback,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''There's no reason to abandon ship.''
 Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for President Bush's re-election campaign, responded to the speech by pointing to recent statistics suggesting a bounce back in the sector -- March saw the highest number of new manufacturing jobs since 1988, and new jobless claims fell by 9,000 in the week ended April 17. 
 Mr. Schmidt asserted that the programs in the speech would cost ''tens of billions of dollars,'' but he was referring mainly to proposals Mr. Kerry made long ago. David Wade, Mr. Kerry's press secretary, said the venture fund would be revenue-neutral because, like its small-business counterpart, the government would just be guaranteeing loans made by private investors, and applicant fees cover the costs of operation.
 Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on a conference call with reporters organized by the Bush campaign, ''While Kerry is running around doing his press conferences and rallies on jobs, we're working here in the U.S. Senate to actually try to do something about it.'' 
 Mr. Kerry's speech capped a 427-mile tour, in an armored bus used by President Bill Clinton for a similar jaunt in 1996. The senator rode from Wheeling, W.Va., through western Pennsylvania, across northern Ohio to this university town. Mr. Bush narrowly won Ohio and West Virginia in 2000; Vice President Al Gore took Pennsylvania and Michigan. 
 At each rally or discussion, Mr. Kerry cited the numbers of jobs lost in that city -- 9,000 in Youngstown, Ohio, he said, for example -- during the Bush administration. 
 In between, he shook hands with construction workers in Cleveland, toured a coal mine and a cookware factory, and chatted with laid-off workers, union leaders, mayors and local reporters invited to ride aboard the rolling photo opportunity called Jobs First Express. 
 Before flying out Wednesday afternoon, he sampled fancy salami and salads at a deli in an Ann Arbor neighborhood known as Kerrytown. 
 President Bush plans to make a similar trek next week through Michigan and Ohio -- including a stop in Toledo, where Mr. Kerry spoke Wednesday at the United Auto Workers' Local 12 union hall.
 ''Every single day I intend to be talking about creating jobs in every state,'' Mr. Kerry said here. ''There's no greater priority.''
 On Monday, Mr. Kerry accused the administration of failing to enforce American trade agreements, saying, ''Just because we live in a global economy, and we need to trade and we're going to trade, doesn't mean that we leave our standards and our values at the nation's shores.''
 Tuesday in Youngstown, Mr. Kerry recalled the day in 1960 when another Massachusetts senator seeking the presidency, John F. Kennedy, made a similar speech across the street.
 ''He said, 'I see a strong and a great country, but I see a country that must be stronger; I see a people full of vitality and energy but I see a leadership that has been standing still,' '' Mr. Kerry quoted his role model as saying then. ''Under George Bush, we're not just standing still, we're moving backwards.''
 Asked by a local television reporter Wednesday afternoon what kinds of cars his family owned, Mr. Kerry listed a Dodge 600, a Chrysler 300 M, a Chrysler van, a Chrysler PT Cruiser, a Chevy Suburban, and a Land Rover, among others. The senator, who was criticized last week for saying that he did not own a gas-guzzling S.U.V., then adding that his wife had a Chevrolet Suburban, drew another fine distinction on Wednesday.
 ''My wife has a number of different cars in some different locations,'' he said.
 Interview over and camera off, Mr. Kerry added: ''All my cars are American. The ones I've personally bought are American.''

HEADLINE: Specter, Victory in Hand, Now Pushes Bush Away

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, April 28 

 BODY:
Just hours after he had squeaked by a conservative opponent in a grueling primary, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania on Wednesday began emphasizing his independence from the man who many Republicans believe carried him to victory, President Bush. 
 Republican analysts said Mr. Bush's hard work for Mr. Specter, which included a joint appearance last week, allowing his image to be used in commercials and dispatching aides to promote Mr. Specter's record, probably made the difference in Mr. Specter's two-point victory over Representative Patrick J. Toomey. The margin was 16,000 votes out of more than one million cast. 
 On Wednesday morning, Mr. Specter took steps to win over the centrist Democrats and swing voters who will be crucial in the general election by enumerating his differences with Mr. Bush's conservative agenda. 
 In a hastily called news conference, Mr. Specter said he supported stem cell research, while the president opposes it. He voted to trim part of the president's tax cut, much to conservatives' chagrin. He objected to an administration plan to roll back the minimum wage for some workers. And he opposes federally financed vouchers for private schools, an education priority for Mr. Bush. 
 ''I intend to retain my independent voice,'' Mr. Specter said. ''The people of Pennsylvania have not elected me to be a rubber stamp.''
 Mr. Specter said that although he intended to work hard for Mr. Bush's re-election, he believed that he could give the president ''greater credibility'' by disagreeing with him.
 ''I don't give anybody a blank check, including the president of the United States,'' he said.
 Mr. Specter spoke as his Democratic opponent, Representative Joseph M. Hoeffel, began a 19-county six-day state tour by characterizing Mr. Specter as a White House puppet ''dragged across the finish line'' by the president.
 ''He's not the moderate maverick that Democrats used to like,'' Mr. Hoeffel said. ''He has, as I've said, become a meek and a mute supporter of George Bush. And I don't think that's a winning message for Pennsylvania.''
 Mr. Specter stepped away from Mr. Bush as social and fiscal conservatives from Pennsylvania and elsewhere voiced dismay over the razor-thin outcome on Tuesday. Those conservatives had viewed the Pennsylvania primary as a golden opportunity to topple a leading Republican centrist and pressure other moderates to shift rightward. Mr. Specter will lose many of those conservatives if he focuses on moderating his message, the conservatives said. 
 ''If he moves to the center, there won't be much enthusiasm for him,'' said Pete Sepp, vice president for communications of the National Taxpayers Union Campaign Fund, which endorsed Mr. Toomey. 
 Despite Mr. Toomey's calls on Tuesday night for party unity, State Representative Gordon Denlinger, an Ephrata Republican who backed Mr. Toomey, said conservatives' disaffection with Mr. Specter ran deep.
 ''Unity isn't a foregone conclusion,'' Mr. Denlinger said. ''Specter has to work for it.''
 James N. Clymer, a Lancaster County resident who is national chairman of the Constitution Party, said his party planned to mount a major fund-raising drive and sponsor a conservative candidate whose goal would be to siphon votes from Mr. Specter, even if it meant helping to elect Mr. Hoeffel.
 ''There's so little difference between Specter and Hoeffel, I don't think it should matter to most principled conservatives,'' Mr. Clymer said. ''In fact, Arlen Specter does more damage to the conservative movement than Joe Hoeffel.''
 There was, however, talk of unity among some conservatives. The Club for Growth, an antitax group that spent more than $2 million supporting Mr. Toomey, endorsed Mr. Specter on Wednesday.
 ''Although we disagreed with Arlen Specter on a number of economic issues, there is no doubt that Senator Specter is far more likely to support tax cuts and other Bush economic policies than Representative Hoeffel,'' the group said in a statement.
 Some conservatives said there was even some relief in their movement that Mr. Specter had won, citing concerns that the Democrats would have had a better chance of beating Mr. Toomey, risking the Republicans' thin Senate majority. 
 ''The desire to see Toomey beat Specter was always tinged with a certain danger and uncertainty,'' said Grover G. Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, who had personally endorsed Mr. Toomey. 
 Democratic officials in Washington acknowledged on Wednesday that they had wanted Mr. Toomey to win, saying it is more difficult to topple an incumbent senator. But they promised to pour money and manpower into Mr. Hoeffel's race.
 Mr. Hoeffel has yet to demonstrate the fund-raising prowess that Mr. Specter has, in part because of his incumbency. 
 On Wednesday, Democrats opened a Web site, spectertwostep.com, dedicated to portraying Mr. Specter as an opportunist with no ideological core.
 ''You can only be on all sides of all of the issues all of the time for so long before it comes back to haunt you,'' a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Brad Woodhouse, said. ''It nearly did to Arlen Specter in the primary.''
 A pollster, G. Terry Madonna, said Mr. Toomey's attacks on Mr. Specter's stands on abortion, gun control, taxes and spending forced the senator to move right on those issues in the last year. That could make it harder to appeal to centrists before November, Mr. Madonna said. 
 Jennifer Duffy, Senate editor for The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter, said Mr. Specter's moves had been too incremental for most voters to notice. In many ways, Ms. Duffy said, Mr. Specter and Mr. Hoeffel look the same. Both support abortion rights, receive support from trial lawyers and unions and run strongest in the Philadelphia suburbs. Mr. Hoeffel represents Montgomery County outside Philadelphia.

HEADLINE: South Korea Casts Wary Glance to North

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, April 24 

 BODY:
The huge orange fireball that leveled a North Korean railroad town last week stamped an exclamation point on a report that spelled out how North Korea, once the peninsula's industrial showcase, is now its industrial wasteland.
 After almost six decades of Communist rule by the Kim family, North Korea can boast industrial equipment with a value of $2 billion, according to the Bank of Korea, South Korea's central bank. By contrast, the same industrial inventory in South Korea is worth $489 billion.
 When Kim Il Sung took over northern Korea from fleeing Japanese colonialists in 1945, industrial development was concentrated in the north. On April 22, Kim Jong Il, Mr. Kim's son and North Korea's current ruler, narrowly missed the explosion in Ryongchon. Returning by rail from Beijing, where Chinese officials gave him lectures on market economics, he passed through just hours before the blast vaporized the railroad station, killing 161 people and injuring 1,300. 
 The images of North Korea's decrepitude -- blast survivors moving household possessions by cart and blinded children sleeping on filing cabinets in a crowded hospital -- were vivid reminders of the high economic price of an East German-style collapse. South Korea's bill to rebuild North Korea in the first decade of unification could be around $600 billion, said Marcus Noland, a Korea specialist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
 With polls showing South Koreans balking at such an amount, South Korea's government and media nurture the slightest tendrils of a market economy growing between Communist cracks in the North.
 ''Waiters now take tips at hotels,'' Moon Chung In, a Yonsei University foreign affairs professor, said in an interview after returning from a trip this month to Pyongyang. ''It's all part of an incentive system that is now in place.''
 ''In 2002, I was at the Koryo Hotel, and they would throw us out of the restaurant at 10 p.m. on the dot,'' he said. ''But this time, they let us stay there until 2 a.m. to drink and eat. They said that if sales go up, they get bonuses, which raises their monthly salary twice or threefold.''
 Next month, five South Korean companies -- makers of shoes, clothing and kitchen utensils -- are to sign leases in an industrial park in the North sponsored by the South Korean government. Just over the Demilitarized Zone border, the park at Kaesong will open in June, offering as its main attraction docile workers who will toil for as little as $57 a month.
 This month, in two firsts for North-South cooperation, agreements were completed to allow the Korea Electric Power Corporation, or Kepco, South Korea's government-run monopoly, to supply 15,000 kilowatts an hour to the North Korean industrial zone, and for the E1 Corporation, a South Korean company, to supply liquefied petroleum gas to the zone.
 At last count, 1,600 South Korean companies have applied to set up factories in the zone, which will eventually include 10 square miles. 
 Kept on the back burner in recent months, partly because of the controversy over North Korea's nuclear weapons production, the Kaesong park is expected to win more government support after the liberal sweep of the congressional elections on April 15.
 Seoul's media, seeking to portray North Korea on a slow march to normalcy, has highlighted the fact that in recent months cellphone service expanded to most of North Korea's main cities and that this month brought the opening of Pyongyang's first 24-hour convenience store. 
 South Korean tourists, returning from package tours to the North, report that farmers' markets have become primary sources of food, clothes and cosmetics and that private cars are increasingly seen on the streets. In an economy that only three years ago was as demonetized as Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, people are now allowed to fix bicycles, repair shoes and sell sundries at sidewalk stands.
 As potential foreign investors test the waters, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in Korea, a Seoul group, opened a branch in Pyongyang in January. At that time, Roger Barrett, a former British Army officer, opened a consulting office in Pyongyang, Korea Business Consultants. Selling advice to dozens of foreign companies interested in North Korea, Mr. Barrett also started the first privately published business newsletter on North Korea, The DPRK Business News Bulletin.
 In March, Jang Song Thaek, Kim Jong Il's brother-in-law and de facto No.2, lost his job, apparently for opposing the new market-oriented economic policy.
 Starting in the summer of 2002, food prices were allowed to float; construction began in most cities for private markets; the North Korean currency, the won, was heavily devalued; and businesses like restaurants and small hotels were allowed to open.
 But the question remains whether Kim Jong Il is embarking on Chinese-style reforms or whether he is simply allowing enough economic activity to ease pressure for political change.
 The virtues of markets were extolled in Beijing last week during Mr. Kim's four-day visit. 
 For China, North Korea is an economic albatross, a backward nation that relies heavily on Chinese food and fuel aid, and then builds nuclear weapons to assert its independence. A collapse of North Korea would flood northern China with refugees. 
 Allied by a historical attachment to Communism, China and North Korea conducted trade last year that amounted to $1 billion, much of it Chinese aid. In contrast, China's trade last year with South Korea totaled $58 billion.
 North Korea's basic quandary ''is that it would like to pursue economic reform or openness while not being threatened politically,'' said Koh Il Dong, an economic researcher at the Korea Development Institute in Seoul. ''They will seriously consider ways to reform without hurting their system.''
 The free market changes so often cited by visitors to Pyongyang were never mentioned by North Korea's prime minister, Pak Pong Ju, in his annual speech to the Supreme People's Assembly, according to Aidan Foster-Carter, a Korean studies professor at Leeds University.
 ''Ominously, not once did Pak Pong Ju explicitly mention the cautious yet far-reaching market reforms which North Korea has implemented since July 2002,'' Professor Foster-Carter wrote in an analysis of the March 25 speech. ''A reform which dares not speak its name must by definition be limited. Yet the day before, the visiting Chinese foreign minister was proudly shown Pyongyang's new Tongil private market.''
 Little touched by the market reforms are the government-owned industrial mastodons of North Korea. Starved for investment, most of North Korea's economy has become, in the words of one Japanese economist, ''a planned economy without planning.''
 Mr. Noland, the Washington economist, told a seminar here this month: ''North Korea today is stuck in a nether world where they haven't managed to successfully reform, but they are going to have difficulty going backwards. It's probably hard to put that genie back into the bottle.''
 ''I'm not sure that that is reversible in the sense of going back to a classic centrally planned economy that may have existed in the 1960's or 1970's,'' he said. ''But on the other hand, it's not clear that it leads anywhere, either.''
 Others see the obstacle as Mr. Kim. A man with a rudimentary training in economics, Mr. Kim has run North Korea, directly or indirectly, for 20 years.
 ''Reform is only possible when Kim Jong Il is removed,'' Kim Sang Hun, a leading South Korean human rights activist, said. ''In North Korea, no reform is going to take place with this guy still in power. Just lip service.''
 In the wake of the train explosion, the limits of North Korea's openness were on display. With dozens of reporters in the Chinese border city of Dandong, North Korean officials refused to let any journalist into the country. When foreign aid workers drove up from Pyongyang, North Korean officials refused to allow them to visit blast victims in hospitals in Sinujiu, because they lacked permits to enter the city, nominally a free trade zone. 
 And then North Korean officials refused to allow South Korea to send aid by truck to Ryongchon. In a country where many trucks look like battered props from Soviet movies of the 1950's, the sight of a convoy of modern trucks driving the length of the nation was deemed to be too destabilizing.

HEADLINE: Their long slump over, airlines are battling for a busy summer market.

BYLINE: By Nat Ives

 BODY:
AS summer approaches and the air travel business recovers from its long doldrums, Madison Avenue has produced a crop of campaigns talking up its airline clients. The advertising varies widely in style and content, but all of it aims to fill seats in what could be the busiest travel season in several years.
 ''Demand absolutely has returned and is continuing to grow,'' said Dennis Poynter, director for advertising at ATA Airlines, now running its first national brand campaign since changing its name from American Trans Air. ''What you're seeing in the intensity by all the airlines, as the economy and travel economy continue to improve, is that everyone wants to increase their share.'' 
 Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., and a former airline marketing executive, agreed. ''This summer we'll see passenger demand that will almost equal the summer of 2000,'' Mr. Mann said. ''This summer will be a war over hearts and minds to see who can run closest to full.''
 The airlines with new or revamped campaigns include Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Continental Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Lufthansa, the Scandinavian Airlines System, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways.
 As one might expect in an industry that has seen so much change, the stakes are enormous. For instance, where American Airlines once flew the most passengers to and from Kennedy Airport in New York, JetBlue is now tops there, according to statistics provided by the airport.
 And in 2000, United Airlines had the most miles flown nationally by fare-paying passengers, called revenue passenger miles, with 126.9 billion, according to the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics. JetBlue, then in its first year, did not crack the top 30 airlines ranked by revenue passenger miles.
 By last year, American had overtaken the top spot, with 120.3 billion revenue passenger miles, and JetBlue ranked 11th, at 11.5 billion.
 While many factors affect the ebb and flow of airline fortunes, the carriers clearly hope some good ads will go a long way. They spent $627.8 billion advertising in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR. 
 As JetBlue grew, for instance, company executives felt as if other low-fare airlines were trying to copy the JetBlue brand voice. ''We thought it could get confusing to consumers,'' said Amy Curtis-McIntyre, vice president for sales and marketing. ''We decidedly sought separation from where the pack was going.''
 But a legion of travelers has already taken to the JetBlue upstart brand personality, said Paul Cappelli, chief executive at the Ad Store in New York, the JetBlue agency. ''As a brand begins to mature, even as young as JetBlue is, how do we keep this brand special for consumers?''
 The new campaign, with a budget estimated at $16 million to $18 million, tries to answer that question with the theme, ''We like you, too.'' New print and outdoor ads were produced, while commercials from last year were updated to include the new theme.
 The ATA Airlines division of ATA Holdings romances consumers in a way that is not so different from the original JetBlue pitch, stressing simplicity and comfort. Commercials appearing nationally show montages of attractive travelers and aircraft, all set to a song including the words, ''Go easy, go ATA.'' 
 That theme, created by Romani Brothers in Chicago, is infused throughout television and radio commercials, airport displays and print ads. The campaign budget was not disclosed, but ATA spent roughly $37 million in local and regional advertising last year.
 While some carriers' campaigns play for affection and peace of mind, others brag about features. SAS, as the Scandinavian Airlines System is known, has begun a print and radio campaign to introduce a new class of seating on its aircraft called Economy Extra, which will offer 30 percent more room than coach.
 The SAS agency, Needleman, Drossman & Partners in New York, created a campaign to show that roominess matters by running some print ads in small sizes and others with a lot of white space. 
 But two overseas heavyweights with trans-Atlantic flights are also running new campaigns. Lufthansa, in ads created by Gotham in New York, and British Airways, in a campaign by M&C Saatchi in London and the iTraffic division of Agency.com, are promoting features like seats that recline entirely flat, preflight meals that allow passengers to go directly to sleep and high-speed Internet access in seats. Agency.com is part of the Omnicom Group.
 Other carriers are fighting for turf. After Southwest Airlines said two weeks ago that it was considering adding more flights from Philadelphia International Airport, US Airways decided to begin a counterattack, said B. Ben Baldanza, senior vice president for marketing and planning.
 ''As our key Northeast hub, we will not let other carriers poach our customers and steal our revenue,'' Mr. Baldanza said.
 To that end, US Airways is simplifying and lowering its fares, which it will advertise via a sprawling campaign that will include ''guerilla'' activities like buying gasoline for random drivers at the pump and going into office buildings to offer free massages. The campaign was created by Eisner Communications in Baltimore.
 United Airlines, part of the UAL Corporation, began its first big campaign in five years in March in anticipation of its emergence from bankruptcy protection this summer. The campaign drops the previous theme, ''United Rising.'' 
 The new commercials, which are animated, feature the voice of Robert Redford. ''United,'' Mr. Redford says at the end of the spots, which were developed by Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of the Publicis Groupe, ''It's time to fly.''
 Executives there certainly hope so.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

''ARCADIA AND METROPOLIS: MASTERWORKS OF GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM FROM THE NATIONALGALERIE BERLIN,'' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through June 7. In 1937 the Nazis seized a large collection of Expressionist works from the Kronprinzen Palace in Berlin, Germany's first museum of contemporary art. But this branch of Berlin's Nationalgalerie has made great strides in restoring what was the heart of its collection. This show of 40 works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Otto Dix, Hannah Hoch, Paula Modersohn-Becker and others touches on the history of German modern art -- Expressionism, Dadaism, Neue Sachlichkeit -- from around 1910 through the post-World War I period. Its title is drawn from the early preference of the Expressionists for rural places versus their later attraction to the city. One of the show's great ''Metropolis'' paintings is Kirchner's large ''Potsdamer Platz'' (1914); in the ''Arcadia'' mode is Modersohn-Becker's ''Kneeling Mother With Child'' (1907). Satirical thrusts at the failures of the Weimar Republic by Hoch, Dix and Grosz are also standouts. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7 for students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

* ''BOCCIONI'S MATERIA: A FUTURIST MASTERPIECE AND THE AVANT-GARDE IN MILAN AND PARIS,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through May 9. The Italian Futurist Umberto Boccioni's view of his mother as she sat before her apartment window was far from conventional. Her broken-up face is done in a distinctly Cubist style, her enormous folded hands are given frontal prominence, and the Futurist concept of simultaneity makes street activity almost part of her personage. The painting ''Materia'' is the centerpiece of this ambitious show, which studies Boccioni's work in relation to that of some European contemporaries, among them Braque, Delaunay, Duchamp, Gris and Picasso. The indebtedness of Italian Futurism to French Cubism and their rivalries are also addressed. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., Fridays until 8 p.m. Admission: $15; students and 65+, $10 (Glueck).

* ''BYZANTIUM: FAITH AND POWER (1261-1557),'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through July 4. This vast and humblingly beautiful show about the waning centuries of the Byzantine empire reminds us that political decay does does not necessarily mean artistic decline. Full of amazing exotica -- manuscripts, miniature mosaics, textiles, drawings, paintings -- the exhibition ends with a room of great Northern Renaissance art indebted to icons that proves Byzantium's continued reach. People who are not Eastern Orthodox believers can enjoy the earthly pleasures of aesthetic spectacle linked with historical enlightenment. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Michael Kimmelman).

''CHRISTO AND JEANNE-CLAUDE: THE GATES, CENTRAL PARK, NEW YORK,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through July 25. At last ''The Gates,'' the long-plotted Christo-fest in Central Park, is about to be realized: in February 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels, each suspended from a free-standing 16-foot-high framework, will be installed for 16 days on 23 miles of park walkways. The project, 25 years in the making, is saluted in this preview installation of Christo's drawings, collages, photographs, maps, diagrams and samplings of the actual ingredients, like poles, panels, bolts, supports and self-locking nuts. Like everything else the collaborative team of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, his wife, does, this documentation is as yawningly thoroughgoing as a space exploration log, sparing the viewer no detail. But for anyone who wants a pre-game fill-in, this show is indispensable. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

* ''FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,'' National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, (212) 514-3700, through October 2005. That Native American art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker collection. Masks, baskets, pots, clothing, baby carriers, painted hides, drawings and other treasures are displayed here not as ethnological artifacts, but as objects of art. The works are as beautiful as any you are likely to find in a private holding. The show affirms the distance achieved in allotting Native American art a worthy aesthetic place in world culture. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free (Glueck).

* ''GUSTAV KLUTSIS AND VALENTINA KULAGINA: PHOTOGRAPHY AND MONTAGE AFTER CONSTRUCTIVISM'' AND ''WAR IN IRAQ: THE COORDINATES OF CONFLICT, PHOTOGRAPHS BY VII,'' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through May 30. Provocatively buttressed by two smaller shows, these imposing exhibitions dovetail into a chillingly informative examination of the roles of photography in art, history and science. The political, the personal and the formal alternate energetically in the first exhibition in this country devoted to Klutsis and Kulagina, who were married, and is primarily the tale of an artist whose striking photomontage posters helped establish the graphic look of the young Soviet Union, until Stalin had him assassinated. ''War in Iraq'' makes manifest the kinds of events that swirled around but rarely registered within the work of Klutsis or Kulagina. Starting with the ruins at ground zero, 53 images by nine intrepid photojournalists associated with the agency VII record the havoc that war, violence, dictatorial regimes and fanatical faith have wrought in our own time. Whether riveting, shocking, seductive or merely banal, few can resolve the question raised by even the most seemingly straightforward photograph: does it bring us closer to reality or does it distance us from a reality that is already constructed largely of photographs? Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7 (Roberta Smith).

* ''MOMA AT EL MUSEO: LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART,'' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, through July 25. The first broad-scale exposure of the Modern's extensive holdings from Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America, the 150 or so objects here are a small selection from the more than 2,000 it owns. But they form an arresting show, from the powerful Surrealist-
influenced ''Jungle'' (1943) by the Cuban artist Wifredo Lam to an untitled 1995 sculpture by the Colombian Doris Salcedo that invokes the political violence in her country. The sardonic humor of Marisol (Venezuela) and Fernando Botero (Colombia); the geometric tweakings of Jesus Rafael Soto and Gertrude Goldschmidt (Venezuela); the Conceptual hatchings of Felix Gonzalez-Torres (Cuba) and Cildo Meireles (Brazil), among others, remind us of the artistic richness south of the border. This show joins the strength of the Modern's resources with the growing importance of El Museo as a showcase of Latino culture. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $7; students and 65+, $5 (Glueck).

''OPEN HOUSE: WORKING IN BROOKLYN,'' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Aug. 15. This all-Brooklyn show of new art has been timed to coincide with the inauguration of the museum's new front entrance pavilion and public plaza. With 300 pieces installed in the fourth- and fifth-floor galleries, and spilling over into the permanent collection galleries, it's a very crowded affair. It's also all over the place in terms of media, styles and themes, not to mention quality; the good, the bad and the iffy mingle. Still, there's plenty of good work by artists you know and by some you don't, drawn from across a borough that has many different art worlds. Also on view, though not part of the show, is Alexis Rockman's mural-size painting of Brooklyn 3,000 years in the future, submerged under water as a result of global warming. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Holland Cotter).

* ''ROTH TIME: A DIETER ROTH RETROSPECTIVE,'' Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400, and P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084, through June 7. This exhaustive, exhausting but ultimately astounding exhibition offers total immersion in the art of the German-born, Swiss-based multimedia dynamo Dieter Roth (1930-1998), who not only erased the line between art and life, but also fused them into a single insoluble entity. With nearly 400 works of painting, drawing, prints, sculpture, assemblage, collage, music, poetry, film, photography, video and sound, and using every imaginable kind of found object or material -- foodstuffs included -- the exhibition moves through 50 years of incessant, obsessive art-making with remarkable clarity. It culminates in a presentation of five enormous installation pieces at the Modern's little-sister institution, P.S. 1, that reveal a seemingly boundless universe of artistic activity and a radically new picture of an artist at work. MoMA Queens hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $8.50. P.S. 1 hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 62+, $2 (Smith).

* ''SINGULAR FORMS (SOMETIMES REPEATED): ART FROM 1951 TO THE PRESENT,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through May 19. A lavish, mostly in-house display of Minimal art and its progeny. Along with the requisite examples by standard-bearers (Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Robert Ryman) and a few by predecessors (Robert Rauschenberg, Ad Reinhardt), it features post-1960's works by a range of artists including Gerhard Richter, Charles Ray, Robert Gober, Liam Gillick, Sherrie Levine, Rachel Whiteread and Damien Hirst. Ultimately, Minimalism doesn't describe everything here. The show is a hodgepodge. But it's a stimulating hodgepodge, and it looks great in Wright's building. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

* ''WHERE GODS AND MORTALS MEET: CONTINUITY AND RENEWAL IN URHOBO ART,'' Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700, through Aug. 16. This engrossing show documents aspects of a so-called traditional African art as it existed in the recent past, and as it survives in a 21st-century world. Africa in this case means a society called the Urhobo of the Niger Delta, and the art ranges from spectacular larger than life-size figures of ancestor spirits to carvings of grotesque beasts with gaping, saber-toothed mouths, images meant to both encourage and control male aggression. Although some sculptures are now rarely produced in their original forms, they are in the paintings and prints of Bruce Onobrakpeya, a contemporary Delta-born artist of international stature, in whose art Urhobo traditions live on. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3 (Cotter)

* WHITNEY BIENNIAL, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through May 30. Easily the best biennial in a long time. The spirit is upbeat and ingratiating -- almost polite -- on the surface at least, with a utopian streak and a youth-heavy emphasis on gloss and craft. There's plenty of painting and drawing, ratifying the much-hyped trend, and multigenerational work, stressing ecstatic engagement and meticulousness. But the real story is the stress on the handmade in general, on materiality in whatever medium -- a change from the politics-heavy, slacker installations of recent years. The cross-generational dialogue is an interesting subtext. Among the younger set utopia does not mean 1960's-style radicalism; it implies something unattainable, except perhaps in a hand-me-down form, and therefore smaller and inherently poignant. Look for a few standout works from artists both younger and older, including Yayoi Kusama, Alec Soth, Catherine Opie, Julie Mehretu, Jim Hodges, Eve Sussman, Raymond Pettibon, Slater Bradley, Robert Mangold and Stan Brakhage, who died last year. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50 (Kimmelman).

Galleries: Uptown

BRICE BROWN AND DON JOINT, ''A Marriage in Paint,'' Naumann, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 472-6800, through May 22. Painters who share a life as well as a studio, Mr. Brown and Mr. Joint nevertheless have distinctly disparate abstract styles. Mr. Joint's is one of exuberant high-key color laid down in hard-edge geometric and biomorphic shapes; Mr. Brown's looser brushwork and softer palette relates more to Abstract Expressionism. But subtle similarities might be discerned and the two have painted a collaborative canvas that comes off. Soft shapes and hard ones form a pleasant melding; wayward linear trackings play off precisely formed edges. The colors get along. But each is a persuasive painter in his own right (Glueck).

* JEFF KOONS, ''Highlights of 25 Years,'' C&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, through June 5. This excellent 27-piece survey touches on all phases of Mr. Koons's career, including greatest hits like the basketballs mysteriously hovering in aquariums; the Mylar ''Rabbit'' balloon cast in shiny stainless steel; and the sexy blonde embracing the Pink Panther in glazed ceramic. The climax of the show is the 10-foot-tall ''Balloon Dog.'' Made of stainless steel and coated in coppery translucent orange, it is a breathtaking symbol of the inflationary euphoria and anxiety of our times (Ken Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

''ANIMALS AND US,'' Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 245-6734, through May 22. This menagerie of an exhibition offers many different species of animals viewed through many stylistic lenses. It includes Sue Coe's expressionistic anticruelty cartoons; William Wegman's comic photographic dog portraits; Frank Noelker's photographs of live animals in zoos; Hiroshi Sugimoto's eerie photographs of simulated animals in museum dioramas; and Rona Pondick's surrealist stainless steel dog, which has a human head and hands cast from life with a smooth and shiny canine body (Johnson).

* LES KRIMS, ''Fact or Fiction,'' Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-3930, through May 15. In the 1970's, feminists hated Mr. Krims's staged pictures of naked women in absurd and humiliating situations. Today, these small prints from the late 1960's and early 70's are striking for their psychological urgency and mold-breaking inventiveness. His famous picture of a screaming legless man on a small table in a windowed alcove remains an image of frightening intensity. His mother seated naked in her dimly lighted living room is an image of heartbreaking vulnerability (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

JOE ANDOE, Feigen, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 929-0500, through May 15. Mr. Andoe's ghostly monochromatic paintings of pretty, erotically alluring young women and boxy 1960's-vintage cars rolling through barren, nocturnal landscapes are about memories of teenage years devoted to drinking, drugs and reckless driving on the outskirts of Tulsa, Okla. They exude the nostalgic romance of a Bruce Springsteen song (Johnson).

NIGEL COOKE, Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000, through May 15. This young British painter's landscapes combine Magic Realism, postapocalyptic fantasy and extreme shifts of scale. Along the bottom edges of canvases that measuring up to 6 by 12 feet, Mr. Cooke paints scruffy landscapes of dirt, weeds, and rubble in miniaturistic detail. Above, immense walls rise with passages of graffiti here and there. Looking closely you discover that tiny human heads, separated from their bodies, are unaccountably scattered about the ground (Johnson).

CHRISTA DONNER, Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, through May 8. This young Chicago artist makes surreal narrative paintings on paper, cutting out and pasting together generic comic-book style images of women in colors alternately muted and acidic. Why they are connected to one another by arteries or intestinal tubing, and why the prevailing mood is one of agitated, gothic melodrama with hints of a baleful supernaturalism, remain unexplained. But something promising is brewing in Ms. Donner's world (Johnson).

''PAPER CHASE,'' Axel Raben, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 647-9064, through May 8. This entertaining show of things made of paper, organized by Renee Riccardo, includes Jon Rosenbaum's miniature, intricately detailed fantasy constructions; Charlene Liu's delicately visionary landscapes of cut paper and watercolor; Molly Smith's wryly simplified sculptures of a waterfall and a big blue drip leaking from a hole in the wall; Doug Morris's intensely patterned symmetrical reliefs; and Koji Shimizu's toylike, papier-mache sculptures of industrial vehicles (Johnson).

ANDRE PRETORIUS, ''A Year in the Life,'' ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088, through May 8. Mr. Pretorius's comical, vividly illustrative paintings depict allegorically suggestive scenes. ''Active, Passive, Neuter'' shows three pajama-clad children in a bright modern living room -- a boy with his pants down, another with a raised switch and an amused girl watching. In ''Fear of a Second Child,'' a perplexed woman contemplates a farmer in the company of a child-size extraterrestrial and a metrosexual with a diapered chimpanzee (Johnson).

''REVISITING HISTORY: SELF-PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY,'' Cristinerose/Josee Bienvenu, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-0297, through May 15. This show of postmodernist, photographic self-portraiture includes Yasumasa Mormura in drag, in big parodies of Pre-Raphaelite paintings; giant-size prints of Orlan as a Baroque Virgin in white robes with one breast exposed; Kimiko Yoshida in blackface wearing an American Indian headdress and as a white-faced nun; Janieta Eyre wearing Edwardian costumes in surreal pictures of herself and her imaginary twin; and John O'Reilly's naked body as an element in small Cubist montages (Johnson).

ERIK SCHMIDT/NEAL ROCK, Henry Urbach, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-0974, through May 15. Mr. Schmidt, a Berlin painter, depicts corporate sterility in high-contrast, photo-derived images of spectral businessmen and office buildings. Crusty painterly surfaces call to mind stale cake frosting. The London-based Mr. Rock created ''Work From the Polari Range,'' an installation of sculptural reliefs, by squeezing colored silicone out of pastry bags. Suggesting reeflike accumulations of tropical submarine creatures, they are grotesque, seductive and comical (Johnson).

* WILLIAM SCOTT, Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through June 5. Pots, dishes, fruits, vases and other domestic shapes form the basis for much of this Scottish-born painter's imagery, magically reduced to lyrical, luminous ghosts of themselves. Scott, a figure of some importance in post-World War II British art, was well known in New York, too. This small but engrossing show progresses from 1954 to 1977, and in his spare, sensual paintings shape, space and color play beautifully together (Glueck).

Galleries: Downtown

GIDEON BOK, Plane Space, 102 Charles Street, Greenwich Village, (917) 606-1268, through May 9. In heavily worked paintings of his studio and living space, Mr. Bok captures temporal as well as visual experience. When objects or people move, he adds their new positions to the developing picture; the parts that stay still are finished, the things that move have a ghostly transparency. Combining scratchy lines, resinous glazes and troweled-on impasto, he produces a flickering, cluttered vision of bohemian transience (Johnson).

FORD CRULL, ''Horror Vacui,'' Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay Street, TriBeCa, (212) 925-9424, through May 15. Mr. Crull produces layered, richly colored and textured paintings in which passages of brushy smearing and linear scrawling emphasize the surface, while blended areas create spaces of illusory luminosity. Heraldic, alphabetic, geometric, numerological and other kinds of mystically suggestive symbols are woven into the painterly fabric (Johnson).

* ''INDIGESTIBLE CORRECTNESS,'' Participant, 95 Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 254-4334, through May 9, and Kenny Schachter/ROVE, 132 Perry Street, West Village, (212) 807-6669, through May 5. The Participant half of this two-part show is excellent. With sculptures by Louise Bourgeois and Richard Prince, one of Lutz Bacher's great Vargas paintings, a gender-blending collage by the artist-team Breyer P-Orridge, and metal shoes by the couturier Imitation of Christ, it's fervid, twisty, demimondaine tangle of fashion, pornography and youth culture. Part II, at ROVE, is spread out over a much larger space, which reduces the tension considerably. Still, with a circa 1940 painting by Francis Picabia and an altar by the artist Kembra Pfahler devoted entirely to her charismatic self, it's not half bad (Cotter).

* ''OCEAN FLOWERS: IMPRESSIONS FROM NATURE,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through May 22. Dense with ethereal images and silhouettes of seaweed, this unusual exhibition shows how the needs of Victorian botanists, book publishers and inspired amateurs pushed traditional drawing and printmaking into the realm of photography without so much as touching a lens. The driving force was the need to get the wonders of nature down on paper, one way or another. Those ways run riot here and provide a startlingly revised view of the mongrel hands-on origins of the age of mechanical reproduction (Smith).

''TACTICAL ACTION,'' Gigantic Artspace, 59 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-6762, through June 10. This lively but crowded and unfocused exhibition is designed to promote leftish dissidence. Highlights include scenes of the war in Iraq, drawn on location by Steve Mumford; clever anticorporate lenticular photographs by David Byrne and Danielle Spencer; David Krippendorff's noirish video about the eroticism of hate; Michele Pred's American flag sculpture, made from pen knives confiscated at airports; and a mock prison visitors' booth, with a soundtrack about teenage gang violence, by Dread Scott (Johnson).

Other Galleries

''THE DEVONSHIRE INHERITANCE: FIVE CENTURIES OF COLLECTING AT CHATSWORTH,'' Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, through June 20. The stately English country home Chatsworth has been occupied since its construction in 1552 by the Cavendish family, headed by a long succession of dukes and duchesses of Devonshire. They have enriched it with notable collections of fine and decorative arts, an awesome library of books and manuscripts, scientific instruments, silver, furniture and needlework. A glimpse of these treasures is provided by this show, which has works by Rembrandt, Raphael, Titian, Durer and Lucian Freud; books and drawings by Andrea Palladio; a spectacular jewelry ensemble worn at the coronation of Czar Alexander II and much else to light up the eyes of the most jaded connoisseur. The next step is a visit to Chatsworth itself, still a private home for the Cavendishes but very much open to the public (Glueck).

Last Chance

RALSTON CRAWFORD, Salander-O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606, through tomorrow. Crawford, an American Modernist, painted in a stylistic range bounded by George Ault's reductivist Precisionism and Stuart Davis's jaunty, planar Cubism. This selection of paintings and photographs dating from the late 1930's to the late 70's reveals how he drew on the abstraction in his photographs of urban and industrial subjects for the composition of his hard-edged, nonrepresentational paintings (Johnson).

JIM DINE, PaceWildenstein (through tomorrow) and Pace/MacGill (through next Saturday), 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292. New works by Mr. Dine include a series of medium-large paintings, each of which has a valentine heart image imbedded in an all-over field of Abstract Expressionist brushwork; a freestanding folding screen with tools, Venus de Milo reproductions and molten metal puddles attached to a steel framework, randomly spray-painted in saturated colors; and a series of big, grainy photographic views of the artist's messy studio, which make it seem like a place of scary mystery (Johnson).

* CHRISTIAN JANKOWSKI, ''Now Playing,'' Maccarone, 45 Canal Street, near Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 431-4977, through Sunday. Spread throughout a small building, in contrasting viewing situations, the three film and video pieces in this inspired show include a Felliniesque film of people encountered on a street in Rome; a series of mysterious exit interviews with New York moviegoers; and outtakes from another director's film into which Mr. Jankowski has inserted his own script. The artist himself doesn't seem to do much of anything, but he has created something memorable: a cerebral, transparent, emotionally touching experience of the ways films flow out of and back into life (Smith).

CY TWOMBLY AND JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT, Briggs Robinson, 527 West 29th Street, Chelsea,(212) 560-9075, through tomorrow. Showing these works on paper together is a natural idea given Mr. Twombly's influence on Basquiat, and the differences are as interesting as the similarities. With a mix of irony and nostalgia, Mr. Twombly's scribbly improvisations romance the cults of antique humanism and modern primitivism. Basquiat's blocky diagrammatic organizations of found words and pictographic images suggest the comic pseudo-rationalism of an inspired but mentally unbalanced street poet (Johnson).

''JOHN WATERS: CHANGE OF LIFE,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222, through Sunday. In the mid-1990's the filmmaker John Waters, of ''Pink Flamingos'' notoriety and ''Hairspray'' fame, started making collages of stills from films of the past, including his own. Some collages reduce entire movies to a few images; others are devoted to themes like childbirth, cosmetic surgery and cinematic violence. Dozens of them make up the bulk of this survey; while ingenious and funny, they're a bit light to carry a show. But they are supplemented by a continuous showing of three Waters films -- the first made in 1964 when he was in high school -- that are worth the price of admission. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m., Thursdays until 8 p.m. Admission: $6; students, artists and 65+, $3 (Cotter).

HEADLINE: Building a Novel With Austen's Help

BYLINE: By RICHARD EDER

 BODY:

THE JANE AUSTEN BOOK CLUB
By Karen Joy Fowler
288 pages. G. P. Putnam's Sons. $23.95.
 As Falstaff was not only witty in himself but the cause that there was wit in others, the silvery percipience of Jane Austen causes other writers to shine responding to it.
 Sir Walter Scott, romantic and clangorously popular: ''The Big Bow-wow strain I can do myself like any now going'' but not ''the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting.'' G. K. Chesterton defending Austen's sheltered life and small palette: ''Jane Austen may have been protected from truth: but it was precious little of truth that was protected from her.''
 Best and most daring, Virginia Woolf in a link to Shakespeare: ''The minds of both had consumed all impediments; and for that reason we do not know Jane Austen and we do not know Shakespeare, and for that reason Jane Austen pervades every word she wrote, and so does Shakespeare.''
 Such quotations (and cavils from the dislikes of Mark Twain, Henry James and Joseph Conrad) cluster ingeniously in an afterword to ''The Jane Austen Book Club'' by Karen Joy Fowler. Ms. Fowler, an original and unexpectedly voiced novelist (''Sarah Canary,'' ''The Sweetheart Season''), takes her own place among the shining responders. Not just with comments of her own, though there are some excellent ones, but with the entire playful structure of her new novel.
 Five women and one man meet monthly to discuss each of the six works in the Austen canon. We get bits and pieces of their thoughts, some pertinent, others seemingly distracted or eccentric. Only seemingly. Ms. Fowler plainly believes that there is very little, however far from the point, that does not lodge somewhere within Jane Austen's particularly capacious point.
 The thoughts are more than literary discussion. They bring out the characters and emotions of the participants along with the tensions and sympathies that flit and filter among them. Ms. Fowler has the genial notion to see in the book club -- that newish American cultural phenomenon -- a society resembling nothing so much as one of those sets of country gentry among which Austen constructed a social comedy where irony stiffens sentiment, and pain is a cool afterthought.
 ''Each of us has a private Austen,'' the book begins. The ''we'' recurs here and there. It is the author, perhaps, or an unspoken book club consensus; and in any event a distancing, dispensing voice used the way Austen used it herself.
 Mostly though, the characters speak for themselves. Jocelyn, first of all, who organized the club: ''It was essential to reintroduce Austen into your life regularly, Jocelyn said, let her look around.'' Indeed, it is through Austen-like glances, dry-eyed and amused, that the stormier aspects of the book-clubbers are revealed and restrained.
 Holding at bay memories of parental abandonment and young sexual abuse, the unmarried Jocelyn is upbeat, controlling and generous. She'd organized the book club partly to cheer up her childhood friend, the melancholy Sylvia, whose husband of 32 years had just asked for a divorce. She vetoes a proposal to choose ''Pride and Prejudice'' for the first book.
 ''Jocelyn would not subject Sylvia, the news so recent and tender, to the dishy Mr. Darcy.'' They will begin with ''Emma'' instead, ''because no one has ever read it and wished to be married.''
 Allegra, Sylvia's daughter, is fiery and self-centered; addicted to dangerous sports like sky-diving, and flaunting wounds from her lesbian lover, a writer who had listened to her stories, written them up as her own, submitted them to magazines and -- worse -- had them rejected. (Helpfully, Ms. Fowler submits Austen's history of publisher rejections.) ''Stripped and then strip-mined,'' Allegra laments. Her Austen is very dark and deals with the economic oppression of women.
 Bernadette's is Austen as comic genius. From a hard, wild life, she has aged into calm, sustained by talking amiably, aimlessly and interminably. ''Nothing disturbed her peace less than the sound of her own voice.''
 There is Prudie, who struggles to hold herself away from breakdown and memories of a terrible mother. (Ms. Fowler portrays mental abuse surreal in its quietly inventive horror.) She shelters in prissy self-control, in her own Austen -- changeable and dead of Addison's disease at 41 -- and in her job teaching high school French. Her mannered Gallicisms irritate the others. ''If only she would stop speaking French,'' Jocelyn thinks. ''Or go to France, where it would be less noticeable.''
 The obvious irritant is Grigg, whose presence initially raises all kinds of feminine/feminist hackles along with a tremor or two. Instead of bringing a well-thumbed individual volume to each session, he arms himself with a brand-new complete set. (''Why did men always have to have the biggest books?'' Prudie grouses.) His eyelashes are lovely, but his first suggestions are snubbed, particularly when he ventures that today Austen would be writing television serials. ''What a waste those eyelashes were on a man who watched sitcoms,'' Sylvia reflects. 
 He is polite, and clearly sensitive, though, and bit by bit his intelligence and eagerness to learn win out. Even then there is wariness, and when he cites the dashing Darcy to complain that women go for heels, we read Jocelyn's devastating thoughts.
 She ''knew a lot of men who believed this. Women don't want nice men, they cry out over beers, to any woman nice enough to listen. They condemn themselves loudly, lamenting their uncontrollable, damnable niceness. In fact, when you got to know these men better, lots of them weren't as nice as they believed themselves to be.''
 If Grigg begins as a sand grain, Ms. Fowler gradually allows him the status of a pearl, one particularly valuable to Jocelyn. Like Austen, the author fashions her frayed and fractious strands into bows at the end; not to compel our belief but detachedly to adorn it.
 In Ms. Fowler's wit, the way she renders the pratfalls of emotion and desire, and the deceptively mild temperature of her splintering detonations, she comes closest to her model. She is weaker with plot: some of the club members' own stories drag or else seem feverishly forced.
 Austen, of course, was an assured storyteller. However sharply and coolly she treats her characters, we need to know what will happen to them. We follow the ''Book Club'' members for all the pungent delight they give us, but not so much for where they lead us.

HEADLINE: On Gay Circuit, The Party Never Ends

BYLINE: By JANELLE BROWN

 BODY:
IT was one in the morning on Easter Sunday. Inside the Palm Springs, Calif., convention center, which had been transformed into an elfish forest, with chiffon drapery and cherry blossoms, 4,500 men dressed -- partially at least -- in white were dancing to ear-shattering techno. Suddenly, the D.J. stopped the music, and the curtain on the stage rose to reveal a symphony orchestra playing a dance version of Annie Lennox's ''Into the West'' from ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.'' A silver-painted drag queen in a 20-foot headdress lip-synched the song from a dais while a small troupe of modern ballet dancers pirouetted onstage.
 When the song ended, the ceiling exploded with silver confetti. Watching the spectacle, Gary Steinberg beamed. ''It makes me proud to be a gay man,'' he said.
 Mr. Steinberg; his boyfriend, Steve Ceplenski; 10 of their friends; and nearly 20,000 other gay men had converged on Palm Springs for the 15th annual White Party. Each April this resort town erupts in a weekend of round-the-clock revelry: pool parties, carnivals, dance extravaganzas, elaborate performances and after-hours celebrations. Palm Canyon Drive, the town's main street, is suddenly populated by gay men (and a sprinkling of their female friends) walking shirtless, hand in hand. All day and night the sound of techno echoes. 
 In the gay community, the White Party is what is known as a ''circuit party,'' and it is just one of a hundred such events that take place around the country (and hundreds more around the globe) all year-round, including the Cherry 9 in Washington this weekend. There is also the Black Party in New York, the Black & Blue Festival in Montreal, Mardi Gras in Sydney, the White Party and the Winter Party in Miami, the Fireball in Chicago or Gay Days in Orlando. You can dance all night at gay ski weeks, gay river-rafting trips and aboard ships on gay cruises. Weekend after weekend, gay men fly around the world to dance, dress in costume and get as little sleep as possible.
 Everywhere you look at these events there are men, men and more men. As Rudy Coblentz, a 32-year-old film accountant, said: ''When I told my mother I was gay, she said, 'It's a very lonely life.' If she only knew, she'd be floored.''
 To outsiders -- and some attendees -- circuit parties are all about drugs, sex and spectacle. To the travel industry, they represent a profit-making opportunity.. But for many circuit party aficionados, the weekend celebrations are essentially a year-round extension of the Gay Pride Parade.
 ''The truth is, many gay men growing up felt separate and different,'' said Kelly Woodruff, a New York interior designer, as he took in the scene at the White Party. ''Here, we have created an environment that's all about ourselves. It's important for our gay identity to know that we're part of a community that knows how to have fun.''
 Circuit parties were born in the 1980's when the Saint, a New York nightclub, began giving ''White'' and ''Black'' costume balls, drawing gay men from around the country. By the time the Saint closed in 1988 (although Saint-at-Large parties persist in New York), several competitors had sprung up, including a White Party in Miami. Although the parties were initially run by nightclubs or nonprofit health organizations, professional promoters saw an opportunity to turn them into money-making all-weekend events. Gay men began referring to the far-flung events as ''the circuit,'' after circuit-training routines at gyms.
 ''This is my fifth circuit party in a row,'' said David Noe, 49, who lives in Portland, Ore. ''I just got back from Australian Carnivale. It's just an incredible scene.''
 The circuit party scene is also enormous, and -- though organizers decline to disclose actual figures -- enormously profitable. While many of the upstart and less exotic events (say, parties in Long Beach, Calif., or Birmingham, Ala.) cater to smaller local crowds, the marquee events -- the White Parties, the Black & Blue Festival and the Winter Party -- concoct ever-more-elaborate decors and entertainments, and draw tens of thousands of partygoers. The top events have performances by the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Boy George or Cirque du Soleil; plus well-known ''circuit D.J.'s'' like Tony Moran, Kimberly S, Brett Henrichson, Susan Morabito and Junior Vasquez. Jeffrey Sanker, the promoter of the White Party in Palm Springs, said that he spends between $1 million and $1.5 million on decoration, facilities and D.J.'s each year.
 Despite their sometimes outre clientele, circuit parties have corporate sponsors (like Finlandia Vodka and Bacardi, sponsors of this year's White Party in Palm Springs) and are welcomed by communities eager for tourist dollars. Still, Mr. Sanker said, he has encountered protesters opposed to the parties in Pensacola, where he also promotes one. And he said that even in Palm Springs he struggled with some local opponents who wanted to evict the White Party -- until last year, when Ron Oden was elected the town's first openly gay mayor. ''It's taken years to be accepted,'' Mr. Sanker said.
 Money eventually opens doors, promoters say. ''Cities that have been against us change their mind when they look at the financial dollars -- the Black & Blue Festival brings in $12 million in just hotels alone,'' said Mr. Ceplenski, an executive consultant who, with Mr. Steinberg, publishes the magazine Circuit Noize. ''In this economy, you just can't say no.''
 Certainly, that's been the case in Palm Springs; this year's White Party added $4 million to the city's revenues, from hotel and sales taxes, according to Ginny Foat, a city council member. ''It's one of our highest generating revenue events,'' she said. ''We love the White Party.''
 Tickets to the White Party cost up to $450, not including airfare or hotels (and rooms at the Palm Springs Wyndham, where most of the activities take place every year, start around $200 a night during the event). As a result, the majority of the attendees are affluent professionals in their 30's and 40's, some of whom attend up to a half-dozen events a year. ''Circuit parties are the ultimate expression of gay men having the disposable time and cash to travel,'' said Ed Salvato, editor of Out and About, a gay travel magazine. 
 Mr. Steinberg, for example, is a 48-year-old real estate agent from Los Angeles; in the last year, he and Mr. Ceplenski have attended five circuit parties, including Carnival in Rio. ''The dance floor is like a big battery; we all come here to recharge,'' he said. ''I love running into my friends from all over the world. It's like a reunion.''
 This year's White Party was no exception. On that Saturday morning at 6, while many attendees were still dancing, Mr. Steinberg, Mr. Ceplenski and a group of friends took a balloon ride over the Coachella Valley. As they drifted over the date palm trees and mansions, they raised Champagne glasses to toast Mr. Steinberg's birthday; the one-year anniversary of Mr. Woodruff and his boyfriend, Jim Sanak, who had met on the dance floor at the previous White Party; and the 15th anniversary of another couple. At least half of the friends had met through the circuit party scene.
 The group said that drugs -- always a controversial part of the circuit life -- were not part of their routine. Champagne was the only intoxicant the men touched all weekend, despite dancing until the pink hours of the morning. Not everyone exhibits such self-control. In the 90's, the circuit party scene was fueled by Ecstasy, much as the rest of the club scene was. Now it's GHB and methamphetamine, better known as crystal meth or tina. Not only does crystal meth give revelers the stamina to stay up for three days without a nap, it can also enable marathon -- and often unprotected -- sex sessions. (Many gay men's health organizations have stopped sponsoring circuit parties for fear of appearing to endorse drug use.)
 The notorious Black Party in New York, for example, draws a leather-wearing S-and-M crowd, and sex in bathrooms and on dance floors is not uncommon. The party -- this year's was in March -- can be a ''dirty and trashy'' scene, said a regular attendee who did not want his name used. ''The drug of choice,'' he said, ''is crystal meth, maybe GHB to take the edge off it, which makes you very, very horny.''
 Other circuit parties are far tamer. At the White Party, although local AIDS nonprofit organizations dispensed mountains of condoms, the only visible sexual shenanigans consisted of heavy petting on the dance floor. Jeffrey Sanker suggested that drug use seems to be on the wane: Alcohol sales were up 25 percent over last year, while the number of drug hospitalizations and arrests dropped to zero. Volunteer doctors in red tank tops roamed the dance floor, watching out for anyone who might be in need of help.
 While drugs may not have been in evidence, plenty of flesh was. When the men step on the dance floor, shirts -- and, occasionally, pants -- vanish. ''Circuit parties are just an excuse for guys to check out the latest in men's underwear,'' said Scott Larson, who manages a sports medicine center in Los Angeles. At the pool parties Easter weekend, men in diminutive swimwear with shaved chests and impeccable abs greeted each other with hugs and kisses and danced with their arms around one another's waists.
 ''We've waited our whole lives to be here,'' said John, 35, a high school principal from Nevada who asked that his last name not be used. ''Twenty-five years ago, if you came out in Nevada, you got killed.'' He was with his boyfriend, Dan, who had previously been married for 17 years and who also asked that his last name not be used. Even though they say they have found acceptance in their community -- Dan says he speaks to his former wife every day, and John's nephew and Dan's son live with them -- they say they aren't comfortable going out at home. ''We decided that with our jobs and careers, it's more important to get outside our community to have fun,'' John said. The circuit parties, he said, are ''liberating.''
 This liberation was in full effect on Easter Sunday at the annual Tea Dance. Seven thousand men converged at an empty field in the center of town for the biggest event of the weekend, an evening dance party. This year's theme was Carnival, with a Ferris wheel, stilt-walkers and feather-clad samba dancers. Sweaty bodies heaved as the sun set.
 At 8:30 p.m., a fireworks display exploded over the cheering crowd. Sergio Finetto, a Brazilian-born textile importer, looked around him and smiled. ''This is like home,'' he said. ''I couldn't be happier. Every year I come on Sunday and remember why I work so hard all year to come back.''

IF YOU GO
A Whirl of Parties, Montreal to Miami

CIRCUIT parties are notoriously hard to define. Many gay men say, as Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said of pornography in 1964, ''I know it when I see it.'' And there are hundreds of promoters around the country trying to cash in by calling their upstart events ''circuit parties.'' Still, most circuit parties follow a certain template.
 Whether in a club, on a cruise ship or a beach, around a hotel pool or at Disney World, it is a several-day, several-location spectacular, with lights, big-name D.J.'s, decorations and performances. Themes are mandatory. Many parties are tied to holidays, like Mardi Gras.
 Some promoters complain that competition from new events is hurting business. ''Party attendance is down 20 to 30 percent since 2000,'' said Steve Ceplenski, editor of the magazine Circuit Noize. ''You start wondering what's the difference between all these events.''
 Here are some of the most prominent parties scheduled for the next six months. JANELLE BROWN

HEADLINE: . . . And Bulldozing It

BYLINE: By STEVE DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKLIN, Tenn. 

 BODY:
''IT was a horrendous scene, so many brave boys,'' Thomas Cartwright said haltingly as he stood on the porch of the Carter House. The two-story brick building was at the center of a battle here that was among the bloodiest of the Civil War. Mr. Cartwright, executive director and resident historian of the Carter House Museum, spoke in a voice tight with emotion about the 8,000 soldiers, Union and Confederate, who had died within a span of five hours on Nov. 30, 1864, in a battle that rivaled Pickett's Charge in terms of carnage.
 Many of them were killed within a radius of a few hundred yards from where Mr. Cartwright stood, on land that has long since been paved over and developed for commercial use. ''Those boys consecrated this ground with their blood,'' he said. ''And on that ground we build Pizza Huts and parking lots.'' 
 As the 140th anniversary of the battle approaches, Mr. Cartwright is among a small but active group of residents in Franklin, an affluent bedroom community some 20 miles south of Nashville, that has joined with far-flung preservationists to try to save what is still left of the site. And like the cause for which the South fought, the effort to save the battleground from the bulldozers long appeared futile. Last year, the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission, created by Congress in 1990 to identify battlefields threatened by residential and commercial development, gave Franklin its lowest ranking -- Priority 4.
 Because so much of the battlefield was already lost, saving it looked like a hopeless cause, said Jim Campi, spokesman for the Civil War Preservation Trust, an affiliated organization based in Washington. The trust, following the advisory commission's decision, added Franklin to its list of the 10 most endangered Civil War sites, which also included Chancellorsville, Va.; New Bern, N.C.; and Mansfield, La., where housing subdivisions, strip malls and fast-food spots now stand on former battlegrounds.
 To preservationists like Mr. Cartwright, who tells tour groups that acres of Civil War battlefields are being destroyed nationwide by developers each day, the situation is desperate. ''Here in Franklin,'' he said, ''we have the equivalent of a Wendy's at Shiloh or a KFC at Devil's Den in Gettysburg; we're paving over battlefields just as haunted and hallowed as those places.''
 It has been a struggle for preservationists since the turn of the last century, when Congress rejected repeated requests to appropriate money to preserve the battlefield as a national military park, as was done at paces like Gettysburg and Antietam. ''It was such a horrific battle, maybe they simply didn't want to be reminded,'' Joe Smyth, president of Save the Franklin Battlefield, said of the lack of a local grass-roots campaign to preserve the battlefield. ''They spent the rest of their lives trying to forget the carnage.''
 Mr. Smyth, a native of Maine who moved to Franklin in 1981 and who plays drums for the country rock band Sawyer Brown, said the fields and pastures and front yards where so many had died were sold off in chunks as the town of 2,500 grew to a city of nearly 46,000 by 2002. Only scattered sites were preserved, including a nine-acre overlook on Winstead Hill, where Gen. John Bell Hood watched his army attack Union forces dug in two miles north. ''The field was lost in parcels, bit by bit,'' Mr. Smyth said. ''If we're ever going to succeed in putting it together again, it will be bit by bit.''
 ''THE fighting was vicious at times,'' Victor Andrews said. But Mr. Andrews, a real estate appraiser, was talking not about the battle fought in 1864 but about the more recent confrontations among local business interests and those who he said wanted ''no new development at all.'' The skirmishes -- won by developers -- centered around new construction projects on Columbia Pike, the north-south thoroughfare along which Confederate troops charged to their deaths.
 Now lined by strip malls, car washes, auto repair shops, fast-food stores, nondescript warehouses and a ribbon factory, Columbia Pike bisects the western portion of the battlefield. Near the crest of a rise where a deep trench and earthworks protected the center of the Union lines, the pike now intersects Cleburne Street, where the fighting ''was brutal and at such close quarters, the dead were left standing, with no room to fall,'' Mr. Cartwright said.
 Today, the same ground is occupied by pizza shops and parking lots; a cluster of simple signposts identify the spots where five Confederate generals died -- including Patrick Cleburne, for whom the street is named, and a commander with the telling name of States Rights Gist.
 ''We're dumb not to preserve our heritage,'' said Mr. Andrews, a fifth-generation resident whose grandparents were sharecroppers on land north of town where the Cool Springs Mall and the familiar logos of Starbucks, Borders, T.G.I. Friday's and Marriott have replaced pecan trees and cotton fields. ''But we have to do it intelligently, with preservationists and developers working hand in hand.''
 Mr. Andrews points to the Cool Springs development as an example of the kind of tax-generating managed growth that Franklin and surrounding Williamson County need to prosper in the face of soaring property values and a population boom that is expected to bring 35,000 new homes within 10 years. ''No growth means no prosperity,'' he said. ''If you kill growth, you kill the goose that laid the golden egg.''
 But many preservationists see it as ''Cool Springs Sprawl,'' an example of what the community would look like if growth were to continue unchecked. ''People don't want to live in Anywhere U.S.A.,'' said Mary Pearce, president of Franklin's Heritage Foundation, a nonprofit preservation group. ''They don't want to wake up in the morning confused whether they're in Denver or Nashville. People want to move here and to visit because of those things that make Franklin unique -- its downtown historic district, its heritage and its beauty.''
 (Recently the local debate over preservation has also included Harlinsdale Farm, a place hallowed by Tennesseans not as a battleground but as the birthplace of the famed breed of Tennessee Walking horses. A $10 million bond issue has been proposed to turn the farm's 200 acres into a public park. Opponents of the bond issue have argued that some of the property should be preserved, but that a portion of it should also be developed for housing.) 
 Prominent in the the preservation camp is Robert Hicks, a Nashville music publisher and native Tennessean, who joined a migration to Franklin that now includes other transplants like the country singer Alan Jackson and the songwriter John Hiatt ''One of the reasons I moved here in 1974 was that there was still plenty of green space,'' Mr. Hicks said. ''Here was a town that respected its history; or so I thought.''
 Mr. Hicks helped raise financing to restore the Carnton Plantation house on the east edge of the battlefield. The much-scrubbed floor planks of the house are still stained with the blood of Confederate soldiers.
 ''This is not only about battlefields,'' Mr. Hicks said over breakfast at Dotson's, a popular downtown restaurant housed in two converted double-wide trailers and where the ''meat and three'' menu includes Jell-O among its long list of vegetables. ''It's about preserving the quality of life that draws people here to live.''
 It wasn't until after national groups like the Civil War Preservation Trust decided last year that the battlefield was a lost cause that Mr. Hicks scored a coup for preservationists. Heading a campaign to buy a golf club next to the plantation property where the owner planned to build 250 homes, he convinced a former president of the trust, Rod Heller, a Virginian who is a descendant of the family that owned Carnton during the Civil War, to buy the property for $5 million and hold it until Mr. Hicks's informal coalition of preservation groups could raise the money to buy it back.
 ''I'm very confident that that's going to happen,'' said Mr. Campi of the preservation trust, adding that there has been a turnaround in Franklin. ''So much of the core battlefield had been lost in the past few years that a lot of people are determined to protect what is left.''
 Mr. Campi said that there were economic factors, too, and that public officials were beginning to realize that heritage tourism can be a real boon.
 Preservationists like Mr. Hicks say they believe that what many had considered a lost cause may now actually be within reach. ''Scattered Civil War sites with a few historical markers are not enough,'' he said. ''We need a battlefield where you can walk where men fought and died. People don't want to take their families to Franklin to see a parking lot.''

HEADLINE: Pumping Air Into the Museum, So It's as Big as the World Outside

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Call it an attitude, a phase or a fad, but postmodernism did at least one good, big thing. It rained hard on the mostly white, mostly male, by-invitation-only party that had long been Western art.
 It did so by asking pushy, deflating questions about beauty, quality, authority and who really owns what. It pegged as corrupt an aesthetic hierarchy shaped by a cozy alliance of market interests and critical -- read personal -- opinion. It told reigning tastemakers: sorry, but your best thinking is old, parochial, stale. It forced inside players to either look outside their suddenly uncharmed circle or be uncool.
 To me, postmodernism primarily meant that art and the world expanded, and connected. My white, middle-class, American credentials no longer put me at the center of the picture, but over there somewhere, among the many others over there. And this was fine, since Over There turned out to be the new Here. If such repositionings made sense to you, you were unlikely to look at art, or the art world, or museums, or yourself the same way again. 
 They made sense to the artist Fred Wilson, who is the subject of a traveling survey now at the Studio Museum in Harlem, and who played a significant role in defining a fresh critical perspective on art and its institutions. Mr. Wilson was much in the news last year: he represented the United States at the 2003 Venice Biennale. But he made his first influential splash more than a decade ago with a site-specific exhibition titled ''Mining the Museum'' at the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore.
 At the museum's invitation, he sifted through three centuries' worth of artifacts, from paintings to potholders, and assembled a show. This is, of course, standard curatorial procedure, putting objects together to tell a story. And because museums tend to be conservative places, the stories are frequently soft and predictable, telling us things we basically already know and like to hear. Mr. Wilson, however, chose unusual, often unpretty things, and made them even more unusual by the way he combined them. The results were, in their undemonstrative way, eye-opening.
 In one vitrine, labeled ''Metalwork 1793-1880,'' he placed ornate silver goblets and pitchers and iron slave shackles side by side. Elsewhere, he tucked a vintage Ku Klux Klan mask into an antique baby buggy. And in an installation titled ''Cabinetmaking 1820-1960'' -- reconstituted at the Studio Museum -- he had four fancy parlor chairs attentively facing a cruciform wooden whipping post once used at a Maryland jail.
 ''Mining the Museum'' was far from the first show to engage critically, even subversively, with an institutional context. Hans Haacke had been doing such work for years, and the Center for African Art's 1988 exhibition ''Art/artifact'' offered a model from which Mr. Wilson might have learned much. But the Baltimore project, which focused on excavating and recovering a specific history, American racial history, from a specific range of existing materials, brought a bracing, investigatory spirit to contemporary art. Soon other artists started digging away. 
 Mr. Wilson had a personal stake in doing so. Born in New York City in 1954, he was the child of an African-American father and a mother of Caribbean descent. He spent part of his childhood in a predominantly white suburb and experienced racism first-hand. He also experienced art. His mother, a teacher, encouraged him to spend time in Manhattan museums, where he found both pleasure and subtle lessons in cultural exclusion.
 After art school he worked in the Metropolitan Museum's education department, traveled to Africa, and in the early 1980's accepted a curatorial post at Longwood Art Center in the Bronx. The 1980's were formative years for New York art. For the first time, artists of color -- African-American, Latino and Asian-American -- were, ever so slowly, entering a mainstream that, thanks to the postmodernist impulse known as multiculturalism, had became several streams, which at some points fed into one another.
 This trend accelerated in the 1990's. And many of the artists involved took their outsider-moving-inside identities as their subject. They made art about who they were, where they came from, how and why they had been shut out of the larger arena. Mr. Wilson, who remembers being handed dirty wineglasses at gallery openings where he was mistaken for a member of the cleanup crew, was one of these artists, though his work was not openly autobiographical.
 The earliest piece in ''Fred Wilson, Objects and Installations: 1979-2000'' is a series of photographs of archaeological sites and sculptural fragments that he shot on visits to Egypt and Peru. They are as impersonal and inexpressive as field documents, but they embody the theme of cultures ruined, appropriated and displayed that has become central to Mr. Wilson's art.
 In the West such possession and display is the business of the art museum, which serves as secular temple, trophy hall and public relations agency for the dominant cultural and political institutions of the past. Throughout the 1980's and 90's, Mr. Wilson was inventing minimuseums of his own, in the form of installations, and he gave them an additional function. They were forensic laboratories for examining the dark side of institutional power.
 In one such installation, ''Colonial Collection'' (1990), African masks, blindfolded with colonial flags, hang above a display case holding pinned tropical insects and popular prints of skirmishes fought between ''natives'' and Europeans. In another, ''Friendly Natives'' (1991), casts of human skeletons lying in vitrines are identified simply as ''Someone's grandfather,'' ''Someone's mother,'' ''Someone's sister'' and so on. The humanizing gloss is undercut, however, by the title, which implies that the only good native is a dead one.
 In Mr. Wilson's hands individual objects are subject to the same kind of scrutiny and revision as the institutions that house them. His grafting of the sculptured head of an Egyptian deity onto the body of a Greek goddess in ''Artemis/Bast'' (1992) symbolically corrects the fiction of ethnic purity imbedded in Western Classicism. And the kitsch collectibles in the form of racial stereotypes that he incorporates in several pieces suggest how loaded and dangerous artifacts can be.
 A small installation called ''Mine/Yours'' (1995) pairs an old photograph of an African-American family with a cluster of cartoon figurines of mammies, Uncle Toms and watermelon-eating children. Another piece from the same year, ''Me and It,'' includes more figurines and two videos playing simultaneously. In one Mr. Wilson assumes the poses of the ceramic sculptures, which include images of black men designed to be used as coin banks and ashtrays; in the other a woman smashes a mammy figurine to bits with a hammer, each blow resounding like a gun blast.
 While these miniinstallations are succinct, direct and effective, others are overly clever or obvious, even cute, always a risk in didactic art. Mr. Wilson is at his most persuasive, in fact, in site-specific projects like ''Mining the Museum,'' where his instinct for metaphors inherent in materials can flower. But such projects can only be summarily represented in a traveling show like this one, which has been astutely organized by the art historian Maurice Berger and the Center for Art and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
 One installation, however, created for the International Center of Photography in 1999, appears intact, and it is remarkable. It consists of 64 photographs, each covered with a sheet of matting with a single, small ''window'' cut out. We are given preliminary information that some of the hidden pictures document atrocities; others are of quite ordinary things. But all we can actually see is an inch or two of each print.
 Are we looking at a patch of checked fabric or barbed-wire fencing, a sunset sky or a bloodstain? Under conditions of restricted visibility, prosaic images can take on exaggerated, energy-sapping force, and terrible realities can remain unrevealed and uncorrected.
 In a sense this is the message conveyed by all of Mr. Wilson's conceptually pointed, technically polished, often visually arresting art. It is an extended meditation on the necessity of learning to see: to see how art and culture are shaped by social, economic and ideological power, and to see how our relationship to that power -- compliant, collusive or resistant -- can determine what our attitude toward art and culture will be.
 These concerns also sum up a postmodern perspective in a nutshell. It certainly isn't the only possible approach to art, but it is the fundamental one, the one that clears the air, establishes realness, offers the widest embrace.
 Without the critical intelligence it provides, we're in the Dark Ages. With it, we may sample and savor art's myriad effects and purposes -- pleasure, wonder, solace, insistence, manipulation -- as we will.

''Fred Wilson, Objects and Installations: 1979-2000'' remains at the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through July 4. The show travels to the Chicago Cultural Center in July.

HEADLINE: U.S. Economy Grows 4.2%; War Spending Provides Push

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The American economy grew at a vigorous annual rate of 4.2 percent in the first quarter, with military spending making a significant contribution to economic growth for the first time since the early days of the war in Iraq.
 Consumers provided most of the lift, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported yesterday. Business investment was also strong, adding more to the growth rate than the military outlays. Without the war spending, however, the gross domestic product would have expanded at an only mediocre pace: 3.5 percent. 
 Because the quarter ended on a stronger note than it began, stepped-up military spending may not be necessary to sustain the economic recovery in the weeks ahead. Retail sales, home sales and consumer confidence all accelerated in March, the quarter's final month, and that acceleration appears to have continued through April. 
 ''We are in the sweet spot of the recovery right now, and the second quarter is also likely to be strong,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a forecasting and data-gathering firm. The big uncertainty, for Mr. Zandi and for other forecasters, is what will happen in the second half of the year. 
 Persistently low interest rates and low inflation, coupled with widespread mortgage refinancing, gave homeowners hundreds of millions of dollars in extra spending power and finally turned a sluggish recovery into a vigorous one over the last nine months. Now those supports are fading, suggesting that the surge in economic growth -- the G.D.P. has risen at a 5.5 percent annual rate since October -- might not last. And if growth tapers off, so will job creation. Total employment has been rising since August, but is still well below its level in November 2001, when the recovery began.
 The Bush administration greeted yesterday's G.D.P. report as confirmation that the president's tax cuts are working. ''America's economy is poised for long-term growth,'' Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said. 
 John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, focused not on the G.D.P. report but on the still subpar job creation. ''We all know that America is at its best when it's at work,'' Mr. Kerry said, according to The Associated Press.
 Neither party addressed the unexpected contribution of military spending to economic growth. It accounted for $17.4 billion of the $108.5 billion increase in the G.D.P. in the first quarter, adjusted for inflation. Not since the second quarter of last year, when the war started, has military spending been so important to growth. 
 Most of the increased spending went to the Air Force, for ''base support equipment,'' the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported. Very little went for weaponry, although that might change if the fighting continues to escalate. 
 ''Clearly military spending is more elevated because of Iraq than people had expected,'' said William C. Dudley, director of domestic economic research at Goldman Sachs. 
 The financial markets reacted negatively to the new G.D.P. report. Stocks fell, reflecting investor disappointment that the growth rate was slower than what many analysts had forecast. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 70.33, closing at 10,272. Bond prices, meanwhile, dropped as the data heightened concern that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to hold inflation in check. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, which moves inversely to the price, rose to 4.54 percent, from 4.50 percent on Wednesday. 
 Most forecasters had expected the G.D.P. to expand at an annual rate of at least 5 percent. They had counted on manufacturers to raise production for two reasons: to keep up with current brisk sales and to build up inventories in anticipation of more spending to come. The inventory buildup barely happened. Stockpiling rose at an annual rate of $15.3 billion. While that was nearly double the fourth-quarter pace, it was far short of the $30 billion to $40 billion that forecasters had expected.
 ''That was the major shortfall in my forecast and I assume in most others,'' said Lynn Reaser, the chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management. She had expected a growth rate of nearly 5 percent and now expects at least that much in the second quarter, assuming that inventory accumulation finally kicks in. 
 The markets also responded to fresh evidence of rising inflation, which damps stock prices and pushes up interest rates. Accelerating inflation increases the pressure on the Federal Reserve's policy makers to push up interest rates, although almost no one expects them to act at their next meeting, on Tuesday.
 An inflation index included in the G.D.P. report, measuring price changes for many goods and services, rose at an annual rate of 2 percent. The number, which excludes recent increases in food and energy prices, was up from 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter. 
 The Fed's policy makers pay close attention to that index. And though Alan Greenspan, the chairman, has publicly discouraged speculation that the Fed might act soon, the inflation numbers are pushing up market rates, which had fallen as low as 3.68 percent last month for the 10-year bond.
 ''If higher long-term rates persist, the Federal Reserve may be compelled to raise short-term rates to prove its vigilance for inflation,'' Lee Price, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, said in an analysis of the G.D.P. numbers.
 So far, labor costs have not contributed to the pressure on companies to raise prices. But that pressure may be coming. In a separate report yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the employment cost index rose at a robust 1.1 percent annual rate, not because wages went up -- they barely did -- but because employers' health insurance and pension costs shot up.
 When interest rates rise in response to inflationary pressure, they create obstacles to robust economic growth. One casualty could be personal consumption, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the first-quarter growth rate, and made roughly the same contribution in the fourth quarter, when the G.D.P. expanded at a 4.1 percent annual rate.
 Consumer borrowing helped fuel the first-quarter spending increase by compensating for personal income, which rose more slowly than spending in the quarter. Rising interest rates would damp that borrowing. So will the end of the refunds that have resulted this year from the Bush administration's tax cuts. 
 Consumption, though still robust, grew more slowly in the first quarter -- at a 3.8 percent annual rate -- than in the second half of last year, when it was 5.1 percent. The falloff was mostly a result of weaker auto sales, economists said. 
 The same tapering was evident in capital spending, which also made a significant contribution to first-quarter economic growth, thanks mainly to spending for computers and software. But the annualized first-quarter pace of 7.2 percent for all investment in the tools of production was down from a 10.9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. 
 ''We enjoyed the third straight quarter of very solid economic growth,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ''But going forward we are almost certain to see slower growth in consumption, and with it a decline in the economic growth rate.''

HEADLINE: A Chaotic Galaxy of Big Films, Unknowns and Noble Goals

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
Coherence is not necessarily a virtue of film festivals. Since the third annual TriBeCa Film Festival, which starts tomorrow, will stuff more than 150 features into a little more than a week, coherence may not even be a possibility. Like last year's TriBeCa Festival and other, similar events sprouting like toadstools in every resort town and urban center in North America, a degree of chaos will surely be part of what makes this festival festive.
 TriBeCa clearly has a number of ambitions, not all of them necessarily congruent with one another. It wants to be a flagship in the transformation of the western edge of Lower Manhattan from a Wall Street bedroom (and a scene of recent atrocity) into a cultural mecca. It wants to contribute to the revival of New York's status as a center of the American movie industry. It wants -- or at least its founding sponsor wants -- to paper every inch of wall below Canal Street with the American Express logo. Last, and one hopes not least, it wants to give New Yorkers a chance to see a lot of movies they might otherwise miss. 
 This last goal is the most traditional, and the noblest, but it sometimes threatens to be overshadowed by the festival's practice of showing audiences movies they will have plenty of other chances to see. One of the functions of festivals is to offer advance peeks at various goods right before they go on the market, to ensure early media exposure while giving a few lucky souls the chance to say, a few weeks later, '' 'The Mother'? Oh yeah, I saw that in TriBeCa.''
 In that spirit, tomorrow's opening-night film will be ''Raising Helen,'' a romantic comedy directed by Garry Marshall and starring Kate Hudson, which is scheduled to open on May 28. That fizzy, big-studio opener will be followed by a series of somewhat smaller, artier pictures making their world, North American or at least New York premieres on their way to and from other festivals. These include ''The Mother,'' directed by Roger Michell from a screenplay by Hanif Kureishi; ''Coffee and Cigarettes,'' the first movie in four years from Jim Jarmusch; and ''Baadasssss!,'' Mario Van Peebles's biographical tribute to his father, the pioneering African-American filmmaker Melvin Van Peebles, whom he plays on screen.
 These movies and others like them are surely deserving of a showcase at TriBeCa (and Showcase is, indeed, the name of one of the programs in which they can be found). But they can also overshadow the lesser-known, farther-flung movies that are the festival's core, if not exactly its reason for being. Whether this more modest (and also, in some ways, more ambitious) festival-within-the-festival is harmed by the hype that surrounds TriBeCa as a whole, or enabled by it, is an interesting question. Another question -- harder to answer at the outset -- is whether the competitive categories are strong enough to assert their own identities within the larger smorgasbord.
 Two of the three main competitive programs, the one for features and the one for documentaries, are devoted to the work of first- and second-time filmmakers, and these demonstrate impressive eclecticism on the part of the programmers even though the films themselves are uneven. Some of them, especially in the feature category, can most kindly be described as curiosities, a word that certainly fits Richard Ledes's ''Hole in One,'' about a gangster's girlfriend somewhere in cold war America whose dream is to have the latest style of lobotomy. The heroine is played by Michelle Williams, of ''Dawson's Creek'' fame, and her thuggish beau is played by Meat Loaf -- casting decisions that contribute to the film's overall oddness, which is sometimes arresting and sometimes just baffling. 
 As in past years, there seems to be special interest in stories from the Middle East and Central Asia, perhaps because after 9/11 these parts of the world are forever linked to Lower Manhattan. Last year, TriBeCa showed some of the first films made in post-Taliban Afghanistan. This tradition continues with a documentary called ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul'' and also with ''Zaman, the Man From the Reeds,'' a feature shot in Iraq in the twilight of Saddam Hussein's rule. 
 One of the themes that can be glimpsed amid all the hectic diversity is a kind of low-key, socially conscious humanism, often inflected with a quiet feminism, of the kind that has flourished recently among Iranian filmmakers and has taken root in Africa, Latin America and East Asia. This spirit is evident in Iranian movies like ''Abadan'' and ''Crystal,'' and also, more obliquely perhaps, in Danae Elon's ''Another Road Home.''
 Ms. Elon, the daughter of Amos Elon, one of Israel's leading intellectuals, whose parents now live in Italy, finds herself wondering about the family of Musa Obeidallah, a Palestinian man who came to work for them as a housekeeper, handyman and babysitter in Jerusalem after the 1967 war. Her search leads her to Paterson, N.J., where several of his sons now live, and then to a reunion with Mr. Obeidallah himself. Though it takes place in the bleak political context of deteriorating Israeli-Palestinian relations, the film has an emotional complexity that moves well beyond politics into the mysterious connections that form, almost imperceptibly, within and between families.
 Other documentaries address the crises of the modern world more frontally, and with more polemical passion. ''A Social Genocide,'' from Argentina, is an angry chronicle of that country's recent political and economic troubles, presenting a prosecutor's brief against the bureaucrats and politicians who oversaw the privatization of its resources in the 1990's. ''The Origins of AIDS'' revisits the controversial claim, put forward by Edward Hooper in his book, ''The River,'' that the AIDS epidemic was caused by a polio vaccination program in the Congo in the 1950's. (The theory was challenged again by a study published this month in the journal Nature.) Though its credibility is undermined by tendentious narration and melodramatic music, the movie is, at the least, a fascinating and frightening medical detective story.
 Like many documentaries, these films are as interesting for their subject matter as for their cinematic qualities: they are, in effect, works of visual journalism. But documentary, now in something of a golden age, is a form without limits, and there is at least one nonfiction feature in TriBeCa this year that can be called, without qualification, a great film. This is ''Delamu,'' Zhuangzhuang Tian's gorgeous, slow-moving tour of a mountainous region tucked between China and Tibet.
 The film's pastoral rhythms and breathtaking landscapes immerse you in a way of life that seems almost unimaginably distant from the modern urban world. But like something by Satyajit Ray (or like ''The Blue Kite,'' Mr. Tian's splendidly lyrical fictional film), ''Delamu'' has a universal resonance that lifts it beyond ethnographic observation. 
 Another Chinese movie, ''The Green Hat,'' by Fen Dou Liu, presents a drastically different view of modern China, and a style of filmmaking that draws on quite different influences. Saturated with sex, gunfire and glum nihilism, Mr. Liu's debut film has a harsh, profane bravado that recalls ''Reservoir Dogs'' and a chilly aura of disaffection that seems to have blown onto the Chinese mainland from Taiwan or Japan.
 This is, needless to say, but a tiny sample of this year's festival, and a possible route through its busy first few days. In the future, as it grows into a clearer sense of what it wants to do, TriBeCa will, one hopes, become more navigable and maybe, without sacrificing its eclecticism and curiosity, a bit more coherent as well.

HEADLINE: Will a Bigger Europe Be a Better Europe?

BYLINE: By ROBERT LANE GREENE & NIGEL HOLMES. 
Robert Lane Greene is a correspondent for Economist.com. Nigel Holmes is a graphic designer.

 BODY:
Tomorrow the European Union will grow to 25 members from 15, including 8 new countries from formerly Communist Eastern Europe: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. (The other two new members are Malta and the southern part of Cyprus.) 
This will have a profound effect on an organization whose institutions were designed for six members in the 1950's and have been only tinkered with since. And, as the chart below shows, the differences between West and East are striking.
 The established members are worried that workers from the new members will flood westward, driving wages down and unemployment up, and straining welfare systems. Almost all of the 15 will restrict the rights of workers from the new 10 for several years; only Britain and Ireland will let them work freely from the start.
 The new members have adopted thousands of pages of laws shared throughout the union. They have had to reform their economies and clean up their environments. And they must endeavor to support the ''common foreign and security policy,'' despite their significant ideological differences with ''old Europe,'' most notably on relations with the United States. 
 But there's a significant upside for those joining as well. Since the union gives large subsidies to its poorer members and support to its farmers, they will soon see a significant influx of money. In the past, this cash injection has helped poorer members like Spain and Ireland go from the bottom of the economic tables to the first tier. Ireland is now, by some measures, richer than Britain. Small wonder that, despite their differences with established members, the new countries are eager to join.

HEADLINE: U.N. Struggles to Find Troops to Police Haiti

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29 

 BODY:
Just a month before its deadline, the United Nations finds itself hard-pressed to sign up peacekeeping troops and French-speaking police officers to take over security in Haiti from an American-led interim force, United Nations officials and diplomats say.
 The Security Council is considering a request by Secretary General Kofi Annan to send 6,700 peacekeepers and 1,622 civilian police officers to Haiti, which was shaken in February when armed insurgents opposed to the government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide took over much of Haiti's north and moved on the capital.
 Planners cite several challenges as they seek to replace nearly 2,000 troops from the United States and about 1,500 from France, Canada and Chile who were deployed to keep order after Mr. Aristide left. 
 Although this interim force has managed to impose a modicum of stability, diplomats express concern that large parts of the country remain under the rebels' control, and that there has been no systematic effort to disarm them.
 One problem is the competition for French-speaking peacekeepers, as missions are prepared for Ivory Coast and Burundi this year, United Nations representatives said.
 In addition, some potential contributors are reluctant to offer troops because of lingering doubts about the conditions of Mr. Aristide's departure, on Feb. 29: he was assisted into exile by American officials in an incident he later referred to as a kidnapping. The Bush administration denies this, saying it acted to safeguard Mr. Aristide from attack and to avert a rebel takeover.
 ''The big problem they have is the controversy over Aristide's departure,'' said a senior diplomat who is involved in the negotiations. ''It remains a cancer, and it tends to limit support.'' 
 The countries that currently have troops in Haiti have signaled their willingness to stay under the new mandate, and Brazil has said it would take part. A Canadian official said French-speaking nations in Africa had been asked to join in, and he said he was optimistic that the United Nations would reach its goal of more than doubling the interim force. ''I think the world will be able to provide that,'' the official said.
 The 15 nations in the Caribbean Community, or Caricom, have withheld recognition of Haiti's interim government, whose leaders were selected by a council of elders. Caricom has settled into an ambiguous stance, not ruling out a role in the new security forces and deferring a decision on recognizing Haiti's government until July. 
 One Caricom diplomat said the group had been stymied by the dispute over whether Bush administration officials undermined its diplomatic efforts and forced Mr. Aristide into exile. But Caribbean foreign ministers met last weekend and decided to take a more active role, now that the United Nations is involved.
 In a report last week, Mr. Annan noted that his efforts to raise even small amounts of money for Haiti had fallen short, with the response to his appeal for $35 million in emergency assistance ''slower than anticipated.''
 Potential donors are expected to make an assessment next month to identify specific needs.
 Mr. Annan's report calls for a force that would take over Haiti's security on June 1 and remain in place until elections can be held next year, and for an ''appropriate period of time thereafter.''
 The open-ended nature of the mission has caused some skepticism among potential contributors. The last peacekeeping mission -- a joint operation of the United Nations and the Organization of American States -- followed an American intervention in 1994 and lasted until 2001. Mr. Annan's report criticized the international community for having pulled out too quickly.
 Calling for a sweeping United Nations program to develop the economy and civil society, Mr. Annan said conditions in Haiti now were actually worse than before foreign involvement began.
 A key to progress, he said, would be establishing a process of national reconciliation and putting an end to a climate of impunity and revenge.
 ''Our task will not be easy,'' Mr. Annan wrote. ''The situation looks more daunting today than it did a decade ago.''

HEADLINE: Go Off the Beaten Path? Not Likely With G.P.S.

BYLINE: By NANCY M. BETTER

 BODY:
THE term ''road trip'' used to mean piling into the family station wagon and waiting for the fireworks to begin. There was the familiar ritual of watching Mom open the pale blue map -- creased and worn, splattered with coffee stains -- while Dad took the wheel. There was the leisurely interlude when the trip was on course and everyone took turns measuring distances and noting points of interest. Then there was the panicked moment when someone realized Interstate 95 had become Interstate 195 and the next exit was 30 miles away.
 This summer my family will hit the road equipped with a state-of-the-art navigation system in our new Toyota sport utility vehicle. A disembodied woman's voice will crisply issue directions (''One quarter mile, right turn''), and a computerized map will show details (including every McDonald's between Manhattan and Maine, if we desire). No more fumbling to unfold a four-foot-square map in the front seat, no more arguing over directions, no more illegal U-turns or frantic shrieks of ''Turn off here!'' 
 My family will not be alone in sharing our trip with a technology once reserved for fighter jet pilots. The research firm J. D. Power & Associates reports that in 2003 more than 550,000 consumers bought new vehicles with factory-installed navigation systems. These onboard computers receive satellite signals from the Global Positioning System operated by the Defense Department. Nearly 30 percent of new car models sold in the United States now offer these systems -- at a cost of $1,500 to $2,000 -- up from less than 1 percent in 1998.
 ''You don't find G.P.S. in just Range Rovers going deep into the Utah back country anymore,'' said Justin McNaull, a spokesman for AAA. ''It's in family minivans going to the beach.'' 
 Indeed, upon buying my S.U.V., the Toyota salesman offered congratulations -- and promptly suggested I throw away all the dog-eared paper maps stuffed in my glove compartment. This reminded me of the doctor who told my friend to throw away her glasses after laser eye surgery. She couldn't part with her glasses, and I couldn't part with my maps. They are as much repositories of memories as directional aids. Besides, what if I couldn't work the dashboard computer?
 I was also worried about the loss of serendipity that might come with using G.P.S. When the route is determined by computer, there's little chance of veering off course. And sometimes getting sidetracked -- or even getting lost -- can be the best part of a trip. As Mr. McNaull said, ''If your routing is really narrow, you lose your peripheral vision. The periphery is where you find a lot of neat things that are off the beaten path.'' 
 For grown-ups, getting used to G.P.S. can be a challenge. I was intimidated by the inch-thick manual in its own glossy leather case, which warns users to update the mapping software regularly: ''The database reflects reality as existing before you received the database and it comprises data and information from government and other sources which may contain errors and omissions.''
 But my three children had it all figured out in minutes. The moment they got in the car, the 11-year-old began plotting the route to visit Jeremy, his camp friend in Baltimore. The younger pair, 9 and 7, requested the street address of Disney World to test the system's calculators, which can predict travel time and fuel mileage. This confirms J. D. Power's finding that younger consumers are more likely to use computer navigation systems on a regular basis, and to report much higher satisfaction with them. 
 For the first few weeks, I was mesmerized by the dashboard computer. It was fascinating (sort of) to experience life in two dimensions. On the G.P.S., my car was a little red arrow in a circle, traveling to and from a little red dot that was my house. Familiar landmarks took on a new look; the screen transformed our environs into a tidy pastel grid. The local golf course was green, dotted with tiny blue splotches. The hospital was yellow; the cemetery was pink. And the steady patter of narrated directions gave each driving maneuver added importance. 
 But I soon grew weary of the glowing, talking four-inch box. I also grew worried about my children's navigational skills. How would they learn geography without using paper maps? During our elementary school years, my brother and I spent hours curled up in the rear of the family car studying the Rand McNally road atlas. Mr. McNaull of AAA has similar memories. ''I remember sitting in the back of my family's car with the atlas and pestering my parents with questions. What's the highest mountain in Nebraska? Where's the longest river in Texas? I learned a lot of geography in the back of the car.''
 SOME some educators worry that the United States is becoming a nation of geographic illiterates. In his book ''The Educated Child,'' William J. Bennett, the former education secretary, cites a government study called the National Assessment of Educational Progress. According to this research, half of the country's fourth graders in 1996 could not identify the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans correctly on a map.
 Caleb Mason, a spokesman for DeLorme, a manufacturer of mapping tools, said he believed that navigation systems could actually help teach children about geography. Using Delorme's Earthmate G.P.S. receiver and companion mapping software program (sold together for $129.95), a laptop computer can be turned into a full-featured navigation system. ''The kids can learn some geography in the car while tracking the trip on the laptop,'' he said. Mr. Mason's son and daughter, ages 15 and 12, often travel this way. ''It keeps them occupied for hours,'' he said. ''It competes with DVD movies. It's not quite as cool, but it's in the realm.'' 
 Mary Kathryn Hassett, a public relations officer for the Core Knowledge Foundation in Charlottesville, Va., an education research institution, agrees that the G.P.S. can be a teaching aid. ''I think G.P.S. might be used to intrigue kids and help them develop their map-reading skills, especially if it's combined with some prior trip preparation and some inventive car games based on geographical facts.''
 Her own children, now grown, whiled away the time on summer road trips from Ohio to Massachusetts by playing geography games. ''I think anything that eliminates squabbling and isolating earphones is a plus,'' Ms. Hassett said. ''Twenty years later, my kids still talk about the car games that measured out the miles between Cincinnati and Cape Cod.''
 Still, the paper map is hardly an endangered species. Joel Minster, senior vice president of geographic information systems for Rand McNally, said that sales of the company's classic road atlas remained strong. ''G.P.S. is about where you are,'' he said. ''The road atlas is about where you are going. People like to see the context of where they're going, and unless you zoom in and out on G.P.S., you can't get the big picture.''
 Mr. Minster also pointed out the inability to make notes on computerized navigation systems. ''For many people, the road atlas becomes a kind of travel diary,'' he said. ''You circle the towns you've been to and jot down notes about where you've stayed, where you've eaten. People don't want to give that up.''

HEADLINE: The French Get Their Drug Company. Will Foreign Investors Retaliate?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
WILL foreign investors punish France? 
 That question arises in the wake of the French government's successful effort to create a French pharmaceutical giant, regardless of what shareholders might have preferred.
 To engineer the takeover of one French drug company, Aventis, by another, Sanofi-Synthelabo, the government had to sidestep supposed European rules barring national preferences. It evoked snickers with the disingenuous argument that a non-French company might not provide vaccines after a terrorist attack. 
 But it succeeded, and on terms that let Aventis shareholders do reasonably well, although they could suffer if Sanofi loses a court case involving patent protection on an important drug. Aventis came up with a clever security to protect its shareholders if that happened, but the French government said such a tactic would not be allowed.
 Nationalism in takeovers is hardly unprecedented, of course. The European Commission is irritated that some European governments retain ''golden shares'' to prevent foreign takeovers of formerly state-owned companies. The United States government reserves the right to bar foreign takeovers of companies that have technology deemed critical for defense. And American law bars foreigners from owning more than 25 percent of a United States airline.
 Not that long ago, it was America that was worried about its place in an international economy increasingly dominated by Japan. There were cries of anguish as Japanese investors snapped up assets deemed to be emblematic of the United States, among them Rockefeller Center in New York and the Pebble Beach golf course in California. The anxiety existed even though it was hard to imagine what harm there could be. Would the Japanese refuse to rent offices to Americans? Would wealthy duffers be banned from losing golf balls in the Pacific?
 Now, ''in Europe there is a feeling of insecurity,'' Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker and former United States ambassador to France, said in an interview. ''The problem is the lack of growth.'' Efforts at economic reform in Europe have proved both ineffective and unpopular. 
 France evidently wants to protect its place in a growth industry where it has two important companies, even if Aventis is the result of an earlier French-German merger. But France has been less protectionist in other areas. It allowed Alcan of Canada to acquire Pechiney, but pharmaceuticals are different from aluminum.
 What would have happened if Novartis, the Swiss company, had been willing to bid for Aventis despite worries that France could have retaliated with delayed drug approvals or harsh decisions on drug pricing? ''I can't be sure that if they had made a superior bid the French government would have stopped them,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. He thinks a combined Novartis-Aventis could have defended itself with threats to move research or other operations.
 Weeks ago, the French prime minister arranged to meet some foreign capitalists, Mr. Rohatyn among them, to begin a campaign promoting investment in France. The meeting took place the day after Aventis surrendered.
 The timing could have been better. Angry investors who wanted more for their Aventis shares are now muttering about avoiding France, and it can be noted that the euro peaked soon after the French government first intervened.
 But there are other reasons for the euro's rise and retreat. Investors hoping for takeover bonanzas may be less willing to buy major French companies, but that effect on investment is likely to be marginal. France's big problem with attracting investment has not changed: Investors doubt French growth prospects, and they have little expectation that much will be done to improve them.

HEADLINE: Preserve Performance Art? Can You Preserve the Wind?

BYLINE: By John Rockwell

 BODY:
One photo on the postcard and the program showed a naked, paint-besmeared man dragging a naked woman through more paint, all solemnly observed by dimly lighted musicians and art fans sitting in the background. There was a second photo on the postcard, of a naked woman (presumably the same naked woman) posing demurely in profile, her right breast dark with paint and hence obscured, standing next to a wall covered with butcher-paper on which she had pressed herself, leaving the predictable marks.
 The performance was staged in Paris in 1960 by Yves Klein and called ''Anthropometries of the Blue Period'' (the dark paint was Klein's obsessively personal shade of blue; the musicians were playing Pierre Henry's ''Symphonie Monotone''). The photos, by Harry Shunk, constituted the event's immortalization, along with the memories of those who were there, other photos that may have been taken and whatever prose records exist. Not quite the same thing as being there, or being able to hang an artwork on the wall of your living room or a museum. 
 The photos were illustrations for a symposium held recently at New York University's Einstein Auditorium entitled ''Not for Sale: Curating, Conserving and Collecting Ephemeral Art.'' This was a very serious affair, held before an audience that was large (the auditorium was packed) and attentive. The discussion was organized and moderated by RoseLee Goldberg, an associate adjunct professor at N.Y.U. and the author of ''Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present,'' from which I gleaned the details of the Klein event.
 Panel members consisted of Chrissie Iles, the curator of film and video at the Whitney Museum; Robert Storr, a former senior curator at the Museum of Modern Art and currently a chaired professor at N.Y.U.; and Joan Jonas, the noted performance artist. 
 Worthies all. Why, then, when I first got the postcard and before I even realized who would be pondering these issues, did the whole conceit strike me as hilarious?
 The answer was the very seriousness with which these experts concerned themselves with an apparent paradox: conserving and collecting art that was intended to be transitory and uncollectible.
 Their seriousness speaks, I think, to the inherently more conservative tenor of our times (whatever the political views of the panelists may be) and to the natural desire of artists as they age to feel that they should leave some sort of mark on posterity.
 By my count, the art under discussion comes in four forms: purely conceptual art, performance art, art that is only temporarily displayed, and site art. Performance is really the best example, being neither conservable nor collectible. It can be described and notated and recorded and videoed. But just like a night in a jazz club or a theater or even at marmoreal Carnegie Hall, the true experience is being there, in that exact time and place, never to be repeated. Which, of course, is a good part of the magic.
 Site art can indeed be conserved, as proved by the discussions about what to do with Robert Smithson's ''Spiral Jetty,'' which keeps disappearing and reappearing in the Great Salt Lake. Of course, some artists conceived of the natural decay of erosion as part of their work. And it's hard to collect it, unless by collecting you include the overall suzerainty of a foundation designed to preserve it.
 By ''pure'' conceptual art I mean work that exists only as an idea: the term conceptual art has also been applied to all sorts of actual objects. La Monte Young, the composer, did a series of conceptual pieces consisting of phrases like ''This piece is little whirlpools out in the middle of the ocean,'' also from 1960. That was it. Of course, the words remain to be quoted, and no doubt Mr. Young's original manuscript, which could be conserved and collected, exists somewhere. Maybe it would even look nice above someone's fireplace.
 Finally, temporary display, as in Rachel Whiteread's plastic cast of the interior of a water tower that graced a SoHo roof for a few months six years ago. It was seen in slides; slides were popular at the N.Y.U. panel, another form of conservation.
 Why were artists in the 60's, and some still today, so determined to be ephemeral? Part of the reason, as the panelists were well aware, was a protest against the objectification of the artwork. Also a protest against the entire collecting impulse, wherein a work of art is taken from the artist (presumably in exchange for money that allows the artist to make more artworks, but never mind) and whose subsequent appreciation, if any, does not profit the artist directly.
 Of course, more than mere financial envy was at stake. Artists resented the incestuousness of the art scene (however much they may have participated in it). They wanted to demystify the hierarchies of art; in that sense, Pop art was similarly ephemeral, however much someone like Andy Warhol may have made money from his infinitely reproducible works and may have played the art scene like a virtuoso violinist. And they sought to imbue art with a spiritual essence stripped of mere physical form.
 What's changed in the intervening 45 years? Well, artists do need to eat, and in a capitalist economy selling their artworks is still the most immediate way to make money. But Ms. Jonas, at the N.Y.U. panel, sounded unself-consciously frank about wanting to preserve her work, and to be paid for it. Today, she pointed out, she often makes an installation that can be observed over time in a museum or gallery and then she creates a performance within it.
 A similar relation of permanence and impermanence -- a museum documenting a past event or even plans for a future event with objects that can be sold -- has become common. A current example is the Metropolitan Museum's exhibition of Christo and his wife Jean-Claude's project, 25 years in the making, to decorate 23 miles of Central Park walkways for 16 days next February.
 To be fair to Ms. Goldberg and her panelists, all of them referred to the ''complexity'' of this issue, and conceded that some artists actively resisted the idea that their ephemeral works be conserved. But they didn't seem to see the inherent humor of the panel title or the ideas behind it. Perhaps they do so in private, after a few drinks.
 We do live in more conservative times, not just politically but culturally; hence the impulse toward conservation. More poignantly, artists want to be remembered when they're gone.
 It's easy if you're Rembrandt, even though all things must eventually fade. But it's not so easy if you're a creator of youthfully defiant ephemeral art. The impact of such art is instantaneous; photos and other documentation linger as fading aftershocks. As you grow older, you begin to realize that nothing is so ephemeral as all human accomplishment -- and, indeed, human life.

The American economy grew at a vigorous annual rate of 4.2 percent in the first quarter, with military spending making a significant contribution to economic growth for the first time since the early days of the war in Iraq. 
 Consumers provided most of the lift, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported. Business investment was also strong, adding more to the growth rate than military outlays.

HEADLINE: Study Tracks Boom in Prisons And Notes Impact on Counties

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

 BODY:
A study mapping the prisons built in the boom of the last two decades has found that some counties in the United States now have more than 30 percent of their residents behind bars. The study, by the Urban Institute, also found that nearly a third of counties have at least one prison.
 ''This study shows that the prison network is now deeply intertwined with American life, deeply integrated into the physical and economic infrastructure of a large number of American counties,'' said Jeremy Travis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and an author of the study.
 ''This network has become a separate reality, apart from the criminal justice system,'' Mr. Travis said. ''It provides jobs for construction workers and guards, and because the inmates are counted as residents of the counties where they are incarcerated, it means more federal and state funding and greater political representation for these counties.'' 
 In addition, Mr. Travis said, because the study found that prisons were increasingly being built far from the cities where most inmates come from, ''we are making it harder and harder for their families to remain in contact with them.'' As a result, he said, ''we have made it harder for these inmates to successfully re-enter society when they are released.''
 The study, ''The New Landscape of Imprisonment: Mapping America's Prison Expansion,'' was released yesterday. The number of federal and state prisons grew from 592 in 1974 to 1,023 in 2000, and this study is the first effort to show where all the building has taken place. In 1923, the United States had 61 prisons.
 The report focuses on the 10 states that had the largest increases in the number of prisons between 1980 and 2000, when the number of state and federal inmates soared to 1.3 million from 315,974.
 Texas led the way, building 120 prisons in those two decades, or an average of nearly six a year. Texas also has the most prisons in operation, 137, and the largest percentage increase in the number of prisons, 706 percent.
 ''Texas is in a league of its own,'' the report concluded.
 Florida has been the second-busiest prison builder since 1980, with 84, while California is third with 83. New York, with 65, is fourth.
 One of the most striking findings of the report was that in 1980, only 13 percent of the counties in these 10 states had a prison, but by 2000, 31 percent did. In Florida, 78 percent of the counties have at least one prison. In California, 59 percent do, while in New York the figure is 52 percent.
 One force behind the spread of prisons to so many counties, Mr. Travis said, has been a strong argument by rural legislators that building prisons in their communities would be an economic boon. ''We've seen the development of a prison construction advocacy position,'' he said.
 But the report said there was no clear evidence that building prisons in poor rural areas had a significant economic impact. In fact, it cited one study, by the Sentencing Project, using 25 years of employment and per capita income data from rural counties in New York, which found ''no significant difference or discernible pattern of economic trends'' between counties that were home to a prison and counties that did not have one.
 The Sentencing Project is a research and advocacy group based in Washington that calls for alternatives to incarceration.
 But having a large number of inmates can produce extra federal and state financing for a county, the Urban Institute report pointed out. Federal money for Medicaid, foster care, adoption assistance and social services block grants is based on the census, and the census counts prison inmates as residents of the county where they are incarcerated, not where their homes are. Conversely, the federal money is lost to the home communities of the inmates or their families, creating a financial burden on those areas because inmates disproportionately come from concentrated areas of large cities. 
 Similarly, within a state, money for community health services, roads and local law enforcement is also based on census figures. 
 The report found that the county with the largest share of its residents in prison was Concho County, Tex., with a population of just under 4,000 and 33 percent of its population in prison.

HEADLINE: New H.I.V. Infection Found in Sex-Film Industry

BYLINE: By NICK MADIGAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 29 

 BODY:
Health officials on Thursday confirmed a third case of H.I.V. infection among actors in the pornography industry.
 Sharon Mitchell, the director of a clinic that is testing hundreds of performers for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, said the latest infection had been detected in a 26-year-old woman from the Czech Republic who worked on a sex-video on March 23 with Darren James, the first actor here known to have been infected in the outbreak.
 Ms. Mitchell, who informed the Czech actress of her condition on Thursday morning, did not identify her, but confirmed a report on the Adult Video News Web site that her stage name is Jessica Dee. Four tests were used to establish the presence of the virus. 
 ''She's been counseled,'' said Ms. Mitchell, the director of the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation. ''No one is ever very happy about getting H.I.V., but she's taking to counseling very well and she is already on antiretroviral therapy, early H.I.V. meds.''
 Another actress who had worked with Mr. James, Lara Roxx, a Canadian, was found to have the virus two weeks ago.
 The outbreak, which involves the first known cases of H.I.V. in the San Fernando Valley sex-video industry since 1999, has forced a 60-day halt to filming while performers are tested and re-tested for the virus. It is believed to have been brought in by Mr. James from Brazil, where he was working on a film in early March.
 Ms. Mitchell said Thursday that she had contacted Brazilian health officials to try to trace the virus on the Sao Paulo film location. She said she believed it was linked to a young actress who had had sex with Mr. James in the film. She declined to name the actress and said her identity had been provided not by Mr. James but by ''an outside source.''
 Ms. Mitchell said she had yet to ascertain whether the Brazilian actress knew that she had the virus at the time she worked with Mr. James.
 Health investigators in Los Angeles have obtained the legal names and medical files of about 65 performers here who were known to have had sexual contact with Mr. James and Ms. Roxx, or with someone else who had sex with them. The investigation will presumably now be expanded to include anyone who had sexual contact with Ms. Dee.
 Mr. James is believed to have worked with 12 actresses in Los Angeles after his return from Brazil. He was tested for H.I.V. immediately, but the result was negative. A later test was positive.
 The pornography industry, which is based nationally in the San Fernando Valley, turns out some 4,000 films and videos a year in the shadow of Hollywood and brings in $5 billion to $9 billion a year, economists here say. The higher number almost equals the amount brought in by mainstream studio and independent films last year in the United States and Canada.
 The moratorium on filming is to last at least until June 8. About 65 performers have been placed under quarantine, meaning they cannot work until they are cleared. Many other actors have voluntarily agreed to tests beyond the normal once a month.
 About 1,200 performers in the industry are monitored once a month for H.I.V., chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. Most tests are conducted at the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation's offices in the Sherman Oaks and Woodland Hills neighborhoods.
 Health professionals estimate that there are 40,000 new H.I.V. infections around the country every year.

HEADLINE: Senate Extends Until 2007 Ban on Internet Access Tax

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29 

 BODY:
The Senate agreed Thursday to extend a ban on taxes on Internet access for another four years, approving a compromise between those who had wanted to make the restrictions permanent and opponents who said they would deny needed revenue to state and local governments.
 The deal, brokered by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Commerce Committee, was accepted on a 93-to-3 vote after lawmakers dismissed efforts to add stalled energy legislation to the Internet measure.
 Under the bill, which must still be reconciled with a much broader tax moratorium already approved by the House, no new taxes would be allowed on high-speed Internet access through Nov. 1, 2007. A few states that have already imposed them would, however, be able to retain them for now. In an important concession to its opponents, the bill does not extend the tax ban to any traditional phone service conducted via the Internet. 
 ''This is a huge victory for those who want the Internet to be healthy and vibrant in the years ahead,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who had been among those pushing for a broader, permanent moratorium on taxes that they argued could stifle the availability of broadband access.
 Opponents of the permanent ban, including a handful of former governors, said they were satisfied that they had won sufficient protection for governments that rely on billions of dollars from telecommunications tax revenues that could be lost as more phone service migrates to the Internet.
 But Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said the debate should serve as a ''wake-up call'' to state and local governments that they needed to make clear their views on what stages of the Internet connection should be subject to taxes before the issue of the ban came up again.
 ''We are going to have to do some careful, creative, constructive thinking,'' said Mr. Alexander, who said the issue had financial implications for every municipality, county and state in the nation.
 The Internet tax moratorium, which was enacted in 1998 and expired last fall, almost got swallowed in political maneuvering. But Mr. McCain and supporters of his compromise won a surprising 64-to-34 vote to cut off debate on the bill earlier Thursday, clearing the way for its quick passage.
 Senators, however, did not vote to limit debate on a plan by the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, to increase the use of corn-based ethanol as a gasoline additive or on an effort by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, to add a stalled energy measure to the Internet bill.
 The effort to keep the tax ban in place received a lift earlier in the week when President Bush urged Congress to block taxes on Internet access, saying fast Internet service needed to be affordable and widely available if the United States was to keep pace with other nations.
 But local government officials had been pressing lawmakers to move cautiously on the issue, saying the moratorium could disrupt their budgets and cause them to raise local taxes to compensate for lost revenue. 
 Lawmakers said the Senate bill would allow seven states that began taxing dial-up Internet service before 1998 to keep doing so for four more years, while 17 states that have been taxing high-speed service were granted two more years.
 Backers of the ban said they believed that those Senate exceptions would be a point of contention in negotiations with the House and that local governments were eyeing the taxes, particularly on digital subscriber lines or D.S.L., as a rich source of revenue.
 Authors of the measure said they hoped to reach a deal with the House and deliver a bill to President Bush this year.
 On Thursday Mr. Bush called the measure ''an important step toward permanently banning access taxes on broadband that will help make high-speed Internet services more affordable, increase the number of broadband users, and enhance our nation's economic competitiveness.''

HEADLINE: Metal Prices Fall; 'Froth' Is Blown Off Market

BYLINE: By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 29 

 BODY:
A steep fall in copper, gold and other metal prices in the last week has heightened nervousness that a two-year boom in commodity markets may be coming to a close.
 Copper and nickel each lost more than 5 percent of their value on Wednesday, accelerating a drop that began in early April.
 Prices stabilized on Thursday, with copper, the most widely used industrial metal, trading at $2,657 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, down from $3,100 in late March. The price of copper had more than doubled from early 2003 until the March peak. 
 ''The froth is being blown off, and there's a lot of froth,'' said Peter Hollands, manager of base metal research at Bloomsbury Mineral Economics, a consultant firm in London. 
 Nickel, used for stainless steel, has lost almost 40 percent of its value since reaching a peak of close to $18,000 a metric ton in early January. The gold price was fixed in London at $386 an ounce on Thursday afternoon, down from a recent peak of $428.20 in January.
 The growing nervousness in metal markets stems mainly from China's moves to cool its fast-expanding economy, as well as a recent rebound in the dollar, reflecting expectations of higher interest rates in the United States. 
 Booming demand from China has been a driving force behind the spike in commodity prices in the last 18 months, with China either overtaking or approaching the United States as the world's biggest consumer of materials like aluminum, coal, copper, iron ore and steel.
 But with fears growing of an inflationary bubble, the Chinese authorities ordered banks earlier this week to stop their rapid rise in lending at least until the weeklong May Day holiday starts on Saturday. The government has also tightened capital requirements for investments in aluminum, cement, real estate and steel projects. The State Council, China's cabinet, earlier this week halted construction of a $1.3 billion steel mill in Jiangsu province. 
 The stronger dollar has roiled metal markets because most prices are denominated in dollars and often move in the opposite direction of the American currency.
 ''Six months ago, it was a no-brainer that the dollar was going to keep going down,'' said Stephen Briggs, a commodities analyst at Societe Generale in London. ''Now, people are not so sure.''
 The slide in copper prices has been exacerbated by an announcement last week by Freeport-McMoRan of New Orleans that it is stepping up output at its Grasberg mine in Indonesia after a series of accidents last year. The mine is the world's second-biggest copper producer.
 In addition, many metal users, especially of nickel, have stepped up the search for cheaper substitutes as prices have risen. ''There may have been more substitution than people thought possible,'' Mr. Briggs said. For instance, in stainless steel, chromium can be substituted for nickel.
 The boom of the last 18 months has ignited the interest of hedge funds and other investors in what is normally among the least glamorous corners of the financial markets. 
 BMO Nesbitt Burns, a unit of the Bank of Montreal, estimates that about $5.2 billion was raised for exploration and mine development last year, more than double the amount in 2002. Another $2.6 billion has been raised so far this year. A record 9,263 delegates registered for the annual prospectors and developers' convention in Toronto last month, 20 percent more than in 2003.
 But with metal prices now in reverse, ''clearly, there's going to be less capital raised in the short run,'' said Peter Collibee, managing director of BMO Nesbitt Burns's mining finance group in Toronto.
 Joseph M. Foster, a gold portfolio manager at Van Eck Global in New York, said that the recent drop in prices had triggered a wave of selling by hedge funds. ''It's a cycle that feeds on itself,'' Mr. Foster said.
 Several analysts said that the sharp pullback in commodity prices was more likely a correction of speculative excess than the start of a bear market.
 ''Nothing has yet happened to suggest that China is going into meltdown,'' said Mr. Briggs of Societe Generale. ''The fear must be thatthere'll be a hard landing rather than a soft one, but there's very little evidence of that so far.''
 Mr. Hollands of the Bloomsbury group said that inventories of nickel and copper would probably shrink over the next year, underpinning prices for the metals. With no new nickel mines starting up until 2006, the surge in prices has been due as much to expectations of supply shortages as to rising demand.
 In the case of gold, Mr. Foster takes the view that ''the bull market is still intact.'' He cited continuing concerns about structural imbalances in the American economy, including towering budget and current account deficits, and high levels of household debt. 
 ''There are a lot of risks in the economy that are being glossed over by strong growth numbers,'' he said. ''People see gold as a safe haven to protect your wealth.''
