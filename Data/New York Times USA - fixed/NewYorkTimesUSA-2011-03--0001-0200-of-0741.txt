HEADLINE: Well-Oiled Security Apparatus In China Stifles Calls for Change

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS and JONATHAN ANSFIELD; Li Bibo contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The call to action shot across mobile phones and Internet chat sites, urging people to converge on 13 Chinese cities to demand an end to corruption, inflation and the strictures of authoritarian rule. ''The Chinese people do not have the patience to wait any longer,'' said one message.
The anonymous organizers got a sizable turnout -- but in China, most of those who poured into squares and shopping centers were police officers and plainclothes security agents.
Two months of upheaval in the Mideast have cast doubt on the staying power of all authoritarian governments. But in China calls for change are so far being met with political controls wielded by authorities who, even during a period of rising prosperity and national pride, have not taken their staying power for granted. 
The nearly instantaneous deployment of the police to prevent even notional gatherings in big cities the past two weeks is just one example of what Chinese officials call ''stability maintenance.'' This refers to a raft of policies and practices refined after ''color revolutions'' abroad and, at home, tens of thousands of demonstrations by workers and peasants, ethnic unrest, and the spread of mobile communications and broadband networking.
Chinese officials charged with ensuring security, lavishly financed and permitted to operate above the law, have remained perpetually on edge, employing state-of-the-art surveillance, technologically sophisticated censorship, new crime-fighting tools, as well as proactive efforts to resolve labor and land disputes, all to prevent any organized or sustained resistance to single-party rule.
''It is a comprehensive call to arms for the entire bureaucracy to promote social stability,'' said Murray Scot Tanner, a China security analyst at C.N.A., a private research group in Alexandria, Va.
Since the first widespread calls for Middle East-style demonstrations in China were published two weeks ago on an American Web site that is blocked in China, the police have reacted with brutal efficiency. They have placed more than 100 dissidents and human rights campaigners under house arrest and threatened others who forwarded messages about the protests, and have detained six prominent lawyers and activists on suspicion of inciting subversion. Censors have also intensified the filters on microblogs, already among the tightest in the world.
At an unpublicized meeting in February, the Politburo outlined heightened controls to prevent the type of revolts that toppled governments in Egypt and Tunisia, said one ranking journalist who declined to be named.
''The crackdown has been the most severe we've seen in years,'' said Wang Songlian, a researcher at Chinese Human Rights Defenders.
Despite persistent calls for political reform among the country's small and embattled group of human rights advocates, most analysts agreed that China faced a smaller risk of street unrest than did Egypt, Libya and Bahrain. Unlike those countries, where oligarchic rule and high unemployment have fed discontent, China's leaders have largely tamed widespread antipathy through policies that have led to robust economic growth and through selective repression that most Chinese have come to tolerate.
Over the past five years, stability maintenance, known as ''weiwen'' in Chinese, has become a multiagency juggernaut that relies on a sophisticated menu of Internet censorship, the harassment of blacklisted troublemakers and an industrial complex of paid informants and contractors. The vast bureaucracy extends from the Politiburo Standing Committee's chief law enforcer, Zhou Yongkang, to neighborhood ''safety patrol'' volunteers on the lookout for Falun Gong members and low-level clashes that can mushroom into large-scale disturbances.
The party has matched this tight fist with a buildup of mediation techniques and manpower within party organizations and a system of rewards and punishments for bureaucrats who fulfill -- or fail to meet -- social harmony goals.
The problem, critics say, is that the high-level pressures to achieve stability often force local officials to clamp down on the symptoms of social discontent rather than address the underlying inequities. That feeds a spiral of new abuses and controls. Just as troubling, legal scholars and judges say, is a party drive to prioritize defusing conflict over adjudication by law.
Yu Jianrong, a leading sociologist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, has been blogging and traveling the country to warn local officials that the fixation on weiwen fuels government mistrust. ''It is tantamount to drinking poison to quench one's thirst,'' he recently wrote in Caixin weekly.
During a study session last month for provincial and ministerial leaders, President Hu Jintao called for a mix of increased Internet controls and investment in local government services to reduce ''inharmonious factors to the minimum.''
Under a new five-year development plan, which is expected to be passed at the annual legislative sessions that begin this week in Beijing, officials pledge new ''social management'' mechanisms to pacify unrest.
Still, studies suggest such outbreaks have yet to subside.
Shanghai's Jiaotong University, in its annual report on crisis management released this year, tallied 72 ''major incidents'' of social unrest in 2010, compared with 60 in 2009. Crises hit the media faster too: about 33 percent were reported the day they occurred, 67 percent on the Internet.
Combating social instability is also increasingly costly.
China budgeted an estimated $77 billion for public security alone last year, according to a Tsinghua University study that was based on official police budgets, putting the costs of internal security almost on par with national defense spending. Some experts say the true number may be even higher.
Liaoning Province in northeastern China devoted 15 percent of its revenues to weiwen last year, according to media reports. Lianjiang, in southern Guangdong Province, acknowledged spending as much on stability maintenance in 2009 as it did in the previous five years combined.
''There's such a nervousness of letting things get out of control that even students complaining about the price of food in the school canteen will be reported as social instability,'' said David Kelly, a visiting scholar at Peking University who studies the stability maintenance system.
The strategy took root in the late 1990s as China grappled with mass layoffs caused by the privatization of state-owned enterprises, and accelerated in 2004 when a new brand of legal activism emerged in China and the color revolutions swept aside authoritarian rulers in the former Soviet republics.
But what began as a governing strategy morphed into an entrenched bureaucracy as China reacted to a series of pivotal challenges, including the 2008 Olympics, ethnic rioting in Tibet and Xinjiang, and Charter '08, a petition calling for Western-style democratic liberties that proliferated online and led to the jailing of Liu Xiaobo, the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who helped draft it.
While Mr. Hu has directed the push, the country's security and propaganda authorities have seized on such events ''to get as much money and power as possible,'' said an editor at a party publication who spoke off the record because he feared repercussions.
In the past few years, thousands of stability maintenance offices have opened, and more than 300,000 government functionaries have been enlisted in ''community service management,'' according to Xinhua, the state news service. Local officials have cycled through Beijing for instruction in tactics to disrupt the Internet and disperse crowds with talks rather than force, and for training in ''channeling public opinion.''
In an article last year in The Southern Daily newspaper, officials in Lianjiang boasted how the city had installed surveillance cameras at major intersections, hired several thousand neighborhood informants and established the ''Flying Tigers,'' a patrol of 340 young men recruited to assist the police in handling unrest.
A ''peace prize'' of up to $22 was awarded to local leaders who successfully stamped out trouble in their jurisdictions. As a result, officials said, there were no ''mass incidents'' in the first eight months of 2010, and the number of people filing complaints in Beijing dropped 25 percent.
''The facts demonstrate that stability can be bought,'' Xu Shun, the Lianjiang party secretary, told the newspaper.
Propaganda officials have come to consider the Internet the front line of defense against instability.
Central propaganda authorities determined in 2009 that local officials had two hours or less on average to contain news of ''sudden incidents'' from escalating on the Internet, though it remained a tough chore.
Under one government initiative, software engineers have been developing an automated system that can track trending topics and better pinpoint potentially disruptive news, according to industry experts.
''For example, at what point will a debate peak and drift more toward antigovernment sentiment?'' one executive said. ''They need to find the right time to step in and control it, but not appear too restrictive.''
Under the mandates of weiwen, judges and legal scholars say the judicial system has largely abandoned two decades of reform and returned to the Mao-era practice of mediation that many lawyers describe as coercive.
Judicial promotions are increasingly tied to the ability to settle or dismiss cases and prevent litigants from appealing court decisions or filing petitions -- an age-old form of redress in which the aggrieved file complaints with the authorities.
Carl Minzner, an expert in Chinese law at Washington University in St. Louis, said many courts will coerce plaintiffs into settling lawsuits regardless of the facts or will simply obstruct them from filing lawsuits in the first place. To illustrate this shift, he cited a ''model judge'' of 2010, Chen Yanping, who was lionized by the Supreme People's Court for using mediation to resolve 3,100 cases without a single appeal or petition.
The flow of money dedicated to stability has also spawned shady businesses like ''black jails,'' the extralegal holding pens for the petitioners who flood Beijing to file complaints against the authorities in their hometowns. The Chinese media have exposed how private security companies in the capital, some with connections to the police, have rounded up petitioners in Beijing on behalf of some 70 local governments.
Like the excesses of weiwen, the disproportionate crackdown on China's phantom Jasmine Revolution could also fuel new discontent. Last week the authorities in Beijing told some members of unauthorized churches not to gather on Sunday, and in cryptic conversations, they sought to dissuade foreign reporters from covering the rallies. Instead, they showed up in droves.
''Limiting people's freedom and trying to restrict the flow of information isn't dealing with the underlying problems China faces,'' said Pu Zhiqiang, a human rights lawyer who said he has been trailed for a week by plainclothes security agents. ''I think this strategy is only going to create more enemies of the government.''

HEADLINE: Oil Drilling To Resume In the Gulf's Deep Waters

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Interior Departmentsaid Monday that it had approved the first new deepwater drilling permit in the Gulf of Mexico since the BP explosion and spill last spring, a milestone after a period of intense uncertainty for industry and a wholesale remaking of the nation's system of offshore oil and gas regulation.
Michael R. Bromwich, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, said that Noble Energy had been granted permission to resume drilling in 6,500 feet of water off the coast of Louisiana. 
Work on the well was suspended, along with virtually all other drilling activity in water deeper than 5,000 feet, immediately after the Deepwater Horizon accident last April 20. The disaster killed 11 rig workers and spewed nearly five million barrels of oil into the ocean.
Still, there was no indication that drilling in the gulf would return anytime soon to levels preceding the BP well blowout.
Mr. Bromwich made clear that each new permit would be closely reviewed on a well-by-well basis and that the old system of rapid approvals of drilling permits had been permanently changed. Noble Energy said it expected to resume drilling by late March.
Approval of the Noble Energy application comes as oil prices are rising in response to unrest in the Middle East and North Africa and many in Congress and in industry are complaining of burdensome rules that are thwarting the development of domestic energy resources.
The interior secretary, Ken Salazar, plans to testify before Congress this week in defense of his department's budget and is certain to face harsh questioning about why it has taken so long to resume drilling in the gulf.
Judge Martin Feldman, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, recently ordered the Obama administration to move quickly on permits for new deepwater wells in the gulf, saying that the continuing delays were ''increasingly inexcusable.''
But in a conference call with reporters, Mr. Bromwich said that there were ''absolutely no politics associated with the approval of this application.'' He also said that the decision to grant Noble Energy the drilling permit was not a response to Judge Feldman's order; he said the department disagreed with the ruling and was preparing a legal response.
It is not clear how quickly federal regulators will move to on the six pending deepwater drilling permits or how soon the normal flow of applications will resume after a nearly yearlong halt to deepwater activity.
''We are taking these applications to drill as they come in,'' Mr. Bromwich said. ''Industry has been waiting for signals that in fact deepwater drilling will be allowed to resume and many will take this as that signal.''
''I have no idea how quickly new applications to drill will be filed,'' he added. ''I have no idea how long it will take to approve the next one or the next one after that or the next one after that.''
Mr. Bromwich noted that Noble's permit was the first in deep water since the BP accident but that 37 shallow-water applications had been approved over the last 10 months.
The decision was cautiously welcomed by the oil industry.
Gary Luquette, president of Chevron's North America exploration and production, called the permit ''a step in the right direction.'' But he added, ''It is time for the government to clear the backlog of deepwater drilling permit applications so industry can create the energy, jobs and economic growth our nation needs so badly.''
Lee Hunt, president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said the industry was seeking clarity on the pacing of additional permits. ''A permit for any well prohibited by the moratorium represents progress,'' he said. ''The question now is how quickly will they proceed to approve other permits that are awaiting approval.''
Mr. Hunt said that six deepwater permits were awaiting federal approval and that the industry could put 33 projects back in operation if companies could obtain permits.
At least six rigs affected by the drilling moratorium, imposed last June, have left the gulf to drill elsewhere.
Mr. Bromwich said that Noble had met new safety and environmental rules that were put in place after the spill and had a contract with a company that was capable of capping a blowout and handling a discharge of as much as 69,000 barrels a day -- roughly the same volume of oil that leaked from the crippled BP well for nearly three months.
The emergency well-capping system will be furnished by the Helix Well Containment Group, which Mr. Bromwich said was capable of meeting the government's spill response requirements for the Noble Energy well.
Mr. Salazar and Mr. Bromwich were briefed in Houston on Friday by Helix executives and representatives of another group developing a new oil spill response system. The second group, a consortium of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP, has developed a system meant to cap a well in up to 8,000 feet of water and collect 60,000 barrels of spilled oil a day.
The consortium is also working on a second system that by the end of the year will be capable of operating in up to 10,000 feet and contain 100,000 barrels a day.
Randall B. Luthi, former director of offshore drilling regulation at the Interior Department and now president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a drillers' trade group, said the approval came at a critical moment. ''With all the world-complicating factors, including rising oil prices, political turmoil in the Middle East and the loss of jobs in the Gulf of Mexico, this decision offers hope,'' he said.
Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, sounded a less magnanimous note. ''This slow-moving process continues to stifle domestic production and puts thousands of jobs at risk in the gulf and around the country,'' he said.
Senator Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who has pressed the administration to begin issuing deepwater permits at a steady clip, called the permit ''long overdue,'' adding ''I hope that this permit is the first of many to come, and I will continue to use every lever at my disposal to ensure that it is.''

HEADLINE: Pensions On the Move

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Lawmakers and governors in many states, faced with huge shortfalls in employee pension funds, are turning to a strategy that a lot of private companies adopted years ago: moving workers away from guaranteed pension plans and toward 401(k)-type retirement savings plans.
The efforts come as the governors of Wisconsin and Ohio, citing dire budget problems, are engaged in bitter showdowns with public-employee unions over wages, pensions and collective bargaining rights.
The new plans allow states to set a firm, upfront limit on the amount they will contribute and leave it up to the employee and the financial markets to make the money grow. In a traditional pension system, the employer promises a certain benefit, then must find a way to pay for it.
Like private employers, which in droves have terminated traditional pension plans, many government officials like the idea of shifting much of a pension plan's risk to the worker. And some workers prefer a 401(k)-type system because it gives them more control over their retirement assets, including the ability to take the money with them when they change jobs. 
Utah lawmakers voted last year to make a partial changeover to a 401(k)-type plan, following in the footsteps of Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio and several other states, which offer at least some version of it.
In February, Kentucky's Senate approved a full switch to a 401(k)-type plan, although the bill faces uncertain prospects in the House. In Oklahoma and Kansas, legislative committees will be studying the issue intensively over the next few weeks. Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas has made it clear he hopes the state Senate will embrace some form of a 401(k)-type plan. Texas is also considering a switch.
Utah decided to adopt a 401(k)-type plan after the stock market plunge in 2008 caused the shortfall in the state's pension plan to balloon to $6.5 billion.
''We said, 'O.K., how do we prevent this from happening again?' '' said Dan Liljenquist, a state senator who pushed for the changes. ''How do we eliminate the bankruptcy risk for our pension fund?''
Under the new plan, Mr. Liljenquist said, the state's retirement contributions for new workers will be roughly half that for current employees, potentially saving $5 million a year for every 1,000 new workers hired.
Still, these plans -- similar to 401(k)'s, but named after other sections of the tax code -- are not being embraced in states with the biggest pension problems like Illinois, California and New Jersey, which have shortfalls so immense that a switch would not solve their problem.
Unlike private companies, most states are constitutionally or contractually barred from changing the pension plans of current employees without their consent. So the new rules are generally voluntary or apply only to new employees.
In fact, switching workers to 401(k)-type plans can make the underfunding problem even worse. As contributions move to individual investment accounts, less money goes into the traditional plan to help finance pensions promised to other workers.
''There's no free lunch here,'' said Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ''People say, 'We can reduce our costs here if we have a defined-contribution system.' Well, if you do this, you still haven't done anything about your unfunded liabilities.''
California's problems are so acute that just last week a government-appointed commission of experts urged the state to consider at least a partial switch to 401(k) plans; six years ago, an effort by Arnold Schwarzenegger, then governor, to move new employees into such plans was blocked by local governments and public-employee unions.
The long-term benefits of restructuring pension systems are alluring to many public officials. The new governors of Florida and Kansas, Rick Scott and Mr. Brownback, and lawmakers in North Dakota, Oklahoma, Virginia and several other states are seriously discussing adopting 401(k)-type plans for state employees.
''Every state has to solve this problem or else there's going to be a very dire consequence,'' said Mike Mazzei, a Republican state senator in Oklahoma who heads the Senate select committee on pensions and is backing an overhaul of a system that faces $16 billion in unfunded obligations.
The push to switch to 401(k)-type plans comes overwhelmingly from Republicans, who see them as more individualistic and free market. Democrats generally oppose the change, partly because their union allies are eager to keep traditional plans.
Utah chose to take a hybrid approach to limit taxpayers' liability and keep money flowing into the old plan.
Starting July 1, new state workers will be able to choose either a traditional pension plan or a 401(k)-type plan, with the state contributing 10 percent of an employee's salary (12 percent for uniformed workers) to whichever plan a worker chooses. But there is an important twist: Utah will never pay more than 10 percent of a new employee's salary to the pension plan. If the plan becomes too underfunded, employees who have joined the plan will have to pay a percentage of their paycheck to help eliminate the shortfall.
The Utah plan is meant to give workers a choice, said Mr. Liljenquist, who became such an expert on pension overhauls during Utah's debate that lawmakers in other states have sought him out for advice.
''Some state workers who will just work for the state a few years -- take, say, bank examiners -- I imagine 75 percent of them will choose defined-contribution plans,'' he said, referring to 401(k)-type plans. ''And I think 90 percent of cops and firefighters and 75 percent of teachers will want a defined-benefit plan because they look at their government jobs as a single career.''
Casey Parry, 32, a research consultant in the Utah human resources department, would prefer the 401(k) option. ''It's hard when you're starting a job to make a decision whether to stay with an employer for 30 years,'' he said. ''I prefer the security of having a defined-contribution plan that I know I can take with me. It's under my control. I can plan for it.''
But Debra McBride, a Medicaid policy analyst who has worked for the state for 35 years, said she was happy with a traditional pension plan. ''I imagine that anyone who went through the recession with a 401(k) and saw the stock market nosedive wished they had a pension plan instead of a 401(k),'' she said.
Lawmakers considering changes are trying to balance competing needs. Georgia officials -- fearing that many employees would retire with paltry amounts in their plans -- stopped short of embracing a full-fledged 401(k) plan, setting up a hybrid plan different from Utah's. New employees join both a traditional pension plan, with a far less generous formula than the old formula, and a 401(k). The state contributes an automatic 1 percent of salary into the 401(k)-type plan and matches half of the next 4 percent that employees contribute.
''Georgia realized that having people solely in a 401(k), they have sole control and they might lose a lot of money in it,'' said Pamela L. Pharris, executive director of the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia, adding that such people eventually ''might become dependent on the state.''
The National Association of State Retirement Administrators has voiced support for traditional pension plans.
''Defined-contribution plans are a very unreliable vehicle for promoting retirement security,'' said Keith Brainard, the association's research director. ''Many workers don't know how to invest, many don't contribute enough to their 401(k)s, and many cash out much of what's in their 401(k) long before they retire, leaving them too little to live on when they retire.''
Mr. Brainard said it would be wiser for states to ask employees to contribute more toward underfunded plans than to switch to 401(k)-type plans. And in fact, some states have shored up their pension plans by requiring employees to pitch in more of their salary.
Despite the cautions, Bette Grande, a Republican state representative in North Dakota, vowed to continue pushing for 401(k)-type plans. Ms. Grande sponsored a bill to switch new employees entirely to such plans, but it was blocked by the House on Feb. 18. ''I think it's condescending to say that workers aren't wise enough to manage their own investments,'' said Ms. Grande, who said she would push to revive the bill. ''I refuse to think I'm going to have a bunch of teachers on welfare.''

HEADLINE: Though Personal Income Rises, Spending Increases Only Slightly

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A tax cut that began last month gave consumers the biggest jump in their incomes in nearly two years. But Americans increased their spending only slightly, a sign that many people are uncertain about the strength of the economy. 
That uncertainty in the economy was reinforced by a report from the National Association of Realtors, which said that fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in January.
In its report on spending and income, the Commerce Department said Monday that consumers increased spending 0.2 percent in January, the smallest gain since June. Personal incomes jumped 1 percent, reflecting the 2 percentage point reduction from the cut in Social Security taxes.
The small spending gain pushed total spending in January to an annual rate of $10.59 trillion, up 7.4 percent from the recession low hit in December 2008. Economists are counting on spending to continue increasing this year to provide support for the economic recovery.
The latest survey by the National Association for Business Economics, which was also released Monday, predicted consumer spending would rise 3.2 percent this year, up significantly from the actual spending gain of 1.8 percent in 2010.
The Social Security tax cut will give the typical family an additional $1,000 to spend this year. But the recent surge in gasoline prices has raised worries that consumers may need to spend the extra money on fuel, and not new goods and services.
The big rise in incomes and small increase in spending meant that the personal savings rate rose in January. Households saved 5.8 percent of their after-tax incomes, up from 5.4 percent in December. For all of 2010, the savings rate was 5.8 percent. That was down slightly from 5.9 percent in 2009. But it is well above the 2.1 percent savings rate in 2007, when Americans were spending freely as the value of their homes surged to record levels.
Since the housing bust and steep recession, Americans have been more cautious. The savings rate has more than doubled from the 2007 level. The effort to increase savings has been a drag on consumer spending. But economists say it should result in stronger spending in the future after consumers pay down debt and boost their savings enough to feel more secure.
Economists closely watch consumer spending because it accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.
In the final three months of 2010, the overall economy grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, the government reported Friday.
In the report on housing, the Realtors group said its index of sales agreements for previously occupied homes fell 2.8 percent last month, to a reading of 88.9 points.
That was higher than the 75.9 reading from June, the low point since the housing bust. But it is below 100, which is considered a healthy level. The last time it reached that point was in April, the final month people could qualify for a home-buying tax credit.
Sales of previously owned homes fell last year to the lowest level in 13 years. Economists say it will be years before the housing market fully recovers. High unemployment and a record number of foreclosures are deterring potential buyers, who fear home prices haven't reached the bottom.

We agree that the telecommunications cost recovery mechanisms should evolve for the 21st century (''New Rules for New Technology,'' editorial, Feb. 24). 
We must remember that it is because of the current system that 95 percent of consumers have access to some form of broadband. Under the existing subsidy system, small, independent companies serving rural communities are the innovators that have made it possible for the global economy to reach remote areas, creating jobs, investment and opportunity.
To further this administration's agenda for telecommunications, we agree that some things need to change. Broadband is the way to the future for all citizens of our country. Let's focus on adjusting the system and use that as a path forward.
While we support ferreting out inefficiency and fixing problems, the extreme examples of costly service cited in the editorial are an anomaly and do not portray the universal service program. Rural telecom leaders are open to dialogue and determined to find solutions that can work to achieve ubiquitous broadband deployment.

HEADLINE: The Budget and American Women

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The War on Women'' (editorial, Feb. 26) appropriately focuses on the assault on women's choices taking place in Congress.
Not since before Roe v. Wade, when women had no choices but to risk their lives if they chose to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, has there been such a disregard for the rights of women to control their bodies.
Not only are the budget bill's measures draconian as they relate to choosing a safe and affordable abortion if necessary, but by eliminating access to affordable contraception and family planning services, they would also take away women's ability to plan their reproductive lives responsibly. 
What is even more ironic and mean-spirited is the attempt to punish low-income women who choose to have their babies by cutting funds for programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (known as WIC) that help them raise healthy babies.
The American people would be better served if our elected representatives focused on getting the economy back on track and stopped interfering with the private lives of women.
Nancy K. Kaufman Chief Executive Officer National Council of Jewish Women New York, Feb. 26, 2011
To the Editor:
The Republican budget bill is not so much a ''War on Women'' as a ''War on the Poor.''
People who can afford it are able to secure contraception or have an abortion, and in the case of an unwanted pregnancy have the means to raise the child. For poorer people, an unintended pregnancy can devastate the lives of a whole family.
Pearl O. Hoberman New York, Feb. 26, 2011
To the Editor:
Your editorial synthesized what I see as a growing and troubling trend. Instead of moving forward as a society of enlightened and reasoned thinking, America seems to be reverting to conservatism that undermines all that has been gained in the last few decades.
From the recent attacks on women's rights, labor unions, the environment, education and health care, it is evident that the political right is using the current economic climate to justify its political agenda. Wake up, people!
Bonnie Slockett Teaneck, N.J., Feb. 26, 2011
To the Editor:
Your editorial ''The War on Women'' and Charles M. Blow's Feb. 26 column, ''The G.O.P.'s Abandoned Babies,'' together demonstrate how badly the budget cuts passed by the House of Representatives would hurt both women and children.
I think of my patient Angela, a 28-year-old working mother of three who came to me with an unintended pregnancy. She and her husband decided to carry the baby to term, despite the enormous strain a fourth child would put on the family. But, at 34 weeks, she delivered a stillborn.
Angela and her husband decided that an intrauterine device would be the best way to prevent future pregnancies and allow her time to heal.
But Angela's insurance didn't cover birth control. Fortunately, we have backup mechanisms in place, like Planned Parenthood and Title X clinics, that help women like Angela get access to and afford needed care when the primary care system fails.
These are the very clinics that the House of Representatives would shut down. We cannot allow this to happen.
Sarah Miller Fellow, Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health Bronx, Feb. 26, 2011
To the Editor:
I have just returned from India, where I've been working for the past several weeks to assist in launching a new family planning program. The work there is tough, but rewarding. I witnessed firsthand the skilled and empathetic care delivered to the nation's poorest women by doctors, nurses, social workers and counselors with the full support of the Indian government.
Imagine my shock to learn that while I was away the House had pushed through a budget that would eliminate support for Title X, the federal program that is the foundation of health care for the poorest of our nation's women.
It seems we are suffering from a bad case of what E. M. Forster called an ''undeveloped heart,'' which can only diminish us as a nation.

HEADLINE: Unintended, But Sound Advice

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
In Lewis Powell's now-famous memo to America's business community, which felt beleaguered in the political environment of 1971, the future Supreme Court justice stressed the importance of organizing.
''Strength lies in organization,'' he wrote, ''in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.''
Powell's memo points to the reason why there is such an effort now not just to extract concessions from public employee unions to help balance state budgets, but to actually crush those unions, to deprive them once and for all of the crucial and fundamental right to bargain collectively. 
When you talk to the workers who are hurting most in this epic downturn, they are overwhelmingly out there on their own. No one has their back. The corporate community and the politicians who do their bidding know better than anyone else that workers who are not organized are most often helpless. They have no leverage. They cannot demand raises or health and retirement benefits or paid vacations or sick leave. They cannot negotiate shorter hours or better working conditions. It's the boss's way or the highway.
It's not just pocketbook issues but the dignity of American workers that is at stake in the confrontations in Wisconsin, Ohio and elsewhere. These confrontations are about so much more than the right of public employees to bargain collectively, as important as that is. This most recent assault on labor is part of an anti-worker movement that has been on the march for decades. Jobs have been shipped overseas. Workers have been denied their rightful share of productivity gains. Wages have been depressed and benefits in many, many instances have disappeared.
It's true that states are facing serious fiscal problems, crises in some cases, but a much bigger threat to America as we've known it is the increasing inability of hard-working men and women to earn enough to maintain a middle class standard of living, even as the corporate sector is thriving. The economic lives of the poor and an ever-widening portion of the middle class have become maddeningly insecure as the wealth of the society has been funneled, increasingly and unconscionably, to those at the top.
There was no net job creation during the first 10 years of the 21st century, and median incomes fell during that period, an abysmal record unmatched by any similar period in the modern post-World War II era.
I have long believed that virtually all workers should be organized, whether they were actually in a union or not. The man or woman who goes home after a long shift with barely enough to pay bills and nothing put away for an emergency, and who knows that he or she could be terminated at any moment for any reason, is subject to a permanent state of anxiety. There should be someone, some group or organization, to turn to for advice and support.
Unemployed workers who show up fully qualified to apply for a job only to be told that the prospective employer will not even consider someone who is already out of work should not have to feel that there is absolutely no alternative, that it is impossible to fight back. American workers should not be treated as if they don't matter.
Working America is a pro-worker advocacy organization affiliated with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. that has signed up millions of nonunion members in an effort to increase the organized reach of workers. Much more organizing, on myriad fronts, is desperately needed.
Millions of Americans throughout the country are facing extreme economic hardship. The Community Service Society in New York City does an annual survey of low-income residents. Twenty-seven percent of respondents to its most recent survey said they had lost a job; 26 percent had had their hours, wages or tips reduced; 23 percent said they had often skipped meals because they did not have enough money to buy food; and 26 percent said they had been unable to fill a needed prescription because of a lack of money or insurance.
One of the saddest things I've read in The New York Times recently was a comment by Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, who said that he views the current hostility toward unions by members of the general public as a sign of the erosion of the aspirational nature that has for so long characterized Americans. ''It shows a hopelessness,'' he said. ''It used to be, 'You have something I don't have; I'll go to my employer to get it, too. Now I don't see any chance of getting it. I don't want to be the lowest one on the totem pole, so I don't want you to have it either.' ''
Lewis Powell's advice to the corporate community in 1971 is -- though he certainly never intended it to be -- the best advice I can think of for workers today who are fighting to hold off the tide of lower living standards. It is not a struggle that can possibly be won alone.

HEADLINE: Altering Stand on Health Law, Obama Offers Waiver Option

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and KEVIN SACK; Sheryl Gay Stolberg reported from Washington, and Kevin Sack from Atlanta. Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, who has stood by his landmark health care law through court attacks and legislative efforts to repeal it, told the nation's governors on Monday that he was willing to amend the measure to give states the ability to opt out of its most controversial requirements right from the start, including the mandate that most people buy insurance.
In remarks to the National Governors Association, Mr. Obama said he supported legislation that would allow states to obtain waivers from the mandate as soon as it took effect in 2014, as long as they could find another way to expand coverage without driving up health care costs. Under the current law, states must wait until 2017 to obtain waivers.
The announcement is the first time Mr. Obama has called for altering a central component of his signature health care law, although he has backed removing a specific tax provision that both parties regard as onerous on business. 
But the prospects for the proposal appear dim. Congress would have to approve the change through legislation, and House Republican leaders said Monday that they were committed to repealing the law, not amending it. Even if the change were approved, it could be difficult for states to meet the federal requirements for the waivers.
The White House described the proposal, based on a bipartisan bill recently introduced in the Senate, as a common-sense date change that would give states the freedom to innovate and act as laboratories. Mr. Obama called it ''a reasonable proposal,'' telling the governors, ''It will give you flexibility more quickly while still guaranteeing the American people reform.''
Political calculations, as much as policy ones, were at work in the president's announcement. The shift comes as the health care law -- and the mandate in particular -- is under fierce attack in the courts, where federal judges have issued conflicting opinions on its constitutionality. The mandate is also a rallying cry for conservatives and Tea Party supporters, who regard it as a prime example of overreaching by the federal government.
Mr. Obama has been trying to reposition himself in the political center on some issues in the wake of the drubbing his party took in the November midterm elections; dropping his insistence on the mandate is one way to do that. And with governors pressing the administration to allow them to cut Medicaid rolls to ease their fiscal distress -- a step Mr. Obama does not want to take -- the president is trying to look flexible in other ways.
But Mr. Obama's flexibility goes only so far. ''I am not open to refighting the battles of the last two years,'' he said, ''or undoing the progress that we've made.''
Mr. Obama's announcement did not appear to appease his Republican critics. The House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, told reporters that the health law was ''an impediment to job growth'' and that Republicans remained committed to its repeal.
And while some Republican governors praised Mr. Obama for reaching out, they said the move did not address their underlying discomfort with the law or the major structural flaws facing state budgets. In meeting with the governors, Mr. Obama also asked them to come up with a bipartisan group to find ways to reduce Medicaid costs.
''I was disappointed,'' said Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, chairman of the Republican Governors Association. ''Pretty much all he did was to reset the clock on what many of us consider a ticking time bomb that is absolutely going to crush our state budgets. The states need more than that.''
Some Democrats also reacted warily. Many are convinced that it is not possible to expand health care coverage and achieve deficit reductions without the federal mandate, and they worry that amending the law would be tantamount to weakening it.
Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee wrote a bill that included an idea similar to the one Mr. Obama proposed, issued a tepid statement saying he would consider it.
''We want to give states as much flexibility as possible,'' Mr. Baucus said, ''but that flexibility shouldn't fail to ensure that Americans in every state have access to quality, affordable health care.''
The White House said the proposal was unrelated to the challenges to the constitutionality of the mandate. But encouraging states to pursue alternative ways of expanding coverage could prove useful should the Supreme Court ultimately rule that the mandate is unconstitutional.
At the same time, the mandate, and the health care law more generally, is sure to be an issue in the president's 2012 re-election campaign, which may be a reason he is offering the proposal now.
''It's to his advantage to show that he wants to be more moderate on this,'' said Dan Mendelson, a health policy expert who worked in the Clinton administration, ''because the mandate is terribly unpopular politically and he doesn't want to be saddled with that going into the next election.''
The bipartisan legislation that Mr. Obama is now embracing was first proposed in November, eight months after the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, by Senators Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts. Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, a Democrat, is now a co-sponsor.
The legislation would allow states to opt out earlier from a range of requirements, including the mandate, if they could demonstrate that other methods would allow them to cover as many people, with insurance that is as comprehensive and affordable, as provided by the new law. The changes must also not increase the federal deficit.
If states can meet those standards, they can ask to circumvent minimum benefit levels, structural requirements for insurance exchanges and the mandates that most individuals obtain coverage and that employers provide it. Washington would then help finance a state's individualized health care system with federal money that would otherwise be spent there on insurance subsidies and tax credits.
Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, has proposed similar legislation in the House, but he said in an interview Monday that his bill had no Republican co-sponsors, making its prospects for passage uncertain at best. Still, Mr. Welch called Mr. Obama's announcement ''extremely significant,'' adding that the waivers were ''an act of empowerment for the states.''
In Vermont, Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, is exploring the idea of using a waiver to create a so-called single-payer system, a government-run health care plan.
Such a plan, dubbed the public option in last year's health care debate, would never have passed Congress. But Mr. Welch said he saw no reason Vermont should not get a waiver to establish one.
''My Republican friends argue that you should drive power and responsibility for implementation to the local level, and they're right,'' Mr. Welch said.
Health economists have mixed views on how difficult it would be to expand coverage and hold down costs in the absence of a mandate.
Jon Gruber of M.I.T. published a recent analysis arguing that eliminating the mandate would ''significantly erode the gains in public health and insurance affordability'' made possible by the health care law. But David Cutler of Harvard said that ''given the uncertainty generated by the mandate, it was reasonable'' to let states experiment with other ways to achieve the law's broad goals ''and let the evidence decide'' if the mandate is necessary.
When the health measure was moving through Congress last year, its authors set 2017 as the date that such experimentation could begin, based on an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, which said it would take three years of experience to determine how much a state should receive in unrestricted block grants if it opted out of aspects of the law.
Otherwise, the budget analysts advised last year, the legislation's 10-year cost estimate would be about $4 billion higher because Washington would probably have to make higher than needed payments to states. Senior administration officials said they had not discussed where to find the additional $4 billion, but described it as ''not a lot of money'' compared with the estimated $1 trillion, 10-year cost of the law.

HEADLINE: In Shadow of 1995 Shutdown, G.O.P. Freshmen Stand Firm

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The specter of the 1995 government shutdown hangs over Capitol Hill, a memory many hoped to leave behind, along with beepers and episodes of ''Baywatch Nights.''
That budget battle has become the central reference point for the fiscal fight that begins in earnest this week. For veteran Republicans, including some of today's party leaders, being blamed for the shutdown was a searing experience, one they have long endeavored to avoid repeating.
But for some lawmakers in the new Republican freshman class, the circumstances and stakes of a budget showdown are quite different today. They frame their mission less as a one-term spending fight than as a crusade to redefine the role of the federal government in American life. 
Many freshmen believe a government shutdown should -- and indeed will -- be avoided. ''I am committed to finding that point at which we can make reductions and get this fiscal ship turned around while finding a way to keep government from shutting down,'' said Representative Kevin Yoder of Kansas.
But a far greater failure, many freshmen lawmakers say, would be to capitulate on the only issue many of them ran on. Arguing that the nation's economic conditions and their mandate from voters demand bold solutions, the freshmen's resolve may give the House speaker, John A. Boehner, less maneuvering room in the hopes of averting a shutdown.
''I don't believe now and 1995 are similar times,'' said Representative Lou Barletta, a freshman from Pennsylvania. ''Back then it was more about how to balance the budget. Now it is about how to keep the country from going broke. Unemployment was much lower than now. The debt was 5 trillion. Now it is 14 trillion. In 1995 the Congress wanted to get its house in order. Now it's the American people that want that, and that's the only reason why we are here.''
The House and Senate will probably avoid a shutdown in the short term, with a spending plan that includes $4 billion in cuts and that finances the government through March 18; the House is set to vote on that measure on Tuesday.
Throughout the opening weeks of this Congress, the freshmen have exerted a palpable influence, upsetting the plans of their leaders on a number of fronts. On no issue have they been more vocal than on budget cutting and reducing the size of government. Before proposing the two-week budget deal last week, Mr. Boehner and other Republican leaders conducted a conference call with the 87 freshmen members to explain their thinking, and get their blessing -- a testament to the power of the class.
But beyond the short-term plan, the House and Senate must still wrangle over how to finance the government for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, and freshmen are still bent on cutting at least $61 billion in federal spending.
On Monday night, Mr. Boehner met with Senate majority leader Harry Reid to discuss budget matters.
While the freshmen members disagree within their own caucus over which specific programs need to be cut, they agree that the government should reduce its role substantially in areas ranging from environmental regulations and education to public broadcasting and the arts. They feel that their credibility is on the line.
''This is not just some academic exercise for me,'' said Representative Todd Rokita, a freshman from Indiana. ''I am trying to actually shrink scope and size of government.''
He added, ''If Harry Reid comes back and says no spending cuts, no nothing, at that point I feel I have no choice given what I ran on, given what I got 70 percent of the vote on, I have to shut down the government.''
As Republican lawmakers returned this week to Washington after a week in their districts, they had perhaps even more determination than when they left. In town hall-style meetings and constituent coffees, they said, the refrain remained the same. There was ''universal agreement that the issues facing our country right now are very critical,'' said Representative Steve Womack, a freshman from Arkansas, and voters encouraged him to ''stand our ground and stay the course.''
To some degree, the view of 1995 depends on each member's experience at that time. Representative Trey Gowdy, another freshman, was a federal prosecutor in South Carolina.
''I remember it like it was yesterday,'' he said, ''having conversations with my fellow prosecutors about whether or not we had a job to come to and whether we were essential. My supervisor assured us we were not.'' As such, Mr. Gowdy said, a shutdown, ''will not be good for people who are innocent bystanders.''
In contrast, Mr. Rokita ''was 25 years old, in my last year of law school at an all-male college, so my mind was on my career and women and not so much the federal government.'' He said that the difference in temperament between Mr. Boehner and Newt Gingrich, the speaker in 1995, was critical: ''Boehner is not sticking fingers in people's eyes.''
What is more, in the view of Mr. Rokita and some other freshmen, their attitudes are getting a far broader and sympathetic airing than those of their Republican brethren of 1995.
''Quite honestly, the major newspapers had a stranglehold on political news in 1995,'' Mr. Rokita said. ''Now you have cable on both sides. People can much more easily choose the news they watch, and I am able to get my messaging out, or I can at least make a case.''
In November 1995, President Bill Clinton vetoed a continuing resolution that would have kept the government running amid a budget impasse, resulting in a partial shutdown.
Today, the party's leaders are promoting the message that cuts can be made through a compromise with Democrats that would avoid a costly, disruptive and damaging shutdown. Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and majority leader, said as much Monday in a meeting with reporters. ''We can keep the government open and cut spending,'' he said.
Representative James Lankford, a freshman from Oklahoma, said, ''I never hear John Boehner talking about a shutdown, and I never have.'' Whether it will come to that will be determined in the weeks to come.
''It's unknowable,'' said Representative David Schweikert of Arizona, another freshman. ''We have to see where the Senate comes back. A shutdown is not out of the question.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans For Trade Are Stalled

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama has made expanding exports a centerpiece of his plan for accelerating the economic recovery, but in recent weeks, his trade agenda has nearly ground to a halt amid partisan feuding.
Although the White House renegotiated a pivotal free-trade agreement with South Korea in December, scoring rare bipartisan praise, House Republican leaders have refused to allow the deal to move forward. They want the administration to make progress first on similar accords with Colombia and Panama that face stiff opposition from labor unions and liberal Democrats.
To add to the pressure on the administration, House Republicans in February blocked a big expansion of trade adjustment assistance -- which provides cash, training, relocation, job search and other benefits to workers displaced by globalization -- from being renewed. Many of the 220,000 workers who took part in the program last year could have their benefits reduced as a result.
Another program, which gives duty-free preferences to 4,800 products from poor countries that are allies of the United States, expired in December after a Republican senator, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, blocked a vote to extend it. Mr. Sessions acted partly at the behest of a sleeping-bag manufacturer in his state, which argued that the preferences put it at a disadvantage. 
Taken together, the disputes amount to a stalemate on what Mr. Obama has called a critical priority: expanding American competitiveness in manufacturing and other export-related sectors.
''In 30 years I have not seen trade policy in such disarray as it is now,'' said Howard F. Rosen, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research organization here.
The standoffs have come to overshadow what trade proponents had seen as a major accomplishment: the completion in December of a free-trade agreement with South Korea, the largest such deal since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994.
The Korea agreement was originally negotiated and signed in 2007, under President George W. Bush. But Democrats in Congress refused to give approval to the agreement, saying that it did not do enough to open market access for American autos and beef.
Under the revised agreement reached in December, both countries gave themselves more time to eliminate their tariffs on autos; the deal gained the support of the Ford Motor Company and the United Auto Workers, which had opposed the earlier version.
Republicans now want the administration to make similar progress on trade agreements that were reached with Colombia in 2006 and Panama in 2007. Although both economies are far smaller than Korea's, the Colombia accord in particular has been an emotional flashpoint for labor unions, which cite a legacy of violence against labor leaders in Colombia.
Most experts agree that the violence has abated recently, and Colombia's new president, Juan Manuel Santos, who took office in August, has made completion of the trade deal a priority. Mr. Obama expressed support for completing the Colombia and Panama deals in his State of the Union address in January, and his trade representative, Ron Kirk, said the goal was to complete the deals by the end of the year.
But House Republican leaders say that while they support the new focus on completing the Colombia deal, it has already taken far too long.
''We've made it clear that the time has run out on Colombia and Panama,'' said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, who leads the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. ''It is time to move on them, along with Korea, in the first six months of this year.''
Mr. Brady said the three deals had to be submitted to Congress as a package. ''It would do great damage to our bipartisan efforts on trade if the administration sends Korea up by itself right now,'' he said.
Administration officials have met with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and Human Rights Watch and with officials in Colombia, in what Mr. Kirk called an intensified effort to get the work done. And on Friday, Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who leads the Finance Committee, which oversees trade, met with Colombian union leaders.
But House Republicans say those gestures have not yielded specific results. Along with declining to support Korea as a stand-alone deal, they have tried to turn up the pressure to complete the two Latin American deals by refusing to support other trade programs.
Two such programs expired Feb. 12: a two-year-old expansion of Trade Adjustment Assistance, which dates to 1962 and helps workers dislocated by free trade, and the Andean Trade Preference Act, which gave Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru duty-free access to segments of the American market in exchange for help in reducing the production of narcotics.
The administration has called for Congress to immediately renew the trade adjustment aid, without preconditions. ''As a result of this inaction, 155,000 Americans will lose access to the job training they need to provide for their families and compete in the global economy,'' said Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council. But so far Republicans have not budged.
''It's absolutely reprehensible,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, who said workers were suffering as a result of Republican obstruction. ''They should not hold people who are dislocated hostage to a trade agreement, or anything else.''
White House officials also said the Republican maneuvers were counterproductive: The Andean preferences, which began in 1991, have lapsed just as the United States was trying to get Colombia to strengthen labor protections as part of the negotiations to revise the 2006 agreement.
A third program, the Generalized System of Preference, also has expired, but for parochial reasons, not partisan ones. Mr. Sessions, the Alabama senator, blocked the program from being renewed past its Dec. 31 expiration unless changes were made to protect Exxel Outdoors, a sleeping-bag manufacturer with a plant in Haleyville, Ala., from competition in Bangladesh.
''Why should my government make laws that are detrimental to American workers?'' asked Harry Kazazian, the company's owner.
The preference system, which began in 1976, is intended to help developing countries by allowing duty-free entry for certain products. Mr. Kazazian says his product -- sleeping bags -- should not be included in the program, but a quasi-judicial agency, the United States International Trade Commission, has disagreed. Most sleeping bags in the United States are imported from China, and indeed, Mr. Kazazian controls a sleeping-bag plant there.
All three programs -- Trade Adjustment Assistance, the Andean preferences and the Generalized System of Preference -- could well be renewed if the Colombia and Panama deals move forward. And the White House says it has made progress on other fronts, including talks on a proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would link the United States to economies from Chile to Singapore, and on reviving the long-stalled Doha round of world trade negotiations.

HEADLINE: With Its Eye on China, Japan Builds Up Military

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
NAHA AIR BASE, Japan -- This sun-baked airfield was built atop Okinawa's rocky coral by Americans during the cold war, but these days its roaring jets proudly display the red sun of Japan.
The Japanese F-15 fighters are engaged in an increasingly busy, and at times tense, game of cat-and-mouse with rapidly modernizing China, just across the East China Sea. The pilots say they face intrusions into Japanese-controlled airspace by an array of increasingly sophisticated Chinese aircraft, including advanced fighters like the Russian-made Su-27.
''You cannot let down your guard when you fly up against an Su-27,'' said Maj. Gen. Masashi Yamada, commander of Naha's squadron of 24 fighters.
General Yamada will soon get additional help. In December, Tokyo announced plans to strengthen its forces in the southwestern Okinawan islands, including adding a dozen F-15s in Naha. The increase is part of a broader shift in Japanese defensive stance southward, toward China, that some analysts are calling one of Japan's biggest changes in postwar military strategy. 
This strategic shift is another step in a gradual and limited buildup of Japan's forces, aimed at keeping up with the changing power balance in Asia while remaining within the bounds of Japan's antiwar Constitution and the constraints of its declining economic power. Political analysts say Japan is slowly raising the capabilities of its forces to respond to a more assertive China and a nuclear-armed North Korea -- and to take a first, halting step out of the shadow of the United States, its postwar protector, which many Japanese fear may one day no longer have the will or ability to defend Japan.
''This is all part of an agonizing soul-searching by Japan,'' said Yuichi Hosoya, a professor of international politics at Keio University in Tokyo. ''Japan feels itself caught between the reality of Chinese power and questions about U.S. commitments in East Asia.''
Japan's new national defense guidelines scrapped the cold war-era strategy of amassing land forces on the northern island of Hokkaido, where they were dug in against a Soviet invasion, in favor of building a more mobile force focused on defending its islands and vast seas in the south. To do this, Japan will strengthen its sea and air forces by adding submarines and helicopter-carrying ships that resemble small aircraft carriers, acquiring next-generation fighter planes and creating a new amphibious infantry unit that Tokyo says would be used to thwart an invasion of outlying islands.
Political analysts are quick to point out that at least for now this is not a full-blown military buildup by Japan, a former colonial power whose pacifist Constitution constrains it to purely defensive forces. They say there is not strong public support for changing the Constitution to allow a full-fledged military, something that former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe tried and failed to do four years ago.
The increases are also limited by Japan's own economic weakening: its military spending has been shrinking for the past decade along with the size of its overall economy, with little prospect of future increases. Japan's defense budget has decreased 5.2 percent since 2001 to 4.68 trillion yen, or $56.4 billion at current rates, though it is still estimated to be one of the five or six largest in the world. To pay for its planned strengthening in the south, Tokyo will cut hundreds of tanks and artillery pieces in the north, and slightly reduce Japan's current number of 155,000 ground troops.
Given its limits, Japan's strategy for now appears for it to become a fuller military partner of the United States, which maintains 50,000 military personnel in Japan. Japanese planners now speak of a division of labor between the two militaries, in which a more robust Japan carries a greater load in areas like anti-submarine warfare, freeing up the Americans to focus elsewhere. The December guidelines also call for ''integrating'' Japanese and American forces by sharing command centers and intelligence.
Analysts say Tokyo seeks to bind the two militaries together in order to keep the United States engaged in East Asia, and from becoming too distracted by its financial crisis and war in Afghanistan.
''Japan is strengthening itself as an alliance partner,'' said Richard J. Samuels, an expert on Japanese security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ''while also hedging against the day when U.S. capabilities might slip below U.S. commitments.''
Indeed, Japan seems to have reached a new consensus about the need to remain close to the United States, even while strengthening itself. The governing party, the left-leaning Democrats, briefly experimented with pulling away from Washington under former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who in 2009 called for taking Japan closer to China, and clashed with Washington over an air base in Okinawa.
However, his successor, Prime Minister Naoto Kan, has worked to regain Washington's trust. China also inadvertently pushed Japan back toward the United States in September, when Beijing's heavy-handed pressuring of Tokyo to release a detained Chinese trawler captain surprised and angered many Japanese.
''China has misplayed its hand in the last year, and that has forced the Democratic Party to get more realistic about regional security issues,'' said Akihisa Nagashima, a Democratic lawmaker who until recently held the No. 3 spot at the Ministry of Defense. ''We don't want overdependence on the United States, but we also need the United States.''
Analysts say one goal of Japan's new strategy is to make its military a more visible presence, to discourage China from trying to extend its reach into waters now controlled by Japan. While Japan has one of most sophisticated militaries in Asia, and the region's most respected navy, it has long been careful to keep its euphemistically named Self-Defense Forces largely out of sight to avoid threatening neighbors victimized by Japan's early 20th century empire-building.
For now, at least some of its neighbors appear willing to accept a larger Japanese military presence. The new Japanese strategy received very little opposition in South Korea, which analysts say now sees China, and also North Korea, as bigger threats than Japan. In fact, South Korea and Japan are now negotiating their first military cooperation agreements since Japan's colonial rule ended in 1945.
''If anything, we now need a stronger Japan to maintain the regional security balance,'' said Park Young-June, a Japanese security expert at the Korea National Defense University in Seoul.
In Okinawa, the Maritime Self-Defense Force, Japan's navy, says that it now conducts regular air patrols of areas disputed by China and Japan, including gas fields in the East China Sea and the Senkakus, a group of uninhabited islands claimed by both nations but administered by Japan. In April, the Japanese navy also monitored a flotilla of 10 Chinese warships that steamed through waters near Okinawa, and the Chinese sent a helicopter to buzz a shadowing Japanese warship.
''There has been a dramatic increase in Chinese naval activity in our area,'' said Rear Adm. Tadayoshi Takahashi, the commander of the navy's air wing that shares Naha Air Base with the Air Self-Defense Forces, Japan's air force.
To strengthen its position on Okinawa and nearby islands, the Self-Defense Forces are building new radar stations and antimissile batteries. Two years ago, Tokyo replaced Naha Air Base's outdated squadron of Vietnam War-era F-4 fighters with its current F-15s, and put the base under the command of Lt. Gen. Hidetoshi Hirata, one of the Japanese air force's top officers, with a Ph.D. from Stanford.
''It takes time for change to happen,'' said General Hirata, ''but Japan is realizing the importance of what is going on down here in Okinawa.''

HEADLINE: For Schools, A Source Of Supplies At No Cost

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Talim Johnson inched along toward the check-out counter, looking over her school's shopping list to make sure she had not missed anything. Construction paper. Colored paper of various thicknesses and textures. File holders. Three-ring binders. Posters to brighten up the hallways.
And a mannequin. ''This is a hot item,'' said Ms. Johnson, who teaches at the High School for Fashion Industries in Manhattan. 
She was not shopping at a mall or a Costco, but at a warehouse in Long Island City, Queens, where everything, like paint, binders, squares of Coach leather and, yes, the mannequins, is free.
The warehouse, the heart of a program known as Materials for the Arts, has been around for 32 years, offering new and gently used donated supplies to artists, nonprofit groups and, more recently, public schools. During good economic times, the place was a nice extra for the thousands of principals, teachers and volunteer parents who have visited, a trip along its wide aisles a treasure hunt of sorts.
During lean times, it has also become a purveyor of necessary items.
When the walls at Public School 105 in the Morris Park section of the Bronx needed a fresh coat of paint, Anna Cheina, a fifth-grade arts teacher, found a few gallons there. When Joseph Pagano, a drama teacher at P.S. 150 in Sunnyside, Queens, was looking to recreate the burning of the scarecrow for the school's spring production of ''The Wizard of Oz,'' he used the battery-operated candles he found at the warehouse to light up the stage.
A former principal at Banana Kelly High School in the South Bronx once picked up filing cabinets and desks for his office. A few months ago, Karen Feuer, the principal at P.S. 110 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, got chairs and shelves for the school's library and benches to line the walls of a room that doubles as line-up space on bad weather days.
''You go there for the things you need,'' Ms. Feuer said, ''but there's always something unexpected, something that you would have never imagined you could find there, and that you end up taking with you.''
Because offerings are impossible to predict, the element of surprise has shaped shopping habits over time. Instead of settling on a idea and then going to the warehouse in search of the materials that suit it, teachers and school volunteers are more likely to let their discoveries define the project they will undertake.
''Clear buttons?'' Donna Gyurko, who runs an after-school arts program at P.S. 321 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, asked her shopping companion, Cathy Hundt, who has a son in second grade at the school.
Ms. Hundt hesitated, but Ms. Gyurko tossed the buttons in their cart anyway, telling her, ''We never know what we're going to make with the stuff when we're here, but we'll find use for this.''
The merchandise is displayed in categories on metal shelves at the 35,000-square-foot warehouse at the corner of Northern Boulevard and 33rd Street.
The inventory is varied: one can find office supplies, like tape holders and index tabs. There have been household items, like a Beck's beer mug and an old Waring blender that still worked. And there have been computer routers donated by McKinsey and Company, black lacquer dressers donated by Columbia Pictures, holiday ornaments given by Macy's and pieces of leather from Coach, and zippers, feathers and hats.
The place depends on donations, which have decreased with the economic slowdown, even if visits have not, the program's executive director, Harriet Taub, said.
Staff members from nearly 650 schools visited the warehouse last year, the second highest number of schools to have made use of the program since 2005, according to its statistics. (The highest number, 697, was in 2009. The lowest, 492, was in 2005.)
Film production companies are among the most reliable contributors, Ms. Taub said. In 2010, the warehouse received 87 lamps from ''The Smurfs,'' a movie set for release this year, and it often receives props from the set of the HBO series ''In Treatment'' and the CW Network's ''Gossip Girl.''
On Wednesday, the celebrity chef Rachael Ray donated some cafe tables, chairs, a custom-made food preparation island and props from the set of her television show.
Materials for the Arts has a truck and two drivers, who pick up donations five days a week, four to five times a day, anywhere in the city's five boroughs; sometimes the team even goes to the suburbs for high-demand items like fabric and paper.
The warehouse is open for drop-offs on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and the program runs a password-protected online exchange. In a processing room, the items are weighed and valued, and donor information is recorded, so whoever claims the items later can send a thank-you note, the only price to be paid.
Creativity is required, too, to realize that a humdrum stack of wire hangers could become puppet bodies and that the frame of a lamp shade can become the base of a planetary mobile.
Materials for the Arts is run by the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, with support from the Sanitation Department, because repurposing items helps reduce waste, and the Education Department, which joined the effort in 1998 and pays $145,000 a year so that schools can take advantage of the offerings.
Paul King, executive director for the office of arts and special projects at the Education Department, said that after consecutive years of budget cuts the program had allowed principals and teachers ''to offset costs and reallocate funds to other stuff they wouldn't be able to get for free.''
Ms. Johnson, the visual arts teacher, has found not only mannequins there, but also Styrofoam heads she has used to teach perspective to her students, as well as a wicker house, fake flowers and other trinkets her class uses for the six displays it creates each year for the school's big windows overlooking West 24th Street.
''It's either coming here,'' she said, ''or settling for pencil and lined paper to teach my class.''

HEADLINE: Oscar or Not, Children Face Deportation From Israel

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
TEL AVIV -- The children in the kindergarten class were taking their new celebrity status in stride on Monday, singing a Hebrew song about patience hours after a movie about their school, Bialik-Rogozin in south Tel Aviv, won the Academy Award for best short documentary in Los Angeles.
The school, which is state-supported, caters to the children of migrant workers and refugees from 48 countries. For many of them it is a safe haven from daily hardships and, in some cases, traumatic pasts. 
Although the American-made documentary, ''Strangers No More,'' celebrates the school's atmosphere of diversity and tolerance as it tries to integrate the children into Israeli life, there is an ominous subtext to the story that was not explored in the movie. Of the school's 828 pupils, ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, 120 are facing deportation with their families because they do not meet government criteria for obtaining legal status.
Despite all the school's attention from the Oscar, Israel's Interior Ministry said Monday that the government's preparations for dealing with the children of illegal residents were in their final stages and that the plan would be carried out in the coming weeks.
Among the potential deportees is Esther, 12, one of the stars of the movie, who came to Israel from South Africa at the age of 8. An appealing girl with big dark eyes, Esther was brought here by her father after her mother was murdered, teachers said. Interviewed at school on Monday, she said she was happy with the way the movie turned out.
''I want everyone to know about me and about the school,'' said Esther, whose favorite subjects are Hebrew and mathematics, ''but not the reason why I came.'' A staff member who accompanied her said she did not want to discuss the threat of deportation, either.
Last summer, the Israeli cabinet laid down guidelines for granting legal status to the children of people who have entered Israel with a valid visa or permit but have stayed on illegally. The criteria grant permanent residency visas to children of migrants if they attend school, they speak Hebrew, their parents entered the country legally and they have resided in Israel for at least five years.
Under those rules, up to 400 children and their families living in Israel are not qualified to remain.
A spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry said that since August the government had considered more than 700 requests from people appealing their expected deportation.
Most, including Esther and her father, who are a year short of meeting the criteria, have not received word about their fate.
In Israel, a country of 7.5 million people, the idea of deporting children has become the subject of emotional debate. It is estimated that there are as many as 300,000 foreign laborers in Israel, about half of them without valid documents. Many have entered legally to work in construction, agriculture and domestic jobs, but have outstayed their visas. Their numbers have swelled as African refugees and economic migrants have crossed the border from Egypt over the past several years.
Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has described the illegal migration in the past as ''a threat'' that could ''flood the foundation of the Zionist state.''
Others here say that Israel, a nation of Jewish refugees, should show more compassion, especially for Hebrew-speaking children who consider themselves Israeli and have not known any other home. ''I cannot believe that we do not have room in our territory or in our hearts for these children,'' said Rotem Ilan, the founder of Israeli Children, a nongovernmental volunteer organization that helps the children of immigrant families. ''We let them go through the Israeli school system, and then we are surprised that they feel Israeli and want to stay?''
The directors of the documentary, Karen Goodman and Kirk Simon, could not immediately be reached for comment. Asked why ''Strangers No More'' did not broach the subject of the threatened deportations, Mr. Simon told The Jerusalem Post's Friday magazine that ''because our film was going to take over a year to produce, we thought that dramatizing an issue that might be resolved, or change, or evolve, could hurt its long-term viewership potential.''
Bialik-Rogozin is supported by the Tel Aviv-Jaffa municipality and the Ministry of Education. Ron Huldai, the mayor of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, told Israel Radio on Monday that the school slowly began to become a center for the children of foreign workers about 15 years ago. ''When I became mayor we made things formal,'' he said, ''not to ignore them but to care for them, and there were wonderful people who joined and helped.''
Over the past six years or so, the rate of children passing their matriculation exams at the school has almost doubled to about 78 percent, according to Nechama Seinberg, one of the school's deputy principals.
Meanwhile, Gila Benarzi, a staff member, said that winning an Oscar had imbued the school with a ''feeling of euphoria and hope,'' adding, ''The children are proud.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo Seeks to Cap Pay for School Superintendents

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey saluted a number of other governors, including Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, last week for making tough decisions in tough economic times.
On Monday, Mr. Christie had one more reason to applaud his counterpart in Albany.
Mr. Cuomo, in his boldest attack yet on what he calls wasteful spending by school districts, introduced legislation to limit superintendents' pay that would virtually replicate a measure that Mr. Christie imposed in New Jersey. 
Mr. Cuomo's proposal would tie superintendents' maximum pay to the size of their school districts, with the leaders of New York's largest districts limited to a salary of $175,000 and those in the smallest limited to $125,000. It would not affect the New York City school system, where the chancellor, Cathleen P. Black, earns $250,000 a year.
The bill was introduced after a month's worth of sharp words from Mr. Cuomo aimed at school superintendents and their pay. He singled out administrative compensation as one area where districts could find savings as they worked to absorb his proposed $1.5 billion reduction in state school aid, which has drawn criticism from teachers' unions and education groups.
About one-third of the state's more than 650 superintendents earn more than $175,000, and Mr. Cuomo said his pay cap would save $15 million.
Mr. Christie's measure, which he introduced last year, imposes a pay ceiling of $175,000, with case-by-case exceptions permitted only for the largest districts.
That measure, which went into effect on Feb. 7, drew sharp criticism from school officials, and superintendents are fighting it in court.
After Mr. Cuomo's repeated criticism of school administrators in public appearances since he released his budget a month ago, many superintendents worried that he, too, might pursue a salary cap.
''We must wake up to the new economic reality that government must be more efficient and cut the cost of the bureaucracy,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement on Monday. ''Reducing back office overhead, administration, consultants and encouraging consolidations are the best targets to find savings.''
Mr. Cuomo's proposal drew an immediate rebuke from the New York State Council of School Superintendents, which called the average salary for New York's superintendents of $163,000 on par with the national average of $160,000.
''As it is now, school districts have found it increasingly difficult to get candidates to take on the job of superintendent,'' Robert J. Reidy Jr., the council's executive director, said in a statement. ''A cap would make it much harder.''
Dr. Reidy suggested that Mr. Cuomo was calling for a cap on administrators' pay to create a ''distraction'' from the damage that he said proposed school-aid cuts would create for districts.
The $15 million in savings from the pay cap would be 1 percent of the financing reduction Mr. Cuomo has proposed.
The proposal by Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, includes an opt-out provision for local communities, which is one key difference from what Mr. Christie, a Republican, put in place. At the time of annual budget votes, school districts' voters would be allowed to approve a proposed superintendent's contract exceeding the cap.
That provision appears aimed at addressing what has been a major argument advanced by school superintendents, which is that some communities -- particularly affluent ones -- are more than happy to pay high salaries to their superintendents, because the quality of the local school system is why many residents decided to live there.
Mr. Cuomo has at least one ally in his call for limiting superintendents' pay. Senator Charles J. Fuschillo Jr., a Long Island Republican who has praised Mr. Christie's pay cap in recent months, introduced his own bill on Monday to limit the salaries not only of superintendents but also of other school administrators. ''We have to remember these are taxpayer dollars,'' Mr. Fuschillo said. To pay superintendents as much as half a million dollars a year in total compensation, he said, ''is absurd.''
Mr. Cuomo's proposal would take effect district by district as superintendents' contracts expire.

HEADLINE: Refugee Agency Reports 'Humanitarian Emergency' as Multitudes Flee Libya

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Geneva.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Almost 100,000 people have fled Libya's fighting for neighboring Egypt and Tunisia, the United Nations refugee agency said, in what it called a humanitarian emergency.
The numbers seem to have increased over the weekend as armed rebel forces moved closer to a showdown with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and his loyalists who were standing their ground in Tripoli, the capital, and a handful of other places.
The executive director of the World Food Program traveled to Tunisia on Monday to meet with government officials on refugees' needs and the impact on the region. In Geneva, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the United States Agency for International Development was dispatching two teams to Libya's borders in Egypt and Tunisia to assess the need for emergency assistance. She said the aid agency had set aside $10 million for humanitarian assistance and begun an inventory of American emergency food supplies. 
On Monday, the French prime minister, Francois Fillon, said in Paris that his country was sending two planes carrying doctors, nurses, medications and medical equipment to the rebels' eastern stronghold of Benghazi.
People from the United States and many European nations have been evacuated by sea and air from Tripoli and Benghazi, using the island of Malta as a staging point. The European Union said in Brussels that most of its 10,000 people in Libya had left, but that 650 were still asking to be evacuated, many of them from areas where rescue is difficult, The Associated Press reported. China said Monday that it had sent four military transport planes to rescue the remaining 1,000 of some 30,000 of its people who were there before the crisis.
Kristalina Georgieva, the European Union's crisis response commissioner, said that 1.5 million additional foreigners remained in Libya, increasing pressure on the borders with Egypt and Tunisia as non-Libyans sought to flee.
In a statement on Sunday, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, based in Geneva, said Tunisian authorities had estimated that 40,000 refugees had arrived from Libya in a week. And Egyptian authorities said 55,000 people had fled since Feb. 19. Over half the total number of refugees were Egyptians, the refugee agency said, but they also included Libyans, Chinese and people from several other Asian countries.
Television coverage at Libya's land borders showed mainly poor contract workers carrying few possessions. Some footage showed hundreds of people crossing into Tunisia, then sitting on the ground, awaiting help.
''We are committed to assisting Tunisia and Egypt in helping each and every person fleeing Libya,'' said Antonio Guterres, the high commissioner for refugees. ''We call upon the international community to respond quickly and generously to enable these governments to cope with this humanitarian emergency.''
The crisis in Libya had left people from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sudan and Thailand stranded with no travel documents as they tried to flee to Egypt, the refugee agency's statement said. The agency said it had sent more than 100 tons of supplies like tents, blankets and cooking equipment.
''According to the tribal leaders, Africans are being treated with suspicion in eastern Libya, due to rumors about the government employing mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa,'' the statement said.
Reuters reported Monday that Kenyans who fled said they had faced attacks and hostility from Libyan citizens and officials who branded them as mercenaries supporting Colonel Qaddafi. A Kenya Airways flight landed in Nairobi with 90 Kenyans and 64 people from Burundi, Congo, Lesotho, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, officials said.
''We were being attacked by local people who said that we were mercenaries killing people,'' Julius Kiluu, 60, a building supervisor, told Reuters. ''Let me say that they did not want to see black people.''
Last week, British and German military planes flew into Libya's desert to pluck hundreds of people from remote oil installations and, British news reports said, the British C-130 Hercules military transports were protected by special forces units in case they came under attack.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate Breathes Life Into Moribund Market

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
A crucial part of the securitization market - the Wall Street credit machine that helped set off the financial crisis - is kicking back into gear.
In the last few weeks, a number of big banks have successfully bundled and sold new securities backed by commercial real estate loans. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America completed a $1.55 billion deal last month that included office and retail properties. So far this year, financial firms have sold about $5 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities, almost as much as was done in all of 2010.
More deals are in the works. JPMorgan Chase, for example is in the process of selling a $1.5 billion commercial mortgage-backed security. If the pace continues, the volume of these sales could hit $45 billion this year, according to JPMorgan. 
Bankers even have a nickname for the postcredit crisis crop of commercial mortgage-backed securities: C.M.B.S. 2.0, referring to new versions of old products.
''Things have gone vicious to virtuous,'' said Brian Lancaster, a securitization specialist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, which in conjunction with Wells Fargo & Company recently sold a $1.3 billion commercial mortgage-backed security.
Other sectors of this market, including car loans and collateralized loan obligations, are also showing signs of life. But the recovery is being led by commercial real estate, which did not reach the lows that experts expected.
Commercial real estate was supposed to be the next shoe to drop, sending the economy into a tailspin like the housing market did. But while residential prices continue to sputter, the values of office, retail and other commercial properties are stabilizing. As of December 2010, the Moody's/Real Commercial Property Index, which tracks prices on such buildings, was up modestly from its August lows.
Such stability has helped bond investors set prices on the related securities, even in some of the areas most devastated by the crisis. In a recent $2.2 billion commercial deal by Deutsche Bank and UBS, roughly 15 percent of the underlying assets were in Arizona, a state hit hard by the broad real estate problems.
Some on Wall Street, however, are raising warning flags about the new crop of C.M.B.S. deals. The rating agency Standard & Poor's says that some of the new deals are becoming increasingly complex and underwriting standard have loosened.
''We have seen some examples where appraisals/valuations look quite aggressive to us, especially given the downward property price movements over the past few years,'' the agency said in a recent report titled ''15 months Later... The Caution Flag is Out for C.M.B.S. 2.0.''
As part of the securitization process, commercial real estate loans, credit card balances and other types of debt are bundled into bonds, pieces of which are then sold to investors. The yield on a commercial mortgage security is based on the rent or revenue collected on the underlying properties.
With Wall Street firms aggressively packaging loans at inflated values at the peak of the boom, the total volume of securitization reached $2.5 trillion in 2007, according to JPMorgan. Banks issued a record $230 billion of commercial mortgage bonds that year.
Then the market collapsed in 2008 as the underlying loans soured, helping to incite the worst economic rout since the Great Depression. Some pundits predicted the end of securitization.
But with investors nervously on the sidelines, the government started a series of initiatives to help kick-start lending, including the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. Under the program, which was expanded to include commercial mortgage-backed securities, the Federal Reserve lent money to big investors willing to buy such securities. The shopping center owner Developers Diversified Realty Corporation hired Goldman Sachs to prepare one loan backed by 28 properties - worth about $400 million - through the Fed's program.
''TALF really helped the markets to recover,'' said Mike Millette, who is responsible for the structured finance group at Goldman Sachs. ''It did what it needed to do and then disappeared.''
As the government steps back, Wall Street continues to chug along on its own. Although the securitization market could always become overheated again, banks seem to be taking a more cautious approach - a discipline in part enforced by the government.
Under the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform, banks are required to hold 5 percent of any securities they sell to investors. The move is intended to reduce risk by forcing banks to eat their own cooking.
Another rule, which will most likely take effect early next year, requires banks and other financial firms that issue asset-backed securities to review the quality of the underlying assets, including commercial real estate. The banks must then disclose their findings to investors. If the assessment shows that the assets did not meet the underwriting standards promised to investors, financial firms must explain the discrepancy in a filing.
Banks are also improving their lending standards on their own. The securities today are more diverse, including multiple loans from a number of developers across the country. The recent deals, for instance, includes a broad set of properties like the Christiana Mall in Newark, Del., the Kenwood Towne Centre in Cincinnati, the Pearlridge Center near Honolulu and 7 Hanover Square in New York.
''The banks can cherry-pick the loans they are making and typically only top-quality prime borrowers are getting financed,'' said Tony Plath, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Small Airports, Left Behind

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Residents of some of America's smaller cities may face a tough choice in the future: pay increasingly high fares to board a plane close to home or drive farther to a bigger airport with lower ticket prices.
While it is difficult to calculate how much fares are rising at places like Mobile, Ala., versus large cities like Miami -- the Department of Transportation's most recent study of rural airfares was published in 1998 -- industry executives and analysts agree that smaller markets are generally experiencing bigger price increases. 
''It's just the economics of the airplane involved and the demand,'' said Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant with Boyd Group International. ''It's an issue of volume.''
Since airlines typically fly turboprops and 50-seat jets on the routes that connect outlying communities to big hubs, the higher cost of fuel and other expenses gets split among fewer passengers. Airlines are retiring these planes because they are unprofitable as oil prices climb.
But many small airports do not generate enough traffic to fill larger planes multiple times a day, or attract the low-fare airlines that choose markets with higher volume. And as local residents drive to bigger airports with lower fares, or forgo flying as it gets more expensive, small airports feel the pinch even more.
That means communities are fighting to maintain affordable airline service as airlines cut back on flights to money-losing markets..
''There are very few communities that are going to lose access to the rest of the world,'' Mr. Boyd said. ''It's just that that access may not be from the local airport.''
The country's network of plentiful regional airports connecting to big hubs was largely built in an era of $30-a-barrel oil. But oil prices are now more than triple that, so maintaining commercial airline service to underperforming airports may be unsustainable.
Still, any discussion of shrinking airline service is a political minefield, as illustrated by the recent furor over proposals to reduce the subsidies for the federal Essential Air Service program, which provides $200 million annually to help pay for flights to 154 rural markets. While it is acknowledged by some government officials and lawmakers that residents of many of those communities could drive to other nearby airports, Congress has been reluctant to overhaul the eligibility rules for the program.
''Given that there are 535 interested parties on Capitol Hill, I don't see anyone stepping up and wanting to close an airport in some congressman's district,'' said William S. Swelbar, a research engineer with M.I.T.'s International Center for Air Transportation.
He and other analysts said market forces could lead to cuts that politicians and even some airport executives would rather not address.
''We're just operating too many airports,'' Mr. Swelbar said, noting that 200 of the roughly 450 airports in the contiguous United States account for 97 percent of demand. ''Have we really built a system that makes sense?''
But what makes sense from a national policy perspective, or an airline's balance sheet, has big ramifications for residents of smaller communities that rely on local airport service. Driving two hours or more to catch a flight, factoring in unpredictable weather, traffic and airline delays, can be a major disincentive to fly.
The Traverse City Area Chamber of Commerce, in a mostly resort community in northern Michigan, collected comments from more than 300 members last summer about the impact of rising airfares and declining service at the local Cherry Capital Airport.
According to data compiled by Mr. Boyd, who has been hired as a consultant to the airport, Traverse City has the sixth-highest fares out of the top 175 airports in the United States -- tickets cost about 23 cents per mile flown compared with about 16 cents at Newark.
Local residents say they are driving to Detroit, Grand Rapids and Flint for cheaper fares, cutting back on school activities that involve flying and skipping nonessential meetings. Businesses and resorts worry about lost revenue from conferences and visitors as tourists opt for more easily accessible destinations.
Airport officials and community leaders have met with Senator Carl Levin of Michigan and airline executives to express their concerns. But they also have realistic expectations about the market forces driving higher fares.
''The airlines have been responsive, particularly Delta,'' said Doug Luciani, president and chief executive of the chamber of commerce, adding that colleagues around the country are facing similar challenges. ''There's been a lot of chatter among the chambers asking, 'What are you doing in your community about high fares?'''
Trebor Banstetter, a Delta spokesman, said the airline was addressing some of the issues raised by Traverse City residents, and regularly worked with cities to make sure airline service was not a barrier to attendance at local conventions and events. At the same time, airports are offering incentives to the airlines to add or maintain service, like reducing landing fees and terminal rents, a longstanding practice that may get more costly as airlines make Darwinian decisions about where they can afford to fly.
''Communities are going to have to be innovative, responsive and flexible in order to maintain the tremendous service they've enjoyed,'' said Roger Cohen, president of the Regional Airline Association, whose members operate most of the flights to small cities in the United States.
Although he does not expect widespread airport closings, he cited fuel prices and economic headwinds as two factors beyond the control of the airlines -- and the communities they serve.
''Whatever happens is going to be market-driven,'' Mr. Cohen said.

HEADLINE: Warships Move In as U.S. Readies a Range of Options for Qaddafi's Ouster

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and THOM SHANKER; Reporting was contributed by Steven Erlanger from Paris, Steven Lee Myers from Geneva, Helene Cooper from Washington, and Neil MacFarquhar from Cairo.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States began moving warships toward Libya and froze $30 billion in the country's assets on Monday as the administration declared all options on the table in its diplomatic, economic and military campaign to drive Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi from power.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the administration was conferring with allies about imposing a no-fly zone over Libya. Such a move would likely be carried out only under a mandate from the United Nations or NATO, but Mrs. Clinton's blunt confirmation that it was under consideration was clearly intended to ratchet up the pressure on Colonel Qaddafi and his dwindling band of loyalists. 
''Qaddafi has lost the legitimacy to govern, and it is time for him to go without further violence or delay,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters after a special meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council. ''No option is off the table,'' she said, adding ''that of course includes a no-fly zone.''
But officials in Washington and elsewhere said that direct military action remained unlikely, and that the moves were designed as much as anything as a warning to Colonel Qaddafi and a show of support to the protesters seeking to overthrow his government.
Speaking in Geneva, Mrs. Clinton said the United States was sending two teams of aid workers to Libyan border regions with Tunisia and Egypt, where tens of thousands of refugees are massing in a desperate flight from Libya's strife-torn cities. The administration has set aside $10 million for emergency relief.
As part of a potential military role in the humanitarian effort, Pentagon officials said that military aircraft and ships were being ordered to move into position closer to the Libyan coast. The Navy has an aircraft carrier strike group -- with ample planes and helicopters -- and an amphibious landing vessel, with Marines and helicopters, in the nearby Red Sea.
''As part of our contingency planning to provide the president flexibility on a full range of options regarding Libya, we are repositioning forces in the region,'' said Col. David Lapan, a Pentagon spokesman.
The coordinated statements were part of a rapidly accelerating Western response to the bloody clashes between rebels and loyalists of Colonel Qaddafi. Administration officials said they were held back until Friday because of fears that the Libyan government might take its diplomats and other Americans there hostage.
Now, with most Americans safely out of the country, senior administration officials are demanding Colonel Qaddafi's immediate resignation and ridiculing his claims that he enjoys the support of his people. Working with European allies, the administration has rolled out a battery of measures to seek to peel away senior officials and military commanders who remain loyal to the Libyan strongman.
In addition to a no-fly zone, designed to prevent the Libyan Air Force from attacking its citizens, options under review include using military transports to deliver food and medicine, or evacuating Libyans who want to leave the country.
But there are clear risks to involving the military, officials said, especially if the effort is led by the United States.
Privately, American officials said any United States military presence could undermine the legitimacy of the Libyan revolt as an internal, grass-roots movement. Qaddafi supporters -- and even those across the Arab world who do not like the dictator -- could denounce American action as being only about oil.
A NATO operation could produce a similar backlash, given the bitter residue of European colonialism in North Africa. In meetings at NATO and the United Nations, European officials have resisted military action, officials said.
''Should NATO get involved in a civil war to the south of the Mediterranean?'' said Prime Minister Francois Fillon of France. ''It is a question that at least merits some reflection before being launched.''
Egypt's foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said his country would not endorse any foreign military intervention. An Egyptian official noted that the use of Egyptian forces was wholly a decision for the military, which controls the country.
Indeed, there is an element of gunboat diplomacy to the talk of military action. Besides reassuring protesters, a senior American official said, the naval vessels and warplanes could be used as a show of force to embolden members of Colonel Qaddafi's military to turn on him. The announcement of American military planning could have an impact even without carrying out any operations, the official said.
The Treasury Department's move against Colonel Qaddafi's wealth was more concrete. Hours after President Obama signed an executive order on Friday freezing assets belonging to the Qaddafi family and other Libyan government entities, an unspecified number of American financial institutions cut off access to some $30 billion, including Libya's oil-enriched sovereign wealth funds.
''This is the largest blocking under any sanctions program ever,'' said David Cohen, the acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. The $30 billion is separate from Libyan government money being blocked by European countries and banks under separate orders, he said, and it speaks to the vast holdings Colonel Qaddafi acquired in more than four decades in power.
Britain and Switzerland had already frozen Libyan assets, and the European Union announced further sanctions on Monday, including an embargo on the sales of arms and police equipment, and a visa ban for Libyan officials. Those measures go beyond the sanctions passed by the United Nations on Saturday, though the Security Council also referred Colonel Qaddafi to the International Criminal Court for an investigation into possible war crimes.
In Washington, Mr. Obama met with the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to reinforce the sense of international consensus. Afterward, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, delivered a blistering denunciation of Colonel Qaddafi from the White House briefing room.
Citing an interview the Libyan leader gave Monday to Christiane Amanpour of ABC News and others, Ms. Rice said, ''When he can laugh in talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people, it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality.''
Pentagon officials said the United States would seek an international mandate for action, most likely from the United Nations or NATO. There is no appetite for assigning ground troops to any mission, officials said.
But the scope and pacing of planning under way is a substantial increase from just a week ago, when officials said that the most likely military action would come from European countries like Italy or France.
Officials said the administration had realized that only the American military was equipped to lead across a range of options to halt the violence. ''This has been a fast-moving scenario, with the violence really accelerating over recent days,'' one Pentagon official said.

HEADLINE: Shares End the Month With Gains, Helped by Buffett's Comments

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks advanced on Monday as benchmark indexes notched a third straight monthly gain, helped by improving economic data and news of Warren E. Buffett's plans for more acquisitions.
Mr. Buffett, in his annual letter to shareholders on Saturday, said that his ''trigger finger is itchy'' for takeovers after cash holdings at his company, Berkshire Hathaway, climbed to $38.2 billion. ''Our elephant gun has been reloaded,'' Mr. Buffett said. Berkshire also announced that its profit rose 43 percent in the fourth quarter to the highest level since 2007.
Stocks of phone and utility companies led the gains in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, with each sector adding at least 1 percent. Walgreen, the drugstore chain, climbed 3.3 percent after Morgan Stanley raised its share-price estimate for the company. Intel, the chip maker, fell 1.8 percent as JPMorgan Chase said the company might miss revenue estimates. 
The S.& P. 500 rose 7.34 points, or 0.56 percent, to 1,327.22, rallying for a second consecutive day. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 95.89 points, or 0.79 percent, to 12,226.34. The Nasdaq rose 1.22 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2.782.27.
''Warren Buffett is always out there to buy companies at the right price,'' said E. William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia. ''He has enough cash to do what he wants to do. On top of that, the economy continues to recover and earnings will not be affected by the situation in oil prices. We see pressure coming off the oil market.''
Crude oil fell the most in two weeks as Saudi Arabia offered to make up for supplies lost because of unrest in Libya.
The S.& P. 500 rose 3.2 percent in February, extending this year's gain to 5.5 percent, amid government measures to stimulate the economy and higher-than-estimated corporate earnings.
Stocks were supported early Monday by data showing that personal income climbed 1 percent in January, reflecting the tax-cut compromise reached by President Obama and Congressional Republicans in December.
Stocks also rose after the Institute for Supply Management of Chicago said its business barometer increased to 71.2 in February, the highest level since July 1988, from 68.8 in January. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.
William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech that the ''considerably brighter'' economic outlook was not yet reason for the central bank to withdraw its record monetary stimulus.
Berkshire's Class B shares rose 2.8 percent, to $87.28, while its Class A shares gained 2.9 percent, to $131,300. Fourth-quarter net income advanced to $4.38 billion, or $2,656 a share, from $3.06 billion, or $1,969 a share, a year earlier, Berkshire said.
''It's another positive influence for confidence,'' Liam F. Dalton, president of Axiom Capital Management in New York, said of Mr. Buffett's comments. ''It supports a lot of what we're dealing with right now -- improving data in the real economy. A Buffett remark perpetuates that trend.''
Gains in the S.& P. 500 were driven by companies that are least-dependent on economic growth. Phone companies had the biggest gain in the index, rising 1.5 percent, followed by gains in a gauge of utility companies, which added 1 percent.
Walgreen rose to $43.34. Morgan Stanley raised its share-price estimate to $50 from $44, while raising its second-quarter profit forecast, citing stronger-than-estimated sales stemming from flu trends.
Humana rose 3.9 percent to $65.01. The company, which provides health benefits, raised its full-year profit forecast to $5.95 to $6.15 a share.
Nationwide Health Properties rose 9.7 percent, to $42.74. Ventas, a health care real estate investment trust, agreed to buy Nationwide Health for about $5.7 billion. Ventas slid 3.1 percent, to $55.42.
Intel's fall of 1.8 percent was the most in the Dow. The shares closed at $21.47 after JPMorgan said the company was at risk of missing revenue estimates.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 3/32, to 101 22/32, and the yield rose to 3.42 percent from 3.41 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Car Sales Jumped in February, but Here Come Gas Prices Again

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Sales of new vehicles in the United States increased 27 percent in February, automakers said Tuesday, even as violence in the Middle East and a surge in gasoline prices threatened to slow the industry's postrecession recovery.
The automakers said that they were seeing some signs that fuel economy was becoming a higher priority for consumers again, but that gas prices were not affecting car shoppers as much as three years ago, when drivers were scrambling to get out of big trucks and sport utility vehicles. Sales rose 37 percent for pickups and 34 percent for S.U.V.'s from February 2010, while demand for small cars rose 24 percent, according to the Autodata Corporation. 
General Motors led all automakers with a 46 percent increase, as sales of its full-size pickup trucks jumped 66 percent and its Buick and Cadillac brands each reported gains of at least 70 percent. Chrysler sold 82 percent more pickups, though its total sales were up just 13 percent.
''It took less than 90 days to go from wondering where we would get some sales to how we're going to get enough cars,'' said Sam Pilato, general manager of the Dimmitt Chevrolet dealership in Clearwater, Fla.
Toyota said sales rose 42 percent last month, when traffic at its dealerships was hurt by two big recalls. Nissan, Hyundai and Kia each set February records.
The Ford Motor Company, which benefited from Toyota's troubles last February, said sales were up 10 percent; excluding Volvo, which Ford no longer owns, its sales were up 14 percent. Its midsize car, the Fusion, outsold the Honda Accord, a perennial leader in that hotly contested segment.
Ford said it planned to increase production by 9 percent in the second quarter, despite widespread projections that gasoline prices could hit $4 this summer. Nationwide, gas is averaging $3.375 a gallon after rising 20 cents in the last week and 27 cents from a month ago, according to the AAA motor club.
LeaseTrader.com, which helps people who want to get out of auto leases, said its analysis of the price run-up in 2008 suggested $4 was the psychological barrier that could cause consumers to change their buying behavior. But the automakers said they were confident sales would continue to rise, in part because many people put off buying a new vehicle during the recession and would need one soon.
''If gas prices rise slowly, as we expect them to, we don't expect to see a big impact, but if there is a dramatic spike that could obviously have a big impact on industry volumes,'' Don Johnson, G.M.'s vice president of United States sales operations, said in a conference call with analysts and reporters. ''The last one, we had a lot of people that overreacted and went into vehicles that didn't meet their needs.''
Since then, G.M., Ford and other automakers have vastly improved their lineups of small cars as well as the profit margins that those segments generate. Smaller cars are still less profitable than trucks and S.U.V.'s, but in the past the Detroit companies often sold those models at a loss simply to keep factories running.
G.M. last year introduced the Chevrolet Cruze, a compact sedan, while Ford rolled out the smaller Fiesta last summer and will introduce a redesigned version of its Focus compact car this month.
Still, if consumers looked to downsize again, many might continue to ignore Detroit's offerings, said Jessica Caldwell, director of pricing and industry analysis at Edmunds.com, which provides car-buying information.
''The perception of most consumers is that they don't have fuel-efficient cars,'' Ms. Caldwell said. ''There's just not as much brand awareness for a new model like the Cruze as there is for something like a Civic or a Prius,'' she said, referring to popular models from Honda and Toyota, respectively.
Ms. Caldwell and other analysts said cash rebates, low-interest financing and subsidized lease deals were allowing G.M. to gain market share more quickly than it would otherwise. G.M. and other automakers, particularly its Detroit-based rivals, used to rely heavily on such incentives to clear unpopular models from crowded lots, but have backed away from that strategy.
G.M. executives said that the company was not falling back on one of the bad habits that helped lead it into bankruptcy protection two years ago. They noted that dealer inventories were at the lowest level in many years and, excluding deliveries to car rental companies and other so-called fleet buyers, sales to individual consumers were up 70 percent in February, the highest year-over-year gain in company history.
''There is clearly a lot more going on here than a mere incentive move of a couple hundred dollars,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Our disciplined approach to incentives has not changed.''
Mr. Pilato, the Florida dealership manager, said incentives were helping to make sales, but so were improved vehicles and banks that had become more willing to offer financing to customers with lower credit scores.

HEADLINE: Radical Cleric Demands Ouster Of Yemen Leader

BYLINE: By LAURA KASINOF and SCOTT SHANE; Laura Kasinof reported from Sana, and Scott Shane from Washington. Helene Cooper and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
SANA, Yemen -- Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, maintained a tenuous hold on power on Tuesday, blaming the United States and Israel for protests across the Arab world, while a prominent radical cleric joined the growing crowds demanding his ouster and called for an Islamic state.
American officials expressed concern about the statement of the cleric, Abdul Majid al-Zindani, a onetime mentor of Osama bin Laden, which introduced a new Islamist element to the turmoil in a country where Al Qaeda is viewed as a grave threat. The protests that toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt and that now have spread to Libya, Bahrain and Oman have been largely secular in nature.
Mr. Zindani spoke on an open-air stage before several thousand antigovernment protesters, guarded by 10 men carrying AK-47s and shielded from the scorching sun by two umbrellas wielded by aides. ''An Islamic state is coming,'' he said, drawing cries of ''God is great'' from some in the crowd.
He said Mr. Saleh ''came to power by force, and stayed in power by force, and the only way to get rid of him is through the force of the people.'' 
How much support Mr. Zindani had in the protest movement was not clear.
As the opposition held what it called ''a day of rage,'' the pro-government camp mustered one of its biggest crowds in weeks of turmoil. Men danced in the streets, waving aloft traditional curved daggers and replacing their opponents' slogan -- ''the people want the regime to fall'' -- with the words ''the people want Ali Abdullah Saleh.''
Obama administration officials increasingly fear the power vacuum that they believe would follow if Mr. Saleh, whose son, nephews and close allies in the Sanhan tribe control the military and intelligence agencies, departed. Mr. Zindani has long supported Mr. Saleh, and his defection, which followed that of tribal leaders and a refusal on Monday by opposition parties to join a unity government, was a sign of how quickly the president's patronage system is dissolving, a senior administration official said.
Thomas C. Krajeski, the American ambassador to Yemen from 2004 to 2007, who just returned from a visit there, said he would put Mr. Saleh's chances of staying in power at no better than 50-50, despite the Yemeni president's long history as a wily survivor and tribal deal-maker during three decades in power. Mr. Krajeski, now senior vice president of the National Defense University, said that the State Department each year had studied possible successors to Mr. Saleh and ''came up empty.''
A collapse of the government in Yemen would pose a serious threat to Saudi Arabia, Yemen's far wealthier neighbor to the north, Mr. Krajeski said. ''If I'm sitting in Riyadh and looking south, I would be very, very worried,'' he said.
A senior Pentagon official, Garry Reid, said that given Mr. Saleh's close cooperation on operations against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, he saw no alternative to Mr. Saleh.
''In my view, it's the best partner we'll have, and hopefully it will survive,'' said Mr. Reid, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and combating terrorism, in a talk at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington.
Mr. Saleh, for his part, sought to put distance between himself and Washington with comments that were all the more startling given the United States' political support and military aid to his government.
''From Tunis to the sultanate of Oman,'' Mr. Saleh said, the wave of protest is ''managed by Tel Aviv and under the supervision of Washington.''
American officials dismissed the accusation. ''We don't think scapegoating will be the kind of response that the people of Yemen or the people in other countries will find adequate,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. Mr. Carney said the Obama administration had ''made clear to the leadership in Yemen, as we have to the leadership in other countries, that they need to focus on the political reforms that they need to implement to respond to the legitimate aspirations of their people.''
Privately, administration officials said they believed that Mr. Saleh was posturing to try to hang onto his job. ''We're not taking those comments that seriously,'' one administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
''American diplomacy, when it's working well, is mature enough to see when leaders are playing to their own domestic interests,'' said Juan Carlos Zarate, a former Bush administration national security official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''To the extent that Saleh feels he needs to distance himself from us publicly, I think we can live with that.''
For the Obama administration, the immediate preoccupation was whether Mr. Saleh could survive.
''A lot of people are really worried about what happens the day after Saleh is gone,'' said Gregory D. Johnsen, a Yemen specialist at Princeton University, in a telephone interview from Cairo. Yemen is a famously well-armed country, he noted, and if a power struggle were to break out, it is hard to predict how the factions would shape up.
Yemen is very different from Egypt, where President Hosni Mubarak stepped down but the military command structure stayed very much in place, Mr. Johnsen said. If Mr. Saleh goes, his relatives and tribal allies are unlikely to hold on to their positions, he said.
The early demonstrations in Yemen were inspired by Egypt's largely secular, pro-democracy protests. But the appearance of Mr. Zindani on Tuesday suggested a possible shift to a more overtly religious direction, Mr. Johnsen said. ''Religion has a larger place in public discourse in Yemen than in most other countries in the region,'' he said.
Since 2004, Mr. Zindani has been named a ''specially designated global terrorist'' by the United States Treasury Department, which accused him of a role in financing terrorism -- a designation Mr. Saleh's government fought to reverse. Mr. Zindani's word as a spiritual leader carries considerable political and moral weight in Yemen.
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist network's affiliate in Yemen, ''is nowhere near strong enough to make a play for control of the state,'' Mr. Johnsen said. But he said that if Mr. Saleh's departure raised hopes for rapid change, the country's rampant unemployment and poverty, growing population, shrinking oil revenue and dwindling water supply would remain.
''In a year, that could open the way for Al Qaeda to say, 'You tried Saleh, you tried democracy, now you have to try the way of the prophet and the rule of Shariah law,' '' Mr. Johnsen said.

HEADLINE: Gas Wells Recycle Water, but Toxic Risks Persist

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
As drilling for natural gas started to climb sharply about 10 years ago, energy companies faced mounting criticism over an extraction process that involves pumping millions of gallons of water into the ground for each well and can leave significant amounts of hazardous contaminants in the water that comes back to the surface.
So, in a move hailed by industry as a major turning point, drilling companies started reusing and recycling the wastewater.
''Water recycling is a win-win,'' one drilling company, Range Resources, says on its Web site. ''It reduces freshwater demand and eliminates the need to dispose of the water.'' 
But the win-win comes with significant asterisks.
In Pennsylvania, for example, natural-gas companies recycled less than half of the wastewater they produced during the 18 months that ended in December, according to state records.
Nor has recycling eliminated environmental and health risks. Some methods can leave behind salts or sludge highly concentrated with radioactive material and other contaminants that can be dangerous to people and aquatic life if they get into waterways.
Some well operators are also selling their waste rather than paying to dispose of it. Because it is so salty, they have found ready buyers in communities that spread it on roads for de-icing in the winter and for dust suppression in the summer. When ice melts or rain falls, the waste can run off roads and end up in the drinking supply.
Yet in Pennsylvania, where the number of drilling permits for gas wells has jumped markedly in the last several years, in part because the state sits on a large underground gas formation known as the Marcellus Shale, such waste remains exempt from federal and state oversight, even when turned into salts and spread on roads.
When Pennsylvania regulators tried to strengthen state oversight of how drilling wastewater is tracked, an industry coalition argued vehemently against it. Three of the top state officials at a meeting on the subject have since left the government -- for the natural-gas industry.
One executive at a drilling wastewater recycling company said that for all the benefits of recycling, it was not a cure-all.
''No one wants to admit it, but at some point, even with reuse of this water, you have to confront the disposal question,'' said Brent Halldorson, chief operating officer of Aqua-Pure/Fountain Quail Water Management, adding that the wastewater contains barium, strontium and radioactive elements that need to be removed.
Mr. Halldorson emphasized that he had not seen high radioactivity readings at the plant he operates in Williamsport, Pa. He said he firmly believed in the benefits of recycling -- to reduce the waste produced and water used and to help promote a shift toward natural gas, which burns cleaner than coal for producing electricity. ''But there still needs to be a candid discussion, and there needs to be accountability about where even the recycled wastewater is going,'' he added.
More than 90 percent of well operators in Pennsylvania use this process, known as hydrofracking, to get wells to produce. It involves injecting water mixed with sand and chemicals at high pressures to break up rock formations and release the gas. Between 10 percent and 40 percent of the water injected into each well resurfaces in the first few weeks of the process.
Many states send their drilling waste to injection wells, for storage deep underground. But because of the geological formations in Pennsylvania, there are few injection wells, and other alternatives are expensive. So natural-gas well operators in the state have turned to recycling.
''The technical breakthroughs that have allowed us to lead the nation in water recycling are complemented by a carefully orchestrated water-management system, involving a combination of on-site and off-site treatment, depending on specific geography and economics,'' said Kathryn Klaber, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade group.
State and company records show that in the year and a half that ended in December 2010, well operators reported recycling at least 320 million gallons. But at least 260 million gallons of wastewater were sent to plants that discharge their treated waste into rivers, out of a total of more than 680 million gallons of wastewater produced, according to state data posted Tuesday. Those 260 million gallons would fill more than 28,800 tanker trucks, a line of which would stretch from about New York City to Richmond, Va.
While the total amount of recycling in the state is nowhere near the 90 percent that the industry has been claiming over the past year, the practice has undoubtedly been on the rise in recent months. The amount reported recycled in the past six months is roughly 65 percent of the total produced, up from roughly 20 percent during the 12 months before that. At least 50 million additional gallons of wastewater is unaccounted for, according to state records.
The fate of more of the wastewater is unknown because of industry lobbying. In 2009, when regulators tried to strengthen oversight of the industry's methods for disposing of its waste, the Marcellus Shale Coalition staunchly opposed the effort.
''There is no other industry in Pennsylvania that is required to have a manifest system for residual waste,'' industry officials argued, according to notes from a meeting on March 11, 2009, with state regulators and officials from the governor's office. Under the proposed system, a manifest would have been required so that each load of wastewater was tracked from the well to its disposal, to verify that it was not dumped at the side of the road.
After initially resisting, state officials agreed, adding that they would try to persuade the secretary of Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection to agree, according to the notes. In the end, the state's proposed manifest system for tracking was not carried out.
Three of the top state officials in the meeting -- K. Scott Roy, Barbara Sexton and J. Scott Roberts -- have since left their posts for jobs in the natural-gas industry.
The tracking system that has been put in place requires monthly or yearly reports to the state from well operators indicating where their waste has been taken, but offers no way for the state to guarantee that the waste actually reaches the disposal sites.
The challenges of tracking all of the industry's drilling waste and disposing of it will not go away soon. At least 50,000 new Marcellus wells are supposed to be drilled in Pennsylvania over the next two decades, up from about 6,400 permitted now.
Wells also create waste that is not captured by recycling, because operators typically recycle only for the first several months after a well begins producing gas.
Though the amount of wastewater decreases over time, the wells can continue to ooze for decades after they have been hydrofracked. There are regulations, however, that govern how gas wells are plugged and abandoned.
''This is important because as the well ages, the fluids that come up from it become more toxic, and the state or companies are even less likely to be tracking it,'' said Anthony Ingraffea, a drilling expert and professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell.
State regulators predict that the heaviest burdens are still to come.
''The waste that flows back slowly and continuously over the 20- to 30-year life of each gas well could produce 27 tons of salt per year,'' Pennsylvania officials wrote in new rules adopted last August about salt levels in drilling wastewater being sent through sewage treatment plants. ''Multiply this amount by tens of thousands of Marcellus gas wells,'' they said, and the potential pollution effects are ''tremendous.''
In an interview on Sunday, John Hanger, who in January stepped down as secretary of Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection, pointed to these rules as some of the strongest in the country and cited other accomplishments during his term, including increasing inspections of drilling industry trucks, more than doubling his department's natural-gas staff and improving well design requirements.
The natural-gas industry uses a number of methods to recycle drilling waste.
Some drillers have used recycling equipment at the well site or trucked the water to a dedicated recycling facility. The wastewater is filtered, evaporated and then distilled, to be used again at the well. Other companies add fresh water to the wastewater, to dilute the salts and other contaminants, before pumping it back in the ground for more hydrofracking.
Any sludge that settles from these various processes is taken to landfills, which in Pennsylvania are equipped with radiation monitors, or is sent to injection disposal wells.
But drilling experts say that virtually all forms of recycling still result in liquid waste that can be more toxic than it is after the first use.
''The wastewater that comes up from the well will likely increase to some degree in many contaminants such as salts and possibly radium and other radionuclides with each new fracking, but the data is very limited on this issue, so not much is known,'' said Radisav Vidic, an environmental engineering professor and drilling expert at the University of Pittsburgh. ''There needs to be more data on this.''
Industry officials said there was no reason for concern about radioactivity levels in wastewater.
''All of our reports indicate that this industry operates within the same standards set forth and observed by all water consumers in Pennsylvania,'' said Matt Pitzarella, a spokesman for Range Resources-Appalachia, a part of the Range Resources natural-gas company.
Some energy companies have found more profitable options for getting rid of their drilling wastewater.
In West Virginia, for example, environmental regulators and highway officials last year announced plans for the state to start paying around five cents per gallon for gas drilling wastewater known as brine, which tends to be extremely salty, to melt ice on roads. They planned to buy about 1.2 million gallons at more than 120 sites around the state and to buy more as needed.
West Virginia's water and waste management director, Scott Mandirola, has said that he recognized that the waste might have radioactive contaminants and that some of the waste would find its way to the state's waters.
But he added that it would be highly diluted by rain or snow and that de-icing the roads was important. State officials also said that only wastewater from shallow wells would be used, thereby reducing levels of radioactivity.
Pennsylvania also allows salty brine produced from the wastewater to be spread on roads for dust suppression or de-icing.
More than 155,000 gallons of this wastewater was sent by a drilling company called Ultra Resources to nine towns for dust suppression in 2009, state records show. The water came from two gas wells in Tioga County and contained radium at almost 700 times the levels allowed in drinking water.
''I was told nothing about frack water or any gas-well brines or anything else,'' said Deborah Kotulka, the secretary of Richmond Township, in Tioga County, whose name appears on the state record. Her township received 101,640 gallons of the water from wells with high radioactivity, those records show.
As gas producers have tried to find new ways to get rid of their waste, they have sought reassurances from state and federal regulators that the industry's exemptions from federal laws on hazardous waste were broad enough to protect them.
In late 2009, for example, officials from an industry trade group, the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Association, wrote to regulators to confirm that drilling waste, regardless of how it was handled, would remain exempt from the federal law governing hazardous materials. The association said it was asking in case companies sought to distill the waste into salts for de-icing roads.
''The query has monumental significance,'' Steve Rhoads, then the president of the association, wrote in a September 2009 e-mail to state regulators explaining his members' concerns about any attempt by federal officials to categorize drilling waste as hazardous material. The correspondence was obtained through open-records requests filed with the state.
If drillers were to lose the exemption from federal law that allowed their waste not to be considered hazardous, they would probably be forced, at great expense, to start more rigorously testing the waste for toxicity.
They might also have to do what most other industries do: ship any sludge or salts that are high in radioactivity to Idaho or Washington State, where there are some of the only landfills in the country permitted to accept such waste.
Instead, federal regulators informed the industry that their exemption remained intact, a decision that association officials quickly passed on to their members. State regulators declined to comment on the exchange because it concerns a federal, not state, exemption. Federal officials said the salts were regulated by the states.
''In short,'' Mr. Rhoads wrote his members, the Environmental Protection Agency has determined that the exemption ''remains in effect once the waste is generated, regardless of how the waste is treated or managed.''

AI FIORI
The Setai Hotel, 400 Fifth Avenue (37th Street), Midtown; (212) 613-8660.
Here at long last is a winning new defense of fine dining. Ai Fiori is an emphatic rejoinder to the trend toward farmhouse tables, rustic food and shouting that has so dominated the dining scene in Manhattan, at least since the start of the recession.
It is not really a beautiful restaurant. The palette is too earthen and anonymous. And the service is not quite formal enough for it to qualify as truly fancy, either -- more Danny Meyer in attitude than Alain Ducasse. 
But the dinner menu is a soulful amalgamation of French technique and Italian passion, executed with great skill. It turns an Italian lens on haute French cooking to reveal French food as it might be cooked in Como for a table of aristocrats.
This works out well for everyone: Ai Fiori is one of the best restaurants to open in New York in the last 12 months. (With its $79 four-course prix fixe, it also provides one of the best values.) (Reviewed Feb. 23, ---) SAM SIFTON
BAR BASQUE
Eventi Hotel, 839 Avenue of the Americas (29th Street), Chelsea; (646) 600-7150, chinagrillmgt.com
Yuhi Fujinaga, the executive chef, cooks beautifully, and his menu offers real pleasures, particularly in the precincts of appetizers and side dishes. From faux ravioli stuffed with oxtail (essentially a sandwich of crisp-fried bread, the whole dish bathed in a sticky reduction of red wine) to a bowl of piquillo peppers baked into sweetness and mellow heat, there is much to enjoy about eating this restaurant's food.
There is little to enjoy about the actual restaurant, though.
Bar Basque is a strange glass-walled and tube-shaped spaceship on the second floor of the Eventi Hotel in Chelsea, with a view of a jumbo television screen across the alley park behind it. The setting is red and black and clattery, with a substantial, low-seating lounge area that vibrates with dinkadinkadinka club music and the repressed desire of hotel guests traveling with hard-body work associates. It could appear in a sequel to Bret Easton Ellis's ''American Psycho.''
Naturally, Bar Basque is owned by Jeffrey Chodorow, the irrepressible restaurant entrepreneur who brought the world the juggernauts China Grill and Asia de Cuba. He is interested beyond measure in the theatricality of dining; his restaurants pulse with showmanship and risk much in its pursuit. At Bar Basque, he has taken a thrilling cuisine and able practitioners of it, and put them in what amounts to a nightclub. (Feb. 16, -) SAM SIFTON
PORSENA
21 East Seventh Street (Third Avenue), East Village; (212) 228-4923.
Billed as a ''pasta restaurant,'' Porsena is a crimson-painted, wood-floored space with a comfortable bar, and worthwhile detours on the way to pasta.
Charred, chewy-soft crostini are made from Sullivan Street's casareccio bread, and served with tasty decorations like salami, anchovies, butter, bottarga, local mozzarella and pickled onions. There are three salads, all excellent precursors to pasta: a crunchy one of green beans, celery and fennel; a chunky Greek-style one with romaine, red onion and cucumber; and a Caesar-inspired one involving escarole, slightly wilted but not warm, in a creamy anchovy bath.
And now to the pasta. For the main-course brigade, there is a lush and crackly bowl of penne with roasted cauliflower and oily bread crumbs; pasta rings in a breathlessly spicy and bitter homage to Bolognese made from lamb sausage and mustard greens; small twists in ''una marea di formaggi,'' an ocean of cheeses that includes a tangy whiff of blue. These are all memorably delicious.
For the minimalists, there are a couple of simply sauced spaghettis: sweet tomato, laced and softened with Parmesan; garlic and parsley with Manila clams. But neither of those dishes had the refined brightness that makes simplicity worthwhile, and the clam pasta was just far too salty. (Dining Briefs, Feb. 16.) JULIA MOSKIN

HEADLINE: Greenhouse Projects Nurture Produce and Workers

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
HACKETTSTOWN, N.J.
IN the winter of everyone's discontent, it was, of course, below freezing outside, but Todd Brusberg was checking the rows of baby Parris Island, Royal Oak Leaf and Firecracker lettuce thriving in the 70-degree temperature and 100-percent humidity of a new $100,000 hydroponic greenhouse here.
''It's great to be in this green oasis,'' Mr. Brusberg said. ''It's good to work with your hands on things that are green.''
Mr. Brusberg, a former technology consultant who experienced memory loss after surgery on a cerebral aneurysm, is one of 37 trainees in three New Jersey greenhouses tending a riot of vegetables and herbs; they are the vanguard of a $800,000 program with national ambitions. The project, called Arthur & Friends, trains developmentally disabled workers to grow pristine, sustainable produce for restaurants and farmers' markets. About 200 people have been educated in the art of dirtless farming, and more are waiting to learn. 
For each trainee, the journey to the program is singular. Mr. Brusberg, 49, owned a consulting firm in Sparta, N.J., installing business communication systems until the surgery. He spent more than a year recovering at the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in West Orange, N.J. He said, ''It was a little unreal, and I had to get past the 'why me?' stage.''
He added that he hopes to restart his business, but meanwhile is ''trying to prove to myself that I can still do what I did before, and hoping to use my own expertise in technology in the hydroponic greenhouse,'' particularly the facility's electronic control systems. They monitor temperature, humidity and the flow of nutrients that enable plants to thrive without soil, pesticides or herbicides.
Mr. Brusberg's colleagues in the greenhouses include men and women who have dealt with autism, cerebral palsy, strokes, traumatic brain injury, Huntington's disease and severe bipolar disorder.
The program calls the trainees ''friends'' because ''they aren't really clients or consumers, and since many are older, they don't really answer to the word 'student,' '' said Wendie Blanchard, the nonprofit project's founder and program director.
The first friend in the program was Mrs. Blanchard's nephew, Arthur Blanchard, 33, who was born with Down syndrome. When he told his aunt how bored he was, toiling in a sheltered workshop popping dog treats like pigs' ears into plastic bags for five hours a day, they began discussing how he might find a more rewarding job.
''We thought, 'What would continue to be around in the recession?,' and we thought -- food,'' Mrs. Blanchard said, recalling their conversation five years later. ''We decided we wanted to create something more meaningful.''
Now, Mr. Blanchard's life has changed. ''And I've been learning a lot about hydroponic farming and packaging the produce,'' he said. ''I even do some of the deliveries to local restaurants. There are lots of challenges, but that's good.''
The program has received more than 100 inquiries from organizations in New Jersey and across the country, including Detroit; Birmingham, Ala.; Jackson, Wyo.; and Kealakekua, Hawaii. Also kicking the tires have been the William J. Clinton Foundation and representatives of Jon Bon Jovi, who sponsors affordable housing for AIDS patients in Newark. Sir Richard Branson, who is constructing a Virgin Spa in Peapack, checked out the greenhouse in Sussex County, at the New Jersey State Fair Grounds in Augusta, last year. Over the last four months, revenues from each greenhouse has averaged $1,500 a week, ''which is profitable,'' Mrs. Blanchard said. Profits are reinvested. The program has applied for grants to establish greenhouses at veterans' hospitals for disabled military personnel and hopes to establish greenhouses at schools to train developmentally disabled students and to teach healthy eating.
And along with the greenhouse here and the one in Sussex County, there is the Arthur & Friends Urban Greenhouse and Training Center in Orange, in more densely populated Essex County.
''I thought it would also be perfect for urban areas, where there are so many unemployed people, especially ex-offenders and disabled veterans,'' said Lorraine Gibbons, coordinator of the year-old, 1,800-square-foot Orange greenhouse, which has trained 10 ex-offenders, two of them veterans. ''The idea is to keep the entire cycle in the urban community, growing food in the neighborhoods, distributing it there and selling it there.'' The operation has sold to Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan, along with New Jersey restaurants and a farmer's market in Newark.
The greenhouses grow an assortment of greens including Claytonia, dandelions, basil, arugula, kale, Tuscan kale, curly red Russian kale, cilantro, mizuna, tak soi, bok choy and Swiss chard. The program provides restaurants with seed catalogs, encouraging them to place custom-blend orders.
''It used to be that you'd wait for the ramps to come up in the spring,'' said Andre de Waal, the chef and an owner of Andre's restaurant in Newton, who has been buying Arthur & Friends greens for eight months. ''But now, for 12 months a year we can have this beautiful, fresh produce.'' In winter, he said, ''to be able to work with a product that is still alive, while you're serving it, is a very special thing.''
Participants work 8 to 20 hours a week in a four-tier, 200-hour program that trains them in hydroponic agriculture and also teaches invoicing, ordering, shipping, conducting online sales and interacting with customers.
People with disabilities ''have long been excluded from the workforce, and have been given jobs to keep people busy -- repetitive manual labor or janitorial duties,'' said Elaine E. Katz, vice president of grant programs at the Kessler Foundation, which gave $48,162 to establish the Sussex County greenhouse in 2008 and $500,000 more in 2009 to expand the project to Hackettstown and other sites.
The project is unusual, she said, because it is potentially profitable and provides jobs with the possibility of advancement.
Mrs. Blanchard said the workers ''were breaking their own stereotypes about themselves.'' She added, ''As their sense of independence and entitlement increases, their dependency on their families and friends -- and on social services -- goes down.''
One trainee, Andrew Cohen, 43, has risen to assistant greenhouse manager in Hackettstown despite developmental and anxiety disorders. ''My goal is fulltime employment,'' he said. ''It keeps you from being in the house and being bored.''
When graduates are hired in the program's greenhouses, their hourly pay rate can range from $7.45 to $13, depending on their responsibilities. Graduates receive assistance in finding employment at the estimated 184 greenhouses in the five-county area of the Northwest New Jersey Community Action Program, the project's original sponsor.
The project is not entirely a garden of Eden. The greenhouses are expensive to start. Federal grants, which helped create the first greenhouse, are threatened in next year's budget. There is a long waiting list for training slots and jobs. And the program had to navigate a two-year learning curve in formulating a training and growing schedule, as managers experimented with crops to entice chefs, and calibrated the proper balance of hydroponic nutrients in water.
But now, Arthur & Friends is licensing its program for $10,000 a greenhouse, selling other organizations its hard-won know-how. Rutgers University has paid for advice on a planned greenhouse, and a nonprofit group in Portland, Ore., has agreed to do so.
As the program has grown, so have the workers.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Brusberg was demonstrating the technique of running a pizza cutter along seeded rows of baby All Star lettuce mix, to separate the plants.
''I'm open to where this takes me,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Uncertainty Drives Up Oil Prices

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Just when oil markets appeared to be calming, crude oil prices surged again on Tuesday as the potential for more oil shipment disruptions spread across the Middle East and North Africa.
With Libya's oil exports almost entirely halted for the last several days, renewed unrest in Oman, Iran and Iraq rattled oil traders. An interruption of shipments from any of those countries would further tighten oil supplies, even as Saudi Arabia has rushed to fill the vacuum of Libyan supplies by pumping more oil from its fields.
The worries about the oil supply rippled through other markets, with stock markets turning lower on concerns that the higher cost of energy would slow economic recovery.
Gold prices also surged on the latest reports, and indexes on Wall Street declined sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 1.3 percent. The Saudi Arabian benchmark stock index fell 6.8 percent. 
In the latest sign that the political contagion was spreading, demonstrators in Oman on Tuesday tried to block a major road leading to the industrial port town of Sohar. Protesters in recent days have set fire to at least one police station and two government office buildings in the normally stable Persian Gulf country, which is ruled by a family dynasty and is the largest non-OPEC oil producer in the Middle East.
''To have protests in Oman, which had previously been seen as a sleepy gulf kingdom, heightens concerns that nowhere is immune from the contagion affects,'' said Helima L. Croft, a director and senior geopolitical analyst at Barclays Capital. ''Every day we seem to have a new country with a new problem.''
Oman produces 860,000 barrels of oil daily, almost 1 percent of world supplies, and its production has been rising in recent years with investments from Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Repsol and other international companies. Its importance is magnified by the fact that its crude is of such quality that it can be blended by most refineries around the world, although most of its exports now go to China and Japan.
Oman straddles the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic route through which 40 percent of the world's oil tanker traffic crosses. On the other side of the strait lies Iran, another major producer, where there were reports on Tuesday that security forces had used tear gas to disperse protesters in Tehran. Iran, with approximately 10 percent of the world's oil reserves, exports about 3.7 million barrels a day.
The price of light sweet crude rose to $99.63 a barrel while Brent crude rose 3.24 percent to $115.42. Oil jumped above $100 a barrel in after-hours trading in New York. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline rose by nearly a penny on Tuesday to just over $3.37, which is 20 cents higher than a week ago.
In testimony on Capitol Hill, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said that it would take a sustained increase in oil prices to push up consumer inflation significantly and threaten the economy. ''Currently the cost pressures from higher commodity prices are being offset by the stability in unit labor costs,'' he added.
The rising tensions across the region sent the Saudi Arabian stock market into a tailspin, with Saudi shares suffering the biggest daily decline in more than two years despite rising oil prices. The Saudi index fell 6.8 percent, to its lowest close since July 2009. Refiners around the world have been hoping that Iraq, as violence ebbed, would again become a major oil producer, with production stabilizing at 2.3 million barrels a day. But over the weekend rebels bombed the country's largest refinery, reducing the refinery's capacity to refine petroleum products by 75,000 barrels a day. The attack came less than three weeks after a terrorist attack on a pipeline leading to a second refinery north of Baghdad.
Greg Priddy, an oil analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said it was ''highly unlikely'' that output in another major producer in the region would be shut off. But he said that markets were jittery because ''if the Saudis are going to make up for the shortfall in Libya, their spare capacity is thinner.''
He added, ''Another major country going out completely would use most of their spare capacity, and that is really what the market is worried about.''
Saudi Arabia has a total production capacity of 12.5 million barrels a day, and currently produces nine million barrels after increasing its output by several hundred thousand since the beginning of the year. Saudi officials say they are ready to pump what it takes to fill any supply gap, but much of its 3.5 million barrel excess capacity contains sour crudes that do not easily replace the Libyan sweet crude European refineries in particular desire to produce diesel. In Libya, major oil operations in the eastern part of the country remained under the control of rebel forces. While foreign operators withdrew most of their foreign workers, local Libyan employees can still produce some crude. Oil experts say at least one million of the country's 1.6 million barrels a day of production has been shut down.
Little if any oil can be shipped out of Libya because most ports were closed. Meanwhile, storage tanks were filling up rapidly. Oil traders said one major oil company cargo ship was supposed to berth this week, but no one was at the port to deliver an oil shipment, and shipping companies were reluctant to send ships into the Libyan ports.
Most fields in Libya are operated by a combination of the National Oil Company, which owns 50 percent of the fields, and international consortiums, which share the other half.
The Arabian Gulf Oil Company, the largest subsidiary of the Libya National Oil Corporation, claims it had broken off from its mother company. It said it would honor its contracts but would divert the funds to the opposition, not to Tripoli.
Arabian Gulf's Hamada field had been shut, and output at Nafoora, Sarir and Misla had dropped to under half of maximum capacity. The company was still exporting crude at the Tobruk terminal, according to a report by PFC Energy, a consulting firm, but Arabian Gulf has stated that with only sporadic loading operations, it could reach its maximum storage capacity within two weeks, even with the drastically reduced production levels.
Arabian Gulf officials ''have claimed that the company's export revenues will no longer be controlled by its parent company,'' PFC Energy said in the report, ''but have not been able to confirm how those revenues would be managed by the subsidiary or potentially channeled to Libya's opposition.''
Eni, the Italian oil giant and largest foreign operator in Libya, evacuated most of its employees and their families last week. The company's fields were still producing 120,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas, about half their capacity before the revolt began. The company declined to say which fields it had shut down and which were still in operation, citing safety concerns. Eni still has 21 Italian employees in Libya, a spokesman said.

11 percent went to China and only 3 percent to the United States. But in addition to 1.5 million barrels a day in petroleum exports, the country sent 350 billion cubic feet of natural gas to Europe, mainly through a pipeline to Italy. (Sources: Energy Information Administration

HEADLINE: In Ivory Coast, Bloodshed and Misery Prompt Exodus

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

 BODY:
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- At the Marcory market, iron shutters are pulled down tight over storefronts for block after block. In the Koumassi neighborhood, idle men drift up to a rare open vendor, cadging a lone cigarette. Fish and grain stalls on the road into another area, Abobo, are deserted, save the rats scurrying in a facing gutter. Lines of women, fleeing the violence in a single-file exodus, balance possessions on their heads and then scatter at the sound of nearby gunfire.
Abidjan, once West Africa's most important city, is collapsing under the weight of Laurent Gbagbo's armed fight to stay in power, three months after losing a presidential election. 
Businesses are shutting, employees are being laid off by the dozen and families complain of going without meals. Traffic is minimal, and roadblocks operated by rock-wielding, pro-Gbagbo youth groups are everywhere. Amid the torrent of international sanctions against him, banks have closed, all A.T.M.'s have shut down and cash is rarer by the day.
But still Mr. Gbagbo refuses to yield. If anything, the world's shift of focus to the uprisings in the Arab world appears to have emboldened him. Bloody incursions continue into neighborhoods that support the opposition. Xenophobic language airs nightly on the state television channel and from the mouths of government officials -- ''France, the United States and the United Nations are provoking civil war in Ivory Coast,'' a Gbagbo spokesman, Alain Toussaint, said in a recent interview. And on Monday, Mr. Gbagbo's forces fired on United Nations inspectors seeking to determine whether his government had imported attack helicopters from Belarus in violation of an arms embargo.
This week also, nine newspapers opposed to Mr. Gbagbo closed, saying they could no longer withstand police harassment and constant threats of violence against their journalists. ''They've been summoned repeatedly by the Crime Squad'' of the Gbagbo government, said a spokesman for the papers, Dembele Al Seni.
Meanwhile, the man who nations across the world say defeated Mr. Gbagbo in last year's election, Alassane Ouattara, a former International Monetary Fund official, remains trapped in a lagoon-side hotel, protected by United Nations troops.
But increasing signs of armed assaults against Mr. Gbagbo's forces have appeared in recent days. Some of his soldiers-- estimates range from 3 to 27 -- were killed in Abobo last week by a shadowy militia that fades into the neighborhood after attacking, leaving pro-Gbagbo troops, rifles bristling from the sides of trucks, cautiously patrolling Abobo's edges. And late last week, gunmen affiliated with the armed rebellion against the government in 2002 captured several small towns in the country's west from Mr. Gbagbo's forces.
''It's war in the trenches, not open warfare,'' said a diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, predicting further bloodshed and no quick resolution.
He said armed ''pressure'' on Mr. Gbagbo had begun, aided by defections from his troops. With diminishing revenue coming into the government -- European Union sanctions have blocked trade with certain entities tied to the government, including the ports -- and the nation's accounts at the regional central bank shut off by West African leaders, only about half of February's army and civil-service salaries were paid, the diplomat said.
The new resistance has increased perils here. ''The danger of reprisals on civilians is very real,'' the diplomat said. ''I'm afraid the price of his fall could be very heavy, like Qaddafi.''
In Abidjan, blocklong fields of uncollected garbage are not uncommon, and signs of exasperation with this stifling status quo are everywhere.
On Tuesday morning, dozens of women marched in a tight pack through the mostly pro-Ouattara Koumassi neighborhood waving leafy branches and chanting ''We want peace!'' -- one of a number of spontaneous anti-Gbagbo demonstrations here in recent days.
Gunfire sounded the previous night in Koumassi, and there were several deaths. Mr. Gbagbo's forces often raid in darkness, the residents explained. Then on Tuesday again, the pop-popping of semiautomatic rifles by Mr. Gbagbo's troops could be heard after several minutes, a warning to the marchers. Yet they kept on.
''We're marching because we are tired,'' Kankou Samake shouted above the din. ''We can't sleep. We are not able to eat. And our husbands are not working since Gbagbo demonized the whites,'' she said, explaining that European-owned firms here had shut down or suspended operations.
''We are hungry. There is no work for our men,'' said another marcher, Aminata Traore.
A line of neighborhood men watched the women, approving but not joining in. ''They are fed up,'' said Maiga Mikailou, a hardware-stall owner, explaining that his store had been closed for a week. ''Nobody is eating.''
Elsewhere in Abidjan, fear prevailed over anger.
''It's too frightening,'' said an Abobo resident, Jean Kimon, walking slowly down the road out of the neighborhood, carrying his possessions in a small plastic bag. ''Everyone's leaving.''
A thin trickle of women followed Mr. Kimon. ''Too dangerous to stay,'' a woman said, walking as fast as the large plastic bag on her head would allow her to. ''The attackers are threatening us,'' she said. ''There are bodies on our street.''
Shattered storefronts lined the road, looted over the weekend by pro-Gbagbo youth in a neighborhood supporting his rival, residents said. The political violence has added to the economic misery, which has become more acute as the crisis wears on.
''Everything's broken,'' said an unemployed electrician, Kouame Konan, looking across the road. ''Where are you going to work? Nobody can pay you anyway.''
The normally bustling Sococe shopping center in Deux Plateaux, another neighborhood, was unusually quiet Tuesday afternoon. The president of Ivory Coast's National Union of Shopkeepers, Abdoulaye Diakite, slowly sipped a coffee and explained: ''It's total desolation. Our members are in a panic. They don't know what to do. They have no access to their assets. And their stores have been looted.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Manufacturing Races While Construction Sags

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
United States manufacturers expanded at the fastest pace in nearly seven years in February, as factories continue to bolster economic growth.
But January was another difficult month for construction. Builders began work on fewer offices, shopping centers and other commercial projects in January, pushing construction spending down to near a 10-year low. 
In its report on manufacturing, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 61.4 points in February, up from 60.8 in January. That was the highest reading since it reached 61.4 in May 2004. The index bottomed out at 33.3 in December 2008, its lowest point in nearly 30 years.
Any reading above 50 indicates expansion. The manufacturing sector has now expanded for 19 months.
A gauge measuring orders rose and an employment index topped 60 for only the third time in a decade. But prices paid for raw materials rose for the third straight month, a sign that inflation could be a problem.
In the construction sector, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday that builders trimmed their activity 0.7 percent in January after a revised 1.6 percent decline in December.
The consecutive declines pushed total spending down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $791.8 billion in January, close to the decade low of $791.5 billion hit in August.
The current pace of construction activity is just about half of the annual $1.5 trillion level that economists believe would signal a healthy construction sector. They think it could be another four years before construction recovers to that level.
Builders have struggled with falling demand since the housing bubble burst, helping to push the country into the deep 2007-9 recession. The recession lowered overall economic activity and that depressed demand for office buildings, hotels and shopping centers. In addition, banks tightened lending standards, making it harder for builders to get financing for projects.
For January, total private construction fell 1.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted rate of $490 billion.
Housing activity rose 5.3 percent to a rate of $245.6 billion but private nonresidential construction dropped 6.9 percent to a rate of $244.4 billion. The weakness in this area was led by an 18.2 percent drop in construction of hotels and motels. Spending on office buildings fell by 6 percent and the category that includes shopping centers was down 1.4 percent.
Government construction edged up 0.1 percent to an annual rate of $301.8 billion in January, supported by a 9.1 percent rise in federal projects, which climbed to an annual rate of $31.5 billion.
Construction by state and local governments fell 0.9 percent to an annual rate of $270.4 billion. Building at the state and local level is being constrained by efforts to get control of large budget deficits.

HEADLINE: In Service to the Public

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
If Alison Sadock had finished college before the financial crisis, she probably would have done something corporate. Maybe a job in retail, or finance, or brand management at a big company -- the kind of work her oldest sister, who graduated in the economically effervescent year of 2005, does at PepsiCo.
''You know, a normal job,'' Ms. Sadock says.
But she graduated in a deep recession in the spring of 2009 when jobs were scarce. Instead of the merchandising career she had imagined, she landed in public service, working on behalf of America's sickest children. 
Ms. Sadock is part of a cohort of young college graduates who ended up doing good because the economy did them wrong.
As job hunts became tough after the crisis, anecdotal evidence suggested that more young people considered public service. Exactly how big that shift was is now becoming clear: In 2009 alone, 16 percent more young college graduates worked for the federal government than in the previous year and 11 percent more for nonprofit groups, according to an analysis by The New York Times of data from the American Community Survey of the United States Census Bureau. A smaller Labor Department survey showed that the share of educated young people in these jobs continued to rise last year.
''It's not uncommon for me to hear of over 100 applications for a nonprofit position, sometimes many more than that, and many more Ivy League college graduates applying than before,'' said Diana Aviv, chief executive of Independent Sector, a trade group for nonprofits. ''Some of these people haven't been employed for a while and are happy to have something. But once they're there, they've recalibrated and reoriented themselves toward public service.''
It is not clear, though, whether a different starting point will truly ''recalibrate'' these workers' long-term career aspirations -- that is, whether their newfound paths will stick, or if they will jump to more lucrative careers when jobs are more plentiful.
Renewed interest in public service is visible across the country. Applications for AmeriCorps positions have nearly tripled to 258,829 in 2010 from 91,399 in 2008. The number of applicants for Teach for America climbed 32 percent last year, to a record 46,359. Organizations like Harvard's Center for Public Interest Careers have been overwhelmed -- and overjoyed -- with the swelling demand from talented 20-somethings.
Several factors probably contributed to these phenomena. Perhaps President Obama indeed made public service ''cool'' as he had promised during his presidential campaign. Some experts say millennials -- those who grew up in the 1990s or the 21st century -- are unusually big-hearted, maybe because of the community service requirements they had in school.
''The millennial generation is a generation that is just more interested in making a difference than making a dollar,'' said Max Stier, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group that advises government recruiting efforts.
And indeed, the numbers of educated young people working in public service jobs had been rising ever so slightly since the turn of the millennium.
The sudden surge in 2009, though, suggests that the absence of traditional private sector jobs forced many of the country's best and brightest into lower-paying, if psychically rewarding, work.
Since the recession began three years ago, the private sector has shed 7 percent of its jobs. The federal government, meanwhile, has expanded its payrolls 3 percent.
While many of those who graduated in 2008 got whisked off to high-paying jobs in consulting and finance, the graduates of the barren years of 2009 and 2010 were not courted in the same way. They were mostly left to scrounge about for their own job leads.
''We had to think deeper about our careers, and different kinds of careers,'' Ms. Sadock says.
A consumer affairs and business major at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Ms. Sadock spent the summer before her senior year as an intern in the buying department at Kohl's. She assumed she would exit school with a job in retail as a merchandising analyst.
''I wasn't really sure what types of jobs existed,'' she said. ''Retail was what I knew, and nonprofit jobs didn't really pop into my head as opportunities.''
She sent resumes all over the place, with no luck. The summer after graduation she moved home to Greenwich, Conn., where she and six high school friends commiserated over their dire employment prospects. They banded together to form Grads4Hire, a Babysitters-Club-esque group that did odd jobs like catering and secretarial work.
The members of Grads4Hire also advertised that they would do one hour of community service for every job they booked. They were all active volunteers in college -- in the case of Ms. Sadock, through her sorority's partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, an organization devoted to children with life-threatening illnesses.
This was a way to ''give back,'' Ms. Sadock said, and also make themselves ''a little more marketable.'' It was her first clue that her interests in public service and in paying her bills were in any way related.
At the end of the summer, she moved to Los Angeles to work part time as a personal assistant. Meanwhile, she began searching for a full-time job.
One acquaintance mentioned an opening at Starlight Children's Foundation, an organization providing entertainment, education and other support to seriously ill children.
Ms. Sadock was an attractive candidate for Starlight. In addition to her volunteer work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, she had a resume item Starlight was not used to seeing: a business degree.
Ms. Sadock was hired almost immediately as a corporate accounts assistant, working with corporate donors like California Pizza Kitchen and Wyndham Hotels on marketing and sponsorship opportunities for Starlight's programs.
The job is, she says, a perfect application of everything she was trained to do, and had originally planned to do, for the private sector.
''But now I'm serving a purpose,'' she says, rather than just ''helping some large corporation sell more widgets.''
Like Ms. Sadock, many of the dozen other young graduates interviewed for this story say that, in retrospect, they are grateful the private sector shut them out.
''I always thought that nonprofit work was something I'd do as charity, and then have an agency job for a paycheck,'' said John Warren Hanawalt, 26, a graphic designer in Boston.
He applied at public relations firms after graduating from Stonehill College in Easton, Mass., in December 2009, but the contract work they offered was not enough to make ends meet.
Nearly a year later, he found a job at Fenway Health, a nonprofit group that works with Boston's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. ''It took me a while to see that graphic design could fit into my passion for social justice in a sort of integral way.''
Though happy to have found an energetic, educated, cheap group of workers to replace retiring baby boomers, some nonprofits worry that their popularity among today's youth may not outlast this period of high unemployment.
Several studies have found, though, that economic conditions at the start of a worker's career can affect their long-term goals. For most entry-level positions, the pay difference between jobs in nonprofits and those at profit-making companies is often negligible.
''I don't get paid a million dollars, that's for sure,'' says Ms. Sadock, who is paid $35,000 annually. ''But I am financially independent, and I make ends meet.''
But a few years into the job, the upside is generally much greater for private sector employees. Workers in management jobs at companies, for example, earn about 22 percent more than their nonprofit counterparts.
It is easier to be idealistic and relatively unconcerned about wages when workers are young, childless and mortgage-free; attitudes toward the importance of financial remuneration can change when responsibilities add up.
''I'm not opposed to working in the private sector, depending on what was available as I get older and need a more lucrative career to support family and so on,'' Ms. Sadock says. ''But I'd still like to be something more meaningful. Maybe something in corporate philanthropy would work.''

Re ''Treat the Patient, Not the CT Scan'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 27):
As Abraham Verghese so aptly puts it, technology at the bedside is too often supplanting the hands-on physical exam in medical practice. The many errors that follow are both predictable and potentially catastrophic in overlooking critical clues to diagnosis, unnecessary testing and exposure to radiation. The costs mount as we lose the patient amid the wiring.
There is as well a further distance imposed by technology, and this is the distance between two human hearts: the physician's and the patient's. Empathy and kindness take back seats to the printout. Yet rather than seeing this as an excess of technology, we might see it as a dearth of values. 
If we value the emotional and spiritual aspects of our humanness, we will assure their constancy within medical practice. Critical to reforming our health care is the reassertion of these values, their reinsertion into practice and training, and reimbursement that reflects the time and attention needed to treat the patient in all of his or her humanity.
Johanna Ferman Martinez, Calif., Feb. 27, 2011
The writer, a doctor, is director of behavioral health, ambulatory care, in the health services department of Contra Costa County.
To the Editor:
Abraham Verghese presents a false choice. A good doctor does not shun medical technology; rather, she uses it to supplement, not supplant, her powers of reason. The physician who listens attentively to the history, lays his washed hands on the patient for a detailed exam yet always skips the high-tech tests is not a paragon of medical humanism; he is a Luddite who will harm people.
I for one do not want to go back to the days when hip fractures too small to be seen on X-ray were detected by stethoscope -- rotating the hip and listening for crunchy sounds. Give me an M.R.I. any day.
Joseph Bernstein Haverford, Pa., Feb. 27, 2011
The writer is an orthopedic surgeon.
To the Editor:
Abraham Verghese focuses on medical education as the culprit for the overreliance on CT scans at the expense of a more hands-on approach. But there are also the economic incentives that drive doctors in that direction. The large medical group practice I use for my health care owns its own imaging center, and it is indeed a busy place.
I am covered by Medicare, and the paltry reimbursement rate for an office visit pales in comparison to that for scans. In my case, a recent colonoscopy led to a CT scan to explore an irregularity. It was negative, but found something ''suspicious'' in my lung.
The pulmonary specialist prescribed a PET scan. That, too, was negative, but I was then told to follow up with three more CT scans over the ensuing two years. This all adds up to an enormous radiation risk.
I decided to seek further medical counsel outside of the group. As a lay person, I am not in a position to evaluate recommended medical procedures. Nor do I want to wonder if profit motives shape those procedures.
Stanley Herz Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., Feb. 27, 2011
To the Editor:
Abraham Verghese brings out some very important aspects of health care.
Physical diagnosis has become a lost art in this country. I do not blame technology for that loss.
Most doctors are afraid of being sued, and that results in scans and laboratory tests that may be remotely linked to the patient's condition. The easy accessibility of technology in the United States dumbs down the clinical methods that the doctors learned in medical schools.
Unless there is reform in the legal system, I am afraid that the situation that Dr. Verghese complains of will only get worse along with a huge waste in health care dollars.
Somdev Roy Mount Pleasant, Mich., Feb. 27, 2011
The writer is an oncologist at the Norval K. Morey Cancer Center.
To the Editor:
I appreciate Abraham Verghese's efforts to look beyond the scan, but he has skirted an important issue, which is, Why are scans so prevalent in the first place?
Scans -- M.R.I., CT, ultrasound and PET -- generate profits and revenue, for the manufacturers who make the devices, for the doctors who prescribe them, and for the hospitals and labs that perform them. This, I believe, is the primary reason that scans are such a routine (and growing) part of American health care.
As Dr. Verghese points out, such scans often have the effect of creating distance between health care professionals and patients. This is one good reason to reduce their use. An equally good reason is that scans are a source of health care inflation, generating additional costs while providing little benefit in many cases.
We should focus not just on the ''distancing'' effect of scanners, but also on their efficacy and the effect they have on health care cost inflation.
John Ranta Hancock, N.H., Feb. 27, 2011
To the Editor:
Abraham Verghese makes some excellent points. One thing he does not address is how much this overreliance on technology is costing.
When my mother was hospitalized with the terminal stages of heart failure, she was given one CT scan after another. It was frustrating for her daughters to see this, knowing that in the end it drove up her Medicaid bills without doing anything to ease her suffering. No one consulted with her or her family about the tests ordered; they just went ahead and did them.
I don't fault the doctors for giving her the best care they could; I do fault them for not seeing the whole picture. It was as if they were frantic to just see ''one more scan'' that might tell them something different from what they knew to be true.

HEADLINE: Feeling Budget Pinch, States Cut Insurance Rolls

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
EASTON, Pa. -- Ken Kewley woke up Tuesday without health insurance for the first time in nearly nine years.
So did most of the 41,467 other Pennsylvanians who had been covered by adultBasic, a state-subsidized insurance program for the working poor that Gov. Tom Corbett shut down on Monday in one of the largest disenrollments in recent memory.
Mr. Corbett, a Republican elected in November, has said the program he inherited is not sustainable with Pennsylvania facing a $4 billion budget shortfall. He blames his predecessor, Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat, for not keeping the plan solvent. His administration notified beneficiaries in late January that their coverage would expire Feb. 28.
For Mr. Kewley, 57, an abstract artist in this gritty town in the Lehigh Valley, it meant the end of the coverage that made possible an aortic valve replacement last May. While the life-saving procedure cost about $85,000, he said he had paid only $915 out of pocket. 
The state has pointed Mr. Kewley toward other options, but the coverage would be less comprehensive and the premiums far higher than the $36 he had been paying each month. Now any minor symptom, like a mild pinch in his chest, prompts a devil's calculation about whether he can afford to have it checked.
When he noticed such discomfort on Tuesday morning, he broke into a cold sweat, felt his stomach tightening and experienced ''a sense of impending doom,'' he said. For the moment, Mr. Kewley is trying to convince himself it is just a pulled muscle.
''It's a worry, and it's draining,'' he said, seated in the home studio where he applies bold acrylics to landscapes of the sloping hillsides nearby. ''It's always present in my mind so it's hard to come up here and do my work.''
Pennsylvania is one of several destitute states seeking to help balance budgets by removing adults from government health insurance programs.
Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington, a Democrat, recently removed 17,500 adults covered under Basic Health, a state-financed plan for the working poor. In Arizona, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, proposes to remove up to 250,000 childless adults who have been insured by her state's Medicaid program under a decade-long agreement with the federal government.
Medicaid, which is financed jointly by state and federal governments, primarily covers low-income children, parents and the disabled. Most states do not now offer coverage to childless adults, but starting in 2014, the new federal health care law will require them to expand Medicaid to insure adults earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level.
Former Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, started Pennsylvania's adultBasic program in 2001 to cover those who earned too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford private insurance.
Originally supported with national tobacco litigation proceeds, the policies were made available to adults who earned up to twice the federal poverty level (which would be $21,780 this year).
When the tobacco money started to dwindle, Mr. Rendell negotiated a deal with the state's four nonprofit Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurers, which had been accumulating large surpluses. The Blues agreed to contribute to the plan to show they were fulfilling the charitable obligation that accompanies their tax-exempt status. The agreement expired on Dec. 31.
Over six years, the Blues provided $542.7 million to the plan, and $356.5 million more to other state health programs. They agreed last year to add $51 million to help maintain coverage through the fiscal year, which ends in June. It was not nearly enough.
The program's revenue streams have never met more than a fraction of its demand, which has soared in the economic downturn. When the program closed, 505,000 people were on its waiting list, nearly seven times as many as in early 2007.
In an interview, Kevin Harley, a spokesman for Governor Corbett, called the program's closing ''unfortunate,'' and then quickly blamed Mr. Rendell. He said the former governor had pledged to find $56 million to sustain the plan as part of last year's deal with the Blues, but never did.
Donna Cooper, who was Mr. Rendell's secretary of policy and planning, and the senior official in those negotiations, called Mr. Harley's assertion ''just wild.''
''That is patently untrue,'' said Ms. Cooper, now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. ''That commitment was never made.''
Mr. Corbett met with the Blue Cross plans, but did not persuade them to make additional contributions. ''My understanding is that the Blues were not willing to continue,'' Mr. Harley said. ''They fulfilled all their obligations under the law.''
The Obama administration rejected the state's request to allow refugees from adultBasic to qualify immediately for the high-risk insurance pool authorized under the federal health law. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, responded that she could not waive the law's requirement that applicants be uninsured for six months.
In Harrisburg, the state capital, Democratic legislators proposed to keep the program alive by seeking $25 million each from the Blues and the state, and by nearly doubling premiums. The Republicans, who control both houses of the General Assembly, have expressed no support.
''At the end of the day, the Blues are not willing to do it,'' said Senator Jay Costa Jr., the minority leader, ''and the administration is not willing to put the strong arm on them to get them to participate in the way that Governor Rendell did.''
The Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans continue to run substantial surpluses, rising to a cumulative $5.6 billion in 2009 from $3.5 billion in 2002, according to the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, a research group that advocates for low-income families.
But the insurers say their obligation to pay for a state program has ended. ''Our support to adultBasic was always a temporary financing mechanism,'' said Aaron Billger, a spokesman for Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, the largest of the state's plans. ''We have long told the state that it was unsustainable.''
As the program's shutdown loomed, many enrollees scurried to schedule doctors' appointments and procedures. Mr. Kewley had his blood checked, and asked for new prescriptions. Roseanne Davis, a mother of two from Perkasie, scheduled a hysterectomy for Monday, her final day with coverage.
Doctors had discovered a benign ovarian cyst in January, but told her it did not have to be removed immediately. ''I said, let's get this done before I roll off insurance,'' Ms. Davis said. ''Down to the last day.''

HEADLINE: Credit Card Data Tells Mixed Story

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD; Christopher Maag contributed reporting from Columbus, Ohio, and Nate Schweber from Paramus, N.J.

 BODY:
American shoppers did not shed their reliance on credit cards over the year-end holidays.
While the average debt on credit cards in December decreased by 4 percent compared with the same month a year before, Americans still carried an average of $4,284 on credit card statements in December 2010, according to data released this week by the credit monitoring company Experian.
The data offers conflicting versions of the economy's already mixed picture. While some consumers spent more during the holidays because the economy was rebounding, others were still unable to cover expenses without leaning on their credit cards. And while holiday spending also appeared to have been more robust than in the last several years, even more recent data has shown a bit of a slowdown in consumption this year.
''You've got people who already had good credit and were pretty much managing their credit, and because of the risk, paid down their debt even more,'' said Maxine Sweet, vice president for public education at Experian. Then there were ''very dramatic increases in debt by people who, mainly, lost jobs, but also had medical emergencies, and turned to credit cards to carry them through the hard times.'' 
The most recent consumer credit report from the Federal Reserve showed that revolving credit, which is mostly credit card debt, increased by 3.5 percent in December at an annual rate, the first such increase in 27 months. (That data included ''charge-offs,'' or debt that the credit card companies considered essentially uncollectible, while the Experian data, since it was pulled from active credit files, did not.) Card spending (including credit, debit and electronic benefit-transfer cars) was up 6.5 percent in December compared with spending at the same stores a year earlier, according to First Data, which processes merchant transactions.
Retailers tend to benefit from credit card spending, as it often means people are spending beyond their budgets.
Holiday spending rose 5.5 percent in the 50 days before Christmas in 2010 compared with 2009, according to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse. Much of that was driven by increases in apparel, jewelry and luxury goods.
While many shoppers had vowed to spend only with cash this holiday season, that was a budgeting trick that not everyone could use.
The cash shoppers, Ms. Sweet suggested, ''were the ones that were pretty much in control -- they can say, 'I'm going to be more conservative.' '' People under more difficult circumstances had to put certain debts on their credit cards, she said. In February, the retail analyst David Strasser issued a note to clients saying that the increase in credit spending was good news.
Spending at Visa and MasterCard in the United States was up a combined 8.3 percent for the fourth quarter, Mr. Strasser noted, ''a hopeful sign that big-ticket spending is in recovery mode for 2011.''
''Weak credit trends have clearly bottomed out,'' he wrote, and the increases in credit card spending ''will disproportionately help big-ticket retailers that were hit hard during the downturn, as credit was curtailed and consumers lacked liquidity to purchase big-ticket products.''
The Experian data, which is broken down by metropolitan area, also gives a sense of how different cities may be recovering from the recession.
The city with the highest card debt in December was San Antonio, with $5,177 due on average, 21 percent above the national average. (The figures include debts on regular credit cards and retail Visas and MasterCards, but not a retailer's own card -- so a Gap-brand credit card would not be included, but a Gap Visa card would.)
San Antonio was followed by Jacksonville, Fla., at $5,115, a city with one of the lowest average credit scores, suggesting that pure debt may have been piling up there. Dallas, which came in at fifth with $4,936, also has one of the lowest average credit scores in the country.
Atlanta was third, with $4,960, and Honolulu, with $4,939, was fourth.
In 2009, the list of cities with the most credit card debt was similar: Dallas, Atlanta, San Antonio, Jacksonville and the Waco, Tex., metropolitan area.
Jeanie Wyatt, chief executive of the San-Antonio based advisory firm South Texas Money Management, said the economy in the city had been quite steady.
''Our unemployment rate is lower than the national average,'' she said, ''the health care field has been fast-growing, and of course we still have a big military component, and tourism, and a growing energy component. People are feeling, I think, pretty good about their job security.''
She said San Antonians were largely living on working-class paychecks, which could explain some of the credit card debt.
''While San Antonio has a lower unemployment rate and a more stable economy, our wage earners are at that mid- to lower end,'' she said. ''I would presume that lower-income individuals tend to have a higher percentage of credit card debt.''
The cities that racked up the lowest credit card debt for December were Sioux Falls, S.D. ($3,446); the area in Tennessee and Virginia around Kingsport, Johnson City and Bristol ($3,449); Fort Wayne, Ind. ($3,476); Paducah, Ky.($3,515); and Davenport, Iowa ($3,515).
In December 2009, the cities with the lowest credit card debt were Altoona, Pa.; Lafayette, La.; Evansville, Ind.; Davenport, Iowa; and Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
VantageScore, a credit rating produced by the three major reporting bureaus, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, gives a picture of whether the credit card spending came from economic confidence, or from desperation.
Midwest and West Coast cities dominated the list of cities with the 25 highest VantageScores. Wisconsin had three cities on that list (Green Bay, at No. 1; Madison, at No. 2; and Milwaukee, at No. 21). Several states had two: California (San Francisco and Santa Barbara), Minnesota (Minneapolis and the Valley City-Fargo area, which crosses into North Dakota), Oregon (Eugene and Portland) and Iowa (Cedar Rapids and Des Moines). There were no Southern or Southwestern states on the list of the top credit scores.
''Cities like Minneapolis, that always have great credit scores, actually have higher debt than other cities,'' Ms. Sweet said. ''But it's offset by the fact that they never miss payments, and they always have high credit limits.''
The list of the 25 cities with the lowest VantageScores in December was heavily Southern. Texas had seven cities on the list (Harlingen, El Paso, Tyler, Waco, San Antonio, Dallas and Houston, going from lowest to highest credit scores). Other than two California cities (Bakersfield and Fresno) and Las Vegas, every other city on the list was from the South.
''Part of that is a lot just a lot of younger people moving in, and a larger migrant population -- so by younger, meaning not just in age, but also less depth in their credit history, and we think that's one factor,'' Ms. Sweet said of the lower credit scores in Texas in particular.
''When you have these consumers who are in crisis with foreclosures and unemployment, that has to be driving up their credit card debt,'' Ms. Sweet said.
Shoppers interviewed last December sounded quite cautious about their spending.
Julianne Cantarella, 43, was at the Garden State Plaza Mall in Paramus, N.J. (the New York metropolitan area is No. 42 on the Experian list of high credit card debt). Her house had finally sold over the summer after being on the market for a year and a half, she said, so she thought the economy was improving.
''But I did cut down on the money I'm spending and the amount of gifts I'm buying,'' she said.
In Columbus, Ohio (No. 12 on the Experian list), Dorothy Huggins, 54, was shopping with her granddaughter.
''Everybody in our family is fine -- nobody's lost their jobs, but I have lots of friends and neighbors who have been hit,'' Ms. Huggins said. ''That made us more conservative this year because we're wondering, are we next?''
''There are so many people hurting, through no fault of their own. And we're fortunate enough to be doing well,'' she said. ''So we bought a lot less stuff this year.''

HEADLINE: This Is Just The Start

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Future historians will long puzzle over how the self-immolation of a Tunisian street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, in protest over the confiscation of his fruit stand, managed to trigger popular uprisings across the Arab/Muslim world. We know the big causes -- tyranny, rising food prices, youth unemployment and social media. But since being in Egypt, I've been putting together my own back-of-the-envelope guess list of what I'd call the ''not-so-obvious forces'' that fed this mass revolt. Here it is: 
THE OBAMA FACTOR Americans have never fully appreciated what a radical thing we did -- in the eyes of the rest of the world -- in electing an African-American with the middle name Hussein as president. I'm convinced that listening to Obama's 2009 Cairo speech -- not the words, but the man -- were more than a few young Arabs who were saying to themselves: ''Hmmm, let's see. He's young. I'm young. He's dark-skinned. I'm dark-skinned. His middle name is Hussein. My name is Hussein. His grandfather is a Muslim. My grandfather is a Muslim. He is president of the United States. And I'm an unemployed young Arab with no vote and no voice in my future.'' I'd put that in my mix of forces fueling these revolts.
GOOGLE EARTH While Facebook has gotten all the face time in Egypt, Tunisia and Bahrain, don't forget Google Earth, which began roiling Bahraini politics in 2006. A big issue in Bahrain, particularly among Shiite men who want to get married and build homes, is the unequal distribution of land. On Nov. 27, 2006, on the eve of parliamentary elections in Bahrain, The Washington Post ran this report from there: ''Mahmood, who lives in a house with his parents, four siblings and their children, said he became even more frustrated when he looked up Bahrain on Google Earth and saw vast tracts of empty land, while tens of thousands of mainly poor Shiites were squashed together in small, dense areas. 'We are 17 people crowded in one small house, like many people in the southern district,' he said. 'And you see on Google how many palaces there are and how the al-Khalifas [the Sunni ruling family] have the rest of the country to themselves.' Bahraini activists have encouraged people to take a look at the country on Google Earth, and they have set up a special user group whose members have access to more than 40 images of royal palaces.''
ISRAEL The Arab TV network Al Jazeera has a big team covering Israel today. Here are some of the stories they have been beaming into the Arab world: Israel's previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, had to resign because he was accused of illicitly taking envelopes stuffed with money from a Jewish-American backer. An Israeli court recently convicted Israel's former president Moshe Katsav on two counts of rape, based on accusations by former employees. And just a few weeks ago, Israel, at the last second, rescinded the appointment of Maj. Gen. Yoav Galant as the army's new chief of staff after Israeli environmentalists spurred a government investigation that concluded General Galant had seized public land near his home. (You can see his house on Google Maps!) This surely got a few laughs in Egypt where land sales to fat cats and cronies of the regime that have resulted in huge overnight profits have been the talk of Cairo this past year. When you live right next to a country that is bringing to justice its top leaders for corruption and you live in a country where many of the top leaders are corrupt, well, you notice.
THE BEIJING OLYMPICS China and Egypt were both great civilizations subjected to imperialism and were both dirt poor back in the 1950s, with China even poorer than Egypt, Edward Goldberg, who teaches business strategy, wrote in The Globalist. But, today, China has built the world's second-largest economy, and Egypt is still living on foreign aid. What do you think young Egyptians thought when they watched the dazzling opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics? China's Olympics were another wake-up call -- ''in a way that America or the West could never be'' -- telling young Egyptians that something was very wrong with their country, argued Goldberg.
THE FAYYAD FACTOR Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad introduced a new form of government in the Arab world in the last three years, something I've dubbed ''Fayyadism.'' It said: judge me on my performance, on how I deliver government services and collect the garbage and create jobs -- not simply on how I ''resist'' the West or Israel. Every Arab could relate to this. Chinese had to give up freedom but got economic growth and decent government in return. Arabs had to give up freedom and got the Arab-Israeli conflict and unemployment in return.
Add it all up and what does it say? It says you have a very powerful convergence of forces driving a broad movement for change. It says we're just at the start of something huge. And it says that if we don't have a more serious energy policy, the difference between a good day and bad day for America from here on will hinge on how the 86-year-old king of Saudi Arabia manages all this change.

HEADLINE: A Tax Cut May Carve Into Budgets Of 19 States

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Struggling states could lose as much as $5.3 billion in tax collections during the next few years in an unintended consequence of one of the lower-profile federal tax cuts that President Obama signed in December, according to a report released Tuesday.
The tax-cut package the president signed in December is best known for extending the Bush-era tax rates for two years and giving a one-year payroll tax cut to most Americans. But it included a business tax cut that could blow a hole in state budgets: a provision allowing businesses to deduct the full value of new equipment purchases from their taxes through 2011. 
That cut, intended to spur the economy by encouraging businesses to spend more money on equipment, could end up costing 19 states as much as $5.3 billion in lost revenue over the next few years, according to the report, by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research organization based in Washington.
The 19 states stand to lose money because they link their state tax laws to federal tax law. So the newly allowed federal tax deductions that businesses in those states take will lower their taxable incomes, which would in turn have the effect of driving down state corporate and income tax collections.
The change could cost Illinois, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and other states hundreds of millions of dollars of lost revenue unless they decide to enact laws decoupling their state tax laws from the federal ones, the report said. When similar cuts have been passed before, it noted, many states have chosen to break with federal laws.
But some states do not intend to do so this time. In Pennsylvania, which the report estimated could lose $833 million in revenues over the next few years, the state's Department of Revenue announced last month that it had settled on a ''business-friendly'' interpretation of the law that could benefit as many as 117,000 corporate taxpayers.
The department said the new policy would not affect Pennsylvania's revenues in the long run because companies would simply be taking full deductions now, rather than spreading them out over several years. But this is a hard time for Pennsylvania to give large tax breaks up front: the state faces an estimated $4 billion deficit in the coming fiscal year.
The unexpected tax change is just one example of how difficult it can be for states to perform one of their most important tasks: guessing how much money they will collect in the coming year, so they will know how much will be available to spend.
Those educated guesses, known as revenue estimates, were the subject of another report released Tuesday by the Pew Center on the States and the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. It found that errors in those revenue estimates have grown progressively worse during the last three fiscal crises, and that during the first year of the Great Recession states overestimated the amount of money they expected to collect by $49 billion, leading to difficult midyear budget cuts. Some states were off by more than 25 percent, it found.
During periods of economic growth, the report found, states tend to underestimate tax collections, resulting in surpluses at the end of the year. But states tend to underestimate the severity of economic downturns: then, they usually come up with overly optimistic estimates of how much they expect to collect. The report warned that ''as forecasting revenue accurately becomes more difficult, states have a tougher time balancing their budgets to provide taxpayers the services they expect and ensuring the long-term fiscal health of the state.''

HEADLINE: Union Pay Isn't Busting State Budgets

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com; twitter.com/DLeonhardt

 BODY:
When Ed Rendell became the mayor of Philadelphia in 1992, he started a fight with the city's labor unions that will sound familiar to anyone who has been following the recent news from Wisconsin. In his inaugural address, Mr. Rendell, a Democrat, announced, ''Philadelphia stands on the brink of total disaster.''
He told the city's unions that they needed to accept less generous health benefits, fewer holidays and a pay freeze. The unions promised to strike. Mr. Rendell pointed out, frequently and publicly, that the city offered better benefits than private companies did. The public sided with the mayor, and on most issues, the unions eventually caved. 
If you review the recent history of battles between unions and state or local governments, you'll find similar stories. In New York, Rudolph Giuliani won big concessions. In Chicago, Richard Daley did, too. In Wisconsin -- setting aside Gov. Scott Walker's attempt to end collective bargaining -- unions have already agreed to a significant cut in take-home pay.
It has become conventional wisdom to say that public sector unions are inherently problematic because they can use their political influence to win lavish pay from politicians. But that's not quite right. The real problem with most union contracts for public workers is not the money -- it's almost everything else.
On money alone, many politicians are pretty tough negotiators. They have both the motive and the means. They want to spend their budget on projects that are sexier than government pensions. And, as Mr. Rendell says today, politicians can often win a fight with unions in ''the court of public opinion.''
No wonder that academic papers spanning more than 30 years have found that government workers receive compensation that is similar -- with somewhat lower salaries and somewhat better benefits on average -- to that of private sector workers with similar qualifications. One study went so far as to include workers' scores on an intelligence test, to ensure the comparison was apples to apples. Over all, government workers are modestly underpaid or overpaid, depending on which technical accounting assumptions are used to value their pensions.
Either way, modestly is the crucial word. There is no good case that government pay is a major cause of the budget problems now facing states.
Unfortunately, though, politicians do not have the same incentives to be tough negotiators on issues besides money. Why not? Because most government agencies are monopolies. They face no competition. Whether they perform beautifully or miserably, they cannot be run out of business. They also can't be run out of business by pushing off costs until a future day. So they delay too many costs and don't perform their jobs well enough.
The delaying of costs is obvious. Both politicians and union leaders have decided that generous future benefits offer the easiest way to hold down spending and still satisfy workers. The result is government pay that's skewed too heavily toward pensions and health insurance.
To be clear, I'm making an argument that's different from ''Government workers are overpaid.'' I'm saying that they are paid in the wrong ways -- in ways that make life easier on union leaders and elected officials, at least initially, but that eventually hurt both workers and taxpayers.
The best example is health insurance. Health plans for union workers and retirees are much more likely to require little or no co-payment, which leads to lots of medical treatments that don't make people any healthier, and to huge costs. Ultimately, some of these plans will probably prove so expensive as to be unsustainable. Workers would have been better off accepting a less generous benefit package and slightly higher salaries.
The solution today is not to cut both the pay and the benefits of public workers, as would happen if workers in Wisconsin, Ohio and elsewhere lost their right to bargain. Remember, public workers don't get especially generous salaries. The solution is to get rid of the deferred benefits that make no sense -- the wasteful health plans, the pensions that start at age 55 and still let retirees draw a full salary elsewhere, the definitions of disability that treat herniated discs as incurable.
These changes will help the states' long-run budget problems, but of course they won't address the immediate, recession-induced crisis. Dealing with the crisis will require dealing with the second failure of government: subpar performance.
On Tuesday, an auditor released a report showing that the federal government was wasting tens of billions of dollars on specific programs that accomplished little. Inefficiency is just as big a problem in state and local governments. Yet many public sector unions have been terribly short-sighted on this issue.
They have too often blocked attempts to make government work better. Instead, they have protected their worst-performing members, at the expense of both the taxpayers and the thousands of public workers who do their jobs well. Only recently, for instance, have teachers' unions started to cooperate with serious efforts at teacher evaluation, and they are still not giving their full cooperation.
The tragedy -- or maybe it's the good news -- is that the government really can become more efficient when it tries. Indiana, under Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican, has had some success measuring its results and then improving them. (Mr. Daniels, less admirably, eliminated many state workers' bargaining rights in 2005.) Washington State, under Democratic governors, has had success, too. The Obama administration, meanwhile, has made the federal government more productive in a variety of modest ways.
A more efficient government is one that does not need quite so many employees to do the same work. Layoffs are not always necessary, either. Attrition can reduce a payroll fairly quickly, as has happened in Indiana.
Ideally, the states' current fiscal crisis will end up being the spark that forces government to improve. But even if that happens -- for that matter, even if Mr. Walker and some other governors succeed at slashing worker pay -- don't expect our budget problems to go away. They're too big.
Fat and happy government workers, however easy the caricature may be, are not the cause of our looming federal and state deficits. Neither are spineless politicians.
The cause is Americans' collective desire for low taxes and generous government benefits. We want our politicians to promise us tax cuts, a strong military, safe streets, good schools and unchanged Medicare and Social Security. And promise it all they do.
Eventually, we will have to pay for the government we want, regardless of what happens in Wisconsin.

HEADLINE: Governors Seek Help on Medicaid Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Governors told Congress on Tuesday that President Obama had not gone far enough in proposing to let states opt out of major provisions of the new health care law in 2014, and they said they needed more immediate relief from the growing financial burden of Medicaid.
''It sounds good, but it provides very, very little actual help,'' Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, a Republican, said of Mr. Obama's proposal. 
The most important provisions of the federal law, including a big expansion of Medicaid eligibility and a requirement that most Americans carry health insurance, take effect in 2014. The federal government will initially pay the entire cost of coverage for the people who are newly eligible for Medicaid, but after several years, states will be required to pay some of the cost.
Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, a Republican, said Medicaid had been a large and growing part of his state's budget even before the federal law was passed.
''In this recession,'' Mr. Herbert said, ''Medicaid enrollment has skyrocketed. In December 2007, enrollment in Utah stood at 158,267 individuals. In December 2010, enrollment stood at 230,812 individuals, a 46 percent increase in three years.''
The governors testified at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, a Democrat, told the committee that he was largely indifferent to the president's proposal because his state had already overhauled its health care system so that 98 percent of residents had health insurance.
The Republican governors said they were skeptical of the president's proposal because they would have to seek waivers, making the future of innovative state health programs subject to the discretion of the secretary of health and human services. In the past, they said, they have had difficulty obtaining permission for such initiatives.
Mr. Herbert said Utah had been trying for eight months to get federal permission to communicate with Medicaid recipients by e-mail and through a secure Web site. Only after he raised the issue with Mr. Obama at the White House on Monday did federal officials agree to the arrangement, Mr. Herbert said.
Utah estimates that the move will save more than $6 million a year. Federal officials said that Medicaid recipients had low incomes and that some might not have access to computers. So in a letter approving Utah's request, the Obama administration said the state could use e-mail only if beneficiaries ''elect to receive notices through an electronic mailing system.''
Medicaid is now an open-ended entitlement, under which anyone who meets eligibility requirements is entitled to benefits. Governors said they would accept a fixed amount of federal money, in the form of a block grant, if they had more freedom to tailor the program to their residents' needs.
The new health care law generally prevents states from adopting more restrictive eligibility requirements for Medicaid -- for example, by lowering personal income limits. The Republican Governors Association has asked Mr. Obama to lift that constraint.
Representative Joe Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, said Congress might need to give states more latitude. ''If states cannot change their eligibility criteria,'' Mr. Pitts said, ''governors are left with few choices but to cut payments to providers or cut other parts of the state budget, such as education and transportation.''
But Representative Gene Green, Democrat of Texas, said, ''States want the federal government to write them a blank check.''
Based on his 20 years of experience as a state legislator, Mr. Green said, that is not a good idea. In the absence of federal requirements, he said, Texas might try to balance its budget by eliminating coverage for tens of thousands of children.
Mr. Barbour said: ''We can save money without taking people off the rolls. In return for total flexibility in managing my Medicaid program, I would agree to a block grant, with growth capped at half the national rate of increase. We should not have to kowtow to Washington to get permission for every change.''
Jocelyn A. Guyer, co-executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, said the federal law also prohibited states from adopting enrollment procedures that made it more difficult for people to sign up for Medicaid.

HEADLINE: Born of 9/11, an Effort to Rebuild Shattered Haiti

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
Just four days after 9/11, James P. Stuckey, then a vice president of Forest City Ratner Companies, met with executives of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield at Forest City's headquarters in Brooklyn. Empire had been the fourth-largest tenant at the World Trade Center, and the shell-shocked executives were already thinking about new offices.
Mr. Stuckey promised them a building in 18 months, even though, he said, ''they didn't have any floor plans, they didn't know who had sat next to who, or even where much of their staff was.''
''Based on a handshake, we started to pour the foundation,'' at the MetroTech office plaza in downtown Brooklyn, said Mr. Stuckey, who in 2009 was appointed a dean of the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University. Soon after he assumed the position, he said, he started to think how he could teach students the lessons he learned after 9/11. 
The result was a course on postcatastrophe reconstruction, now in its second semester, where students devise building plans, work on environmental and social issues, and create financing models for real-world projects.
The devastating earthquake that hit Haiti on Jan. 12, 2010, provided an opportunity to put Mr. Stuckey's theory into practice. Starting last fall, students at the Schack Institute began assisting on three development projects there.
''The magnitude of the catastrophe in Haiti is unimaginable,'' Mr. Stuckey said. ''In that one 30-second earthquake, more people died than in the whole area impacted by the tsunami in Southeast Asia. Its grinding poverty, its proximity to the United States and the ability to get our feet on the ground quickly made it a perfect location for us to put our efforts to work.''
Postcatastrophe reconstruction -- which Mr. Stuckey defines as the period following a disaster from Week 2 to Year 5 -- is an emerging field in development circles, and it gained momentum after the tsunami that shook Indonesia in 2004. While many organizations focus on disaster preparedness and the emergency humanitarian efforts that crop up immediately after the event, ''there is a void that occurs in the interim period,'' Mr. Stuckey said. ''After the humanitarian aid ends, how do you transition to the rebuilding stage?''
The first project in Haiti is in Delmas 32, a neighborhood of one square kilometer in the country's capital of Port-au-Prince where 120,000 people lived before the earthquake. In comparison, New York City has 27,000 people per square kilometer, said T. Luke Young, an urban planner and a consultant who is working on the project. Approximately 1,500 of 5,000 buildings collapsed in Delmas 32, which lacks plumbing and electricity, and an additional 2,000 were structurally damaged.
With the help of a $30 million grant from the World Bank, a redevelopment plan is under way, and New York University students have been helping analyze the infrastructure, transportation needs, housing and social patterns, and are thinking of ways to determine land ownership.
''N.Y.U. has been remarkably helpful,'' Mr. Young said. One student, for example, has studied water management and treatment at Delmas 32 and is testing a model unit for capturing and treating rainwater, he said.
A second project is the Rebuilding Center in Port-au-Prince. Under the direction of Architecture for Humanity, the center provides work force training, education and other services, and connects Haitian professionals with nongovernmental organizations.
The New York University students are working on bolstering the Rebuilding Center's services by devising financing structures, equity models and other ways to finance businesses in hopes the center ''will become the Haitian economic development center in Port-au-Prince,'' said Mr. Stuckey, who was the director of the New York City Public Development Corporation, now called the New York City Economic Development Corporation, under former Mayor Edward I. Koch.
The third project is a joint effort of the Schack Institute, Architecture for Humanity and Habitat for Humanity. Called the North Pole, it is the redevelopment of roughly 16,000 acres just north of the capital.
Before the earthquake struck, some 10,000 to 12,000 squatters were on the land, but after the catastrophe and the announcement that the government was redeveloping the area, people flocked to the site. There are now 50,000 squatters, said Elizabeth K. Blake, the senior vice president for government affairs, advocacy and general counsel at Habitat for Humanity International.
''If we don't do something, don't get some commercial developers involved, get infrastructure up and running, and have the land rights sorted out, there is going to be a slum there no matter what,'' she said.
As an example of the practical effects of development and planning, a few weeks after the Haiti catastrophe, an earthquake of 8.8 magnitude hit Chile, lasting three minutes. Though it was much more severe and lasted far longer than the one in Haiti, the Chilean earthquake killed some 500 people compared with 316,000 in Haiti. Experts have attributed that difference in part to the superior quality of construction in Chile.
A central issue at the North Pole, as well as in Delmas 32 and other redevelopment projects in the country, is land ownership. Only 5 percent of the land in Haiti has documentation proving proprietorship, Mr. Stuckey said. It has long been a pattern that when the government in Haiti changes hands -- which has been often, given the country's history of political unrest -- land is often forcibly redistributed.
''We don't want to build a shelter that will cost $5,000 for a family that doesn't own the land,'' Ms. Blake said. ''We learned the hard way that after the shelter is built, someone else will say the land is theirs and throw the family off, and so the donor money will be spent on some other family and the family in need remains homeless.'' About 40 percent of the world's population is subject to forcible eviction from their homes because of a lack of documentation proving ownership, Ms. Blake said. In Haiti, that number is closer to 70 percent.
The work Mr. Stuckey and his students are undertaking is significant, Ms. Blake said. ''They have a very long resume and enormous experience dealing with commercial developers and the private sector, and that is critical to get these projects moving,'' she said
To document the work in Haiti, Mr. Stuckey brought on board a filmmaker, Frederic King, who has made four trips to Haiti and is producing a one-hour educational documentary. Mr. Stuckey is also laying the groundwork for what he hopes will be a center for postcatastrophe reconstruction at Schack, joining two other centers at the institute, one that studies real estate investment trusts and one that looks at environmental issues. He said he was completing a business plan for the center and had begun informal discussions with possible benefactors.
Mr. Stuckey said an ultimate goal was to create a reconstruction model that could be scaled up or down as needed, perhaps in the form of a field manual ''that would allow us to look at what is happening from region to region throughout the world and create best practices so that next time there is a catastrophe, we can rebuild without having to start from scratch,'' he said.
''When I first came to Schack,'' Mr. Stuckey said. ''I could have taught my students how to build condominiums in New York City, but being a person in my industry means building for all of society, and crisis situations are where we can have the biggest sociological impact.''

HEADLINE: Carlyle To Acquire Parts Maker In Japan

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
8:02 p.m. Updated
TOKYO - The Carlyle Group, the American private equity firm, said Tuesday it had agreed to buy a Japanese bearings and machine parts maker in a deal valued at about $800 million, the largest acquisition by a buyout firm in Japan in more than a year. 
Carlyle said it would buy a 95.56 percent stake in the company, Tsubaki Nakashima, from Nomura Holdings, parent of Japan's biggest brokerage firm.
The sale would be based on a valuation of Tsubaki Nakashima at 66 billion yen, or about $807 million, Nomura said.
Global private equity firms have long struggled in the Japanese market, where both management and shareholders remain highly suspicious of overseas control of companies and the associated restructurings, layoffs and increased debt. Deal-making also slowed substantially during the global financial crisis, as credit dried up and private capital fled Japan, which was particularly hard hit in the aftermath of the crisis.
More recently, private equity firms have focused on somewhat smaller targets and are adopting a more collegial approach, promising to support management and improve profitability.
Still, the Carlyle deal would be the largest buyout in the country by a private equity firm since Bain Capital bought Bellsystem24, a telemarketing company, from Citigroup in late 2009 for about $1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.
The deal is also Carlyle's first in Japan since its 2009 purchase of the auto software company Broadleaf from ITX for $212 million. Carlyle, based in Washington, has $98 billion in assets under management and is preparing for an initial public offering.
Meanwhile, Nomura is divesting itself of some of its riskier investments as it bolsters its capital before stricter global banking rules take effect. Last year, Nomura sold its investments in Huis Ten Bosch, a Japanese vacation resort, as well as Misawa Homes, a Japanese construction company.
Tsubaki Nakashima, whose products are used mainly in the machine tools, robotics, semiconductor and aerospace industries, posted net income of 171 million yen on 17.3 billion yen in sales for the year ended March 31, 2010. The manufacturer employs about 1,500 people and has factories in Japan, China, Taiwan, India, Poland and the United States.

HEADLINE: Fund Manager Settles Charges For $14 Million

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
8:30 p.m. Updated
The Securities and Exchange Commissioncharged a Bay Area hedge fund manager on Tuesday with siphoning off $12 million of investors' money - a case that casts a harsh spotlight on the controversial accounts known as side pockets. 
Authorities contend that the manager, Lawrence R. Goldfarb, through his company Baystar Capital Management, diverted investors' money to other entities, including a real estate fund. The S.E.C. claims that Mr. Goldfarb, a former Credit Suisse banker, tried to hide his actions by shifting money into the accounts of companies that no longer existed.
Mr. Goldfarb, who neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, agreed to pay $14 million to settle the charges, the commission said.
The case centers on side pockets, segregated accounts that hedge fund managers use to set aside thinly traded or illiquid investments. During the financial crisis, hedge funds stuffed billions of dollars into such accounts. But investors complained that the funds did not value the accounts properly and used them to hide investments that performed poorly.
''Hedge fund managers may not use side pockets to obscure their activities from investors,'' Robert Kaplan, co-chief of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division's asset management unit, said. ''Managers need to honor their obligations to investors, and investors should pay close attention to the discretion that managers wield over side-pocketed investments.''
In 2003, Baystar invested $8.4 million in a company that specialized in large commercial real estate projects, an S.E.C. complaint filed in federal district court in San Francisco says. Those assets were then placed in a side pocket, it contends.
Baystar earned more than $16 million on the investment, the S.E.C. says. But for years, Mr. Goldfarb sent investors false statements about the side pocket, authorities claimed. He used the money for other purposes, like personal expenses. Mr. Goldfarb did not disclose the returns to investors until August 2010, more than a year after he learned the S.E.C .was investigating him.
Calls to his investment firm, LRG Capital Group, were not returned.

HEADLINE: Deal Is Reached for Line Under Hudson Giving the City a New Source of Electricity

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
After being pressed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and other elected officials, New York City has struck a deal that would end months of wrangling over a plan to send electricity to Manhattan from New Jersey, people involved in the negotiations said Tuesday.
Faced with a deadline of Monday to complete a proposed deal for a power cable under the Hudson River, city and state officials negotiated through the weekend to decide how to share its costs. The talks culminated in a telephone discussion between the governor and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Monday afternoon, the people involved said. 
In the end, the city agreed to make payments starting at about $2 million annually and rising over 20 years, they said. In exchange, the city will get the benefit of an additional source of electricity that will make its power grid more reliable and provide access to power from new sources, including renewable sources like the wind.
Officials at City Hall, in the governor's office and at the New York Power Authority declined on Tuesday to discuss details of the agreement because it had not been signed. It must still be approved by the directors of the power authority, who are not scheduled to meet again until March 29, but could hold a special meeting sooner.
Larry Schwartz, an aide to Mr. Cuomo, was involved in the talks through Monday, people involved in the negotiations said. New York's two senators, Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten E. Gillibrand, also expressed support for the project to the mayor, as did the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn.
All of those officials were concerned that the city might not have enough power to keep lights and air-conditioners on during periods of peak demand. Some also said they believed the outside power could hold down rates for electricity in the city.
''This project is hugely beneficial to New York City because it brings a significant new source of power to bolster an already strained grid, it will sustain economic growth and it will facilitate more competition to help control rates,'' Mr. Schumer said.
The power would come through a seven-mile-long cable connected to the large grid that supplies electricity to New Jersey and other neighboring states. It would end at a Consolidated Edison substation on West 49th Street, in a neighborhood that is among the top users of power in the country.
The cable would be built by a private developer at a total cost, including upgrades to power lines in New Jersey, of about $850 million, said Edward M. Stern, president of PowerBridge, the developer's parent company. It would deliver up to 660 megawatts of electricity, or about 5 percent of the power consumed by New York City on the hottest summer days.
The project has been in the planning stage for several years, but it has encountered regulatory and bureaucratic obstacles. The current proposal piggybacks on an earlier idea from a different developer that eventually withdrew. That idea, in essence, was to run an extension cord from a power plant in North Jersey to the 49th Street substation.
In 2006, PowerBridge stepped in with a plan to connect the city to the regional power grid. Doing so would allow city and state agencies, like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to order power from a variety of sources west of the Hudson. Often, that power is significantly less expensive than electricity generated in the city.
The metropolitan area consumes much more power than it produces, so officials are going to greater lengths to arrange a new supply. Long Island now gets about one-fifth of the power it uses through a cable strung across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean from Sayreville, N.J. That cable, known as the Neptune project, was also built by PowerBridge.
If the power authority's board approves the agreement, Mr. Stern said, construction could begin in early May. He said that the work would take about 27 months and that the project would employ about 200 people during the period. Power could be flowing to the city in time for summer 2013, he said.
The developer faced a final deadline this week to procure the services of the companies that would make and lay the cable under the river, Mr. Stern said. Had an agreement not been reached this week, he said, the project might have been scrapped.
Once the cable reaches the Manhattan shore, a construction crew will have to thread it under the West Side Highway to 52nd Street, then down 12th Avenue to the substation between 49th and 50th Streets.
''We are delighted that the state and the city have reached agreement,'' said Barry S. Sternlicht, chairman of Starwood Energy Group, an investment firm behind the cable project.
He said the project would accomplish three of Mayor Bloomberg's long-term goals for the city by ''lowering the cost of energy, providing greater reliability and energy security and affording New Yorkers access to renewable power.''

HEADLINE: Pro Bono Campaign Aims to Keep The Kings in Sacramento

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
BILLBOARDS that went up in Sacramento recently say ''Game Over,'' with a deflated basketball representing the ''O,'' and, below that: ''If the Kings leave, we all lose.''
The billboards direct Sacramentans to a Facebook page, facebook.com/SacDeflated, where an online campaign aims to retain the N.B.A.'s Sacramento Kings, whose owners reportedly are contemplating a move 400 miles to the south, to Anaheim, Calif. 
Typically pro bono advertising campaigns like this one arise from a groundswell of citizens that persuades an agency to volunteer its services, but in this case a Sacramento firm, the Glass Agency, is heading the effort.
''Our goal is to provoke the community and make them pay attention,'' said Amber Williams, president of Glass, which is owned by the employees. ''We want to give them a reason to step up and take action, and a platform to do that.''
The deflated basketball in the ad, of course, is meant to signify how deflated many fans will feel if the team flees.
A Kings spokesman, Darrin May, did not respond to a request seeking comment.
The agency estimates the value of the campaign, which consists of four billboards and eight digital boards, to be as much as $200,000. The outdoor ads, which began Feb. 22 for a 30-day run, were bought at a discounted rate from billboard owners who were sympathetic, Ms. Williams said.
''We're not actually spending that much,'' said Ms. Williams, who declined to reveal out-of-pocket costs. ''We have a lot of great community partners and colleagues.''
If the Kings, the city's only professional franchise, were to leave, the city will lose cachet and that could hurt Glass when bidding against agencies from Madison Avenue and elsewhere, Ms. Williams said.
''For us, being from a city that has that legitimacy of a professional sports team is so critical to being taken seriously when we enter a room,'' Ms. Williams said. ''The Kings leaving could be detrimental for how Sacramento is received, and ultimately for how we are received as an agency.''
The idea for a billboard campaign was inspired, fittingly, by an earlier retention effort led by the Kings' owners, the brothers Joe and Gavin Maloof. In 2001, when the star forward Chris Webber also was contemplating a move to Southern California, in his case to play for the Los Angeles Lakers, the Maloofs bought space on a billboard on Interstate 80 in Sacramento, where Mr. Webber could not miss it when driving home from games at Arco Arena.
In the ad, Joe Maloof sat on a riding mower while Gavin stood nearby and promised, ''Chris, Joe will mow your lawn if you stay.''
Mr. Webber did stay, until 2005, but the Kings, featured in 2001 on a Sports Illustrated cover with the text ''The greatest show on court -- Sacramento Kings: basketball the way it oughta be,'' have struggled in recent years.
The team has not qualified for the playoffs since the 2005-6 season and has won only 26 percent of its games this season, one of the worst records in the N.B.A.; last season, the team won 31 percent of its games, and the season before, just 21 percent.
As for attendance, the team sold virtually all its seats in the 2002 season, averaging 17,317 fans per home game, but so far this season has averaged sales of just 13,494, leaving 22.1 percent of the seats empty, according to data on the ESPN Web site.
The Maloofs have long argued that Arco Arena is outdated. Although new stadiums and arenas for professional sports teams often are publicly financed, Sacramento voters in 2006 soundly defeated a measure that would have raised local sales taxes by a quarter cent to help finance a new arena, with 80 percent opposing.
In accordance with N.B.A. rules, the team was required to seek permission to move to Anaheim by Tuesday, but on Monday it filed a request to extend the deadline in order to discuss the matter with the N.B.A.'s board of governors, which will meet April 14.
''The Kings are a big deal here in many ways, not just economically but in terms of the nice warm glow they give the city,'' said Stan Atkinson, a longtime news anchor in Sacramento who retired in 1999. ''But those good years went bye-bye with the team losing its mojo.''
Mr. Atkinson, who has worked actively for local charities since retiring, said companies were most likely to support nonprofits in their backyards, and that the Kings helped such causes by getting ''the kind of attention that makes Sacramento a lot more interesting for a national company looking for headquarters.''
While he lauded the Glass agency for the campaign, saying, ''it's terrific they stepped up,'' Mr. Atkinson had little doubt that the Kings would depart.
''We're all going to feel the loss,'' Mr. Atkinson said. ''The harsh reality is that the Maloofs feel frustrated and more than a little angry about the way things have gone.''
Since appearing on Feb. 20, the campaign's Facebook page has gained hundreds of followers daily, to about 5,000 on Tuesday. The initial effort championed on Facebook was to rally residents to buy every ticket for the Kings Monday home game against the Los Angeles Clippers.
The effort was successful: the game sold out, and the Kings won, 105 to 99.
During a courtside interview from the game posted on the Web site of News 10, the Sacramento ABC affiliate, Joe Maloof said, ''It's an honor to see this place finally filled up again.''
When the interviewer asked, ''It's not too late, right?'' Mr. Maloof looked around awkwardly with a pained expression and said nothing for several seconds. Finally, an off-camera handler for Mr. Maloof thanked the reporter, and abruptly ended the interview.

HEADLINE: Concern Over Energy Sends Indexes Lower

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The major indexes slid on Tuesday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its first decline in three days, as concern that rising energy costs will hurt the economic recovery overshadowed the fastest manufacturing growth since 2004. 
Alcoa and Titanium Metals fell at least 3.7 percent as crude oil rose above $99 a barrel amid escalating unrest in the Middle East and northern Africa. Fifth Third Bancorp dropped 4.5 percent after receiving a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission for information on commercial loans. The Carnival Corporation slid 6.1 percent after the chief operating officer of the cruise line operator sold 180,000 shares.
The S.& P. 500 slipped 20.89 points, or 1.57 percent, to 1,306.33. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 168.32 points, or 1.38 percent, to 12,058.02, while the Nasdaq declined 44.86, or 1.61 percent, to 2,737.41.
''Anyone who thinks that a year from now we're going to look at the Middle East and see nothing but candy and roses, that's not going to happen,'' said Stanley A. Nabi, a vice chairman for the Silvercrest Asset Management Group in New York. ''Manufacturing, the overall U.S. economy, is doing well. Still, that geopolitical situation will be an overhang.''
Stocks erased an earlier advance after crude oil extended gains amid concern unrest would spread from Libya to Iran. Oil climbed as much as 1.9 percent as authorities in Iran, one of the largest producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, arrested opposition leaders to derail demonstrations.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, testifying to the Senate Banking Committee in Washington, said the surge in oil probably would not cause a permanent increase in inflation and repeated that interest rates were likely to stay low. His comments suggest the Fed will stay on course to complete $600 billion of Treasury purchases through June in an effort to suppress borrowing costs and safeguard the economic recovery.
''Bernanke's reiterating that the Fed's going to stay on the path they're on,'' said Joseph Veranth, chief investment officer at Dana Investment Advisors in Brookfield, Wis., which manages $2.8 billion. ''That leaves room for inflation concerns to continue to worry the market.''
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 8/32, to 101 30/32, and the yield fell to 3.39 percent from 3.42 percent late Monday.
The surge in oil overshadowed data showing that factories added workers and increased production in February, indicating momentum for the expansion. The Institute for Supply Management's factory index increased to 61.4, the highest since May 2004, from 60.8 in January. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.
Alcoa, the largest aluminum producer in the United States, fell 3.7 percent to $16.23, the biggest decline in the Dow. Material stocks slid 2.3 percent, the biggest drop out of 10 groups in the S.& P. 500. Titanium Metals slumped 6.1 percent to $17.82.
Range Resources, a natural gas producer, slipped 7.3 percent to $50.34. The company said it would sell 52,000 acres in the Barnett Shale in Texas for $900 million.

HEADLINE: Carmakers Upbeat at Geneva Auto Show, but Wary of Mideast Turmoil

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
GENEVA -- The mood among carmakers at the Geneva auto show this year might be described as nervously confident. Yes, sales around the world are up, emerging markets are booming, and the car companies are introducing fleets of new models. Heck, even General Motors is profitable again.
''If you smell the atmosphere, it is far better than a few years ago,'' said Luca di Montezemolo, the chief executive of Ferrari and former chairman of Fiat. ''I did not expect a recovery so quickly.'' 
At the same time, oil prices are soaring, pushing buyers toward less profitable smaller cars. The Middle East is in turmoil. And economic recovery in the United States and Europe is still spotty.
''A lot of national economies are still on performance-enhancing drugs,'' said Norbert Reithofer, the chief executive of Bayerische Motoren Werke, referring to economic and car-buying stimulus programs. ''It will be interesting to see what happens when the dope gets taken away.''
Even if the overall economic trend remained positive for carmakers, executives at Geneva said, they would have to contend with shocks and setbacks. ''We have to expect more ups and downs,'' Mr. Reithofer said in an interview.
Economic uncertainty is particularly cruel to automakers, which must risk billions developing new models and equipping factories years before the products come to market. A wrong bet can be costly. The last time that oil prices spiked, for example, executives at Daimler decided that U.S. buyers were ready for small city cars. They began selling the two-seat Smart in America. At first sales boomed, but they plunged when gas prices went down. ''Everybody was convinced that it was the end of pickup trucks and the Fiat 500 was our future,'' Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of Daimler, told a small group of reporters on Tuesday. ''One year later you have the same structure as before the crisis.''
Now executives at Daimler are preparing for the possibility that buyers in regions like Europe will equip their Mercedes cars with smaller engines, which are more fuel efficient but less profitable.
To further complicate the picture, carmakers must invest in new fuel-saving technologies, and most are working on battery powered cars -- unless, like Renault and Nissan, they are already bringing them to market. The French and Japanese companies, which cooperate closely, displayed a range of electric models in Geneva, including the Nissan Leaf and a two-seat Renault called the Twizy.
Carmakers are sharing the costs of some new technologies to reduce risk and achieve economies of scale. Daimler cooperates with Renault and Nissan, while BMW and PSA Peugeot Citroen announced on Monday a new joint venture to develop components for hybrid cars.
Another risk is China, which has become the biggest car market in the world. Carmakers are watching closely to make sure that they are not caught off guard by a sudden slowdown in sales there.
Audi, the premium car unit of Volkswagen, conducts a detailed assessment of the Chinese market every six months, said Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of the company's management board in charge of marketing and sales. ''When you talk about China you have to take the long view,'' Mr. Schwarzenbauer said. ''We don't believe it will continue to grow 30 or 40 percent a year.'' Growth of about 10 percent a year is more realistic, he said.
The auto executives in Geneva were not dwelling too much on the potential downsides ahead. On the contrary, they expressed their newfound brio with model launchings ranging from a new sporty two-door version of the Mercedes midrange C Class to a four-seat Ferrari, the FF, that marks the company's entry into the family car market, albeit for families with a vehicle budget of several hundred thousand dollars.
Ferrari promoted the new car with a film showing the four-wheel drive beast plowing through snow and across expanses of desert sand, an illustration of how carmakers are targeting increasingly wealthy emerging markets like Russia and Brazil, where roads may not always be suitable for a low-slung Italian stallion.
But as turmoil in the mideast shows, those markets may be less stable than traditional markets like Europe or the U.S., adding another layer of uncertainty.
Mr. di Montezemolo said he was concerned about the Mideast market, although it does not account for a large percentage of Ferrari sales. While the turmoil has not yet hit countries like Saudi Arabia, which has the most Ferrari buyers, Mr. di Montezemolo said the political upheaval could hurt sentiment.
''With what is happening there, people may not be in a mood to buy,'' he said.
Joachim Schmidt, head of sales and marketing at Daimler, pointed out that sales last year were so strong that the company suffered from parts shortages. This year Daimler expects car sales to top precrisis highs.
But Mr. Schmidt added, ''Having this crisis behind us, we have to be cautious. We have to be close to our markets on a monthly basis.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Assembly Will Push to Keep Tax Increase on High Earners, Defying Cuomo's Wishes

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said on Tuesday that Democrats in the chamber would seek passage of a budget bill that includes the renewal of a temporary income tax surcharge on high-earning New Yorkers, a proposal staunchly opposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
Extending the tax increase would raise about $1 billion in extra revenue for the budget that lawmakers are negotiating with Mr. Cuomo. The money, proponents say, should be used to offset the $10 billion in cuts and savings that the governor is seeking in areas like Medicaid and school financing. 
The extension is overwhelmingly supported by Assembly Democrats, and its adoption has become the focal point of opposition to Mr. Cuomo's sweeping budget cuts among members of his own party.
After a private meeting with Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday, Mr. Silver said he had told the governor that his members considered extension of the tax a top priority and that he expected it to be included when the Assembly unveiled its own budget bill this month.
''I indicated to him that the overwhelming sentiment of my house is to renew and to do it,'' Mr. Silver said.
While not unexpected, the decision is likely to set off a clash with Mr. Cuomo, who is determined to close the state's projected budget gap without raising income taxes.
Mr. Silver has said repeatedly that he wants to work with Mr. Cuomo to close the budget gap and that major spending cuts will be necessary this year. But the speaker's Democratic conference, dominated by liberal lawmakers from New York City and closely allied with labor, also views continuing the surcharge as a fiscal and moral imperative.
Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, said, ''These are very difficult fiscal times, and we have to ensure that we balance the budget in a fair and evenhanded fashion.''
He added, ''To the extent we can bring in at least some additional revenue to mitigate some of the most difficult cuts, that's a good thing for the people of the state of New York.''
Called the ''millionaires' tax'' by some supporters, the surcharge, first imposed in 2009, applies to incomes over $200,000 for single filers and $300,000 for joint filers. Advocates have said that it would be unfair to allow the tax to expire at the end of the year, as scheduled, while cutting billions of dollars from programs that support poor and middle-class New Yorkers.
This week, a group of 42 local elected officials from around the state, including a number of New York City Council members, published an open letter to fellow Democrats criticizing Mr. Cuomo's budget as ''neither balanced nor well conceived'' and singling out his opposition to extending the income tax surcharge.
Mr. Silver's remarks were welcomed by two coalitions of labor and community groups that have pledged to spend millions of dollars pressing for the measure.
''The speaker's been right in saying it takes all three sides to make it happen,'' said Michael Kink, the executive director of the Strong Economy for All Coalition, which is backed by S.E.I.U. 1199, the health care workers' union, and the United Federation of Teachers, the New York City teachers' union.
The Assembly's support is a strong start, Mr. Kink said.
''Our coalition,'' he said, ''will be focused like a laser beam on the Senate. We know that there are many senators from both parties that know this is the right and fair way to address the budget gap.''
Mr. Cuomo did not include the extension in his executive budget last month and appeared unlikely to include it this week in his amended budget. That could make it hard for Mr. Silver to advance the surcharge without support from the Republican-controlled Senate, where leaders have made it clear that they back a budget that reins in spending without increasing taxes.
Scott Reif, a spokesman for Dean G. Skelos, the Senate majority leader, said: ''Our position is, no new taxes, including this tax, which the governor supports doing away with as well. We view it as a job-killer.''
Each house of the Legislature is likely to pass its own budget proposal in the coming weeks. In past years, governors and legislative leaders have usually tossed out their original budget proposals in favor of last-minute three-way agreements -- sometimes right up against the March 31 budget deadline, and sometimes weeks or months after it has expired.
But Mr. Cuomo has signaled that, should the Legislature fail to approve a budget that sticks to the broad parameters of his proposal by the March 31 deadline, he will seek to force a vote on his original proposal using his emergency budget powers.

HEADLINE: Optimism and Caution In Bernanke Testimony

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Oil prices are rising. Housing prices are falling. But the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told Congress on Tuesday that neither issue was likely to derail renewed growth.
There is growing confidence among policy makers here that the economy is making headway, and that Americans still suffering the lingering effects of the 2008 financial crisis will soon start to feel the benefits.
''We have seen increased evidence that a self-sustaining recovery in consumer and business spending may be taking hold,'' Mr. Bernanke said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. He added, however, that ''until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established.'' 
The remarks by Mr. Bernanke, which have been echoed by other officials, place the central bank chairman in the position of telling Americans that things are better than they seem. The Obama administration, privately optimistic but publicly committed to sympathizing when it talks about the economy, said last week that growth is ''not happening fast enough.''
Mr. Bernanke also finds himself on a political tightrope. The Fed is engaged in a vast and unprecedented effort to stimulate growth by buying hundreds of billions of dollars in federal debt, helping to hold down the cost of borrowing.
Republicans worry that the Fed is overstimulating the economy, and they see evidence in the signs of growth that it is time to start fighting inflation by cutting back.
''Once price stability has been lost, it's difficult and very costly to regain,'' Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said Tuesday, invoking the 1980s.
Democrats, however, are concerned that the Fed may claim victory prematurely. The stock market is rising, but 9 percent of the work force still cannot find jobs.
''As the economy continues to struggle to recover, we should be using every tool in the toolbox to create jobs and spur growth,'' Senator Tim Johnson, a Democrat from South Dakota who is chairman of the banking committee, said in introducing Mr. Bernanke.
The Fed chief said that he remained more concerned that the recovery would falter than that inflation would sneak up on the central bank.
He said that both the Fed and independent experts estimated that inflation would remain modest -- at around 2 percent -- through 2013, as the economy recovered from the recession.
And he said it was too soon to decide what approach the Fed should take after its current round of purchases -- a total of $600 billion -- wraps up at the end of June.
''Over the next few months we'll be able to make a judgment about whether this economy has enough strength to move ahead on its own,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
Mr. Bernanke also tried to ease concerns about increases in the price of oil and other basic commodities like wheat, steel and sugar. He said that a sustained rise in oil prices could be a threat to the economy, but that the probable outcome of the higher prices was a temporary and modest increase in consumer inflation.
The reason is that American consumers spend most of their money on finished products, not basic commodities. The cost of wheat, in other words, is a relatively small factor in determining what a supermarket charges for a box of sugared cereal.
Other experts, however, believe the rise in commodity prices is already a cause for concern. Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Company, an institutional stock trading firm, said that commodity prices remained an important leading indicator of inflation, and he said that Mr. Bernanke also was sanguine about rising housing prices during the credit boom.
''Bernanke runs the risk of appearing too Pollyannaish yet again in the face of changing fundamentals,'' he wrote in a note to clients today after Mr. Bernanke's remarks.
Mr. Bernanke travels to Capitol Hill twice a year to testify about the Fed's management of the economy. Inevitably, members of Congress ask the nation's economist-in-chief to weigh in on the financial aspects of other issues.
He told senators that the federal deficit is the nation's greatest long-term challenge. But he rebuffed several attempts by Republicans to secure his support for the proposition that Congress should not raise the debt ceiling -- the maximum amount that the government can borrow -- without a plan to reduce the debt.
The government may hit the current ceiling, now set at $14.3 trillion, next month.
Mr. Bernanke said that the government needed to pay its debts and then reduce future spending. ''Not increasing the debt limit is like saying, you know, we're going to solve our family's financial problems by refusing to pay our credit card bills,'' he said.
Failure to do so, he said, ''would almost certainly create a new financial crisis.''
Mr. Bernanke said that a Republican plan to cut federal spending by $61 billion would likely reduce economic output by ''several tenths'' of one percent. He said that studies cited by some Democrats that project a 2 percent reduction were overstated.
Also Tuesday, the San Francisco Fed named John C. Williams as its new president. He succeeds Janet Yellen, who was appointed by President Obama to the Board of Governors. Mr. Williams, an economist, previously served as the director of research for the San Francisco Fed. He worked during the Clinton administration for the president's council of economic advisers.

HEADLINE: House Hunting in ... Montreal

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA C. McGUIRE

 BODY:
A LOFT APARTMENT IN A FORMER OFFICE BUILDING IN OLD MONTREAL
1,049,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS ($1.07 MILLION)
This two-bedroom apartment overlooks the historic structures and cobblestone streets of Old Montreal. It occupies most of the fourth floor in a five-story building dating to 1921, which originally housed a British shipping company. Urns, friezes and columns embellish the stone facade.
The living area is open plan, with the kitchen anchoring the middle of the space. Italian glass mosaic tiles on the backsplash echo the colors of the granite countertops. The cabinets are modular and can be removed easily from the walls through a detachable hooking mechanism, allowing owners to rearrange at will. 
The master bedroom has built-in closets. The tub and shower are also in the bedroom, while the sink and toilet are behind closed doors. A panel with flashing LED lights over the tub can be synched with the apartment's sound system. The second bedroom also has built-in closets; its bathroom is enclosed with frosted glass, and the walls in the double shower are lined with white river stones.
The building is near Old Montreal's cafes, boutiques and art galleries. The business district, the old port and the performing arts center are all within walking distance. Montreal-Trudeau International Airport is about 25 minutes away.
MARKET OVERVIEW
''Generally in Montreal right now we have a market that still favors sellers,'' said David L'Heureux, senior market analyst for Montreal for the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation. In 2010, he added, prices in the greater Montreal market increased 8 percent, spurred by economic recovery.
Demand is not as robust for the luxury segment of the market, which Mr. L'Heureux defined as homes priced above 500,000 Canadian dollars (about $510,000, at 0.98 Canadian dollars to the dollar). But the property market in Old Montreal is the exception to this rule. ''Nobody wants to sell,'' said Patricia Lallier, owner of Immeuble International in Old Montreal. As a result, the area has very low supply and high demand. Prices per square foot in Old Montreal depend on size and building services. Ms. Lallier says a two-bedroom, 1,000-square-foot condo with high ceilings, views and a parking space costs 440 to 650 Canadian dollars per square foot. The apartment featured here costs 593 Canadian dollars per square foot, average for the area.
WHO BUYS IN MONTREAL
''When the Canadian dollar was weaker, we had a lot of Americans buying,'' said Roger Quirion, a Montreal-based certified real estate broker with Sotheby's International Realty Quebec and the listing agent for this apartment. Now that the euro is stronger, Mr. Quirion said, he is seeing more European buyers, especially from France, because of the language and cultural ties.
Montreal is also popular with the British, but Mr. Quirion said British economic tumult had decreased the number of buyers over the past two years. He added that Russians tend to buy investment properties in Montreal.
BUYING BASICS
There are no restrictions on foreign buyers, Mr. Quirion said. A notary, chosen by the buyer, oversees the sale, processing the legal paperwork for both buyer and seller. Fees vary depending on the size of the mortgage; the notary's liability insurance is tied to the amount of financing involved in each sale.
Buyers also pay a welcome tax, a one-time charge based on the purchase price. Foreign buyers looking to finance their sales are usually required to put down at least 30 percent, Mr. Quirion added.

HEADLINE: Qaddafi Vows to Fight to the 'Last Man'

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
TRIPOLI, Libya -- Amid new reports of fighting between his security forces and rebels seeking his ouster, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi took time out today to deliver a meandering, disjointed three-hour speech mixing a combination of giveaways to the public, promises of reform, and vows of retaliation in an apparent bid to quell the growing unrest here.
His speech bore little apparent relation to reality. Addressing the Libyan Peoples General Congress on the 34th anniversary of the founding of Libya's distinctive ''rule by the masses'' nonconstitutional government, Colonel Qaddafi repeated his recent denials in the face of all evidence that any demonstrations against his government had taken place recently. 
When he entered the room, a cheering crowd mobbed the desk when he was to speak, trampling and breaking an arrangement of flower pots placed on the floor. He was by turns soft-spoken and pugnacious. He turned pages as he read from a long prepared speech, but then veered off into lengthy, improvised digressions.
At times he adopted the tone of an absent-minded uncle, asking his audience to remind him of the names of newspapers or to return to a certain subject before he left (the audience did). But at other times his tone would turn bellicose, as he urged his supporters to fight on with him ''to the last man and the last woman.''
He blamed the insurrection that has removed much of the country from his control on radical Islamists, and once again suggested they had given young people drugs that goaded them into a frenzy of rioting.
''There were no demonstrations'' in the eastern towns where the uprising started last month, Colonel Qaddafi said. ''People came from outside Libya. Al Qaeda and the whole world knows that Al Qaeda does not take part in demonstrations.''
He called the rebels holding some cities ''terrorists'' and said loyalist forces would not surrender. He asked parents to persuade young people to turn in their weapons and promised forgiveness, but he vowed swift vengeance against those he said were behind the revolt: Afghanistan-trained militant Islamists.
He repeatedly vowed to defy international pressure, warning the Western powers not to intervene and threatening a fierce fight if they did. Western intervention, he said, could set off the kind of civil war seen in Iraq or Afghanistan. If Western oil companies stopped doing business with Libya, he said, the country would turn to the Indians and Chinese.
He laughed at reports that the United States had frozen $30 billion of his family's assets abroad, saying that they would not find one Libyan dinar because he lived so simply. He faulted the United Nations Security Council for passing a resolution chastising his government without investigating the situation first, and he blamed the defection of much of Libya's delegation to the United States for spreading misinformation.
He also criticized the foreign journalists he invited to Tripoli. ''Libya doesn't like foreign correspondents,'' he said. ''They shouldn't even know about the weather forecasts in Libya, because we are suspicious,'' he said, according to a translation from Arabic to English carried live on Libyan state television.
But he also tried to placate the public. He said that his son Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi had persuaded him that the Libyan people want a constitution, and so he would support enlisting the country's best experts to draft one. He said he would support freedom of speech, even speech critical of the government. And he offered giveaways that, if genuine, would appear dangerous to the health of the Libyan economy. He said he would more than double the salaries of government employees and offer no-interest loans of as much as $100,000 to Libyans to buy a car or a home.
Libyan state television showed Colonel Qaddafi exchanging clenched fist salutes with his supporters.
''It is the people who rule,'' he said, repeating his assertion, disputed by many outsiders, that he wields no formal political power. ''There is nothing else but people's power,'' he said. ''There is no room for a king or guardian or master to replace people's power.''
After introducing the system in 1977, Colonel Qaddafi said, ''I went back to my tent'' -- a reference to a favored form of accommodation supposed to reflect his Bedouin roots. Scores of people attending the event, however, chanted an apparently choreographed slogan calling him their leader.
A woman who was not identified by name stepped up to a microphone and shouted, ''You are a sword that will not bend.''
To the surprise of the Westerners in attendance, he even had a compliment of sorts for President Obama. ''Obama's policies as I have seen them so far are rational, and he is not going to create a new Iraq or Afghanistan,'' he said, referring to the potential consequences of Western intervention.

HEADLINE: Officials Disagree On Punishment For Mortgage Mess

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Even as state attorneys general and regulators in Washington approach the end of their investigation into abuses by the nation's biggest mortgage companies, deep disputes are emerging over how much to punish the banks as well as exactly who should benefit from a settlement.
The newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is pushing for $20 billion or more in penalties, backed up by the attorneys general and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
But other regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees national banks, and the Federal Reserve, do not favor such a large fine, contending a small number of people were the victims of flawed foreclosure procedures.
As the negotiations grind on, there are signs that the banks still have not come to grips with the problems plaguing the foreclosure process. These problems burst into view last fall with accounts of so-called robo-signers processing thousands of foreclosures at a time without the required legal safeguards. The resulting furor prompted the attorneys general and other government officials to step in. Some banks suspended foreclosures to review their processes before resuming. 
On Monday, though, HSBC disclosed that it had suspended foreclosures after regulators found ''deficiencies'' in its handling of them. These included problems with court affidavits, notarization, mortgage documentation and oversight of law firms, a spokesman for the lender, which is based in London, said. HSBC declined to say how many homeowners were affected.
''The events of the fall really uncovered and provided a degree of focus on fundamental problems in the way banks service and foreclose on mortgages,'' said Paul Leonard of the Center for Responsible Lending. ''Regulators have a great opportunity to come up with some serious fixes.''
Assuming, that is, they can agree. As difficult as it is to decide on a figure for any broad settlement, the question of what to do with the money could ultimately prove more vexing.
If only victims of problems at the servicers are helped in a settlement, that would cover a small portion of homeowners who are in default and even fewer of those whose homes are valued at less than they owe.
All the regulators declined to comment publicly on just how close they are to wrapping up a global settlement that would be presented to the banks. But signs of the differences have emerged in public testimony as well as in private conversations with government officials.
The acting comptroller of the currency, John Walsh, testified last week that while there were widespread problems with documentation and oversight of law firms and other crucial links in the foreclosure chain, only a ''small number of foreclosure sales should not have proceeded.''
Despite skepticism on the part of the comptroller's office, other regulators would like a broader plan to help pay for modifications of mortgages that are delinquent or in default, even if homeowners cannot point to a specific example of wrongdoing on the part of servicers. In other cases, the money might be used to help mortgage holders whose loan principal exceeds the home's current value.
What's more, the Obama administration, as well as the F.D.I.C., sees any broad settlement with the servicers as an opportunity to do more than just fix the foreclosure process. They want to stabilize the housing market, where prices are continuing to decline, and try to help bolster the economic recovery, which is facing newer threats like higher oil prices.
Some two million American homes are in foreclosure, a third of which are vacant. Another two million households are behind on their payments and facing the prospect of foreclosure this year. To make matters worse, roughly a fifth of the nation's home loans exceed the value of the underlying house, raising the risk that homeowners will simply walk away, further weakening the housing market.
Right now, the Obama administration argues, the housing market is facing the worst of both worlds -- a big back-up in foreclosures as procedures are reworked, and a similarly long wait to get a mortgage modification in which the principal or the interest rate of the loan is lowered, easing monthly payments.
Any settlement would include provisions to streamline the modification process, which has proceeded at a snail's pace at many servicers, frustrating many homeowners. The money from the banks, in turn, would help cover the cost of reducing principal and interest payments, paving the way for more modifications. Advocates argue that would finally get the housing market moving again.
But even if these proposals make it past all the regulators, they face fierce opposition from the banks, which argue that what the administration and the attorneys general have in mind is a back-door bailout for delinquent homeowners.
''It's like taking money that should be paid to the Treasury and using it for an unappropriated social program,'' said a lawyer for one of the top servicers, who spoke anonymously because the negotiations were still fluid and the banks had yet to be presented with a proposed settlement. ''This is a bad idea, no matter who pays for it.''
The nation's largest mortgage servicer, Bank of America, is already readying what will be among the industry's main arguments: that it is unfair to reward homeowners who are delinquent or underwater but cannot point to specific errors in their case.
''The question is one of fairness, who should receive a modification and who should not,'' said Jim Mahoney, a spokesman for the bank. Too broad a rescue package, he said, ''could forestall the housing market recovery or even create perverse incentives.''
One possibility, industry insiders and banking lobbyists suggest, is that homeowners might deliberately become delinquent on their loans to get a principal reduction. Housing activists counter that homeowners seeking modifications are often told by their lenders to stop payments, and then end up in foreclosure.
The debate reflects some degree of weariness with foreclosure, as the administration's signature mortgage modification program is under attack by both House Republicans and housing activists as a failure.
''There has been a tension in this country during the financial crisis,'' said Michael S. Barr, a former Treasury official now at the University of Michigan Law School. ''People want those who are in economic trouble to get a fair shake. But they don't want them bailed out for making their own mistakes, like buying too big a home.''
While regulators worry about how punitive any eventual settlement should be, lawyers and other advocates for the foreclosed who were hoping for criminal charges are set to be disappointed.
That sanction, everyone seems to agree, is off the table. In testimony in December about the improper foreclosures by banks, Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor, floated the notion of imposing fines on individuals found responsible for violations or banning them from banking, but officials involved in the talks said this idea had not gotten much traction either.
''The fact is, when the banks prepared their foreclosure paperwork for the courts, they lied about the credentials of their witnesses,'' said Thomas Cox, a Maine lawyer who works with foreclosure assistance groups. ''Criminal sanctions would act as a deterrent.''

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
Although we are hunkered down for a long season of N.F.L. labor discontent -- equipment includes airport-style earmuffs and a device that can change a TV channel to a gardening show at the first mention of the word lockout -- a little ray of common sense emanated from a federal judge on Tuesday. He essentially called out the owners for rigging their television deals so they could afford a lockout. 
If you were making a ''Star Wars'' scene out of this, the Death Star just took a major hit. The league has long been flying into perilous territory because crying poverty while swimming in money is a rather difficult sell to a recession-battered fan base. As Ann Killion writes on SI.com, the league seems intent on testing its bulletproof shields, assuming its popularity will withstand anything. Michael Silver of Yahoo.com hopes Judge David S. Doty's ruling pushes both sides toward a compromise solution, so we can all get back to ogling the conventional personnel fireworks in places like Cincinnati, where quarterback Carson Palmer is vowing to retire rather than play for the Bengals again. In that case, as in most these days, the sympathy is sliding decidedly toward the players, probably, as Mark Kriegel writes on Foxsports.com, because they are paying the far steeper price playing the N.F.L.'s dangerous game.
All that might even drive you to pay attention instead to baseball's spring training dramas, which Wednesday include the Yankees' Mark Teixeira firing the agent Scott Boras. This is less satisfying knowing that Teixeira doesn't exactly need an agent for the six years he has left on his contract. Pitching drama has beset the championship Giants, who apparently are considering buying out Barry Zito. And the Red Sox owner John Henry revealed just how much Major League Baseball hates criticism of its revenue-sharing system. It's a $500,000 fine worth of hate they clipped him for.
College sports has its usual dramas, but Brigham Young added an unusual twist: dismissing one of its best players, Brandon Davies, for violating its honor code and thus imperiling a potential No. 1 seed. College football programs, on the other hand, are apparently epically low on honor, with a Sports Illustrated/CBS News report detailing the prevalence of players with criminal records and the universities' lack of diligence in recruiting them.
In more distressing real-life news, the tennis star Serena Williams was reportedly hospitalized for a pulmonary embolism and the former Atlanta Braves pitcher Mark Wohlers's house went up in flames. Wohler credits his wife for saving the family.
Good thing the N.F.L. is engulfed in only metaphorical flames. Which you may go back to trying to ignore now.

HEADLINE: Model of N.B.A. Success Has Fallen Into Disarray

BYLINE: By JOANNE C. GERSTNER

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The Detroit Pistons appear to be in chaos, a startling state for a franchise that has clicked so well on so many levels over the past decade.
The team reached six Eastern Conference finals and two N.B.A. finals, taking the 2004 title, and fans packed the Palace of Auburn Hills under the steady hand of Bill Davidson, the owner.
The branding worked, too, with the team adopting a Going to Work theme as a nod to Detroit's engrained work ethic and blue-collar values. 
The synergy is now in disarray. The Going to Work model shattered this season, thanks to public displays of player discontent, including what appeared to be a boycott of a practice last week; the team's 22-41 record; and the drawn-out process to sell the team and the arena by Davidson's widow, Karen.
''There is no page in the N.B.A. sports business handbook for what is happening; it's a perfect storm of challenges right now,'' said Alan Ostfield, president and chief executive of Palace Sports and Entertainment. ''We have the economy, team performance, ownership sale and these other things like what happened last week. For us internally, it's about sticking to the core values that made us successful.
''We're not hiding that things aren't where we want them to be. We hope this is just a blip.''
The most stunning blow came Friday when seven players, with varying excuses, skipped a morning shootaround in Philadelphia as part of what was said to be a protest against their second-year coach, John Kuester. Later, Kuester used only the six players who attended the shootaround.
Some of the benched players, like Ben Wallace, Tracy McGrady and Rodney Stuckey, were laughing when Kuester was ejected that night for arguing with officials in a loss to the 76ers. McGrady later said the players were laughing about something else when Kuester was tossed.
Chris Wilcox, Austin Daye, Stuckey and Richard Hamilton were fined for missing the shootaround. Wallace, Tayshaun Prince and McGrady had personal or medical reasons for not participating.
Pistons fans have displayed their dissatisfaction in various ways. Attendance is down 13 percent this season, with an average crowd of 16,304, a far cry from when the 22,076-seat Palace bulged for every home game. The fans that do show up are frequently testy, booing the players and yelling at Kuester. The Pistons were booed off the court Feb. 14, after a lethargic 94-79 loss to the Atlanta Hawks.
Hamilton has been in a protracted dispute with Kuester. He has been benched several times and has caused discord within the locker room. On Monday Kuester and Hamilton said that they had repaired their relationship and that they intended to start over.
''A lot of stuff was put out there,'' Hamilton said to Pistons beat writers. ''It was crazy for me and him, too. Players and coaches go through arguments. That's all it was, a disagreement.''
The Pistons' on-court player dissonance drew strong rebukes from Lakers Coach Phil Jackson, Magic Coach Stan Van Gundy, the former Pistons coach Dick Vitale and Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo.
''What happened in Detroit was absolutely absurd,'' Vitale told ESPN Radio. ''When those players did what they did in that mutiny, unbelievable. It is absolutely sad and a black eye and absolutely hurts the image of the N.B.A. big time.'' He added, ''It breaks my heart.''
Joe Dumars, the Pistons' president for basketball operations, has taken an equally staunch stand, giving Kuester a vote of confidence.
''We've had a long and proud history of being a first-class organization that handles its business the right way,'' Dumars said in a statement. ''We expect everyone that represents the Detroit Pistons to do so in a first-class manner, and that will continue as we move forward.''
It is unclear if the turbulence will affect sale negotiations between Tom Gores, a private equity financier based in Los Angeles, and Davidson. The parties have been exclusively talking since January without coming to a formal agreement.
Gores and Davidson have said they will not comment on the negotiations.
Rodney Fort, a sports economics professor at the University of Michigan, sees Gores looking at the long-term potential of the Pistons.
''You can't get caught up in the short-term when you're investing hundreds of millions into a company,'' Fort said. ''You look at the revenue stream potential, how will this asset perform within its market over the long haul?
''Investors such as Tom Gores are not getting caught up in the same stuff that the fans are right now.''
Rob Tilliss, founder of the New York-based sports equity firm Inner Circle, indicated he believed the franchise was on shakier ground. Inner Circle has handled the sale of the Texas Rangers and the Nets, among other franchises and arenas.
''There are a lot of storm clouds: a team that's woefully underperforming, ownership that's not committed to making changes because of the sale process, and all of this in a city that's been economically to hell and back,'' Tilliss said. ''This is a distressed franchise right now. But it's a glass half full thing. Things eventually do, hopefully, turn around.''

HEADLINE: In Japan, Android Rising

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japanese mobile phones are a gadget lover's dream. They double as credit cards. They can display digital TV broadcasts. Some are even fitted with solar cells.
And yet, for all their innovations, Japanese-made handsets have had little impact overseas. They account for just a sliver of a global mobile phone market dominated by the likes of Apple, Research In Motion and Samsung.
But now the Japanese phone industry hopes to go global -- by adopting Google's red-hot Android mobile operating system.
''We have the technology to compete in the United States,'' said Naoki Shiraishi, who led software development for a new line of Android smartphones from Sharp, the largest Japanese cellphone maker. ''It's finally time for Sharp phones to go play in the major leagues.'' 
Sony Ericsson, NEC and Kyocera are among the other Japanese handset makers also betting on Android as their path to international sales.
While Android was initially overshadowed by the popular iPhone from Apple, its user numbers are now soaring. In 2010, global sales of Android phones reached 67.2 million units, ahead of iPhones, which sold 46 million units, according to the research company Gartner.
And Sharp, clearly hoping to edge onto Apple's iPad turf, has introduced in the United States a lineup of tablet computers running a version of Android -- the sort of competition Apple is hoping to stay well in front of with new versions of the iPad like the one it introduced Wednesday in San Francisco. For the Japanese phone makers, cashing in on Android's popularity will mean learning some new skills, like marketing, while unlearning some old habits, like paying too much attention to the hardware and too little to the software.
Because Japan's phone industry remains highly fragmented, no company so far has been large or savvy enough to make a strong overseas push. Instead, handset makers have long been content to serve as suppliers to Japan's three largest mobile networks, which command a market of more than 100 million users, most of them on advanced 3G networks.
And in their hardware fixation, Japanese manufacturers have tended to bog down their handsets with clunky software platforms and fenced-in Web services that do not emphasize downloads of third-party applications.
That has put them at odds with the trend in much of the rest of the world, where attention has swung to devices like the iPhone, which runs software much as an ordinary computer does and lets users download apps from independent developers.
In fact, the success of the iPhone in Japan -- together with Apple's popular App Store, with hundreds of thousands of applications for download -- has opened eyes.
''Japanese companies have been so pioneering in many fields, but they have failed to build a global business'' of handsets, said Gerhard Fasol, chief executive of Eurotechnology, a Tokyo firm that advises companies on global mobile and telecommunications strategy. ''What you need is a global infrastructure,'' Mr. Fasol said, ''and Japanese handset makers have nothing.''
Global scale is what the Japanese hope to build with Android.
Certainly the price is right: Google offers Android free to manufacturers. And Android has caught on since its introduction in 2007, as a growing community of software developers has written apps, sold via Google's Android Market.
It took a while, but Japanese handset makers are now rushing to introduce Android devices, each married with cutting-edge technology. That includes Sony Ericsson, which dabbled with other platforms like Symbian and Windows Mobile for its high-end Xperia smartphones, but has used Android for its latest models.
And just last week, NEC introduced what it said was the world's thinnest smartphone. At 8 millimeters thick, equivalent to about four stacked nickels, its Medias N-04C runs on Android and also comes with an electronic wallet function, digital terrestrial television and a five-megapixel camera. Although the phone is for sale only in Japan for now, NEC is planning an overseas push, focusing first on Mexico and Australia.
Another Japanese manufacturer, Kyocera, is planning soon for the United States release of an Android-based smartphone that comes with two screens, capable of running separate apps at once.
Sharp, for its part, intends to start with the fast-growing Chinese market, although officials say they also intend to bring phones to North America. Most global operators are preparing to use advanced LTE networks, which could make it easier for the Japanese phones to work on networks anywhere.
Sharp's latest smartphones, like its IS03 model, a sleek device with a high-resolution touch screen, have overseas gadget bloggers drooling. ''The smartphone de facto standard is fast becoming Android,'' said Shigeru Kobayashi, who is in charge of product planning for Sharp's new smartphone line. ''We don't plan to keep on building the same kind of phones that we used to.''
Working with Android has meant an overhaul of Sharp's tightly controlled development process. In one big change, Sharp has invited outside developers to its labs to test prototypes and develop apps -- a rare move for a Japanese manufacturer.
And late last year, Sharp hosted two ''hackathons'' -- programming jamborees -- to encourage more developers to make apps optimized for its smartphones. At one of these sessions, in mid-December, a group of about two dozen outside developers worked on apps at Sharp's usually top-secret research lab near Hiroshima.
And in an unprecedented move, Sharp last year released a phone that was deliberately ''jailbroken'' -- letting programmers freely tweak some of the phone's core software controls.
Google itself, meantime, has urged more handset makers to use Android. Although Google earns no commission from any Android handsets sold, it takes a substantial cut -- 30 percent -- of the apps sold in the Android Store.
''Japan has great hardware, great R.& D., great engineers,'' said John Lagerling, director of Android Global Partnerships at Google. ''Now they can also get the best software.''
Besides helping Japanese phone makers reduce their software development costs, the globally recognized Android standard could also help them achieve worldwide economies of scale that could further reduce overall costs.
Working with Google could also give the handset makers better leverage with Japan's powerful domestic network operators: NTT DoCoMo, KDDI and Softbank. The carriers have long dictated product cycles and phone features. Each network requires that phones be tweaked especially for it. And the carriers -- not the handset makers -- have been the main marketers for the phones.
The handset makers ''need to stop worrying about the carriers and start thinking more globally,'' said Shuichi Iizuka, a telecommunications analyst at the ISB Institute, based just south of Tokyo. Android can help them do that, he said.
Japan's phone makers may need to become nimbler, too. Their love for continual fine-tuning of their hardware has meant they have had trouble keeping up with Google's frequent Android updates.
Many of the smartphones released this season, like the Sharp IS03, still run on Android version 2.1, which was announced more than a year -- and two updates -- ago. Google is soon expected to release Android version 2.4.
And even as Android is helping Japanese phone makers lay their overseas plans, it has also opened the Japanese market to foreign competitors. Samsung, of South Korea, for example, has made inroads in Japan with its slick Android-based Galaxy smartphone.
And Mr. Fasol of Eurotechnology warns that even with good Android phones, Japanese companies could cede some of the most lucrative parts of the business, selling apps, to Google.
Google, in addition to retaining nearly a third of the applications revenue, has recently introduced other revenue-enhancing measures, like letting software developers accept payments within apps. But phone makers would receive none of this income.
''Android gives the Japanese an opportunity, that's for sure, but it places them at a relatively low position,'' Mr. Fasol said. ''It makes them one of many soldiers in the Google army, with Google as king.''

HEADLINE: The Hollow Cry of 'Broke'

 BODY:
''We're broke! We're broke!'' Speaker John Boehner said on Sunday. ''We're broke in this state,'' Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin said a few days ago. ''New Jersey's broke,'' Gov. Chris Christie has said repeatedly. The United States faces a ''looming bankruptcy,'' Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialist, wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday.
It's all obfuscating nonsense, of course, a scare tactic employed for political ends. A country with a deficit is not necessarily any more ''broke'' than a family with a mortgage or a college loan. And states have to balance their budgets. Though it may disappoint many conservatives, there will be no federal or state bankruptcies. 
The federal deficit is too large for comfort, and most states are struggling to balance their books. Some of that is because of excessive spending, and much is because the recession has driven down tax revenues. But a substantial part was caused by deliberate decisions by state and federal lawmakers to drain government of resources by handing out huge tax cuts, mostly to the rich. As governments begin to stagger from the self-induced hemorrhaging, Republican politicians like Mr. Boehner and Mr. Walker cry poverty and use it as an excuse to break unions and kill programs they never liked in flush years.
On Wednesday, to cite just the latest example, House Republicans successfully pressured the Senate to approve a bill cutting $4 billion in spending just to keep the federal government from shutting down for the next two weeks. In a matter of days, the Senate will be forced to take up the House bill to make more than $61 billion in ruinous cuts over the next seven months, all under the pretext of ''fiscal responsibility.'' (At least the White House says it will be involved in the next round.) Many Republican governors are employing the same tactic.
But now voters are starting to notice the effects of these cuts and to get angry at the ideological overreach. A New York Times/CBS News poll published on Tuesday showed that Americans oppose ending bargaining rights for public unions by a majority of nearly two to one. And the poll sharply refutes the post-Reagan Republican mantra that the public invariably abhors all tax increases. Nearly twice as many people said they would prefer a tax increase to cutting benefits of public employees or to cutting spending on roads.
A Gallup poll last week showed that 61 percent of respondents nationwide reject Mr. Walker's attempt to revoke collective-bargaining rights for public unions, including 41 percent of the Republicans polled. Like the Times/CBS poll, Gallup found a mixed result about the overall popularity of unions, suggesting that labor is on firm ground in defending its basic rights but still needs to negotiate with the public good in mind.
Before the union uprising, Wisconsin voters might not have noticed when Mr. Walker approved business tax cuts earlier this year that made his budget gap worse. But now, with his cries of being ''broke,'' they should listen more closely. On Tuesday, he unveiled a budget that would cut aid to school districts and local governments by nearly $1 billion over two years, while preventing those jurisdictions from raising property taxes at all to make up for the loss.
Perhaps because of the economic downturn, voting among union households was sharply down last November, which may help explain some of the Republican gains. Mr. Walker and his fellow Republicans, may wind up turning that around next year.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Stopgap Spending Bill as Obama Seeks Negotiations

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama called on Wednesday for high-level negotiations to bridge major budgetary differences between Congressional Republicans and Democrats after the Senate passed a measure to buy at least two more weeks for talks.
After the Senate's bipartisan 91-to-9 vote in a favor of a bill that keeps federal agencies open through March 18 while enacting $4 billion in new spending cuts, Mr. Obama urged House and Senate leaders to meet with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and two top aides to work out a longer-term budget agreement.
''Living with the threat of a shutdown every few weeks is not responsible, and it puts our economic progress in jeopardy,'' said Mr. Obama, who signed the bill a few hours after the Senate vote. He said any eventual agreement should ''cut spending and reduce deficits without damaging economic growth or gutting investments in education, research and development that will create jobs and secure our future.'' 
Republican leaders said they were already in talks with Democrats and the White House but would take part in budget meetings if they were invited. They noted that the Republican-led House had passed a $61 billion package of cuts covering the remaining seven months of the current fiscal year while the Democratic-controlled Senate had not produced any legislation beyond passing the temporary budget measure drafted by the House.
''The House's position is: We passed a bill. It's out there,'' Speaker John A. Boehner said. ''And I think it's time for them to outline for us what's their position to keep the government funded. We've done our work in the House.''
Contending with sharp internal splits about how far to go in cutting spending and a reluctance to show their hand, Senate Democrats have not made public any specifics on their ideas for cuts, frustrating Republicans who see themselves as making hard, substantive proposals with no corresponding effort in the Senate.
Still, Senate Democratic leaders on Wednesday urged Republicans to come to the bargaining table to work out a deal to finance the government through Sept. 30 and perhaps go beyond the immediate fiscal issues to take on larger budgetary questions about spending on entitlement programs like Medicare and an increase in the debt limit.
''As far as we're concerned, everything is on the table,'' said Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader.
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, said that he and others had been identifying spending cuts that Democrats could support and that they were running the ideas by the White House. ''We're ready to roll up our sleeves, and we hope those on the other side will, too,'' Mr. Schumer said.
Even with the White House effort to jolt lawmakers into talks, reaching a compromise before the expiration of the new spending measure on March 18 seems unlikely and Congressional aides predicted at least one more stop-gap bill might be required.
Given Mr. Biden's long history in the Senate, he has emerged as the president's go-to guy for tricky bipartisan negotiations. He worked with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, to strike a tax deal last December and he also helped steer the nuclear arms treaty through to approval in last year's lame-duck session.
But finding a compromise in the spending fight could test his abilities as well as those of the two senior staff members assigned to take part: William M. Daley, the new White House chief of staff, and Jacob J. Lew, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Not only are the House and Senate far apart on how much should be cut, the House-passed measure includes a number of ideologically charged provisions like proposals to roll back the new health care law, end financing for Planned Parenthood and restrict the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate emissions.
Senate Democrats say they will oppose conducting such policy fights on spending bills. But many House Republicans have declared they will not vote for a broad spending measure unless it eliminates money for the health law and federal financing of abortions. Many in the 87-member Republican freshman class also do not seem inclined to give much ground on the $61 billion in total cuts from the current budget.
The two-week measure approved Wednesday includes a down payment on those cuts by slicing $4 billion from spending by rescinding nearly $2.8 billion that would have been spent on local projects through earmarks that both parties have banned. Another $1.2 billion is saved by eliminating eight programs both Republicans and Democrats have agreed to cut in the past.
Those cuts include $75 million in election grants; $29 million to help rural communities develop broadband networks; $30 million in unneeded Smithsonian renovation money; $250 million for a reading program;, and $650 million in added highway spending.
Republicans said the fact that Democrats did not fight the cuts gave them some confidence that deeper reductions could be made.
''It is the first time I can recall in the time that I've been here our actually cutting spending on an appropriation bill,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''It's a small step, but a step in the right direction.''
Even as Congress approved the short-term extension, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates warned members of a House committee that the military could face a crisis if it is forced to keep operating under current budget restraints or a significant cut. He said the House-passed bill represented a cut of about $17 billion for this year.
''Operating under a yearlong continuing resolution or significantly reduced funding, with the severe shortfalls that entails, would damage procurement and research programs,'' he said. ''Cuts in maintenance could force parts of our aircraft fleet to be grounded and delay deep-needed facilities improvements.''

HEADLINE: Girls And Boys Together

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
In honor of Women's History Month, President Obama ordered up the first report on the status of American women since the one Eleanor Roosevelt prepared for John F. Kennedy. It's chock full of interesting bits of information.
For instance, did you know that the median marriage age for college-educated women is 30? I should have figured that out because I can barely think of a single college-educated woman under the age of 30 who is married. But somehow it still came as a surprise. I got married when I was 25, and I felt as if that was extremely late in the game. Of course, that was in the Mesozoic era, and we had no end of trouble keeping the stegosaurus away from the wedding cake. 
Additional reports from ''Women in America: Indicators of Social and Economic Well-Being'' include information on everything from volunteering (women do more) to housework (go ahead and guess). It has some findings I don't quite know what to do with, like: ''While male students are more likely to be victimized with weapons, female students are more likely to experience electronic bullying.'' Electronic bullying is definitely a bad thing, but I can't help feeling as though we're getting the better end of that deal.
We're a long way from the Eleanor Roosevelt Commission on the Status of Women, which was formed when there were no women on the White House staff doing anything more impressive than typing or cake decoration. ''Men have to be reminded that women exist,'' Mrs. Roosevelt tartly told reporters when the all-male list of top Kennedy administration appointees was released.
At the time, there were 454 federal civil service job categories for college graduates, and more than 200 were restricted to male applicants. It was perfectly legal to refuse to hire a woman for a job because of her failure to be a man, or to refuse her credit unless she had a husband to co-sign her loan. The median age for marriage for a woman was 20, and the only job open to most women that involved a chance to travel was flight attendant.
We're in a different world, but this latest report highlights the one glaring gap: working women still make, on average, much less than men. Among people who work full time, women make an average 80 cents for every $1 that men take home.
There has always been a big difference: in 1979, women made only 62 percent of what men did. And the report suggests that part of the problem is because of the fact that women tend to pursue the lowest-paying professional careers, notably teaching. Perhaps part of the answer is just to increase compensation for people who devote their careers to education. Perhaps the governors could take that up next time they get together to discuss public employee unions.
I've always believed the other big factor is the strain of balancing work and family. Women do better in school -- now all the way to graduate school where they get the majority of doctoral degrees. And young single women tend to make higher wages than young single men. The change comes at the point when many women have to consider their children. Perhaps the House of Representatives could take that up next time they get together to discuss whether they really want to eliminate federally financed child care programs.
''The thing that we're hoping men will focus on: This is not a woman's issue; it's a family issue,'' said Valerie Jarrett, who leads the White House Council on Women and Girls.
That's really the big story for today. Americans are so used to the fact that women are capable of doing anything that we hardly ever discuss it. It's been a long time since the leader of NASA said ''talk of an American spacewoman makes me sick to my stomach.''
A change that happened later, and the one that's going to be driving the future, is that women's ability to succeed in their work life is now a matter of concern for both sexes. The turning point for American women really came on the unknown day when the average American couple started planning their futures with the presumption that there would be two paychecks. In a country where no one has real power without a serious economic role, we entered a time when, whether we liked it or not, all hands were needed to keep the economic ship afloat. Even women who get the opportunity to stay home when their children are young have to be ready to jump back into the work force if their partner is suddenly laid off.
A while back, I was visiting a college in Connecticut where most of the students were the first in their families ever to go beyond high school. I was talking with a group of young men and women, and I asked the men how many of them felt it was very important that their future wife be a good earner.
All of them raised their hands.

HEADLINE: China to Unveil Its Strategy To Rebalance Robust Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The agendas for China's two quasi legislatures this week include proposals to raise taxes on gas-guzzling cars, crack down on drunken driving and improve food safety, most of them predigested by the Communist Party's leadership and destined for rote approval. About the only uncertainty involves the one topic that will get the most attention: the future of China's roaring economy.
The two annual meetings will unveil China's latest five-year plan, which calls for a shift away from an economy based on exports and public works projects to one powered by consumer spending. 
Foreign economists and political leaders say the change will be a critical part of the effort to rebalance global trade. In China, it is seen as crucial to sustaining the country's economic growth and the party's unchallenged rule.
The uncertainty is whether the leadership can pull it off. The last five-year plan, issued in 2006, also proposed measures to increase incomes in an effort to restructure the economy.
In the end, however, exports and public projects revved up the economy, and the gross domestic product was 10.3 percent higher in 2010 than in 2009, well above the government's target. Meanwhile, consumer spending's share of the G.D.P. plummeted almost 10 percentage points from 2000 to 2009, to 35.6 percent -- roughly two-thirds the level in many Asian nations, and half of that in the United States.
''For years and years they've talked about rebalancing the economy and more household consumption,'' Arthur Kroeber, the managing director of the Beijing forecasting firm Dragonomics, said in an interview. The new plan, he said, ''shows they've been listening to their economists and do have, in principle, a stronger commitment to trying to figure out how to create a more domestically oriented economy.''
But Mr. Kroeber said he did not expect quick results. ''China's so enormous that any shift like this is going to take longer than in a smaller country,'' he said. ''It's the difference between a supertanker and a sailboat.''
There is growing urgency behind the reform effort. China's rapid economic growth has enriched the country's eastern coast and its largest cities, but has left behind many rural families. The huge trade surpluses are a growing source of friction with the United States and other nations that could lead to trade wars and currency fights and could slow economies worldwide.
The two legislatures -- the Chinese People's Political Consultative Congress and the National People's Congress -- will take up the latest economic plan separately. The Chinese People's Congress, which convenes on Thursday, is an advisory body; the National People's Congress, which in principle devises and enacts legislation, will give the plan ceremonial legal approval after it convenes on Saturday.
The police usually lock down central Beijing for the duration of the sessions. But the crackdown this year appears to be even harsher in the wake of the pro-democracy uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. Those protests, which have received little attention from the state-run media, have spawned small sympathetic protests here.
The city has banned vehicles that are not registered in Beijing from the city's freeways, set up spot checks on vehicles entering the city and barred hazardous materials from being trucked in.
On Wednesday, security officials threatened to revoke the visas of foreign journalists, among other punishments, if they reported on protests. Several journalists were injured, and one was beaten, while trying to report on a small protest in central Beijing on Sunday.
The economic plan's goals were decided at a Communist Party meeting in October, and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is expected to outline the details in a speech on Saturday to both legislatures. Some of the details, however, have been reported in the state press and on the Internet.
In an Internet question-and-answer session on Saturday, Mr. Wen signaled that the government would settle for 7 percent growth in the G.D.P. this year, the lowest in recent history. That would suggest that some of the billions now spent on construction and corporate subsidies might be diverted to increasing household incomes.
The government offered another hint of its strategy on Wednesday, when the State Council said it would ask the National People's Congress to raise the minimum threshold for personal income tax, now 2,000 renminbi, or $304, a month, by an unspecified amount. News reports also suggested that the National People's Congress would consider measures to improve the income of farmers, who have benefited far less from the nation's prosperity than most groups.
Still, most details of China's economic rebalancing act have yet to be revealed. Many of them are likely to face serious opposition from interest groups that have prospered during the period of blistering growth, like the powerful state-owned corporations and regional and local officials.
Shen Minggao, Citibank's chief China economist in Hong Kong, said the government needed to cut taxes, raise wages and increase social spending if it wanted consumer demand to grow. ''In words, they've said they're paying a lot of attention to these areas,'' he said. ''What I'm curious about is how much money will follow after the words.''
The five-year plan will include a raft of other initiatives, including increased government support for high-tech companies and other strategic industries, proposals to address environmental problems and more money for health care, pensions and other social welfare needs.
The National People's Congress has taken some preliminary steps. Its standing committee, made up of a handful of the 3,000 or so delegates, has approved a tax of up to $820 on vehicles with engine displacements larger than two liters. The highest tax now is about $100.
The committee has also approved legislation making it a crime for employers to withhold wages, a frequent problem at companies that are struggling financially. And it approved plans to remove 13 crimes, most of them related to the economy, from the list of 68 offenses that can carry the death penalty.

HEADLINE: U.S. Punishes Many Firms That Claimed To Aid Jobless

BYLINE: By ASHLEY SOUTHALL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A yearlong investigation into allegations that bogus employment and business opportunities had bilked consumers out of millions of dollars has yielded dozens of civil and criminal actions, federal and state officials announced Wednesday. 
The investigation focused on businesses that lured financially unsophisticated retirees and the unemployed with opportunities to start businesses or gain access to job listings, often with little personal effort but hefty upfront fees, the authorities said.
The victims risked ''their limited financial resources in response to the promise of a job, an income or the chance to build a profitable home-based businesses,'' said David C. Vladeck, the director of the consumer protection arm of the Federal Trade Commission. ''But these turned out to be empty promises. And the people who counted on them ended up even deeper in debt.''
The commission announced more than 90 civil actions, including three lawsuits against companies the agency said defrauded consumers of more than $49.5 million. The F.T.C. said it had obtained judgments and levied fines totaling $14.6 million in six other cases.
The Justice Department said it had taken 48 criminal actions, most in conjunction with the Postal Inspection Service. In 36 criminal cases presented Wednesday, officials said there were 16 guilty pleas, three convictions and seven cease-and-desist orders. Nineteen sentences handed down to defendants total more than 56 years.
Eleven states participated in the operation, imposing millions in civil penalties and restitution.
Roy Cooper, the North Carolina attorney general, said that some victims might not get their money back because the swindlers had spent it all or left the jurisdiction of the courts.
In one of the F.T.C. lawsuits, regulators said that Ivy Capital Inc. of Nevada and 29 other defendants had taken $40 million from consumers who paid up to $20,000 for ''worthless'' business coaching and other services the company had said would help them earn up to $10,000 a month on the Internet.
Calls for comment to a number listed for Ivy Capital in Nevada went unanswered Wednesday.
In another case, the F.T.C. said that the National Sales Group of California advertised sales jobs online that did not exist and offered clients the inside track to hiring at Fortune 1,000 companies with a subscription of about $30. The F.T.C. said the company lied about its relationship with the companies and often charged customers double or triple their advertised rate, charging customers a total of $8 million.
A telephone number for the company was not immediately available, and its Web site was not navigable Wednesday afternoon.
In both lawsuits, the F.T.C. has obtained orders halting the companies' operations, freezing their assets and placing the companies in receivership.

HEADLINE: One Secret To Clocking Out May Be A Moving Van

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
IT seems like bait and switch. People who spent their working lives believing that they could retire at 65 or so are looking at their financial statements and thinking that it can't be done. The recession -- and maybe their own spending -- took too big a bite out of their balances.
Many people are willing, and even eager, to keep working until they can build up their retirement savings. But for those who long to retire sooner rather than later, there is a way out of workaday life that can be leveraged to great advantage -- moving to a lower-cost area.
This route to an earlier retirement is not for everyone, and it favors people who live in high-cost areas and have considerable equity in their homes to tap. 
Beyond that, deciding to sell a longtime home filled with memories can be emotionally wrenching. Leaving an area with a strong network of friends, neighbors, family and service providers is not easy. The sheer difficulty of selling a house, buying a new one and moving can be stressful -- and may not even be possible in this market.
But when the stars align, moving as part of a retirement plan can be an adventure that results in a richer life, both emotionally and financially.
Planning ahead is crucial to this strategy, and right now it also allows time for the housing market to improve. ''Two years is not too long to be thinking about where you want to go,'' said Bert Sperling, founder and president of the Sperling's BestPlaces Web site.
Differences between high-cost and low-cost (but still attractive) areas can be steep. According to Bankrate.com, which offers a free cost-of-living calculator, the average price of a home in the San Francisco area is $813,000; in Boston it is $419,000; and in Chicago it is $361,000. Compare these prices with Asheville, N.C., at $284,000; Lexington, Ky., at $259,000; and Boise, Idaho, at $254,000. Move to a smaller home in one of these areas and the price difference is even more substantial.
Most retirement research is tedious, but researching where you may want to live next can actually be fun. Narrow your search to several locations, and go on vacation to those spots to see if you like them, Mr. Sperling advised. Talk to the locals to find out what life is like there and which neighborhoods would suit you. When you get back, check out the local papers online and make sure that the area is not dealing with severe budget cutbacks or a high crime rate, he said.
Keep in mind that you can rent in a new area -- and perhaps rent out the house you now own -- before you commit, Mr. Sperling said.
Most people who move to a smaller town want to make sure they are close to a major airport, said Fred Brock, author of ''Retire on Less Than You Think'' (and a former editor at The New York Times). Given the increasing likelihood of health problems, they also want to be near high-quality medical care. ''You don't want to move to a place that is beautiful and cheap but the nearest hospital is 100 miles away,'' he said
Mr. Brock, by the way, is retired at 66 and lives in Green Valley, Ariz., near Tucson, where housing, property taxes and car insurance are all much less expensive than when he lived in Montclair, N.J., seven years ago.
Look at the property taxes, sales tax and income tax in your prospective new area, and be aware that some states tax pension withdrawals while others don't. The Web site retirementliving.com is useful for making tax comparisons.
Keep in mind, though, that when it comes to taxes, the states will probably ''get you one way or another,'' Mr. Sperling said, so don't base your decision solely on tax impact.
Smaller towns with big universities are attracting retirees with their lower cost of living and cultural amenities. ''In a university town you have the benefits of a large city without the large city overhead,'' Mr. Sperling said. He named some examples: Oxford, Miss; Madison, Wis.; Boulder, Colo.; Burlington, Vt.; and Northampton, Mass.
Some retirees move back to the town or city of their alma mater. Susan Sadler Hayman, University of Mississippi, class of 1963, decided to do that in 2009. A Dallas-based flight attendant for American Airlines, she retired in 2004. Her second husband had died in 2001, and with her children and stepchildren grown, the four-bedroom house where she lived was too big, but she couldn't find a suitable house in her price range in Dallas.
Finally, she decided to move to a smaller house in Oxford, population 19,000, where housing prices, taxes and utilities are all cheaper than in Dallas, she said.
Moving to a smaller home stretches retirement savings even more and offers an excellent opportunity for downsizing. Ms. Hayman, who is now 69, said she went through every item in every room of her Dallas house, and asked, do I want to keep it, sell it or give it away? She now works part time as a certified life coach, with part of her work devoted to helping other people downsize, too.
The Dallas house held memories of her late husband and their family, and she misses her neighbors and the lovely old trees in her yard. But she has made new friends in Oxford, some of them through a William Faulkner study group and through a city newcomers' club. And she has become reacquainted with some of her old friends from college who have also returned to Oxford.
Her Oxford house has its own attractions: It is on a lake and has a big deck, and is still big enough for family members to visit, which they often do, flying into the Memphis airport an hour and a half away.
Some older cities like Pittsburgh and Buffalo might not immediately spring to mind as retirement locales, Mr. Sperling said, but they often have excellent services for older people, along with relatively cheap housing and cultural attractions.
Retire to Buffalo, which has one of the highest snowfall averages in the country? Mr. Sperling says climate is less of a concern to retirees than it used to be and that the traditional Sun Belt migration is less pronounced these days.
Don't rule out major metropolitan areas, Mr. Sperling said -- you can cut your costs by living in certain suburbs or an hour or two outside a big city, where home prices are considerably cheaper. Living close to the city center is less of a priority without a work commute.
That's what Jean Broom did, and as a longtime renter in Manhattan she had no equity to exploit. She used her savings from her job as a human resources professional to buy a two-bedroom condo in Evanston, Ill., near Chicago, for around $300,000, several years ago. That was much cheaper than if she had tried to buy a similar place in Manhattan.
''The prices were just so crazy in Manhattan I didn't have confidence that it was a place I could stay long term,'' she said.
Ms. Broom, 65, accustomed to plenty of cultural stimulation, enjoys being close to Northwestern University, where she has attended classes on Southeast Asian religions and the history of musical theater.
So for many who always took it as an article of faith that they could retire comfortably in their 60s, yes, it can still be done, with the right combination of savings or equity, combined with a willingness to move.
It might not be easy. ''I don't want anybody to think I'm saying that it's just as easy to retire as it was five or six years ago,'' Mr. Brock said. It isn't. But it pains him, he said, to think there are people out there who believe they can't retire when they actually can.

HEADLINE: Battle Over Bottling Plant Pitted 2 Qaddafis Against Each Other, Cables Show

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Soon after Coca-Cola decided to move into Libya in 2005, it received a harsh lesson in how the personal jealousies and brutality of the feuding family of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi shape the nation's economy.
Two of Colonel Qaddafi's sons began to fight for control of the local Coca-Cola bottling company, and their battle turned into an armed confrontation dominated by a militia loyal to one of the sons, according to American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. The dispute was settled when Colonel Qaddafi's daughter intervened, but only after at least one worker was hurt, one Qaddafi cousin was stuffed into the trunk of a car and the Coca-Cola plant was shut down for months, the cables said. 
The episode provides a rare, behind-the-scenes glimpse into the Qaddafis and more broadly underscores how the whims of ruling families have tainted the climate for economic development in parts of the Arab world.
In the 1990s, with Libya chafing under international sanctions, Coca-Cola did not have a bottling plant in the country. Instead, it was distributed through a franchise in neighboring Tunisia. It was only after Colonel Qaddafi abandoned his nuclear weapons program in 2003 and sanctions were relaxed by the West that American companies, including Coca-Cola, began to invest there again. Coca-Cola's new bottling plant opened in 2005 through a local franchise known as the Global Beverage Company.
But almost immediately, two of Colonel Qaddafi's sons, Mutassim and Mohammed, began to compete for control of Global Beverage. The feud burst into view in late 2005, just two weeks after the plant opened, when security troops loyal to Mutassim occupied the bottling plant in Tripoli, according to a 2006 State Department cable. His militia occupied the plant until February 2006, blocking production.
The State Department cable recounts how on Dec. 28, 2005, ''Two military cars carrying armed personnel without clear identification illegally broke into the facility, asked the employees to leave the premises and shut down the plant.'' Mutassim's forces quickly took control of the plant after one foreign worker was injured and some equipment was destroyed.
During the plant's occupation, managers were initially allowed to enter the plant ''singly or in pairs,'' but later Coca-Cola employees were barred completely. Over the following weeks, company shareholders received extortion demands from ''freelancers'' while anonymous callers threatened the plant's foreign workers with ''political problems'' or physical harm, according to the cable.
''At no time did any Libyan authority offer a legal justification for the plant's shutdown,'' the cable said, recounting complaints from business officials involved.
The battle reached a peak in February 2006, when men loyal to Mutassim went to Mohammed's residence, where they abducted and assaulted one of his cousins, who is also one of Mohammed's in-laws, in order to ''send a signal to The Engineer (Mohammed),'' according to the cable.
Mutassim's associates arrived at ''Mohammed's residence and began shouting for him to come out,'' the cable says, quoting a witness. ''Receiving no response, they left in search of one of Mohammed's cousins, whom they stowed in the trunk of one of their cars and brought back to the residence.''
One of the company's board members received a hurried call warning him to leave Tripoli before Mutassim's men could find him.
Finally, their sister, Aisha Qaddafi, appeared to have become fed up with the fighting and brokered a deal between her brothers. According to the cable, the compromise called for Mohammed to sell his shares in the bottling operation, and in return Mutassim would call off his men and leave the company alone.
One person caught in the middle of the fight told an official from the United States Embassy, according to one of the cables, that ''although he had heard stories about doing business in Libya, he never imagined that what transpired was still possible here. 'You know the movie, 'The Godfather'? We've been living it for the last few months.' ''
On Wednesday, Kerry Tressler, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola at the company's headquarters in Atlanta, acknowledged that in 2006 there had been ''a period of uncertainty about the local ownership of the bottler'' in Libya, but that the problem was eventually resolved.
She said that production and distribution at the bottling plant have now stopped because of the protests and unrest.
The State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, said it would have no comment on the cables' revelations.

As the snow begins to recede from the meager headstone with the wrong name on its bronze plaque, this is the question being asked about the homeless wanderer, dressed in a 60-pound leather suit, who died more than a century ago: How best to remember a man who spent his life, it seems, intent on being unknown?
This spring, a team of historians, geneticists, archaeologists and anthropologists will exhume the remains of the Leather Man, probably the most famous hermit to inhabit these parts. First noticed around 1856, the Leather Man, who fashioned his suit from discarded boots, wandered Westchester County and western Connecticut for decades, sleeping in caves and lean-tos, rarely speaking, accepting food and then walking on. From about 1883 to 1889, he traveled a never-changing 365-mile loop through at least 41 towns; he died in a cave near here on March 20, 1889. 
What's known about the Leather Man is almost entirely limited to what was observed during his walks, reported in thousands of articles in newspapers like The Deep River New Era, The Penny Press of Middletown, The New Milford Gazette and The Brewster Standard.
Everything else is a mystery. His headstone reads Jules Bourglay, but that was not his name. Nor is there any reason to believe it was Isaac Mossey, Rudolph or Randolph Mossey or Zacharias Boveliat, as he has sometimes been identified. He was said to have been born in Lyon, France, the son of a wealthy wool merchant who was driven mad by economic ruin and a broken heart. It was reported that he had vast real estate holdings; that he once had a thriving business in Poughkeepsie; that he might be Portuguese; that he was a devout Catholic; that he was a fugitive from justice; and that he was a black man. There is no proof that a word is true.
He was given a pauper's burial at the edge of Sparta Cemetery, and, in 1953, as his fame continued to spread, the bronze plaque was added, a few paces from busy Route 9. But, as a result of research conducted by Dan W. DeLuca, author of the 2008 book ''The Old Leather Man,'' it became clear that the name on the headstone was wrong. And with traffic on Route 9 increasing -- to 16,000 cars a day -- officials of the Ossining Historical Society, which maintains the cemetery, felt that the site, visited regularly, was unsafe. They decided to move the body to a spot with a proper and accurate marker near the flagpole in the center of the cemetery, and bring in experts to see if the body can tell us what the old man never did.
There's no guarantee there will be enough remains to determine anything. But Nicholas Bellantoni, the Connecticut state archaeologist, said analysis of bone and teeth could provide clues to the Leather Man's origins and health. At best, it could provide information about whether, as some have speculated, the Leather Man was autistic, which might explain his behavior.
''We're trying to do right by this man; he deserves better than a stone with someone else's name in the pauper's area,'' Mr. Bellantoni said. ''We're never going to solve all the mysteries of the Leather Man, but if he couldn't speak, or chose not to, maybe his biology will have the chance to teach us about him -- not through legend, but through actual scientific knowledge.''
Others disagree. Don Johnson, a middle school teacher in one of the Leather Man's old haunts, North Haven, Conn., has started a Web site, leavetheleathermanalone.com. He argues that an accurate, respectful marker could be built and the site made safer without moving the remains. If he's in a pauper's site at the margin, that was the way he lived, Mr. Johnson said. ''If anyone's actions spoke louder than words, it was his,'' he added. ''For 30 years and over 75,000 miles of walking, he showed he could get comfortable with people, sit with them, until they asked any question about his identity, and then he'd be gone. For some reason, it was off-limits.''
As for genetic tests, he says, ''If there's any place left where you can keep your secrets, with the Internet and everything out there, it should be your bones.''
Of course, we don't know if the Leather Man could not communicate or chose not to, if he would have taken some pleasure in his notoriety or hated it. All we know is that, as distant and lonely as his life was, it ended at a familiar place. As one eulogy at the time had it:
May his wrongs all there be righted
And the poor man's frame be made whole:
And his life, that here was blighted
Add happiness there to his soul.

HEADLINE: Go Play Golf, but Monitor Your Portfolio Too

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
WITH stock prices advancing smartly -- both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have gained more than 22 percent in the last six months -- retirees who fled to the safety of money market funds and savings accounts when the market plunged in 2008 and 2009 may well want to move some assets back into stocks.
''It is absolutely time to be in equities,'' said Jason T. Thomas, chief investment officer of Aspiriant, a fee-only wealth management firm with offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles. ''Over time, fixed income is going to underperform vis-a-vis equities'' by three to five percentage points, he predicted.
Chris Leavy, chief investment officer of United States managed equity portfolios for BlackRock Inc., the world's largest investment management firm, pointed to long life expectancies as a reason that stocks are ''a compelling investment compared to fixed income.'' 
For a couple, both age 65, ''there is a 50 percent chance that at least one will make it to 92,'' he said.
''Investors nearing or in retirement should feel comfortable investing up to 50 percent of their portfolios in dividend-paying equities,'' Mr. Leavy added. Equity valuations today are still attractive, he said, despite the markets' recent rise. Historically, he said, dividends have grown faster than inflation, especially in European markets.
BlackRock, which sells mutual funds through financial advisers, has two dividend funds, the BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund and the BlackRock Global Dividend Income Fund, both of which have outperformed their peer group.
Both men and other advisers interviewed emphasized the need for careful risk management and diversification.
Hans Olsen, chief investment officer of JPMorgan's private client services, went so far as to say, ''It's not about getting the most on the upside -- it's about limiting the downside.'' If a portfolio loses 25 percent of its value, he noted, it will have to gain 33 percent to get back to the starting point.
Dividend-paying stocks in developed markets in the United States and Europe ''look particularly fetching for retirees now,'' he said, with potential for both capital appreciation and income. ''Long-term bonds are not a good idea now because of where interest rates are likely to go,'' he added, meaning that as rates rise, the market value of the bonds will fall.
Dr. Thomas, who has a doctorate in economics, said that ''equity returns in any given year are impossible to predict,'' so he offered a hedging strategy to limit risk.
Here is how it works: A retiree puts $100,000 into an exchange traded fund replicating the S.& P. 500. Then, he said, the investor could buy a put option to limit his loss in the unexpected event of a market plunge.
''It would cost about $1,800 to ensure that the portfolio is worth at least $80,000 through the option's expiration date'' of Dec. 17, he said, so, if the market indeed rose 8 percent, an investor who has spent $1,800, or 1.8 percent, for a put would have a net return of 6 percent, still far more than he would have had in money markets or short-term notes.
The strategy can also be used for iShares for the Russell 3000 Index Fund, the MSCI EAFE Index Fund and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund.
Alternatively, he said, a number of mutual funds use options to manage risk, including the Gateway Fund, which in 2008 had a negative total return of 13.92 percent, not nearly so bad as the S.& P. 500, which had a negative 37 percent return. But the Gateway Fund's gains this year have been less than half that of the index, reflecting the cost of protecting the downside.
Christopher Zander, a partner and wealth adviser with Evercore Wealth Management in New York, favors broadly diversified retirement portfolios, including market hedges like gold and other commodities, bonds from Australia, Brazil and Norway, and Treasury inflation protected securities, known as TIPS.
In equities, he likes large-capitalization, dividend-paying domestic stocks and emerging markets issues for which he uses an E.T.F. for the WisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund.
Mr. Zander cautioned against holding any concentrated stock position, which many retired executives have in the companies where they worked. Once they are no longer with the company, they should diversify away from ''single-event risks,'' he said.
The first step in building a retirement portfolio, Mr. Zander said, is to identify your cash-flow needs and your long-term goals. Then put together a portfolio that will provide the growth and income to meet those needs and goals, provided it does not entail more risk than you are willing to accept.
''If a conservative portfolio can meet your income goals and legacy goals,'' he said, you can avoid unnecessary risk. On the other hand, ''if you have a couple of good years,'' when your portfolio outperforms, ''be mindful to set some aside'' for the leaner years, he said.
Alexander Godwin, global head of asset allocation and managing director for Citi Private Bank, said a conservative portfolio might have 20 percent in equities, 8 percent in cash, 9 percent in hedge funds, 30 percent in corporate fixed income and the rest in Treasuries, municipal and supranational bonds.
A moderate-risk portfolio, in Mr. Godwin's model, would have 48 percent in equities, 17 percent in hedge funds, 18 percent in corporate fixed income and the rest in government issues.
A more aggressive one would have 64 percent in equities, 21 percent in hedge funds, 8.5 percent in corporate fixed income and the rest in government issues.
One way to put a reliable floor under current income, so there is less cause for anxiety over the inevitable ups and downs of long-term equity investments, is to put a portion of a retirement portfolio into an income annuity.
Michael J. Gordon, senior vice president of the New York Life Insurance Company, the largest provider of income annuities, said, ''When you're working, you effectively have an income annuity -- your job.'' When people retire, they can replace their paychecks by putting a chunk of their liquid assets, typically 20 percent to 30 percent, into an annuity.
The first step is to figure out how much you need each month for living expenses in retirement, then subtract any Social Security and pension payments you might receive to see how much you would need to cover the difference.
A 65-year-old man who bought a $100,000 annuity from New York Life would receive $577.51 a month for life. The monthly payment would be $549.55 if he bought an annuity with a guarantee that if he died before all the payments received equaled the initial premium amount, his estate would get a refund for the difference.
Couples can buy joint policies, and a variety of secondary guarantees are available, like inflation protection or emergency provisions, Mr. Gordon said, but each additional guarantee would reduce the monthly payment.
The approach at Bank of America Merrill Lynch is to divide retirees' assets into three portfolios, one for short-term consumption needs, the second for longer-term investments and the third for savings and investments that are intended to create legacies.
The short-term portfolio may include annuities or high-quality fixed-income assets to generate regular cash flows over a two- to seven-year period, but not equities, said Thomas Latta, managing director, investment management and guidance, for Merrill Lynch Global Wealth. Over time, assets may be transferred from the intermediate portfolio, which is diversified across most major asset classes, including equities and fixed income, and is intended to keep pace with inflation.
The third portfolio may also include real estate and specialty assets, as well as alternative investments.
''Don't look at it as once and done,'' said David Tyrie, head of personal retirement solutions for the company, adding that a portfolio ''is a living, breathing thing'' that needs careful attention.

HEADLINE: Making the Most Out of Less

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
JEFF NELSON, a manager in the Utah Health Department, says he constantly scolds himself for not setting aside more for retirement. ''It's always there, like that squeaky screen door in back that you want to fix , but you never get to,'' said Mr. Nelson, 40, the father of a 10-year-old and 7 -year-old. ''I feel I have more pressing needs. I have to make the house payment. I have to make the car payment.''
''I know you're supposed to save more for retirement,'' he added, ''but I haven't even started saving for college for my kids.''
Mr. Nelson, a state employee, may be a couple of decades from retirement, but he is in line to receive a pension someday, and that alone puts him in better shape that many Americans. But as he well knows, it is not likely to be enough. Sad to say, people of Mr. Nelson's generation, the baby boomers' children -- in their 20s, 30s and 40s -- are likely to have an even rougher retirement than their parents, many economists say. 
And for the baby boomers themselves, retirement may not seem so rosy as it once did.
This year, the first of the nation's 79 million baby boomers turn 65, and while millions dream of comfortable retirements, perhaps in Boca Raton, Fla., or Palm Springs, Calif., many will discover they will have a tough time in retirement.
''The baby boomers will be the first generation that will do worse in retirement than their parents,'' said Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor and retirement specialist at the New School for Social Research in New York. ''And the next generation of retirees will do a lot worse; they fall off a cliff,'' largely because so few of them will have the traditional pensions that many of their parents and grandparents had.
Americans planning to retire in five to 10 years could see their golden years tarnished by a confluence of circumstances, including depressed housing prices, soaring health costs and a fitful stock market that has pummeled 401(k) plans. Not only that, company after company has frozen or eliminated its pension plan, and many members of Congress are pushing to scale back Social Security benefits -- even though half of the nation's retirees receive at least 90 percent of their income from Social Security. Its benefits average $14,000 a year. So perhaps it should not be surprising that 45 percent of America's baby boomers are ''at risk,'' without enough to maintain their living standards after they retire, according to the nation's leading center on retirement studies, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
Even one development that might seem to be good news -- longer life spans -- could worsen retirement woes, because more and more people will live for years after they have spent their nest eggs. For couples retiring now, the chances are 50 percent that one member will live to 92.
But don't rush to press the panic button, retirement specialists say. Smart planning -- and aggressive saving -- can go far to ensure a comfortable retirement. Whether you are 29 or 59, put far more into your retirement accounts, they say. Many recommend that you set aside at least 10 percent of your income.
And knowing how lackadaisical millions of Americans are about saving for retirement -- and acknowledging that many are struggling just to make ends meet -- many retirement specialists are urging Washington to create a savings vehicle, sometimes called an automatic individual retirement account or guaranteed retirement account, that would supplement Social Security and require workers (and perhaps employers) to contribute several percentage points of employee earnings.
If you have already retired, there are strategies to help make your retirement years more prosperous and secure. Buying an annuity can ensure you a steady income stream until the day you die, above and beyond Social Security. Some advisers also recommend that people 62 and older consider reverse mortgages, though they often offer less money than several years ago because of the decline in housing values.
Another increasingly popular, if unloved, strategy to consider is semiretirement, taking a part-time job or starting a small business to ensure an adequate income.
''No one wants to say longevity is a problem, but you have to finance your retirement for a longer period of time,'' said David Certner, the legislative policy director for AARP. ''We certainly encourage people to continue working that extra year or two. That means not only are you not drawing down for an extra year or two, but you're building up your assets another year or two.''
Phyllis Kaplan, of Highland Park, Ill., began receiving early Social Security payments last August, at 63, because she had lost her job as a graphic designer for a publishing house. She rolled over money from her 401(k) into an I.R.A., but she said that still left her without enough income, even with $1,200 in monthly Social Security benefits.
So Ms. Kaplan started working 10 days a month in a bead shop, making use of her artistic flair.
''I realized I had to continue working because I can't pay my bills,'' said Ms. Kaplan, who has been divorced for 24 years. ''I have no pension, and I have to buy health insurance, and this job is helping me develop more of a nest egg.'' She noted that Social Security would cut her benefits if she worked more each month.
A new report by McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, is gloomy about retirement. The report, Restoring Americans' Retirement Security: A Shared Responsibility, says, ''The average American family faces a 37 percent shortfall in the income they will need in retirement,'' meaning ''the average household will face a retirement savings shortfall of nearly $250,000 by the time of retirement.
''Even before the financial crisis that began in the fall of 2008,'' causing 401(k) plans to tumble, ''Americans were woefully unprepared for retirement.''
Households in the 60-to-65 age group with incomes of $100,000 to $250,000 a year face a 20 percent shortfall in the income needed to maintain their living standards at retirement, the report says, while households 40 to 59 in that income bracket face a 28 percent shortfall.
For households with incomes of $50,000 to $100,000, McKinsey found, those 60 to 65 face a 10 percent gap in the income needed to maintain their living standards in retirement, but those 40 to 59 in that income group face a 37 percent shortfall.
The shortfalls are even larger for those 30 to 39. The McKinsey report says that group faces the biggest challenge, but ''they have the greatest ability to recover by changing their behaviors.'' ''This group,'' the report says, ''must rely almost entirely on personal savings'' because the payouts from traditional defined-benefit pensions ''will provide one-tenth of the retirement income of their parents' generation.''
At 76, Peter Sonders has some strong retirement advice for younger Americans. A longtime lab technician at an Anheuser-Busch Brewery, Mr. Sonders lives comfortably in retirement in Williamsburg, Va., although he worked 27 years for Rheingold, a beer company that went bankrupt, causing his pension there to wither to $88 a month. Still, Mr. Sonders boasts that he has managed to put together a solid retirement in a way, he says, that many others can.
''The strategy I would recommend is, you have to save 'till it hurts, because even your regular pension plan can go up in smoke,'' said Mr. Sonders, who used to be a trustee on union pension funds. ''So save as much as you can, well over 10 percent a year. And don't speculate too much in what you're investing. And if you ever get a raise, don't spend the raise, keep saving it and you usually won't miss it.''
Retirement specialists say a cascade of unhappy factors has dimmed retirement prospects:
Social Security benefits will replace just 28 percent of a recipient's preretirement income in 2030, on average, down from 39 percent in 2002, according to the Center on Retirement Research. The drop will result largely from the increased Medicare payments and higher income taxes Social Security recipients will have to pay.
Financial planners generally recommend that retirement income be 65 percent to 80 percent of preretirement income to avoid a drop in living standards. Social Security recipients face that decline even without more cuts Congress may make to address the system's long-term financing problems. One idea is to raise the age for full benefits to 69.
Low interest rates have translated into paltry yields for many bonds and retirement accounts, making it harder to live off interest alone (although low inflation helps keep pensions and savings accounts from eroding).
Not only do fewer than half of private-sector workers participate in a pension or 401(k) plan, but corporations are moving more workers from traditional pensions to the considerably less generous 401(k). At the same time, public-sector workers, many of whom still have generous defined-benefit pensions, are seeing those plans come under attack in New Jersey, Wisconsin and other states.
Jack VanDerhei, research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, said, ''Unless you're one of the 40 to 50 percent of the private-sector work force that's lucky enough to work for an employer that's sponsoring a retirement plan, the probability that you'll end up with sufficient money for retirement is de minimis.''
Even many Americans with 401(k) plans face problems because workers have a median of about $30,000 in their accounts, while the 55-to-64 age group just before retirement has a median of $78,000, not much to live on in addition to Social Security if you retire at 65 and live 20 more years. As a result of the stock market's slide during the recession, 401(k) plans lost $2.8 trillion in value, tumbling by more than 40 percent -- though Wall Street's recent rise has allowed them to recoup more than half that loss.
Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center on Retirement Research at Boston College, said 401(k) plans were far from ideal for retirement, not least because they are so complicated and many Americans have little investment expertise. Workers, she said, have to decide whether to join their employer's plan, how much to contribute, how to invest their contributions, when to rebalance, what to do about company stock, whether to roll over accumulations when changing jobs and how to withdraw the money in retirement.
''Every step along the way, a significant fraction of participants make serious mistakes,'' she said.
Retirement specialists are overflowing with advice about what to do to prevent a drop in living standards.
For wealthy as well as many middle-class Americans, Mr. VanDerhei, said, ''Any overall rule of thumb I give would be silly, but I plead with people, before you retire please go see somebody, please spend a couple of hundred dollars to see a financial planner to discuss the correct drawdown strategy, annuitization and other matters.''
Mr. VanDerhei said annuities were an excellent idea for many people, though using all one's retirement savings for an annuity ''doesn't make sense for a lot of people.'' He also urged people to seriously consider long-term care insurance to help protect against nursing home costs wiping out their savings.
Whether you are wealthy or middle class, retirement specialists emphasize the importance of rebalancing your financial assets as you grow older, moving a higher percentage out of equities and into less volatile investments.
While Americans in their 20s and 30s are not saving nearly enough for retirement, many specialists agree, they see one optimistic sign -- two-fifths of the 401(k) balances of new hires is being placed in balanced funds, including target-date funds, those that invest based on when an employee plans to retire, to help provide protection from sudden market volatility.
Recognizing that many 401(k) investors rarely change their own asset allocations, specialists recommend target-date funds because the fund managers reallocate the funds toward less risky investments as workers age.
For moderate- and low-income Americans, retirement specialists emphasize the importance of saving as much as you can, although those Americans have the least ability to put money aside.
''Basically, people don't save on their own,'' Ms. Munnell said. ''They only save through organized institutional mechanisms. Lecturing people to save doesn't work.''
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 created incentives for more companies to funnel all their employees into 401(k) plans, but many small businesses have not done so, leaving millions of workers without retirement plans.
Some retirement specialists and advocacy groups, noting that one-third of retirees get 100 percent of their retirement income from Social Security, often just $14,000 a year, say more needs to be done to help low- and moderate-income retirees.
Karen Friedman, executive vice president for the Pension Rights Center, a nonprofit group, is urging Congress to create what are often called guaranteed retirement accounts, to which employees and employers would contribute, with each giving perhaps 3 percent of an employee's pay. She also said the federal government should provide a tax subsidy to give workers, especially low-income ones, an incentive to contribute.
''Congress,'' Ms. Friedman said, ''shouldn't be focusing on cutting Social Security -- that's the part of the retirement system that works best -- but on strengthening the private side of the system to make sure everyone has adequate and secure benefits for retirement.''
But many business groups, as well as Mr. VanDerhei's institute, oppose requiring employers to contribute 2 percent or 3 percent as part of such a system, arguing that companies already face plenty of government mandates.
Professor Ghilarducci had frank if unpleasant advice about how Americans might deal with the looming problem of saving too little to maintain their living standards in retirement.
Asserting that millions of people have been overspenders who have lived beyond their means, she said: ''People do need to save more money for retirement. Unless changes are made to give people better pensions, my advice is to ratchet down your living standards, so when you have less money during retirement you won't be so disappointed.''

HEADLINE: Shifting Strategies For Target-Date Funds

BYLINE: By FRAN HAWTHORNE

 BODY:
TARGET-DATE fund managers are not saying so outright, but they have apparently learned a lesson from the 2008 market collapse and the furious reaction of many 401(k) investors. Now, the fund managers are de-emphasizing stocks and adding investments that are more diversified, less likely to make sharp moves and more likely to provide a steady income.
Those changes could mean fewer heart-stopping plunges in account values -- and fewer angry investors -- after the next bad market. 
''There's clearly a goal to minimize volatility risk,'' said David L. Wray, president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America, a trade group in Chicago.
Target-date funds, which follow a programmed strategy based on the investor's expected retirement date, have become extremely popular since the early 2000s. More than 80 percent of 401(k) plans now offer them, according to Aon Hewitt, a consultancy in Lincolnshire, Ill.
Investors have seen them as a safe haven, because each fund creates what is known as a glide path, a mix of stocks, fixed-income instruments and other investments that gradually and automatically shifts money from stocks into less risky assets as the investor approaches the planned retirement date.
When the markets tumbled in 2008, many investors who had hoped to retire in the next few years were shocked to learn that at a number of funds, far more of their money than expected -- typically half of the assets -- was in stocks. Rather than being a haven, the average 2010 fund -- aimed at people expecting to retire around 2010 -- fell 24.6 percent in the downslide.
Congress, the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission held hearings on the funds' marketing and investment strategies, and the Labor Department is now considering new rules for disclosure.
The managers insist that all the investor and government uproar has not affected their strategies; they note that their glide paths have changed little or not at all since 2008. Vanguard Group still keeps 68 percent of the assets in stocks 10 years before the target date, downshifting to 50 percent at the target date.
But what has changed are the kinds of securities that go into the categories of equities and fixed income.
First, the funds have added investments that are supposed to protect against inflation, usually because their returns or underlying values go up when inflation does. The most common of these investments are special Treasury bonds whose principal and interest are indexed to inflation, known as Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS; real estate investment trusts, or REITs; and various ways of investing in commodities like oil, natural gas and metals.
This latter category might include stocks of companies in those industries, limited partnerships in oil pipelines, investments in hedge funds that specialize in these areas, index funds tied to a commodities index and direct purchases of the commodities.
Some target-date managers are also trying high-yield bonds, bonds from developing countries, infrastructure projects and stocks that emphasize dividends over returns.
Although inflation may be low today, target-date funds seek inflation protection because they must look decades ahead. A secondary goal is to make investments that can produce a steady flow of returns, almost like a traditional pension, once the employees retire.
''People are relying on these strategies to provide them with income for life,'' said Jonathan Shelon, one of the two portfolio managers overseeing Fidelity Investments' Freedom Funds, which has put in TIPS and a commodities index fund. ''But there's no assurance that a traditional combination of stocks, bonds and cash is going to give you that inflation protection.''
The other big change is adding more international stocks. Within the last year and a half, Fidelity and Vanguard, the two largest 401(k) managers, have raised their international allocations to 30 percent of their total stock holdings from 20 percent, an increase that experts say is typical.
In themselves, these new investments bring more stability to the target-date funds. But their impact is doubled, because the money that goes into them must come from somewhere else.
If a manager is simply switching from one type of stock, of a company in the United States to another that is international, there is little impact. Often, however, money will be taken out of equities to go into commodities, high-yield bonds and REITs. Because these investments have some qualities similar to stocks, particularly in the short term and during times of stability, they are classified as such in the glide path. Nevertheless, a high-yield bond or a stake in an oil pipeline is quite different from a stock.
''It's definitely de-emphasizing equities,'' said David O'Meara, an investment consultant at Towers Watson, a consulting firm based in New York City.
Brian Abshire, a senior analyst at Hewitt EnnisKnupp, Aon Hewitt's investment consulting subsidiary, commented, ''With the addition of a larger international participation and more TIPS, commodities and inflation-hedging strategies, it lowers the volatility, especially near retirement.''
The Principal Financial Group in Des Moines, another big 401(k) manager, has also added inflation-hedging and income-producing investments to the retail version of its target-date funds. ''There was certainly panic in 2008, and I'm positive some of that has helped with the sales here,'' said Randy L. Welch, the director of investment services at Principal.
One thing that is not changing significantly, fund managers and outside experts say, is the cost. Even though funds in esoteric categories like international stocks and commodities usually charge higher fees than those in American stocks and bonds, that is far outweighed by the lower fees that 401(k) plans are often able to negotiate. At most, experts say, target-date fees may inch up one to three basis points (0.01 to 0.03 percent).
Mr. Wray of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America said most investors were probably not paying much attention to these alterations. After all, that is the whole point of target-date funds. ''These are the ultimate passive investments,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Willets Point Workers (and One Resident) Aren't Giving Up

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
He came dressed as a revolutionary soldier, complete with tights and a cap reminiscent of George Washington's.
But Joseph Ardizzone, 78, the last remaining resident of Willets Point, conceded on Wednesday that the fight against the Bloomberg administration for a bedraggled piece of real estate in the shadow of the Mets' new stadium in Queens was not a battle for the faint-hearted.
''I've been in the same block for 78 years,'' he said, accusing the mayor of a shameless land grab. ''Where will I go? The city should be ashamed of what it is doing.'' 
Mr. Ardizzone was perhaps the most plucky among those, including dozens of immigrant workers and business owners, who showed up at a public hearing at the Flushing Public Library in Queens to protest plans by the mayor to overhaul Willets Point by making room for 5,500 apartments, parks, office buildings, stores, restaurants and a hotel.
At the emotional hearing, opponents of the city's plans for the $3 billion development project vowed to try to kill it in court, while city officials said they would forge ahead with plans to rejuvenate Willets Point, a 61-acre expanse of junkyards and auto-repair shops -- and one resident, Mr. Ardizzone -- so blighted that locals refer to it as Iraq.
The four-hour hearing was the latest showdown in a four-year battle that has flared tempers and inspired furious lobbying. It was peppered by loud heckling from a crowd of Hispanic workers who say they stand to lose their jobs when the businesses at which they work are seized by the city for the project. .
Proponents of the Bloomberg plan, including members of the hotel and construction industry, local politicians and immigration advocates, spoke zealously Wednesday of the project as a bold example of the mayor's quest to redeem one of the city's most blighted neighborhoods. But critics countered that the project amounted to gentrification by decree and accused the city of engaging in a grandiose and speculative scheme at a time when it was struggling to pay teachers and firemen.
Tom McKnight, Willets Point project manager at the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the agency overseeing the project, said at the hearing that the city was redeeming an environmentally contaminated area that had suffered from chronic neglect.
He said the city's plans would create 5,300 new jobs; provide sewers, water lines and roads; and create a vibrant commercial hub that would generate billions in lost investment.
But opponents said Wednesday that they would fight on and that they planned to reopen a case against the city in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on the ground that the project breached environmental rules.
Michael B. Gerrard, a lawyer representing a group of small business owners, said his case rested on a seemingly arcane but decisive issue: two ramps that the city had pledged to build to connect Willets Point to the Van Wyck Expressway and help offset the up to 80,000 vehicle trips a day that experts say the entire development will generate.
Opponents of the development insist the city cannot use eminent domain unless the ramps are approved by the Federal Highway Administration and the State Transportation Department. In August, the State Supreme Court in Manhattan turned down a request for an injunction by Mr. Gerrard that focused on the two ramps. But Mr. Gerrard said Wednesday that the city had reneged on its promise to gain approval for the ramps, thereby breaching its assurances to the court.
City officials said that the city's initial pledge to build the ramps had been based on development of all 62 acres of Willets Point and that subsequent environmental assessments undertaken by the city had determined that the traffic generated during the first five-year phase of development would not make construction of the ramps necessary in the short term.
''We are continuing to work toward the necessary regulatory approvals for the ramps and anticipate approval in the coming months,'' Mr. McKnight said at the hearing.
For nearly 50 years, development and city officials have tried in vain to revitalize Willets Point, a neighborhood that the master planner Robert Moses once described as an ''eyesore and a disgrace to the borough of Queens.''
In the 1960s, Mr. Moses tried to use park money to clean up the site, but was beaten back by business owners with the help of a young lawyer named Mario M. Cuomo.
The city has 90 days to respond to concerns raised at the hearing; officials say they plan to proceed with the plans, including seizing property, if necessary, by the middle of next year.

HEADLINE: Comptroller and City Development Agency Battle Over Questionable Contract Costs

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
In a scathing critique of the Bloomberg administration's oversight practices, New York City's top fiscal watchdog has accused the city's main agency for economic development of allowing a contract with a construction company to balloon by tenfold in three years to nearly $74 million, and authorizing over $3 million in dubious payments.
The accusations, leveled against the New York City Economic Development Corporation, are detailed in an audit that is scheduled to be released on Thursday by John C. Liu, the comptroller. 
The audit is the latest in an increasingly hostile battle between the agency, which has become a vital vehicle for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's aggressive development agenda, and Mr. Liu, whose office must approve the corporation's contract with the city every year.
According to the audit, the agency approved 21 changes between July 2008 and January 2010 to a contract with Turner Construction Company, which was asked to provide facility management and construction management services at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, Essex Street Market building and other sites. As a result, the contract's value jumped to $73.5 million, from $7.5 million.
The audit says the agency authorized $3.3 million in ''inappropriate and questionable payments'' to Turner. They include improper reimbursements for unsubstantiated expenses and unnecessary costs for loading, storing and transporting contaminated soil from the Brooklyn Army Terminal site.
Referring to an alarming ''lack of involvement,'' the audit says the agency demonstrated a ''total reliance'' on the construction company and ''relinquished far too much control and supervision in reviewing and overseeing the work carried out by Turner.''
Mr. Liu said, ''Given the ongoing economic and budget uncertainties, we can neither tolerate nor afford business as usual at the E.D.C.''
What is unusual about the audit, though, is the equally scathing and exhaustingly detailed response. In a 30-page letter, serving up a point-by-point rebuttal, the agency says Mr. Liu is ''displaying an unfortunate misunderstanding'' of the contracting process. Indeed, the agency says ''20 of the 21 completed projects included in this audit came in under budget, for a net aggregate savings of $2.7 million.''
In a statement supplementing that letter, the agency accuses Mr. Liu of trying to ''sensationalize the record.''
''We are disappointed that after a 16-month review, the comptroller's office has issued an audit report that is flawed, misleading and draws unsupported conclusions,'' Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation, said in the statement.
The agency is one of New York's most powerful entities. With a mission of encouraging economic growth through redevelopment programs and other efforts, it is now managing roughly 600 capital projects valued at $1.6 billion, including planned redevelopments in Coney Island in Brooklyn and Willets Point in Queens.
But Mr. Liu, a former member of the City Council, has long questioned the agency's transparency. In one audit that he released last April, Mr. Liu accused the agency of failing to turn over to the city more than $125 million in payments, taxes and fees through leases on buildings in Times Square and the sale of city properties. Bloomberg administration officials strongly took issue with the audit, but agreed in July to hand over more than $120 million in rental payments by 2014.
In another audit, released in February, Mr. Liu said the agency was doing a poor job overseeing the Water Club restaurant on the East River between 30th and 32nd Streets. Auditors had a hard time tracking down cash receipts for the restaurant -- something that ''shortchanges the city,'' the audit said.
This time, the audit, which was actually initiated under Mr. Liu's predecessor, William C. Thompson Jr., focuses on the agency's dealings with Turner, which has worked on numerous projects in the city.
One of the most controversial was its work on the new Yankee Stadium, which the current audit did not mention. Even though a contract to do some of the work was awarded to a company called Central Excavators, the Yankees and Turner acknowledged that the work was performed by Interstate Industrial, a company that city investigators have long said had connections to organized crime, and that had been prohibited from doing city work since 2004. As a result, the Yankees said they had hired an independent construction monitor to oversee the stadium project, including the hiring of subcontractors by Turner.
In the case with the current audit, Chris McFadden, a spokesman for Turner, said that under the contract with the Economic Development Corporation, the company provided ''on-call'' services as needs were identified and financing was made available. He also said the company had cooperated fully with Mr. Liu's office, and stood behind its work, as well as that of the Economic Development Corporation.
''This is a typical form of agreement that Turner has in place with private and public sector clients,'' Mr. McFadden said. ''This is an efficient process that the N.Y.C.E.D.C. has in place and we look forward to continuing to work in partnership with them.''

HEADLINE: Oakland's Bid to Cash In On Medical Marijuana Hits Federal Roadblock

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN

 BODY:
OAKLAND, Calif. -- For a brief, smoky moment last fall, this economically challenged city seemed poised to become the nation's most aggressive when it comes to growing and taxing medical marijuana.
Those hopes have been dimmed considerably in recent weeks, though, since an exchange of letters between the city attorney and federal law enforcement officials has made it exceedingly clear that Washington will not tolerate plans for the large-scale marijuana farms the City Council approved last July. City officials had hoped to use the massive indoor growing facilities to raise some $38 million annually in fees and taxes at a time when the city is struggling with a $31 million deficit and 17 percent unemployment.
Polls last summer suggested that voters were likely to pass a November ballot initiative that would have legalized recreational marijuana use in California. They did not. But Oakland decided to proceed with its plans anyway. 
Hundreds of well-heeled investors and would-be farmers poured in from across the country to vie for four cultivation permits. Then, in December, just weeks before the city was set to issue the permits, the Council voted to stall the plan after the city's attorney, John Russo, and a county district attorney warned the Council that the marijuana cultivation ordinance thwarted state law and that city officials could be held criminally liable.
On Jan. 14, Mr. Russo wrote a letter to the United States Department of Justice seeking guidance on the city's legal standing. In a response, Melinda Haag, United States attorney for the Northern District of California, warned that ''individuals who elect to operate 'industrial cannabis cultivation and manufacturing facilities' will be doing so in violation of federal law.'' The letter went on to say that the Justice Department was ''carefully considering civil and criminal legal remedies regarding those who seek to set up industrial marijuana growing warehouses.''
Mr. Russo has refused to provide further legal guidance to the city on the marijuana farm issue, forcing Oakland to hire a new legal team as they consider a revised version of the ordinance.
Desley Brooks, the council member who wrote the revised ordinance, said the city had little choice but to move ahead with large marijuana farms. ''There are unregulated grow operations in the city, and we're having fires, home invasions and crime as a result,'' she said.
Ms. Brooks puts much of the blame for the legal hoopla over the ordinance on Mr. Russo. ''Our city attorney went to the feds and invited scrutiny,'' she said.
State law restricts who can grow marijuana to medical marijuana patients and their ''primary caregivers,'' ruling out the type of stand-alone marijuana farms originally proposed by the city. Ms. Brooks's revised ordinance couples the farms together with a storefront dispensary that acts as ''primary caregiver.''
''Oakland is the epicenter of medical marijuana in the United States,'' said Allen St. Pierre, executive director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. ''The Department of Justice is paying closer attention in Oakland because they're mindful of the fact that there is enough political and commercial chutzpah to actually get this done. The only thing stopping these entrepreneurs from breaking ground tomorrow is this letter from the feds.''
When the city gave the green light to industrial-scale marijuana cultivation, an eclectic group of investors stepped forward.
Among dozens of groups who spent months and hundreds of thousands of dollars on business plans, consultants and architects was Ben Bronfman, an heir to the Seagram liquor fortune and fiance of the rapper M.I.A. Mr. Bronfman leased 11 acres of land by the airport where he and partners had hoped to install enormous greenhouses that would produce environmentally friendly marijuana using a massive, experimental carbon-capturing device. ''Cannabis is a more constructive thing to have in our society than alcohol,'' he said.
Jeff Wilcox, a former commercial real estate developer turned medical marijuana advocate, was one of the first in line for a cultivation permit. He spent $120,000 and two years developing a $20 million plan to transform a 172,000-square-foot office park he owns into a high-tech facility capable of growing 23 pounds of medical marijuana a day, an annual crop worth up to $58 million. In accordance with city rules, much of that money would have been turned back into city coffers and into nonprofit organizations.
Many of the investors who flocked to Oakland are now taking their money and their marijuana know-how elsewhere.
''I applaud the city for pushing the envelope, but it's frustrating for those of us who spent a lot of time and money on this process,'' said Derek Peterson, a former Wall Street banker turned marijuana entrepreneur who spent $80,000 on his permit application.
Mr. Peterson is not waiting around for the city to make a decision. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia now have medical marijuana laws on the books, providing ample opportunity to grow and distribute marijuana on a huge scale. Mr. Peterson is applying for a permit to do just that in Arizona.
''Right now Oakland is far too visible for this kind of investment,'' said Scott Hawkins, who worked as a consultant on a permit application on behalf of Richard Lee, the founder of Oaksterdam University, a medical marijuana trade school here. ''Investors don't want to risk their capital in this situation unless things can get worked out between the City Council and the Department of Justice and the city attorney's office.''

THREE STAGES OF AMAZEMENT
By Carol Edgarian
298 pages. Scribner. $25.
Carol Edgarian's ''Three Stages of Amazement'' shares a surprising amount of common ground with last year's most argued-about novel, Jonathan Franzen's ''Freedom.'' Whatever the overarching themes of either book may be, it's the sharply observed detail and intensity that matter: the spectacle of high-strung, hot-blooded, restless people conflating their own private crises with the political and economic turmoil of their times. What Halliburton and the Bush era were to Mr. Franzen, Silicon Valley and the Obama presidency are to Ms. Edgarian's turbulent, furiously compelling book.
For the sake of concision, let's sideline all further thoughts of Mr. Franzen to concentrate on what Ms. Edgarian has done (in half the space, with less loftiness but more soap-operatic plot tricks). ''Three Stages of Amazement,'' her second novel, is set in San Francisco. Its 42-year-old heroine, Lena Rusch, worked in television as a ''radical, save-the-world and nail-the-bastards producer'' until she bore three children, one of whom died in the delivery room, and she became heavily saddled with domestic obligations. 
''Lena liked to give the pious hausfrau eyes,'' Ms. Edgarian writes, ''but, really, not so long ago she had been the family lark.''
Lena's husband, Dr. Charlie Pepper, was a full-time surgeon until he got involved with a start-up business venture involving new robotic operating-room technology. Together ''they were as ordinary as any two people wanting more,'' until they began spending so much time apart. Then the marriage got rocky, and the world got rocky too. Ms. Edgarian starts the book just before the Obama inauguration, with the economy plummeting and Bernard L. Madoff (who looks to Lena like ''a Jew with a George Washington haircut'') in the news.
The basic outline of this story isn't what elevates ''Three Stages of Amazement'' from the commonplace. But it goes like this: Charlie needs funds for his venture. He secretly goes to the man Lena hates most in the world: her uncle Cal Rusch, a venture capitalist with a ''thrill-seeking noggin,'' a Madoff aspect, a hilltop mansion in Pacific Heights and a vast fortune. ''And just to put a cherry on it, an old boyfriend of Lena's works with Rusch,'' Charlie says of the secret deal. ''Lena doesn't know he's there, but I do.''
The old boyfriend is a steamily evoked Italian named Alessandro, whose own Palo Alto venture firm is housed in ''a playhouse for his geek friends.'' (Decorative features include a World War I prop plane, a whale skeleton and 50 guitars.)
Lena married Charlie on the rebound from Alessandro. And she tamped down her wanderlust accordingly. ''But her dreams proved more difficult to control,'' Ms. Edgarian writes, using the kind of lush, risky imagery that can make her book so startling. ''Each night, as Lena closed her eyes, a symphony of bare-chested men greeted her, their deep-river voices calling for her to come over.''
A few further plot developments are inevitable: Charlie must tell Lena about his business venture. Lena and Alessandro must be put on a collision course. And Lena must lock antlers with her uncle. All of this is set in motion once Paco, the majordomo at Cal's Pacific Heights palace, marches seven blocks down a steep hill and delivers an invitation to Charlie and Lena's embarrassing little pink bungalow. Cal and his wife, Ivy, another strong, improbably appealing character in a book that is full of them, are giving the party to end all parties. Lena and Charlie are grudgingly invited.
The party is this book's extended centerpiece, delectably described and then dissected. Surely some of the amazement in Ms. Edgarian's title is about this. Elite Democrats show up, still buzzing about the new president, who had them all weeping. So do the tech wizards whose new fortunes have raised the benchmarks for casual extravagance. Cal's dressing room has a cherrywood massage table. His office has leather tiles on the floor.
Lena shows up angry. She remains very much a ''nervy Arabian'' instead of ''a draft horse,'' as Ms. Edgarian sees her, Lena with the ''grass green eyes'' and ''Audrey Hepburn neck,'' with ''a bit of a fairy about her, a bit of the witch.'' Alessandro appears too. And so does Norah Jones, paid to sing at the party and performing ''Come Away With Me'' as if she were crooning right in Lena and Alessandro's ears.
But when the party's over, the book takes a sharp turn, heading off in an unexpected and fearsome direction. Here's what can be said about this mood swing, without spoilers: This part of the novel overpowers the rest, perhaps more than Ms. Edgarian intended. It beggars the importance of Lena's anomie as more graphic and earth-shaking events upstage her ever more wearying frustration. Her nostril-flaring moodiness wears thin.
Ms. Edgarian nonetheless keeps Lena at the center of the book's universe. It's a dangerous miscalculation. And the author has a lot more trouble ending this book than she did starting it. So things become disappointingly perfunctory. Too many broad, convenient, Lena-friendly strokes of fate shape the book's final pages.
That said, ''Three Stages of Amazement'' is a fiery, deeply involving book with an eccentric streak that keeps it constantly surprising. Its thoughts about strength, endurance and good fortune are neatly embodied by the image of a bubble on the cover. It carries blurbs from Jennifer Egan and Amy Bloom, which signal that this is not a run-of-the-mill family story or romantic fiction. Ms. Egan and Ms. Bloom are writers who share Ms. Edgarian's fearless capacity for surgical precision.
Ms. Edgarian renders her setting so lovingly that San Francisco -- a ''gorgeous sugar-cake'' of a city, with its capacity to weather destruction and reinvent itself, with its drastic extremes of physical and fiscal altitude -- becomes a major character in its own right. And some of her novel's drama hinges on the simple, foolproof power of men and women to misunderstand each other. ''Na, you can't talk about 'em together,'' somebody here says succinctly. ''It's like wolves and apples.'' Strange and true.

HEADLINE: Strong Jobs Report Pushes Shares Higher

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS; Christine Hauser and Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks edged higher on Wednesday after a strong report on hiring by private companies raised hopes that the job market might be improving.
Traders remained concerned about the latest spike in oil prices as Libya's internal conflict deepened. Crude settled above $102 a barrel for the first time since September 2008. Worries about the effect of high oil prices on the nation's economy have recently sent stocks lower. 
The payroll processing company ADP said private employers added 217,000 jobs last month, well above the 180,000 analysts had predicted. That raised hopes that the government's employment report coming out on Friday could show a decline in the unemployment rate, which is now 9 percent.
The Federal Reserve also reported in its beige book survey that the economy expanded broadly over the last two months. All 12 regions covered by the survey reported ''modest to moderate'' growth, including a lift in retail sales.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.78 points, or 0.07 percent, to close at 12,066.80.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.11, or 0.16 percent, to 1,308.44. Both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 wavered between gains and losses throughout the day.
The Nasdaq composite gained 10.66 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,748.07.
The escalating conflict in Libya has resulted in a surge in crude oil prices over the last week and volatility in global financial markets. Stocks in the United States fell sharply on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that higher oil prices could threaten the pace of the economic recovery
''When you look at the stock market any given day it's hard to isolate cause and effect, but today we don't have that problem,'' said Lawrence R. Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. ''Investors will have one eye on oil prices for quite some time.''
Retail companies reported mixed earnings results before the market opened. Costco Wholesale fell 2.53 percent after reporting earnings that met expectations.
Apple rose almost 1 percent after the company's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, briefly emerged from a medical leave to introduce the second generation of its iPad tablet computer.
Rising stocks outnumbered decliners two-to-one on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume was one billion shares.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 21/32, to 101 9/32, and the yield rose to 3.47 percent from 3.39 percent late Tuesday.

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
With protests against Gov. Scott Walker's plan to strip Wisconsin public workers' collective bargaining rights in their third week, national groups are running dueling ads in the state's biggest television markets. 
Republican National Committee
THE SPOT ''Obama's Union Bosses,'' 30 seconds
MESSAGE ''Barack Obama is preparing a billion-dollar campaign,'' the narrator begins, followed by text on the screen that reads, ''2012: Year of the Billion-Dollar Campaigns?'' and ''2008: Unions Spent $400 Million to Elect Obama.'' As pictures of Mr. Obama and union protests flash across the screen, the narrator cites economic ills micro to macro. ''Obama and the union bosses are standing in the way of economic reform,'' the narrator says, later adding, ''They made this mess, let's clean it up.''
AUDIENCE The advertisement is set to run in Madison and Milwaukee through Friday, said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the R.N.C. (She did not respond to more specific questions about the exact cost of the ad.) Wisconsin is noted only obliquely, via a shot of a demonstrator's sign depicting Mr. Walker with a Hitler mustache (pictured at right) and a local headline about school closings due to walkouts. This spot, which has already been on the R.N.C.'s Web site for a week, is more about Pennsylvania Avenue 2012 than Madison 2011 -- but Wisconsin is nonetheless a swing state.
Democracy for America/
Progressive Change
Campaign Committee
THE SPOT ''Republican War on Working Families,'' 60 seconds
MESSAGE Interspersed with shots of the protest are close shots of individuals, snow collecting in the folds of their clothes as they estimate the cuts to their income.''This is Republican class warfare, an attack on the middle class,'' says a woman identified as Kathleen Slamka, an electrician. ''I believe that the issues being discussed in Madison are not unique to Madison and the state of Wisconsin,'' says Jeremiah Holden, an educator. ''These are national issues. Money is being taken away from workers and the tax breaks given to major corporations.'' (Mr. Walker recently signed bills that would let companies new to the state avoid taxes for two years and give credits for creating new jobs.)
AUDIENCE The liberal groups behind the ad originally spent $50,000 to produce and buy their initial set of airtime, which started today in Madison and Milwaukee. However, according to aides for the groups, an online fund-raising campaign brought in an additional $125,000 over about seven hours Wednesday, allowing the groups to expand the buy to include Green Bay and run through Sunday.

HEADLINE: Fed Beige Book Notes 'Modest to Moderate' Growth of Economy

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Economic activity in the United States expanded at a ''modest to moderate'' pace in the early part of the year, as retail sales and manufacturing grew in all but a few regions of the country, according to a survey of the Federal Reserve's 12 districts released on Wednesday.
In the central bank survey of economic activity, compiled in what is called the beige book, severe winter weather affected some aspects of the pace of economic activity. 
The report also said that labor markets improved modestly across the country, although there were differences in the types of jobs. Some regions noted stronger growth in temporary jobs while others saw an expansion in permanent positions.
''Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicated that overall economic activity continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace in January and early February,'' the beige book said. It later added: ''Labor market conditions continued to strengthen modestly, with all districts reporting some degree of improvement.''
The report suggested a benign context for any tightening by the Fed of monetary policy at the moment. The next meeting of its policy-making arm is on March 15.
Gregory Daco, the senior United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said he did not expect any change in the Fed's monetary policy at the meeting.
''This overall upbeat report underlines that the economy has picked up momentum in early 2011,'' he said.
Separately, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said in testimony before Congress on Wednesday that he was still not satisfied with the strength of the economic rebound.
''The economy's recovery is not firmly established, and we think monetary policy needs to be supportive,'' Mr. Bernanke said in semiannual testimony to the House Financial Services Committee.
Responding to a question, Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed's policy of keeping its benchmark rate near zero for an ''extended period'' helped provide support to the economy, ''which in our judgment, it still needs.''
He also said that a House Republican plan to cut $61 billion in federal spending this year could cost around 200,000 jobs over two years.
The beige book report compiles anecdotal evidence that touched on some of the sectors central to the pace of the recovery. Retail sales increased in all the districts with the exception of Richmond, Va., and Atlanta, while in some regions in the East, like Boston and New York, sales were hampered by severe weather.
The report covered the period from Jan. 3 through Feb. 18. A recurring theme in the survey was the impact that severe weather had on a range of economic activity. A manufacturer in the Minneapolis district's Upper Peninsula region reported that severe weather delayed a construction expansion, and it hit the transportation sector in the Atlanta district.
Weather also disrupted some agricultural production in many districts. Exceptionally dry conditions along with extended periods of below-freezing temperatures hurt the vegetable crop in Texas, greatly stressed livestock and necessitated increased supplemental feeding, the report said. Farmers had to break ice to water their livestock in Richmond, where cold weather lowered farm income and slowed development of winter wheat.
Weather also affected retail sales and significantly reduced automobile sales in early February in the Dallas district. Severe winter weather also had some impact on retail spending in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Kansas City, the report said.
The manufacturing sector registered solid growth in all districts except for St. Louis, which noted a decline because of the closing of several factories, including those in tire manufacturing, wood products, automobile parts, aircraft and primary metal manufacturing industries. In real estate and housing, the overall level of home sales and construction remained low, the report said, but it noted some improvement in commercial real estate.
Compared with the conditions in the previous period, there appeared to be a tightening of credit conditions. Such standards were reported in most of the districts as ''unchanged to tighter.''
Higher commodity and oil prices were having an effect on input costs, which increased for manufacturers and retailers in most districts, while the ability to pass on those costs to consumers varied.
The report also said wage pressures remained minimal throughout the 12 districts.
''If that becomes more prevalent, then the Fed begins to worry that inflation pressure is building,'' said John Canally, economist for LPL Financial. ''It is sort of a red flag.''
''The Fed is going to be extra vigilant about letting the inflation genie out of the bottle,'' said Mr. Canally. But if subsequent reports note that wage pressures are building, he said, ''that would be a precursor to a rate hike.''

HEADLINE: Inequality and Political Power

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: In our latest Book Chat, Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson get specific about the ways in which political changes have increased inequality. They also appraise the Obama administration's first two years.

 BODY:
In one of our recent Book Chats, Tyler Cowen offered his diagnosis for slow-growing income: a slowdown in innovation. Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson have a different diagnosis. In their recent book, "Winner-Take-All Politics," they point to government policies that have helped the affluent at the expense of the middle class and the poor. 
Mr. Hacker is a professor at Yale, and Mr. Pierson is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. You can see a video of Mr. Hacker and Mr. Pierson speaking about the book, and read Jonathan Alter's review of the book for The Times. My conversation with the authors follows.
Mr. Hacker: We're certainly not arguing that changes in the balance of power are the only cause of inequality and stagnating wages. The college premium has indeed grown, though it's hard to see how this accounts for the most striking and distinctively American development - namely, the extreme concentration of economic rewards at the very, very top of the economic ladder. Most of those who have a college degree haven't shared in the really big gains experienced by the top 1 percent or top 0.1 percent (average 2007 income: $7 million), which has seen its share of income more than quadruple since the early 1970s.
The big question is whether these outsized rewards could have been distributed more broadly given different economic policies. We're convinced the answer is yes. The key to getting the answer right, we argue, is to look beyond the economics of rising inequality to examine the politics. Much of our book traces how major changes in policies governing finance, corporate governance, taxation, and industrial relations helped fuel the "winner-take-all economy." These changes, we show, directly reflected the declining clout of middle-class voters and unions relative to a much more organized and mobilized corporate sector.
Mr. Pierson: We need to think more broadly about what shapes markets and the distribution of economic rewards. For instance, economists generally err in thinking that unions influence the income distribution mostly through direct negotiations with employers. Instead, we argue the most important role these forces play is to create some organized countervailing pressure in Washington. Cross-national research suggests that strong labor unions are associated with greater government redistribution through taxes and transfers. The United States is one of only a handful of countries where government taxes and benefits have become less redistributive as inequality has grown.And failure to compensate for rising inequality through taxes and benefits is only the tip of the iceberg. From industrial relations policy to regulation of executive pay to financial deregulation, policy makers either remade markets in ways that encouraged inequality or stood on the sidelines (despite plenty of complaints and clear alternatives) as changes in the market outran existing policy rules. Especially after the financial crisis, it's hard to deny that some of the big policy shifts that enriched those at the top have contributed substantially to the hardships faced by the middle class.
In several areas, you offer the kind of details that are too often missing from critiques of corporate power -- the surprising 1978 defeat of a new consumer-protection agency, the defeat of a bill that would have curbed antiunion practices, the pre-Reagan decline in tax rates that mostly affected the affluent. But there are two areas where I'm interested in hearing more: executive pay and finance.
You write that chief executives' check should be stamped, "Made possible by Washington." How, specifically, has Washington changed executive pay? And how is Washington most culpable for the financial crisis? I don't see how the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act -- a move that allowed the combination of investment and commercial banks -- played a major role. The firms that caused the most damage (Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, A.I.G.) were not combined investment-and-commercial firms.
Mr. Hacker: One reason we stress government's hand in generating extreme top-end inequality is because we think Washington's role isn't limited to passing big new laws. We also have to look at how the enforcement of existing regulations was politically undercut and, even more important, at how policy makers failed to step in as existing laws were rendered obsolete by decades of rapid economic change. A big part of the policy story is what we call "drift" - the deliberate failure to update policies to reflect changing economic realities (despite viable and popular alternatives) due to the pressure of those benefiting from such calculated inaction. 
Take executive pay. Not only are U.S. executives much more lavishly paid than they were just a couple decades ago, they are also much more lavishly paid than their counterparts in other successful economies. Moreover, their compensation is often much more weakly connected to performance. As Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard and others have documented, many features of American corporate pay practices seem designed to maximize C.E.O. leverage and minimize oversight- something the corporate scandals of the early 2000s cast in stark light.
Why have these tilted arrangements thrived? We show in our book that corporate managers, who are highly organized, have had reliable friends in Washington. Political leaders supported these practices, and resisted efforts to strengthen shareholders, even as executive pay skyrocketed. The memoirs of Arthur Levitt Jr., S.E.C. head under Clinton, are unambiguous and revelatory on this point. One prominent example we explore is the political furor regulators generated when they proposed more reasonable accounting standards for grants of stock options, the main technique used to boost (and hide) executive compensation after 1990. Prominent politicians, including Democratic senators like Joe Lieberman, were instrumental in forcing the regulators to back down.
Mr. Pierson: The story of finance is similar. We agree that the repeal of Glass-Steagall itself was not central to the financial crisis. But it was symbolic of a broad reorientation of Washington policy to support a vastly more prominent and aggressive financial sector. Finance expanded much more dramatically in the United States than it did in most other countries. Legislators and regulators encouraged this all along the way, both through a steady removal of regulatory obstacles and through a consistent lethargy in developing effective regulation of financial innovation and evolving practices in the banking sector. The most prominent example is the failure to regulate derivatives, which were central to the financial implosion. Numerous figures, including prominent regulators, sounded the alarm about derivatives. They were beaten back in organized political combat by prominent allies in Washington from Robert Rubin to Phil Gramm. 
In short, policy was changed to benefit executives in many cases. But at least as important, it was also allowed to become less effective or even relevant - not because there wasn't a strong case or public support for stronger laws, but because powerful organized interests were pressing political leaders to look the other way.
Mr. Hacker: If we were passing out grades (without grade inflation!) we would give the administration a B. The political system, on the other hand, gets a D. And we would include a note indicating that it's in danger of failing.
The big achievements of the first two years were health reform, financial reform, and a major stimulus package (including additional payroll tax relief in the recent tax deal). All these are major breakthroughs, even if they clearly do not match the scale of the crisis we face. To be sure, the president made mistakes: His economic team was too close to Wall Street, for example, and he over-claimed for the recovery package and didn't leave himself sufficient room for additional action. But we're convinced that the really deep problems aren't with Obama or his team. They're with our political process, which makes meaningful reform that threatens powerful economic interests extraordinarily hard.
Mr. Pierson: The last two-and-a-half years have vividly showcased the basic problems we identified in "Winner-Take-All Politics." First, there is the entrenchment of narrow economic interests, which are very well connected and powerful in both parties. Second, there is the vastly increased role of the Senate filibuster -- a huge change in the character of American governance, which essentially makes 60 votes a requirement on all nonbudget legislation. And third, there is the reality that the Republican Party has become both increasingly cohesive and increasingly conservative on economic issues. Actually, we should say "radical" rather than "increasingly conservative" since prominent G.O.P. figures now express many views on economic matters (tax cuts reduce deficits, slashing spending creates jobs, markets are self-regulating) that are well outside the mainstream consensus of the past 60 years or so.
All three of these developments have badly stacked the deck against economic and political reform. This has become all the more clear in recent months, as Washington has shifted from insufficient concern about the problems in our economy to excessive preoccupation with deficits (even as it extended the high-end Bush tax cuts in the face of consistent public skepticism). So watching all this unfold left us more sympathetic to the administration, but even more deeply concerned about the political process as a whole.

HEADLINE: League Runs Afoul of Its Judicial Nemesis

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
e-mail: sandor@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Thanks to a federal judge in Minneapolis, we know about some of the horse-trading that went on when the N.F.L. renegotiated and extended its contracts with CBS, Fox, ESPN, NBC and DirecTV.
Thanks to the ruling on Tuesday by David S. Doty, we know that the league made deals to hold onto all but $421 million of more than $4 billion in network payments if there is a lockout next season.
And thanks to the ruling, we know that NBC felt the league was ''hosing'' it with its monetary demands and that DirecTV will pay the league more if there is a lockout than if there isn't. 
That, one would argue, is marketplace power. But Doty might be a bigger power than the league. He signed off on the league's free-agency system in 1993 and has overseen every labor deal since.
He has ruled mostly against the league for 18 years; during his term in office, Commissioner Roger Goodell has soothed his Doty acid reflux with doses of Prilosec, a league sponsor. In 2009, the league tried to use his statements to the news media and ex parte meetings with union representatives to force him off the case in which he let Michael Vick keep $16.2 million in bonus money despite Vick's guilty plea for running a dog-fighting operation. An appeals court upheld his decision and his refusal to recuse himself.
So he is still there, still presiding in Minneapolis, home of the collapsed Metrodome roof.
His next step will be to schedule a hearing to determine whether to order the TV revenue into escrow if there is a lockout, which the N.F.L. Players Association is arguing for, or to impose monetary damages against the league. If there is a lockout, the players won't be paid, and they don't want owners to have access to revenue to help them pay off their debt, certainly an issue for teams with new stadiums, like the Jets and the Giants.
But a hearing date will probably await the result of negotiations between the owners and the union.
Doty's ruling is a glimpse at a league negotiating with television networks with a distinct purpose -- to ensure a flow of money during a lockout and beyond. He found that past lockout clauses were goosed to favor the league in 2011. Opposition to paying the N.F.L. (and being repaid over the terms of their contracts) during a work stoppage is a natural sentiment to intelligent television executives. But it was flicked away.
DirecTV considered paying the league more in 2009 and '10 if it could have gotten out of paying during a lockout in 2011. The networks inevitably had to bow to the league and accept the business wisdom of the fictional crime boss Hyman Roth, who famously said that ''this is the business we've chosen.'' NBC did not want to pay what the league wanted to extend its contract to 2012 and 2013 without the rights to a Super Bowl. Dick Ebersol, chairman of the NBC Sports Group, told Sports Illustrated that in talks with Goodell, he heard a ''coldness and a 'that's it' tone in Roger's voice that was chilling.'' NBC felt hosed but extended -- at a little more than $600 million a year -- and got an extra regular-season game from 2010 to 2013 as compensation for Goodell's frightening Ebersol.
Doty sided with the union by indicating that in giving freebies like NBC's extra games or more highlight and streaming rights (to CBS and Fox) during existing network and labor deals in 2009 and '10, the league breached its obligation to use its best efforts to maximize its revenue, hurting the players.
Doty's review: the N.F.L. did not show good faith or sound business judgment.
The league, of course, believes it was fortunate to get extensions of deals during the recession. It says that Doty's analysis was flawed and that he ignored contractual details like one that might have balanced his view of DirecTV's lockout provision.
DirecTV would have paid the league 9 percent more during a lockout than if the games were played. But the contract would give DirecTV an extra season at a substantial discount if a lockout occurred.
DirecTV's average annual payment is $1 billion from 2011 to '14.
Doty, the judicial arch-nemesis of the league, seems poised to penalize it harshly.
As he wrote in his ruling: ''The N.F.L. undertook contract renegotiations to advance its own interests and harm the interests of the players.''
That does not sound like a prelude to a slap on Goodell's hand.

HEADLINE: Libya's Hidden Wealth May Be Next Battle

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- As the battle for Libya rages on, the struggle over control of the country's sovereign wealth fund and its $70 billion in assets has just begun.
With a sizable pot of ready cash and stakes in a few elite European companies -- including the British publisher Pearson and the Italian soccer club Juventus -- the fund served as an emphatic calling card for its founder, Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a son of the Libyan ruler who was once regarded as the reformer in the family.
Established in 2006, the fund was used by Mr. Qaddafi in an effort to make the case that Libya was ready to open itself to the West. It helped draw into Mr. Qaddafi's orbit a range of powerful figures, including the Rothschild family, Prince Andrew of Britain, the former European trade commissioner Peter Mandelson, the cream of corporate society in Italy and the American private equity investors Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone and David M. Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group.
The United States said it intended to freeze any Libyan Investment Authority's assets controlled by American institutions, though no specific bank or asset had been publicly identified. In Britain, officials say the fund will be prevented from selling and repatriating its assets, which include, in addition to its Pearson stake, a small portfolio of commercial real estate holdings in London. 
But what remains unclear is to what extent the $50 billion or so of cash and liquid securities in the fund, which operated under the indirect control of Mr. Qaddafi, is accessible to the regime of his father, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Virtually all of Libya's riches come from oil, and while the country may well be sitting on a cash mountain, deploying those sums in international markets to buy arms or pay outside fighters is likely to be very difficult.
People who worked closely with the fund said that its inner workings were largely a mystery as bureaucratic inertia and lack of investment expertise kept it from being more active. It made its first outside investments only in 2008. Most of the money is probably held in Libya or in other banks in the Middle East outside of the reach of sanctions.
''There was no backup, no staffing and no system -- and everyone wanted to have a cut of the action,'' said Oliver Miles, a former British ambassador to Libya. ''It would be wrong to say that it failed, but it has not succeeded, either.''
To a degree, Mr. Miles argued, the fund's experience mirrors that of Seif Qaddafi's reform agenda as a whole. ''He did not have the professional knowledge and backup to do what he said he was going to do,'' Mr. Miles said, ''and there is a question of how truly committed he was to reform.''
While bankers say that some of the cash pool is probably being managed by the investment banks that so aggressively wooed the fund in its early days, they say it is also likely that the bulk of the assets have been kept in Libya's liquidity-rich banking system -- a reflection of the country's long experience with Western-imposed sanctions.
In addition to the fund, Libya's central bank has reserves of about $110 billion, giving it a net cash position of about 160 percent of the nation's annual gross domestic product, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Ever since his ''rivers of blood speech'' last month, in which Mr. Qaddafi first expressed his family's determination to stay in power at all cost, his once-wide circle of acquaintances has shrunk drastically.
In Britain, friendship has turned to revulsion.
Marjorie Scardino, the chief executive of Pearson, which publishes The Financial Times and The Economist, said the company was uncomfortable with Libya's 3 percent stake. The company has frozen the position and will not pay a dividend to the fund.
In the British Parliament, the opposition Labour Party has called on Prime Minister David Cameron to remove Prince Andrew from his position as a worldwide promoter of British business interests because of his reported ties to Mr. Qaddafi.
In Italy, where the fund was more heavily invested, in part because of the longstanding ties dating from Italy's colonization of Libya, the response has been more measured. Andrea Agnelli, chairman of Juventus, has said that he was not worried about the 7 percent stake that has been tied to one of Mr. Qaddafi's brothers, Al-Saadi, a former professional soccer player in Libya.
Unicredit, the Italian bank that is 7 percent owned by the Libyan Investment Authority and the Libyan Central Bank, has merely said it is monitoring the situation.
The investment authority was established in 2006 just as Libya and Mr. Qaddafi in particular, were making a concerted attempt to rejoin the community of nations.
Mercer, a consulting firm, was called in to provide technical advice, and Mr. Qaddafi made use of his connections at the London School of Economics, where he was working on his doctorate, to recruit further expertise, including Howard Davies, the school's director, to serve as an adviser to the fund.
Mr. Davies said he regretted his involvement with the fund and was no longer connected with it. He said he had taken no fee and had not offered advice on specific investments. The London School of Economics said late Thursday that Mr. Davies had resigned as director and that it had commissioned an inquiry into the school's relationship with Libya and Mr. Qaddafi.
Providing the intellectual launching pad for not just the fund but also for Mr. Qaddafi's fanciful dream to remake Libya as an entrepreneurial hub for the region to rival Dubai was a paper he commissioned from Michael Porter, the international competitiveness expert at Harvard University, which extolled Libya's potential and its system of ''popular democracy.''
''We were there because the country seemed ready to reform,'' Mr. Porter said in response to a question about his involvement in Libya. ''And Seif was the key reform driver. It became clear that the conservatives had blocked the reformers and I ended my personal involvement in 2007.''
The fund's nominal head is Muhammad H. Layas, perhaps Libya's most experienced international banker. He has had a leadership role in institutions including the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank, the only bank allowed to conduct international business during the imposition of United Nations sanctions against Libya; British-Arab Commercial Bank, a London-based wholesale bank now majority owned by Libya; and the Arab Banking Corporation, a Bahrain-based bank also majority controlled by Libya.
But while he was the titular head, bankers who have had dealings with the fund say that the real power was wielded by Mustafa Zarti, a close friend of Mr. Qaddafi whose title is deputy chief executive.
Brash and with an ''in-your-face'' style, according to people who dealt with him, Mr. Zarti went to school with Mr. Qaddafi in Austria. He is also his partner in a tuna farming enterprise, R. H. Marine Services, on the west coast of Libya.
Bankers who dealt with Mr. Zarti said he fancied himself quite a deal maker -- very much taken with glossy Wall Street names like Goldman Sachs -- and was known for his impulsive and unsuccessful investment decisions, like investing in Royal Bank of Scotland before it was bailed out.
In 2008, as the fund began to get off the ground, Mr. Zarti attracted the attention of foreign bankers, so much so that at his wedding in Tripoli in 2009, two of private equity's biggest investors, Mr. Schwarzman of Blackstone and Mr. Rubenstein of Carlyle, were invited and attended as guests.
Peter Rose, a spokesman for Blackstone, said Libya had not invested in any of the company's funds. Christopher W. Ullman of Carlyle said that the company did not comment on the identity of its investors.
While Mr. Qaddafi largely kept his distance from day-to-day operations, he would on occasion swoop in to authorize an investment, like its stake in Rusal, the aluminum producer controlled by the Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska.
By early 2010, the fund was sitting on $50 billion in cash and securities, according to Mr. Layas.
In an interview in his office in Tripoli a little more than a year ago, Mr. Layas said that the bankers were well aware of the billions in cash available to Libya's fund but that he was never tempted to invest overseas at the level and scale of other funds, like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.
Indeed, he suggested that the scars from decades of sanctions were still deeply felt. ''Sanctions have made us very conservative,'' he said. ''And it is the opinion of the leader that as we build our reserves that we keep most of them with the central bank.''

HEADLINE: New Housing Era: 30-Year Mortgage May Fade

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- How might home buying change if the federal government shuts down the housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan, the steady favorite of American borrowers since the 1950s, could become a luxury product, housing experts on both sides of the political aisle say.
Interest rates would rise for most borrowers, but urban and rural residents could see sharper increases than the coveted customers in the suburbs.
Lenders could charge fees for popular features now taken for granted, like the ability to ''lock in'' an interest rate weeks or months before taking out a loan. 
Life without Fannie and Freddie is the rare goal shared by the Obama administration and House Republicans, although it will not happen soon. Congress must agree on a plan, which could take years, and then the market must be weaned slowly from dependence on the companies and the financial backing they provide.
The reasons by now are well understood. Fannie and Freddie, created to increase the availability of mortgage loans, misused the government's support to enrich shareholders and executives by backing millions of shoddy loans. Taxpayers so far have spent more than $135 billion on the cleanup.
The much more divisive question is whether the government should preserve the benefits that the companies provide to middle-class borrowers, including lower interest rates, lenient terms and the ability to get a mortgage even when banks are not making other kinds of loans.
Douglas J. Elliott, a financial policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Congress was being forced for the first time in decades to grapple with the cost of subsidizing middle-class mortgages. The collapse of Fannie and Freddie took with it the pretense that the government could do so at no risk to taxpayers, he said.
''The politicians would like something that provides a deep and wide subsidy for housing that doesn't show up on the budget as costing anything. That's what we had'' with Fannie and Freddie, Mr. Elliott said. ''But going forward there is going to be more honest accounting.''
Some Republicans and Democrats say the price is too high. They want the government to pull back, letting the market dictate price, terms and availability.
''A purely private mortgage finance market is a very serious and very achievable goal,'' Representative Scott Garrett, the New Jersey Republican who oversees the subcommittee that oversees Fannie and Freddie, said at a hearing this week. ''No one serious in this debate believes our housing market will return to the 1930s.''
Still, powerful interests in both parties want the government instead to construct a system that would preserve many of the same benefits, with changes intended to minimize the risk of future bailouts. They say the recent crisis showed that the market could not stand on its own.
''The kind of backstop that we have now, if it didn't exist, we would have had a much more severe recession and a much sharper fall in home values,'' said Michael D. Berman, chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association, which represents the lending industry.
Hanging in the balance are the basic features of a mortgage loan: the interest rate and repayment period.
Fannie and Freddie allow people to borrow at lower rates because investors are so eager to pump money into the two companies that they accept relatively modest returns. The key to that success is the guarantee that investors will be repaid even if borrowers default -- a promise ultimately backed by taxpayers.
A long line of studies has found that the benefit to borrowers is relatively modest, less than one percentage point. But that was before the flood. Fannie, Freddie and other federal programs now support roughly 90 percent of new mortgage loans because lenders cannot raise money for mortgages that do not carry government guarantees.
One prominent investor, William H. Gross, the co-head of Pimco, the major bond investment firm, has estimated that he would demand a premium of three percentage points to buy such loans -- a cost that would be passed on to the borrower.
Proponents of a private market want the government gradually to withdraw its support, allowing investors to regain confidence. They argue that interest rates would eventually settle into roughly the same patterns that held before the financial crisis.
Some supporters of government backing also like the idea, believing that it will demonstrate the need for a backstop.
''I myself am eager to see whether there needs to be a guarantee,'' said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a crucial Democratic voice on housing issues.
Fannie and Freddie also make ownership more affordable by allowing borrowers to repay loans with fixed-interest rates over an unusually long period. A person who borrows $100,000 at 6 percent interest will pay $600 each month for 30 years, compared to $716 each month for 20 years.
The 30-year loan first became broadly available by an act of Congress in 1954 and, from then until now, the vast majority of such loans have been issued only with government support. Most investors are simply not willing to make such a long-term bet. They prefer loans with adjustable rates.
Alex J. Pollock, a former chief executive of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, said such loans would remain available in the absence of a federal guarantee, but they might be harder to find. And lenders might demand a larger down payment. Or a better credit score.
That would be a very good thing, said Mr. Pollock, now a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
Longer terms make ownership affordable only by increasing the total cost of the loan, because the borrower pays interest for a longer period. Moreover, Mr. Pollock noted that over the last several years, borrowers with adjustable-rate loans paid less as interest rates fell, while those with fixed rates kept paying the same amount for devalued homes.
''One of the reasons that American housing finance is in such bad shape right now is the 30-year mortgage,'' he said, noting that such loans are not available in most countries. ''For many people, it's not at all clear that that's the best product.''
Fannie and Freddie also allow a wide swath of the American public to borrow money at the same interest rates and on the same terms. Borrowers who did not meet their standards were forced to pay higher interest rates to subprime lenders, but the companies essentially persuaded investors to treat a vast number American families as if they were interchangeable.
They took messy bunches of loans, with risks as variable as snowflakes, and created securities of uniform quality, easy to buy and sell. The result was one of the most popular investment products ever created.
And in its absence, experts on housing finance say that fewer borrowers would qualify for the best interest rates.
Susan M. Wachter, a real estate professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said a new government guarantee was needed to preserve a homogenous market.
''There needs to be a systematic way of preventing'' fragmentation, said Professor Wachter. ''That's what we need a bulwark against. Because if there isn't, it will occur.''
The government seems least likely to maintain a final set of benefits -- leniencies in loan terms that taxpayers effectively have subsidized for borrowers.
Fannie and Freddie slashed the requirements for down payments in recent years, saying that they were helping people with minimal savings become homeowners. Nine percent of the borrowers whose loans were guaranteed by the companies from 2001 to 2008 made a down payment of less than 10 percent. But borrowers who invest less default more often. The Obama administration has said that it wants the companies to demand a minimum down payment of 10 percent.
A quirkier example is the ability to ''lock in'' an interest rate. Fannie and Freddie permitted lenders to make such promises at no risk because the companies had already obtained commitments from investors. In the companies' absence, borrowers seeking rate locks may need to pay for them.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 17, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on March 4 about the possible effect on 30-year mortgages if the government were to shut down the housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac overstated the proportion of loans guaranteed by the companies that had down payments of less than 10 percent. Those loans made up 9 percent -- not two-thirds -- of all loans guaranteed between 2001 and 2008.

HEADLINE: Experts Fear Looted Libyan Arms May Find Way to Terrorists

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

 BODY:
Security analysts say the armed uprising in Libya poses a long-term security threat -- that weapons looted from government stockpiles could circulate widely, including heat-seeking antiaircraft missiles that could be used against civilian airliners.
Photographs and video from the uprising show civilians carrying a full array of what were once the Libyan military's weapons -- like the SA-7, an early-generation, shoulder-fired missile in the same family as the more widely known Stinger -- that intelligence agencies have long worried could fall into terrorists' hands.
They also show large groups of young men equipped with a complete suite of lightweight, simple-to-use and durable infantry arms, including assault rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, which have been a staple of fighting in Africa and Asia since midway through the cold war. Mines, grenades and several types of antitank missiles can be seen as well. 
Past examples of state arsenals being looted by civilians -- whether in Uganda in 1979, Albania in 1997 or Iraq in 2003 -- have shown that once these weapons slip from state custody they can be sold through black markets, swiftly and quietly, to other countries and groups for use in wars where they can present long-lasting and destabilizing problems. Analysts are particularly concerned about the heat-seeking missiles, known as Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems, or Manpads.
''The danger of these missiles ending up in the hands of terrorists and insurgents outside of Libya is very real,'' said Matthew Schroeder, the director of the Arms Sales Monitoring Project at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. ''Securing these missiles should be a top priority of the U.S. intelligence community and their counterparts overseas.''
The principal threat, the analysts said, is not necessarily that the rebels themselves, who want international sympathy and support, might use such weapons against airliners. Rather, the concern is that because these missiles can sell for at least several thousand dollars on black markets, opportunists will gather and offer them to third parties -- pushing them into the underground trade.
Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's military was not particularly well-led, competent or large at the start of this conflict, with an army of roughly 45,000 soldiers, according to an assessment by Jane's Information Group.
But over the decades, Colonel Qaddafi has spent heavily to equip his forces and amass reserve munitions and arms. He has been accused of procuring weapons to pass on to many foreign groups, including Palestinian and Irish fighters, rebel groups and friendly governments in sub-Saharan Africa.
The weapons that have emerged from storehouses in recent days confirm that despite international sanctions, Libya had acquired arms from multiple sellers in the former Eastern bloc, accumulating an arsenal that looks like the bounty of cold war clearance sales.
The rebels' newly acquired equipment ranges from dilapidated tanks designed more than a half-century ago to relatively recent Russian assault-rifle variants.
Mixed in are rifles of Romanian, Hungarian and Russian provenance, along with crates of ammunition from Norinco, one of the principal arms-manufacturers in China.
Peter Danssaert, a researcher for the International Peace Information Service in Belgium who covers arms proliferation in Eastern Europe and Africa, said that now that the weapons were out of government custody, few would be recovered. ''They are gone forever'' from state accountability, he said.
Nic Marsh, who researches the small-arms trade for the Peace Research Institute Oslo in Norway, said the weapons could move in many directions, to Chad or Sudan, to Algeria or to Palestinian fighters.
If the battles in Libya turn into a long war, the two sides might actually import more weapons to sustain their fighting. But once the uprising is resolved, if history is a guide, the weapons stand to be sold off piece by piece.
In these cases, as in Albania in the late 1990s, weapons become commodities, and organized smuggling rings can swiftly form to move them on.
Assault rifles in Africa often fetch several hundred dollars apiece. The weapons now circulating in Libya, fresh from arsenals and evidently in good condition, could be worth more -- creating an incentive for those who hold them now to dump them onto markets later.
The Manpads, analysts said, are much more difficult to acquire and would command significantly higher prices and attract their own subset of buyers. ''When the guys outside the country realize that there are Manpads available, they will try to get them,'' Mr. Danssaert said. By ''guys,'' he said, he meant terrorist organizations.
The precise sources and types of the missiles that the rebels have lifted from stockpiles are not fully clear, and the sample of images remains small.
But photographs by The New York Times clearly show SA-7 missiles, apparently of the so-called SA-7b, an improvement on the original design, Mr. Schroeder said. One image, of the stenciled markings on a launch tube, shows a missile that appears to have been manufactured in November 1977.
The SA-7, an early-model missile, was fielded in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s for use against NATO military planes. There have been multiple manufacturers of SA-7b knockoffs outside the former Soviet Union, including in Egypt, Pakistan, Bulgaria and China.
Carried and fired by a single fighter, the missiles travel at supersonic speeds from a shoulder-fired launcher toward the heat emitted by an aircraft engine, where they detonate a high-explosive charge.
Many modern military planes use countermeasures to confuse such weapons. But very few civilian aircraft do.
Analysts fear that now that these weapons are out of state hands, they will be more easily acquired by groups that could use them against civilian jets, as terrorists did in Mombasa, Kenya, in 2002, when two missiles narrowly missed an Israeli plane with 271 people aboard.
There have been numerous other attacks against aircraft, many of which have been destroyed in flight.
Some of the attacks were devastating: an Air Rhodesia plane was downed by an SA-7 in 1979, killing all 59 people aboard; an American-supported guerrilla group claimed that it downed a Boeing 737 flown by Angolan Airways with a missile in 1983, killing 130 people; the Sudanese People's Liberation Army used an SA-7 to destroy a Sudan Airways passenger plane in 1986, killing 60 people.
In 1994, a plane carrying the presidents of Burundi and Rwanda was struck by a Manpads, killing both men and setting off genocide in Rwanda.
Even Manpads that are not fired, or miss their targets, can cause economic ripples, because aviation companies might be unwilling to service routes in areas where terrorist groups are believed to possess them. ''A perceived threat can have an effect,'' said Eric Berman, managing director of the Small Arms Survey in Geneva, which has researched the missiles' proliferation.
In the popular imagination, heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles are simple to use and uncannily reliable, but many of them are far from fail-safe.
Most of the missile systems require a degree of training to assemble and fire them effectively, including a sense of the weapons' minimum and maximum ranges and the degree to which targets should be led.
Moreover, the weapons themselves can malfunction and degrade. The SA-7, for example, has three primary components, including a grip stock that holds the weapon, a battery-cooling unit that is necessary to arm and fire it, and a launch tube that contains the missile itself.
Some of the images from Libya show men carrying only partially assembled systems. Such weapons appear menacing to the passing eye, but unless fully assembled are harmless to passing aircraft.
And even when properly assembled and carried by competent users, other factors -- such as how the missiles and batteries were stored, their age, and their provenance -- influence whether they will work when fired. ''You can have a lot of missiles out there, but many might not be effective,'' Mr. Berman said.
The analysts said that in the short term, little could be done about the loose weapons.
Mr. Berman expressed hope that the Libyan government had maintained detailed records of its weapons' serial numbers, so that after the conflict it would be possible to determine exactly what is missing, and then to organize programs to recover or account for the Manpads, one by one.
The United States government has been active in trying to account for and destroy the missile stockpiles, and underwrote buy-back programs that recovered many of the weapons that disappeared in 2003 from Saddam Hussein's storehouses in Iraq.

HEADLINE: Huntington's Clash Revisited

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Samuel Huntington was one of America's greatest political scientists. In 1993, he published a sensational essay in Foreign Affairs called ''The Clash of Civilizations?'' The essay, which became a book, argued that the post-cold war would be marked by civilizational conflict.
Human beings, Huntington wrote, are divided along cultural lines -- Western, Islamic, Hindu and so on. There is no universal civilization. Instead, there are these cultural blocks, each within its own distinct set of values. 
The Islamic civilization, he wrote, is the most troublesome. People in the Arab world do not share the general suppositions of the Western world. Their primary attachment is to their religion, not to their nation-state. Their culture is inhospitable to certain liberal ideals, like pluralism, individualism and democracy.
Huntington correctly foresaw that the Arab strongman regimes were fragile and were threatened by the masses of unemployed young men. He thought these regimes could fall, but he did not believe that the nations would modernize in a Western direction. Amid the tumult of regime change, the rebels would selectively borrow tools from the West, but their borrowing would be refracted through their own beliefs. They would follow their own trajectory and not become more Western.
The Muslim world has bloody borders, he continued. There are wars and tensions where the Muslim world comes into conflict with other civilizations. Even if decrepit regimes fell, he suggested, there would still be a fundamental clash of civilizations between Islam and the West. The Western nations would do well to keep their distance from Muslim affairs. The more the two civilizations intermingle, the worse the tensions will be.
Huntington's thesis set off a furious debate. But with the historic changes sweeping through the Arab world, it's illuminating to go back and read his argument today.
In retrospect, I'd say that Huntington committed the Fundamental Attribution Error. That is, he ascribed to traits qualities that are actually determined by context.
He argued that people in Arab lands are intrinsically not nationalistic. He argued that they do not hunger for pluralism and democracy in the way these things are understood in the West. But it now appears as though they were simply living in circumstances that did not allow that patriotism or those spiritual hungers to come to the surface.
It now appears that people in these nations, like people in all nations, have multiple authentic selves. In some circumstances, one set of identities manifests itself, but when those circumstances change, other equally authentic identities and desires get activated.
For most of the past few decades, people in Arab nations were living under regimes that rule by fear. In these circumstances, most people shared the conspiracy mongering and the political passivity that these regimes encouraged. But when the fear lessened, and the opportunity for change arose, different aspirations were energized. Over the past weeks, we've seen Arab people ferociously attached to their national identities. We've seen them willing to risk their lives for pluralism, openness and democracy.
I'd say Huntington was also wrong in the way he defined culture.
In some ways, each of us is like every person on earth; in some ways, each of us is like the members of our culture and group; and, in some ways, each of us is unique. Huntington minimized the power of universal political values and exaggerated the influence of distinct cultural values. It's easy to see why he did this. He was arguing against global elites who sometimes refuse to acknowledge the power of culture at all.
But it seems clear that many people in Arab nations do share a universal hunger for liberty. They feel the presence of universal human rights and feel insulted when they are not accorded them.
Culture is important, but underneath cultural differences there are these universal aspirations for dignity, for political systems that listen to, respond to and respect the will of the people.
Finally, I'd say Huntington misunderstood the nature of historical change. In his book, he describes transformations that move along linear, projectable trajectories. But that's not how things work in times of tumult. Instead, one person moves a step. Then the next person moves a step. Pretty soon, millions are caught up in a contagion, activating passions they had but dimly perceived just weeks before. They get swept up in momentums that have no central authority and that, nonetheless, exercise a sweeping influence on those caught up in their tides.
I write all this not to denigrate the great Huntington. He may still be proved right. The Arab world may modernize on its own separate path. But his mistakes illuminate useful truths: that all people share certain aspirations and that history is wide open. The tumult of events can transform the traits and qualities that seemed, even to great experts, etched in stone.

HEADLINE: A Walk Through 60 Years of Baseball History

BYLINE: By DAN McGRATH. 
dmcgrath@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Dan McGrath is a columnist for the Chicago News Cooperative.
No institution is more scrupulously attentive to baseball's history and traditions than the Hall of Fame. For baseball fans, a trip to the Cooperstown, N.Y., shrine is like a pilgrimage to a holy place -- Lourdes, say, for Roman Catholics or Ditka's downtown restaurant for aspiring Chicago tough guys.
No one doubts the Hall's good intentions as a guardian of the game, and yet it rarely makes a move (or declines to make one) that doesn't ignite controversy. 
Somehow, Buck O'Neil was omitted when a group of black baseball pioneers was enshrined in 2006. O'Neil, a Negro Leagues standout, might well have been the most versatile, amiable, influential black man in baseball history, Jackie Robinson notwithstanding. And he was slighted when the game's hierarchy sought to right one of its most egregious wrongs.
Then there is (or isn't) Pete Rose, banned for gambling on baseball, though that decision will never fly with the Hit King's fanatical supporters. And where is Ron Santo?
Through it all, the Hall of Fame presses on with its mission as a custodian of history, resigned to the reality of never pleasing everybody. Well, almost never. Once in a while a decision is rendered that makes perfect sense and inspires smiles among baseball people from Seattle to Miami. The honor bestowed on Roland Hemond, a former White Sox general manager, last week is an example: He's going into the Hall of Fame as the 2011 winner of a Lifetime Achievement Award, appropriately named for Buck O'Neil, its first recipient, in 2008.
Nice. Nobody has lived a more eventful or exemplary baseball life, one encompassing 60 years.
''I was stunned -- I couldn't talk,'' Hemond said of the phone call from Jane Forbes Clark, chairwoman of the Hall's board of directors. ''What goes through your mind is all the people who have helped you in your career. I just lost Chuck Tanner a few weeks ago. I wish he could have been around to see this.''
Hemond, 81, still goes to work every day as a special adviser to the Arizona Diamondbacks' president, Derrick Hall. On Monday, Hemond threw out the ceremonial first pitch as the D-backs played Colorado at the palatial new spring training facility they share in eastern Scottsdale, Ariz.
He can't recall why he was enthralled by baseball as a French Canadian kid growing up in Central Falls, R.I. He just knows he was. And unlike the stats-obsessed Harvard M.B.A.'s who populate many modern front offices, Hemond learned the game from the ground up. His first baseball job, in Hartford, Conn., paid $28 a week and entailed selling tickets and sweeping out the ballpark.
He got to the majors with the Braves while they were still in Boston and accompanied them to Milwaukee, which led to an opportunity to help build the Los Angeles Angels when the American League expanded in 1961. The White Sox hired him as general manager in 1971 and he served 15 years under three owners, including Bill Veeck's poverty-stricken fun bunch.
He would later work in the commissioner's office, run the Baltimore Orioles and earn a World Series ring for his role in assembling Arizona's 2001 world champions. Dozens of Hemond acolytes hold front-office positions throughout baseball, including Detroit's Dave Dombrowski and Cincinnati's Walt Jocketty, who squared off in the 2006 World Series when Jocketty was St. Louis's general manager.
But it's his time in Chicago that Hemond said he remembered most fondly, even though the Sox were in financial peril every day he worked for Veeck. ''Bill would say, 'Don't bother with a budget, Roland -- we don't have any money,' '' Hemond said.
The Messersmith-McNally decision of 1975 abolished the reserve clause, set the players free and revolutionized baseball economics, and it looked like a death blow for underfinanced hustlers like Veeck. He and Hemond approached the 1977 season as a last hurrah of sorts, and loaded up on one-year rental players like Oscar Gamble and Richie Zisk and slugged their way to 90 victories as the rollicking South Side Hitmen.
''We couldn't pitch or catch the ball very well, but we hit a lot of home runs and were a very entertaining team,'' Hemond said wistfully.
Success, though, was ephemeral. More than once, Hemond sold a player to make sure the Sox made payroll. He had to plead with Orioles manager Earl Weaver not to demand a forfeit after a deluge followed a concert and turned the Old Comiskey Park outfield into a quagmire. The Disco Demolition Night disaster had already cost the Sox one forfeit, and baseball had begun to cast a wary eye on Veeck's methods, not to mention his sanity.
In 1981, Veeck was in declining health and fresh out of gimmicks when he sold the White Sox to the Jerry Reinsdorf group. Hemond stayed on through 1985, when he was moved aside by the disastrous pipe dream that made Hawk Harrelson the Sox general manager.
Bitterness, though, is not in his makeup. Hemond returned as senior adviser after Ken Williams became the White Sox general manager in 2000, and he was at Houston's Minute Maid Park in 2005 when the Sox won the World Series on his 76th birthday. He couldn't imagine being happier, until he fielded the call from the Hall of Fame.
''I can't tell you how blessed I've been to have worked in baseball and to have lasted as long as I have,'' Hemond said. ''Every day has been an adventure.''
Those who have shared it with him are better for it.

HEADLINE: Slapped In the Face With a Money Pie

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
At about 5:30 p.m. on a freezing Thursday, the Steelers' Charlie Batch and the Colts' Jeff Saturday stepped out of an elevator at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service building. Batch and Saturday, members of the players union executive committee, took one look at the news media horde and slid out a back door.
Hotly pursued by cameras and reporters, Batch finally acknowledged the news of the day: there would be a 24-hour extension in negotiations to reach a new collective bargaining agreement; the old one was scheduled to expire at midnight. The owners and the players would return to the bargaining table on Friday to try to divide their $9 billion pie. 
Oh, joy. What a relief.
Regardless of how this drama plays out, neither the N.F.L. nor the players are winning the battle for the hearts of fans. The public loves the game. It tolerates players and owners.
This bizarre game of chicken has unfolded during a fragile economic period. At a time when millions have lost their jobs, health benefits and faith in the American dream, pro football players and team owners are waging a battle in a league that, thanks to the fans, prints money.
Yet it seems that the fans are being smacked in the face by indifference and insensitivity by each side.
Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer can boast to friends that he has $80 million in the bank and does not have to play football for money. Palmer said he would retire rather than play next season in Cincinnati.
In any other circumstance, Palmer might be lauded as a model of prudence for saving money. But not now, not in a climate where so many fellow citizens are free falling down a dark shaft of economic uncertainty.
Minnesota offensive tackle Bryant McKinnie reportedly had a huge bar tab last month in Las Vegas during N.B.A. All-Star weekend, drawing criticism after it was made public, although he disputes the amount of the tab.
Last month, Brandon Banks, a Redskins kick returner, was stabbed outside a downtown Washington nightclub at 3 a.m. during an argument. And, in the N.F.L.'s showcase game, the Super Bowl, 1,200 ticket-holding fans were either displaced or denied seats at Jerry Jones's lavish Cowboys Stadium.
Before and during the season, DeMaurice Smith, the union's executive director, has talked to players about being aware of public perception, about wisely choosing their words during these protracted labor talks -- about proper comportment.
The last time pro football players connected with the sensibilities of grassroots workers was during the brutal 1987 strike, when players manned picket lines. They threw eggs and stones at buses filled with replacement players. That fight was about free agency and working conditions.
This deal is about money, about a huge economic pie and how to split it.
In its uphill battle with owners, the players union has a larger problem than simply changing the perception that players are spoiled and self-indulgent. Smith's problem is coming away with the perception, if not the reality, of a victory.
When the dust settles, one side is going to talk about what it got, one side about what it gave up.
The owners have been preparing for this confrontation since the players got the better of the deal in 2006. This conflict may well be decided in the courts. The courts are Smith's turf. Smith was a prosecutor, and the N.F.L. Players Association has already won one court battle. A federal judge found that owners were essentially stockpiling network money to be used in the event of a lockout.
Smith's challenge is to determine how to minimize how much the union is going to give back and making those concessions seem like victories.
The union cannot cut a better deal than the one that the former union leader Gene Upshaw hammered out in 2006. As the years went on, an increasing number of owners realized that the deal heavily favored the players.
Upshaw's position was that in negotiations, you give nothing back in the business of sports labor. In fact, the preamble of the N.F.L.P.A.'s constitution is an ode to not giving back.
''Pay homage to all your predecessors, for their courage, sacrifice and vision. Pledge to preserve and enhance the democratic involvement of our members. Confirm our willingness to do whatever is necessary for the betterment of our membership, to preserve our gains and achieve those things not yet attained.''
But if there is to be a deal, the players union must make concessions. Owners are intent on getting back what they feel is theirs -- a larger share of soaring profits.
A public that loves the game looks at the fighting and says a pox on both their houses.

HEADLINE: Answers to Retirement Questions

 BODY:
In Thursday's special section on Retirement, Steven Greenhouse reported that as the first baby boomers reach 65 this year, many will find themselves financially unprepared for retirement. Mr. Greenhouse is taking questions from readers about what these workers, as well as younger ones, can do to get themselves ready.
Q. My wife and I are 68 and 64 years old. ... If we hold off on Social Security until age 70 we will have a Social Security income of $48,000. If we take it when we are eligible, we will receive about $35,000. Should we wait? We are currently grossing $140,000 per year and will continue to do so until we turn 70. Would we be better off waiting until 70?
A. Many retirement experts say that if you have enough income to make it comfortably to age 70 before receiving Social Security benefits, then you should do exactly that. That way, you'll have a larger (steady) flow of income from Social Security during your retirement years. 
Q.If you stock away a small amount of money every month in your 20s, you'll likely be able to retire comfortably because of the compounding effects.
How much do you need to save if you're starting late -- say in your 40s?
Sanjiv Parikh
A. Many retirement experts say middle-class households should have a nest egg of at least $400,000 to supplement Social Security to maintain living standards in retirement. To get to that point, you clearly will have to put aside far more if you're starting in your 40s than if you had started in your 20s. I don't know your income, but you sound clever enough to do the math.
Q.I heard from Jane Bryant Quinn that it's important to retire with no debt, so do you agree with that? Also, when you add up what you will have in retirement, is that pension + Social Security + 401(k)+ other savings?
CD in DC
A. Ideally, it is of course better to retire with no debt. I think Ben Franklin might have said it is better never, ever to a debtor be. One reason that many of today's baby boomers face a hard time in retirement is that they still haven't paid off their mortgages. For many Americans, there are various reasons that they can't enter retirement debt-free, but the less debt you have, of course the better off you are. And, yes, to calculate your retirement income, you combine pension, Social Security, 401(k) and other savings -- and perhaps presents from your grandchildren.
Q.Admittedly, I'm terrible with money and haven't been able to save much of anything. I couldn't stand watching my 401(k) bleed every month, so I stopped contributing. But I own a second home in Florida which will be paid off by the time I retire. I'm also in the process of selling my home in New Jersey and downsizing. I expect to live on two small pensions and Social Security when I retire in 10 years or so. Recognizing that I won't have much of a nest egg to take care of my needs as my health declines, I recently took out Long Term Care Insurance which I hope will be the missing link in my plan. My assumption is that the reason one needs 65 to 80 percent of pre-retirement income is because so much is needed for housing costs. If those costs are minimal (taxes, upkeep), less is needed, so I am thinking I will be fine. Am I missing anything?
Beth Timmons
Montclair, N.J.
A. Many experts recommend having retirement income of 65 to 80 percent to cover housing costs -- maybe one has to finish paying off a mortgage or maybe one pays monthly rent. Of course you need money for food, car, gas, property taxes and maybe trips to visit one's family. Then there are health care costs not covered by Medicare -- prescription drugs can cost a good deal. I don't know how large your small pensions are, but if you feel you'll have a good nest egg from selling your home in New Jersey and if you feel your housing costs will be minimal in Florida, then maybe you need less than 65 percent. But, again, I think it might be a good idea for you to sit down with a financial planner to make sure your calculations (and retirement) are safe.
Q.So timely -- was just ruminating over my prospects at retirement on my way to work this morning.
I am still a ways away from retirement -- but not that far -- certainly not far enough to have my retirement funds recover from the kinds of stupid acts Wall Street is so capable of. I stopped investing in my 401(k) before the 2008 meltdown -- so not all my funds have gone down the toilet -- but given the tax penalties for early withdrawals, I had to leave my 401(k) alone and unfortunately, it took a severe hit. I lost over 60 percent of the value and I have yet to recover the money that I invested, let alone the proceeds from that investment.
Again -- I am still young enough to recover from this most current screw-up by Wall Street but what happens 10 years from now when they screw up again? It seems they have a cycle going here.
Wall Street does not have a good track record and, as Charles Ferguson said in his acceptance speech, ''Three years after a horrific financial crisis caused by massive fraud, not a single financial executive has gone to jail.'' Worse -- they have learned absolutely nothing -- they are back to business as usual.
I am not willing to put my future or my peace of mind at risk here -- I'm betting Wall Street is going to screw up again which means I am not willing to tie up my funds in a captive investment like a 401(k).
Thank you for soliciting feedback and input -- good luck to you!
Kelly
A. Even if you now have an aversion to 401(k)s, it is very important to still put aside money to retirement. Clearly, you, having been burned by Wall Street, are averse to putting money in stocks. But there are better things to do than putting your money in your mattress or in a savings account. Your employer may offer some solid, secure bond funds as part of your 401(k). They should give you a higher annual return than keeping your money in your mattress or in a savings account, and they will of course be safer than putting your money in equity funds. As you have no doubt heard, historically stock funds average larger gains than bond funds, but sometimes Wall Street can plunge, as it did in 2008, and that can be very painful for those who own stocks.
Q.How can I estimate how much money I will need after I'm retired? Is there a rule of thumb to estimate this? Everything I've read suggests you'll spend less in retirement, but I think maybe I'll want to spend more. I'm 63, work from home, and want to travel, take classes, go to concerts, etc. I'll also have more time to shop (but also more time to find bargains!).
Currently, I monitor all my spending using a spreadsheet so I have a good idea what I spend now on my current lifestyle.
Paula
A. Lucky you, it sounds as if you're planning a fun-filled retirement. The general rule of thumb is one needs less income after one retires because 1) you no longer have to set aside money for retirement, 2) you'll be paying less in income taxes, 3) you're probably no longer spending money on commuting, and 4) hopefully you'll have finished paying off your mortgage. But only you know how much you plan to spend on your vacations to Europe and your concerts and classes. So do the math, do the calculations on exactly what you will need. But remember to make sure you have some money for contingencies. You sound plenty capable and can probably do the calculations yourself, but again a financial planner may have some insights and recommendations that can help.
Q.If I have a large sum of money to invest should I invest all of it now or spread I out over several years? I plan to retire in 20 years.
Russell Parkman
A. I'm sure most financial experts will say that it's a bad idea to sit on your money because you're missing potential investment gains and because your money is likely to be eroded by inflation. So in that sense I don't see the advantage to spreading out your investment over several years. But it is also important to make sure you have some cash or liquid investments in case you face an emergency (or a highly tempting purchase), and you suddenly need $5,000 or $10,000.
Q.I would love to see an exploration on the ethics of allocating so much of society's resources to unproductive, retired workers. Should these literally be golden years? I am not suggesting we take the approach of sending elders out into the wilderness to wither and die, but rather questioning the idea that you should be able to maintain a standard of living at peak consumption into retirement.
Would it not be better for society to allocate more resources to the next generation and less to the last generation?
Ben Pasmore
Austin, TX
A. You raise some important ethical, political and economic questions. But I suppose that if you campaign on a platform saying society is allocating too much to retired workers, your electoral chances would quickly decline. And retirees will make powerful argument that they've worked hard, they've been promised these benefits and that it would therefore be wrong to cut back on their benefits.
But there are powerful voices and highly reasonable people -- a New York Times Op-Ed columnist, David Brooks, being among the most prominent -- who argue that the United States is undercutting its long-term competitiveness as well as the prospects of younger generations by devoting so much of the federal budget to its two giant programs for retirees, Medicare and Social Security.
These people argue that with so many American schoolchildren receiving poor educations and with 20.1 percent of American children under 18 living below the poverty line, the nation needs to devote more of its wealth and tax revenue to helping children.
If there is anything I'm sure of, it is that this debate will continue for years.
Q.I have a steady job with a great 401(k) matching program, but I also live in a large city so I live paycheck to paycheck. I put 3 percent of my modest income in a 401(k) but worry constantly that there's more I can do to be prepared for kids, home and retirement planning. How do you recommend a cash-strapped recent grad start planning for this kind of thing? When do I need to get serious about saving -- and what outline would you recommend people my age follow as we start to plan?
Thanks!
Alex A.
A. One respected expert whom I interviewed said that all Americans should have at least 22 percent of their income set aside for retirement. If you're an employee and are part of the Social Security system, you already have 12.4 percent of your pay being set aside for you -- 6.2 percent out of your paycheck and 6.2 percent contributed by your employer. So, this expert said, you should seek to put aside another 10 percent of your income.
Now, as you say, the problem is what is to be done for people who can hardly make ends meet, who run out of money before their next paycheck arrives. All I can say is, try to save what you can. One reason many policy experts are pushing for the guaranteed retirement accounts or automatic I.R.A.'s is that such a form of forced saving will help ensure there is adequate -- or at least, more adequate -- retirement income for all Americans, including those who live paycheck to paycheck. Such policy recommendations help make sure that even those financially strapped workers will have more than just Social Security to live on once they retire.
Q.We could use some advice on retirement, and perhaps our situation is enough like many people that it could be helpful.
I am 52 and have a stable job as a professor. My wife does not work. She is 56. We have $150,000 saved. I make $70,000 a year. Including employer contribution, I put 13% of salary into retirement. Our retirement with TIAA-CREF is invested 70/30 equities/guaranteed income. I plan to work until full retirement age (67) and gradually move our investments to a 70/30 guaranteed income/equities.
According to Social Security, I should receive about $22,000 a year in retirement and my wife will receive half that figure as well, so our total retirement from Social Security should be about $33,000. We have a mortgage, but don't expect to have it paid off; our housing expenses will likely be $12,000 to $18,000 a year even in retirement. How far on/off track would you say we are?
Anonymous
A. I have received numerous very intelligent questions from readers who describe their financial situation and retirement planning in detail and ask me for advice about how they should invest and what type of annuities they should buy. Although I'm flattered that some people call me an expert, I am not a certified financial planner, and I do not feel qualified to give specific answers to such important questions about investment and retirement strategies. As Jack VanDerhei, the research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, recommends in my article, it's well worth spending a couple of hundred dollars to sit down with a personal financial adviser in order to get individualized and expert advice on retirement planning.
Q. I am semi-retired. I was forced into retirement from my primary job and am fortunate to have a pension. I continue to have clients three days a week, but it is isolating and not a regular source of income that can be counted on. I am also finding that because I worked so many hours/jobs before, I am lacking in a social network.
I am considering buying a second home in a community four to four and a half hours away that includes other retirees, activities and the opportunity for ''a life.'' I am not ready to sell my primary home yet. The cost of the home would take my Social Security check but my pension check would be what I would live on. Is this crazy?
I have no debt, my primary home is free and clear, I have a considerable retirement portfolio which I would not have to go into to purchase the home, or if I did it would be minimally. I am widowed so there is really nobody to bounce this off.
I would keep working part time but I really would want to stop at some time. I will be 64 in June.
Holli Toline
A. Considering your situation, I don't think it would be crazy to buy a second home four or so hours away from your primary home. If you that think living in that new area, at least part time, will make you happier and if you're confident that you can afford buying a second home there, then by all means do it.
But before taking the plunge, I'd recommend you double-check with a financial expert, perhaps a personal financial adviser, to make sure that your finances will allow this move and to make sure you're not failing to take some important factors into account.
Q.The Retirement article includes a recommendation for purchasing long-term care insurance. I have considered this, but feel it may be even riskier than staying invested in the stock market. I am in the enough-to-get-by-on-a-budget category.
It would be a major cost -- but probably do-able; however, I have no faith that the insurance company will still be around ( with not intervening bankruptcies) when I am 89 and need that coverage ... or that the benefits will be sufficient.
Please discuss how we can be assured that insurers are able to deliver. A recommendation to ''do your homework'' really is not sufficient -- I can no more evaluate the companies that will be able to perform in 20 to 30 years than the S.E.C. could assess Lehman Brothers.
C Gajowski
A. You are right, long-term care insurance can be tricky. There are solid insurance companies that sell such policies that have been around for decades, and I would think will continue to be around when you're 89. And states and regulatory agencies do seek to ensure that insurance companies are solid and well capitalized. But, yes, we used to think that Lehman Brothers was a rock-solid company.
I would recommend companies that have been around a long time and that have solid reputations.
Q.I'm 54 years old and have $250,000 saved for retirement. Included in that amount is $30,000 in liquid funds for emergencies. I earn $75,000/year and I am currently contributing 18% to my 401(k). I have a $230,000 mortgage with payments of $1,500/month and no other debt.
I recently inherited about $125,000. I was advised to put the money into an annuity (one with a 0.25 annual fee) so I can defer the interest. I've heard positive and negative things about annuities. Do you think an annuity is a good choice or do you have other suggestions?
Would you recommend I find a fee-only C.F.A.?
Kathy Haynes
A. It sounds as if you are doing all the right things. Yes, it might be a good idea to use the $125,000 for an annuity. But, yes, I also think it would be a good idea to discuss not just that issue but your overall retirement planning with a personal financial adviser.
Q. I may retire in the next couple of years, at age 66. My spouse and I will have income to match what we're making now (with pension 40 percent, Social Security 40 percent and savings), but it won't increase along with inflation. How should I prepare for future inflation?
Mitchell Friedman
A. You can purchase an annuity that will adjust for increases in inflation. But the downside is that if you purchase that insurance against inflation, your annuity won't generally pay out as much per month as a straight, fixed annuity. Another option is to buy an annuity that increases by 1 percent, 2 percent or 3 percent each year for life -- your choice of the amount. True, if inflation soars by 5 percent, that won't keep pace.
Another option: let's say you have saved up $600,000 that you'd like to put into an annuity, but you're worried about it being eroded by inflation. Perhaps you should use one-fourth of that amount to buy an annuity now, and then use another fourth in five years, and so forth. That will also help your annuity keep up with inflation.
Q.Has someone already done a piece on how the Social Security people determine how much your monthly check is/will be? Is there a ''formula'' or do they check the past I.R.S. and make a determination?
As someone living very simply I'm in pretty good shape financially but wondered exactly how they came up with the dollar figure on my monthly check?
Jim Bryant
Fayetteville, Ark.
A. Mr. Bryant, thanks for your note. The Social Security Administration's Web site has a link for how to calculate your monthly benefits. Here is a link to the site.
Q.There are many rules of thumb concerning the percentage of income needed at retirement (most seem to say 70 to 90 percent), but I've never heard any of the experts commenting on comparisons to the income levels in the place of retirement.
For example, a single person with a preretirement annual income of $140,000, moving from New York to Florida with a retirement income of $80,000, will have far more income than the median household income in Florida. Yet that person is expecting to live on less than 60 percent of his preretirement income. Many of the experts say this person should have at least 80 percent of his preretirement income.
Isn't it more important to have a good handle on budgeting and expected living costs than it is to meet some arbitrary percentage?
Gary R Collis
A. Mr. Collis, the experts I've spoken with generally say a retiree needs 65 to 80 percent of one's preretirement income to maintain one's living standards. One does not need 100 percent of preretirement income because once one retires, there is no longer a need to put save a specific amount for retirement. Moreover, a retiree generally pays considerably less in income taxes and probably saves on commuting and transportation expenses as well.
You raise an excellent point. In considering how much one needs to live on in retirement, it would be wise to consider where one is going to live and how much it would cost there. If one is going to retire in Manhattan or San Jose, it will certainly be more expensive than retiring in Florida or Costa Rica, as I know some people are doing. Yes, it would be smart to try to calculate living costs for where you are going to be -- mortgage, transportation, food, etc. And that might help one determine whether one wants retirement income of 60 or 80 percent of preretirement income.
And don't forget to factor in such huge possible costs as nursing homes, although none of us like to think about that.
Q. What would be the best method of finding a competent retirement adviser? There are many financial advisers who want to take my money, invest it and take a fee for doing so, and who claim they can give retirement advice, but what I would really want is someone who has no such vested interest, who I could pay to meet with me and my wife and be able to provide some real answers regarding required withdrawals from my 401(k), etc. I am 60, prefer to manage my own investments, do my own taxes, and am planning to work to age 70 and retire.
Larry Best
A. There's no surefire way to find the perfect personal financial adviser. One way to start your search is to ask friends whether they have an adviser they have worked with and would recommend.
To find a financial adviser in your area, I'd recommend taking a look at the Web site of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisers. Here is the link.
But perhaps more important, you should look at a helpful section of that Web that lists tough questions to ask a potential personal financial adviser.
It includes such good questions as, ''Do you have clients who might be willing to speak with me about your services,'' and if not, please explain. Also, ''Will you provide me with references from other professionals?''
And then there's this important question: ''Have you ever been cited by a professional or regulatory governing body for disciplinary reasons?''

HEADLINE: How To Kill A Recovery

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The economic news has been better lately. New claims for unemployment insurance are down; business and consumer surveys suggest solid growth. We're still near the bottom of a very deep hole, but at least we're climbing.
It's too bad that so many people, mainly on the political right, want to send us sliding right back down again. 
Before we get to that, let's talk about why economic recovery has been so long in coming.
Some economists expected a rapid bounce-back once we were past the acute phase of the financial crisis -- what I think of as the oh-God-we're-all-gonna-die period -- which lasted roughly from September 2008 to March 2009. But that was never in the cards. The bubble economy of the Bush years left many Americans with too much debt; once the bubble burst, consumers were forced to cut back, and it was inevitably going to take them time to repair their finances. And business investment was bound to be depressed, too. Why add to capacity when consumer demand is weak and you aren't using the factories and office buildings you have?
The only way we could have avoided a prolonged slump would have been for government spending to take up the slack. But that didn't happen: growth in total government spending actually slowed after the recession hit, as an underpowered federal stimulus was swamped by cuts at the state and local level.
So we've gone through years of high unemployment and inadequate growth. Despite the pain, however, American families have gradually improved their financial position. And in the past few months there have been signs of an emerging virtuous circle. As families have repaired their finances, they have increased their spending; as consumer demand has started to revive, businesses have become more willing to invest; and all this has led to an expanding economy, which further improves families' financial situation.
But it's still a fragile process, especially given the effects of rising oil and food prices. These price rises have little to do with U.S. policy; they're mainly because of growing demand from China and other emerging markets, on one side, and disruption of supply from political turmoil and terrible weather on the other. But they're a hit to purchasing power at an especially awkward time. And things will be much worse if the Federal Reserve and other central banks mistakenly respond to higher headline inflation by raising interest rates.
The clear and present danger to recovery, however, comes from politics -- specifically, the demand from House Republicans that the government immediately slash spending on infant nutrition, disease control, clean water and more. Quite aside from their negative long-run consequences, these cuts would lead, directly and indirectly, to the elimination of hundreds of thousands of jobs -- and this could short-circuit the virtuous circle of rising incomes and improving finances.
Of course, Republicans believe, or at least pretend to believe, that the direct job-destroying effects of their proposals would be more than offset by a rise in business confidence. As I like to put it, they believe that the Confidence Fairy will make everything all right.
But there's no reason for the rest of us to share that belief. For one thing, it's hard to see how such an obviously irresponsible plan -- since when does starving the I.R.S. for funds help reduce the deficit? -- can improve confidence.
Beyond that, we have a lot of evidence from other countries about the prospects for ''expansionary austerity'' -- and that evidence is all negative. Last October, a comprehensive study by the International Monetary Fund concluded that ''the idea that fiscal austerity stimulates economic activity in the short term finds little support in the data.''
And do you remember the lavish praise heaped on Britain's conservative government, which announced harsh austerity measures after it took office last May? How's that going? Well, business confidence did not, in fact, rise when the plan was announced; it plunged, and has yet to recover. And recent surveys suggest that confidence has fallen even further among both businesses and consumers, indicating, as one report put it, that the private sector is ''unprepared to fill the hole left by public sector cuts.''
Which brings us back to the U.S. budget debate.
Over the next few weeks, House Republicans will try to blackmail the Obama administration into accepting their proposed spending cuts, using the threat of a government shutdown. They'll claim that those cuts would be good for America in both the short term and the long term.
But the truth is exactly the reverse: Republicans have managed to come up with spending cuts that would do double duty, both undermining America's future and threatening to abort a nascent economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Foreclosure Follies

 BODY:
Recent price data show home values at nearly their lowest levels in the postbubble era, and a coming tide of foreclosures means prices will drop further. Seven million families have lost their homes so far, and another three million foreclosures are expected through 2012.
The ongoing crash is further evidence that the government's antiforeclosure efforts have fallen short and America's struggling homeowners need more help. 
So what are House Republicans proposing? They want the government to get out of the antiforeclosure business altogether and leave homeowners to fend for themselves. The result would be hundreds of thousands of additional foreclosures and steeper price declines.
House Republicans have introduced bills to eliminate four federal antiforeclosure programs and replace them with -- nothing. Here is a list of those programs and ways they could be improved:
HOME AFFORDABLE MODIFICATION PROGRAM No one disputes that HAMP, the Obama administration's main antiforeclosure plan, is lagging behind its goal to modify troubled loans for three million to four million homeowners. Of the $30 billion intended for the effort, only $1 billion has been spent so far to permanently modify 608,000 loans.
Much of the problem lies with the participating banks. Widespread errors and abuses include the improper delay and denial of modifications, excessive fees, and violations of borrowers' legal protections. Legislation and regulation that gets tougher on the banks could help fix those problems, including enactment of a transparent process for homeowners to challenge banks' decisions, stiffer penalties for banks that don't meet HAMP standards and a streamlined process for converting trial modifications to permanent ones.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION PROGRAM This Bush-era program provides money to states, cities and nonprofits to buy and rehabilitate abandoned and foreclosed properties. It helps curb the blight that comes with empty properties and, in the process, preserves the value of nearby homes and the municipalities' tax base.
The problem is there isn't enough money. Congress appropriated $4 billion in 2008 and $2 billion in 2009; all has been obligated. House Republicans want to eliminate a third round of financing -- $1 billion -- promised in the financial reform law. They say the program may provide a perverse incentive for banks to foreclose. That is absurd. Banks foreclose when they deem it in their interest, not because a small federal program entices them.
THE EMERGENCY HOMEOWNERS LOAN PROGRAM This $1 billion effort, which has not yet been implemented, would grant loans to homeowners who are unemployed, or who have lost income because of illness. Joblessness is the main reason homeowners fall behind, so alleviating such temporary hardship is crucial to curbing foreclosures. Republicans claim that such loans only encourage indebtedness. The claim is overwrought because the loans are not onerous; they are no-interest and are forgiven in installments over five years for homeowners who remain in the home. A short-term and manageable increase in debt is a prudent way to save one's home.
F.H.A. SHORT REFINANCE OPTION Many of the 14 million homeowners who are ''underwater'' -- owe more on the mortgages than the homes are worth -- are current in their payments. But because they lack equity, they cannot refinance their loans at lower rates. The Federal Housing Administration option would facilitate the much-needed refinancings by insuring the new loans.
The program, which began last fall, got off to a slow start, mainly because of technical problems that have been resolved. Wells Fargo and GMAC/Ally recently announced pilot F.H.A. programs, and other lenders expect to be on board by midyear. Ending the program would squander an important chance to prevent foreclosures.
All of the targeted programs address serious unmet needs. If House Republicans get their way and shut these programs down, all Americans will pay the price.

HEADLINE: With a Change in Top Aides, The West Wing Quiets Down

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Rahm Emanuel was the White House chief of staff, decisions about what President Obama would say in the short address he delivers on the radio and Internet each Saturday changed so often that speechwriters would wait until Friday to write.
But since William M. Daley took over two months ago, and David Plouffe succeeded David Axelrod as communications chief, the decision is made early -- and it sticks.
The new team that Mr. Obama has assembled to run the White House is just starting to make its mark. But together Mr. Daley and Mr. Plouffe are bringing a new order and a different management style for different times, say people within the West Wing and others who deal with them. The White House is more disciplined and less personality-driven, more focused on long-term strategic goals and less consumed by the daily messaging skirmishes with Republicans -- even when that means absorbing hits and pulling punches. 
Unlike Mr. Emanuel, the idea-a-minute dynamo who would dart from floor to floor trying to control matters mundane and major, Mr. Daley, a seasoned former executive and a commerce secretary in the Clinton administration, has streamlined the operation and is more likely to keep to his office door closed and to delegate to subordinates. The big matters, however, demand his full attention. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama directed Mr. Daley to help negotiate a deal on spending cuts with Republicans on Capitol Hill.
''Rahm very much needed to do it all,'' Mr. Daley told a group of reporters last month. ''And I don't have that need.''
Mr. Plouffe likewise is less available to reporters and party officials and keeps his office television turned off -- to tune out the daily distractions of cable TV's political play by play. Where Mr. Axelrod was an unabashedly sentimental true believer in the Obama brand, Mr. Plouffe, who managed Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign, is a stoic, by-the-numbers master of organization.
Mr. Daley and Mr. Plouffe declined to be interviewed on the record, in contrast to their accessible and often-profiled predecessors. White House aides and outsiders who work with them asked not to be quoted by name in discussing how the new team is affecting the administration's inner workings. And most said they did not want to imply criticism of Mr. Emanuel or Mr. Axelrod; the White House makeover, they emphasized, reflects a response to factors beyond personalities.
With two years of experience, Mr. Obama and his aides had ideas about how to do things differently. The president's agenda is smaller; initially, his need to fulfill ambitious campaign promises and respond to the economic crisis demanded the tactical and legislative savvy that Mr. Emanuel had as a former member of Congress and senior adviser in the Clinton White House.
And Mr. Obama faces a new power dynamic: instead of leading an all-Democratic government, he heads a divided one in which neither he nor the Republican majority in the House can accomplish much without compromise.
''Times are different,'' Mr. Daley said last month in the round table with reporters, hosted by Bloomberg News.
Nonetheless, staff members describe a happier workplace with clearer lines of authority and less fear of being chided by the often brusque Mr. Emanuel. Responsibility for communications and messaging has been consolidated. Cabinet members who were often overlooked in the past say they are more in the loop. With Mr. Daley taking the lead, there is more outreach to Republicans and business groups.
And the overhaul of the West Wing continues. On Wednesday, administration officials said they were doing away with the White House health care office as well as the coordinator for energy and climate change policy -- the energy czar job that had been held by Carol M. Browner until her recent resignation -- with responsibility for those issues now going to the Domestic Policy Council.
Yet aides also said some energy and dynamism departed with Mr. Emanuel, and much of the idealistic passion of the 2008 campaign left with Mr. Axelrod and some of the other Obama veterans, including the press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who was replaced by Jay Carney, formerly the spokesman for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and before that a reporter for Time.
Nowhere have the changes been more evident than in the administration's early actions in what is likely to be a long-running, contentious and politically defining debate over the chronically imbalanced federal budget.
The strategic shift is clear from the design of Mr. Obama's own budget proposal -- which critics slammed as not going nearly far enough to shrink projected deficits, but which the administration intended as a bid to draw the Republicans into negotiations -- to the White House's muted reaction to the House Republicans' plans for the deepest domestic spending cuts in memory.
White House officials say the goal is to achieve a long-term victory -- by bagging a budget deal, or the credit for trying -- not to win each day's news cycle. On two successive weekends, for example, the White House passed up chances to score points against the House Republicans.
Last Saturday, Mr. Daley addressed Democratic governors who were meeting in Washington and did not even utter the word ''Republican,'' let alone throw partisan red meat by lambasting the House Republicans' proposed cuts in education, health services, border control and other programs important to financially struggling states -- a purposeful omission, officials said.
Similarly, a week earlier when the House approved those cuts by a party-line vote before dawn, the White House remained silent, though many of Mr. Obama's priorities would be slashed.
Frustrated Democratic lawmakers and interest groups have been railing to White House aides that Mr. Obama is forfeiting opportunities to draw the public's attention to what the Republicans' cuts would mean for programs popular with most voters, including the coveted independents. The aides respond that the time will come for Mr. Obama to join the attack, should Republicans press their agenda and refuse to compromise.
''One of the lessons of the last two years is that if the president weighs in all the time, it's less impactful,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, who remains as the communications director. ''But if he weighs in at a moment of his choosing when the public is paying attention, it will be more influential.''
Similarly, the White House mostly has sought to stay out of the fray in Madison, Wis., and other state capitals where Republican governors are battling public employee unions and Democratic lawmakers over collective bargaining rights. When West Wing officials discovered that the Democratic National Committee had mobilized Mr. Obama's national network to support the protests, they angrily reined in the staff at the party headquarters.
Administration officials said they saw the events beyond Washington as distractions from the optimistic ''win the future'' message that Mr. Obama introduced in his State of the Union address, in which he exhorted the country to increase spending for some programs even as it cuts others so that America can ''out-innovate and out-educate'' its global rivals.
Mr. Daley and Mr. Plouffe illustrated the administration's fealty to that message on Tuesday. Mr. Daley, as usual, spoke to the business audience, addressing via videoconference a Florida meeting of the board of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Plouffe met with the executive council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
The events were not advertised by the White House and were closed to the news media. But a White House official said the two men's message was the same: Win the future.

HEADLINE: Democrats Open Talks by Offering $6.5 Billion More in Cuts

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As they opened negotiations with Republicans over budget cuts, the White House and Congressional Democrats on Thursday offered to trim an additional $6.5 billion from current spending, a figure far short of the Republican goal of cutting agency budgets by $61 billion.
The gap between the opening Democratic bid and the cuts already approved by the new House majority illustrated the difficulty the two parties faced in reaching a compromise before the March 18 expiration of a two-week budget bill even with more participation by the White House. 
To test support for the competing plans and lay the groundwork for a compromise, officials said that Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, planned to allow debate and votes on the proposals next week to demonstrate that both parties would need to make concessions in any agreement on financing the government through Sept. 30.
The plan to push the spending dispute onto the Senate floor emerged after a high-level meeting presided over by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The Congressional participants -- Speaker John A. Boehner; Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader; Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader; and Mr. Reid -- had no comment after the hourlong session, leaving it to Mr. Biden, who issued a short statement.
''We had a good meeting, and the conversation will continue,'' Mr. Biden said.
Before the session, White House officials disclosed that they were willing to accept an additional $6.5 billion in cuts, on top of $4 billion in reductions enacted in a short-term budget bill earlier this week.
Gene Sperling, the chief White House economic adviser, said, ''We've made clear that we are willing to cut spending further if we can find common ground on cuts that we can all agree would help reduce the deficit without harming the economy in the short term or harming our long-term competitiveness.''
But even before the negotiating session began, Republicans said the new figure proposed by the White House in consultation with Congressional Democrats was inadequate, particularly given the pressure Republican leaders are under from their rank and file to not give ground from the $61 billion in cuts.
In assembling the proposed cuts, Democrats combed through the bill passed by the House looking for programs that had also been singled out by the White House or Democrats on Capitol Hill.
Among the initiatives to lose financing under the Democratic plan, officials said, are a variety of agricultural programs, Federal Emergency Management Agency grants, a Federal Bureau of Investigation construction program, a Great Lakes restoration effort and a wildfire suppression program. The Democratic plan would also reduce spending on embassy maintenance, cut $227 million from information technology efforts at the Department of Veterans Affairs and pare back some economic development efforts.
Mr. Sperling agreed in part with Republicans that cutting spending can help the economy recover by signaling that the government is getting its finances in order, even as it costs some jobs in the short term under either side's proposed level of cuts. But the White House portrayed the Republican cuts as deep enough to threaten the economy.
''There can be confidence benefits in showing that you are starting the path of getting your fiscal house in order,'' Mr. Sperling said. But cuts on the scale of the House Republicans' package, he added, would have a ''negative impact for the immediate economy'' that offsets any benefits.
In planning to bring the competing spending bills to a vote in the Senate, party leaders expect to show that neither the Democratic plan nor the Republican plan has the support to clear the Senate, forcing both sides to give ground. The Senate vote could be particularly helpful, aides said, in showing the 87 new Republican members of the House that the $61 billion in cuts cannot survive, giving the leadership leverage in pushing for a compromise that can pass.
Earlier Thursday, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said she welcomed a chance to vote on the House plan and discuss its wide-ranging cuts.
''I think the American people need to look at what's going on with my Republican friends who are in charge of the House of Representatives,'' she said. ''We all know we need to reduce the deficit, but we also know the right way to do it.''
The interim spending bill passed by the Senate and signed by the president on Wednesday extends through March 18, giving Congress and the administration two weeks to strike a deal to finance the government through Sept. 30, pass another short-term measure or see parts of the government shut down.
Representative Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican and the majority leader, said Thursday that if lawmakers were unable to reach a deal, House Republicans would continue to pursue cuts through temporary budget bills.
''Our intention is to continue to go forward reducing spending at the rate of $2 billion a week until we can see some signal from the Senate that they are serious about cutting spending,'' Mr. Cantor said.

HEADLINE: Indiana's Public Workers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''In Indiana, Clues to Future of Wisconsin Labor'' (front page, Feb. 27): 
Fiscal discipline has been a hallmark of Gov. Mitch Daniels's tenure. He eliminated state employee collective bargaining in 2005, but that's just a small part of why Indiana is in better fiscal shape than many other states.
Removal of bargaining provisions has not resulted in hundreds of layoffs as you report. It's because the governor reined in spending that Indiana has averted large-scale layoffs occurring elsewhere. Indiana has managed its employment largely through attrition and strategic hiring.
Governor Daniels froze state employee pay in 2009 and 2010 because the national recession caused the bottom to drop out of state revenues. Ninety percent of state employees earned pay increases averaging 4.2 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively, the previous two years under the governor's newly installed pay-for-performance plan.
The state has limited rising health care premiums by offering lower-cost, consumer-driven plans. Eighty-five percent of employees have opted for them. An employee with a $5,200 yearly premium made a choice to go with the Cadillac of plans.
Indiana's experience with state employee collective bargaining offers lessons, but not as framed in The Times.

HEADLINE: In the Fields, Echoes of a Boom

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
The 80 acres of rich farmland that Jeff Freking and his brother Randy bought near Le Mars, Iowa, on Monday for $10,000 an acre would seem to have nothing in common with a condo in Miami or a house in Las Vegas.
But as prices for agricultural land surge across America's grain belt, regulators are warning that a new real estate bubble may be forming -- echoing the frothy boom in home prices that saw values in Miami and Las Vegas skyrocket and then plummet.
''It just seems to be going up in leaps and bounds here,'' said Jeff Freking, who bought a similar farm, also in northwestern Iowa, for $6,000 an acre just two years ago. ''Everybody thinks it's crazy.''
The surge in prices has been dizzying throughout the Midwest, with double-digit percentage increases last year in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota and Nebraska. In parts of Iowa, prices for good farmland rose as much as 23 percent last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. 
Just a few years ago, farmers marveled as land prices began to rise in response to demand for corn to make ethanol. More recently, soaring prices for wheat, corn, soybeans and other crops have driven the increase. Corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade closed at $7.27 a bushel on Tuesday, up from $3.70 a year earlier. Soybean futures were $13.67, up from $9.52 cents on March 1 last year. Average grain prices, adjusted for inflation, are nearing the giddy levels they reached in the late 1970s, the peak of the last disastrous boom-and-bust cycle for agricultural land.
That has regulators worried.
''History has taught us that it is nearly impossible to determine how much of the farmland boom may be an unsustainable bubble driven by financial markets,'' said Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, in testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee last month.
Officials at Mr. Hoenig's bank warn that farmers face a ''huge'' risk that rising interest rates, perhaps combined with falling crop prices, could undercut land values. Farmland values could drop by a third to a half in such a situation, Mr. Hoeing testified.
Prices have risen so far so fast that ''it's getting scary,'' said Mike Green, a real estate auctioneer. He brought the hammer down last Friday on a 118-acre farm in Yetter, Iowa, that sold for $11,000 an acre, which he said was a record for farmland in Calhoun County, in western Iowa. In December, Mr. Green said, he got oohs and ahs when a parcel went for $9,300 an acre. Last fall, similar farms were selling for less than $8,000 an acre.
''It's very hard to guess what a property will sell for these days because it seems like it's been changing on a weekly basis,'' he said.
Nationwide data from the United States Department of Agriculture shows that inflation-adjusted farm prices passed their 1970s peak several years ago, but that includes land, especially on the coasts, whose price rose when it was sold for development. University and Federal Reserve Bank surveys, which give a more accurate picture of the value of land used for farming, show that current prices are approaching the top of the last boom when adjusted for inflation.
Farmland values have been pushed up by several factors. As crops like corn, wheat and soybeans bring higher prices, the land on which they are grown becomes more valuable. Low interest rates have also contributed; they draw investors seeking an alternative to low-yielding certificates of deposit and the volatile stock market as well as create an incentive for farmers to buy more land rather than invest their profits elsewhere.
''Farmland has been a favored asset class in a world where a lot of other asset classes have fallen out of favor,'' said Richard A. Brown, chief economist of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The rapid rise in agricultural land prices has raised alarms at the F.D.I.C., which insures bank deposits and monitors the industry's financial health. The agency sent a letter to lenders in December, warning them to not let high farm land values lull them into lax lending practices. Next week, the F.D.I.C. will hold a forum in Washington to discuss its concerns.
''If it were to be a bubble,'' Mr. Brown said, ''it would be in its formative stages.''
Today's farmland market has some crucial differences from the 1970s bubble and the housing boom of the last decade. In the 1970s, another period of low interest and high crop prices, farmers loaded up on debt, using their farms as collateral. In the housing bubble, many buyers were seduced by gimmicky loans, such as subprime mortgages with floating rates, that magnified risk.
Today, farmers have about one-third less debt over all than they did at the peak of the last boom, according to U.S.D.A. data.
But a big worry for regulators is that farmers will start taking out loans on property they already own, based on today's elevated values, and use it to buy more property or make other purchases. That would be similar to what farmers did 30 years ago and what homeowners did in the housing boom.
Jason R. Henderson, a vice president at the Omaha branch of the Kansas City Fed, said he had heard reports from bankers that such a pattern might be emerging.
Mr. Freking said he and his brother had made their latest purchase using all borrowed money. Their banker lent them half of the purchase price, and the rest of the money came from refinancing and consolidating loans on other property they owned, which are worth more at current land values.
He said there was some sticker shock at the price but the deal made sense because the land adjoined two other properties that the family farmed. He also got an attractive fixed interest rate of about 5 percent, although the loan must be paid off after eight years.
''Everybody's talking big on commodities, so hopefully this pays out,'' Mr. Freking said.
The rising prices have also brought in speculators. A survey by Iowa State University found that investors made a quarter of farm purchases in the state last year, a slight increase from 2009. ''It's been very aggressive as far as bidding action,'' said Todd Hattermann, an auctioneer who sold a farm in Paullina, Iowa, about 30 miles from Le Mars, for $9,600 an acre last week. Investors, he said, were ''running the values up. A lot of them may not be the final bidder but they're bidding all the way through.''
There is no agreement on whether a bubble is emerging.
Michael D. Duffy, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University who conducts the annual land value survey, said the market appeared fundamentally sound and that land prices were responding properly to high crop prices. ''If you've got good ground, it's worth a lot of money,'' he said.
Bruce Brock, the broker who sold the farm to the Freking brothers, exudes an optimism that would sound familiar to anyone who bought a home in 2006. ''If you look from the beginning of farming in the United States to now, the long-term trend has been up,'' he said. ''There will be market fluctuations where it will go down. But in 10 years, I won't be surprised if our $10,000 land is $20,000.''

HEADLINE: A 3-Week World Tour for (but Not Only) Kids

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
Does your wish list for the weekend include seeing a new foreign movie in a real theater? And are you finding your choices limited -- that you're a victim of what A.O. Scott of The New York Times recently called ''the peculiar and growing irrelevance of world cinema in American movie culture''?
Your luck will be better if you live in New York, of course. And for the next three weeks, you'll be especially lucky if you're a New Yorker between the ages of 6 and 16 -- or if you're a parent pressed into chaperone duty.
Over that period the New York International Children's Film Festival will present 12 feature films, 11 of them foreign, at theaters around Manhattan. That's a high percentage even by festival standards. (And the word ''International'' in the title doesn't mean that American films weren't welcome; the organizers are happy to have Disney's ''Mars Needs Moms'' for their opening gala on Friday night.) 
The emphasis on imports isn't confined to this festival, a major operation that holds screenings year round and has its own film-distribution arm. The six features last month at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's smaller BAMkids Film Festival were all foreign; in fact, the last time the BAMkids program included a full-length American film was 2008.
This preponderance of foreign fare can be explained partly by good intentions: a desire to expose children to the art and life of other cultures. But it's also a question of availability: American films aimed at younger audiences are hard for the festivals to come by.
It's not that Hollywood isn't making them. Of the top 10 films at the American box office last year, a majority were aimed at children or teenagers: four animated movies, ''The Karate Kid'' and the latest Harry Potter and ''Twilight'' installments. Throw in the slightly older-skewing ''Iron Man 2'' and ''Alice in Wonderland,'' and 9 out of the 10 would have been good choices for a young person's film festival.
And that's exactly the problem.
''Anything under $250 million at the box office for a kids' film is an utter failure,'' said Eric Beckman, who founded the New York International Children's Film Festival with his wife, Emily Shapiro, in 1997. A result, he added, is that children's festivals find it hard to get American films, because for producers and distributors, ''one bad review, and you lost your corporation a hundred million dollars.''
Some of those films can be of high quality -- Mr. Beckman professed a great appreciation of ''Toy Story 3'' -- but the emphasis for their makers will always be on safety.
''You're mass marketing to a huge audience,'' he said, ''and it's kind of making chicken fingers for kids, basically. You're making something that's going to attract the widest taste and offend nobody.''
Meanwhile, in European and Asian countries where the domestic markets are smaller -- and where there is, perhaps, a stronger tradition of serious art being directed at both adults and children -- the economics allow for a greater variety in mainstream filmmaking.
''If you're creating films for the French market,'' Mr. Beckman said, ''you can make a film for $10 million that's a beautiful animated film.''
As long as it's not computer-animated, anyway. That is the case with Alain Gagnol and Jean-Loup Felicioli's film ''A Cat in Paris,'' a gorgeous hand-drawn feature that is one of the highlights of this festival. A caper featuring a cat, a cat burglar and a girl whose mother is a revenge-obsessed cop, it's like an animated children's version of an Alfred Hitchcock or Roman Polanski thriller set on the rooftops of Paris.
''A Cat in Paris,'' recommended for ages 6 and older, is simultaneously more childlike -- in its straightforward storytelling and its lack of adult-pacifying pop culture jokiness -- and more nerve-racking than its big-budget American counterparts. Without being too frightening, it projects a sense of danger, both physical and emotional, that is more engaging than the high-pitched thrills of the domestic films.
The same can be said of two very different Japanese films in the festival. Yasuhiro Yoshiura's ''Time of Eve,'' animated in a plain style reminiscent of the ''Ghost in the Shell'' television series, is a kind of after-school ''Blade Runner.'' Like that 1982 film, it examines the possibility of humans' falling in love with androids, and vice versa, while using robots as a stand-in for persecuted, voiceless human minorities, in this case Japanese teenagers.
Set largely in an underground cafe where humans and robots can meet on equal and anonymous terms, it's a meditation on technology and alienation, as well as a mystery story in which the two young heroes try to determine which of their new friends are flesh and which are metal. It explores its themes without the violence or sex of ''Blade Runner,'' though the scanty attire of one of the female androids may be a shock to American parents. (The festival recommends it for ages 11 and older.)
''Time of Eve,'' which has its talky, pedestrian stretches, is probably best for science-fiction and anime fans. But anyone, of any age, can enjoy Koji Masunari's ''Welcome to the Space Show,'' an ambitious and large-scale film (at two and a quarter hours) that begins as a typical Japanese summer-in-the-country story and suddenly turns into an outer space adventure.
A group of five plucky children out of an Enid Blyton book find themselves transported first to the dark side of the moon -- which turns out to be an interstellar resort, complete with immigration lines -- and then even farther, all because a drug prized everywhere in the universe is thought to grow on Earth. (It bears a strong family resemblance to a common Japanese condiment.)
Their travels are rendered in animation that echoes, and mingles, the styles of two great filmmakers: the organic forms recall Hayao Miyazaki, while the diversity and abundance of aliens recall the intricate visual overload of Satoshi Kon. Sometimes the movie looks like a toy shop, sometimes like an overflowing candy store, but it never looks like chicken fingers.
The New York International Children's Film Festival plays at various theaters in Manhattan from Friday through March 27; information and tickets at gkids.com.

HEADLINE: Shoppers Stepped Out Last Month, Lifting Sales

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Stephanie Clifford contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Most of the nation's retailers on Thursday reported improved sales in February, topping expectations in a month hit hard by winter weather and sharply higher gasoline prices.
The Thomson Reuters overall index that tracks sales of retail stores open at least a year rose 4.2 percent in February.
''It doesn't meant there are no headwinds, but I think this is moving in the right direction,'' said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, which had forecast a 3.7 percent rise last month in sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial indicator called same-store sales. 
''Sales might have been even better had we not seen this precipitous rise in gas prices,'' Mr. Perkins said. ''It is certainly on consumers' minds. People are really starting to notice $3.50 a gallon in some parts of the country. If it is sustainable and goes to $4, it is really going to have an effect.''
Weather was also a factor. Mr. Perkins said winter weather might have dampened shopping in the early part of the month but there was a progressive pickup in sales from the middle of the month because of pent-up demand, shopping for Valentine's Day and during the Presidents' Day holiday.
Within the various sectors of the index, apparel retailers recorded a 5.6 percent increase, but that number was skewed somewhat because it did not include Gap, which recorded a decline. The department store index was up 5.3 percent and the index for discount stores was up 4.9 percent.
Among the department stores, Saks was up 15.3 percent, while Nordstrom's sales rose 7.3 percent, with jewelry, dresses and women's shoes among the top-performing categories. Sales were strongest in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, Nordstrom's said. J.C. Penney rose 6.4 percent, and Kohl'shad a 5 percent gain. All of those results topped expectations.
Limited Brands, which owns Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works, had a 12 percent gain, which also topped forecasts.
Among discount retailers, same-store sales at the Costco Wholesale Corporationwere up 8 percent while at the Target Corporation they rose 1.8 percent.
The retail sector has been struggling as rising commodity costs and stubborn unemployment have held back the discretionary spending of consumers, and retailers have responded in recent months with discounting and promotions.
Economists say that an oil price rise because of recent turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa could hit consumers if it is sustained, a point reinforced earlier this week by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in testimony on Capitol Hill. Retail gasoline prices have risen more than 20 cents in the last week.
A dichotomy for the month was highlighted by the results of Stage Stores, where same-store sales declined 7.2 percent in February, the largest fall of the 25 retailers in the Reuters survey.
But Andy Hall, president and chief executive of Stage Stores, noted the difference between the first of the month and the end of the month in a web cast.
''We were pleased with the way the business performed in the second half of the month, with comparable-store sales up approximately 10 percent,'' Mr. Hall said. ''Unfortunately, this was not enough to offset the weakness we experienced in the first half of February, as a result of extreme weather conditions in the center of the country, most notably Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri, which represent close to 51 percent of our comparable-store sales base.''
Dillard's slipped 1 percent, saying sales in the home and furniture category and the men's category were significantly below trend during the four-week period ended Feb. 26.
Among retailers aimed at teenagers, Zumiez had a 12.8 percent gain, driven by sales in footwear and accessories but held back by boys' apparel, the company said in a webcast.
''Teen retailers were especially strong, which is a reflection of consumers responding to new spring fashion,'' said Randal J. Konik, a managing director for Jefferies & Company.
But he said he was surprised that the Old Navy unit of Gap had a 4 percent decline.
''It could be early signals of consumer hesitancy responding as a result of these higher oil and gas prices that have been in the headlines,'' Mr. Konik said.
Gap's comparable same-store sales fell 3 percent, including online sales, but net sales were down 2 percent. Mark Webb, the vice president for investor relations, said in a recorded call that sales were strongest in the fourth week of the month and weakest in the first. He said the company was ''not pleased'' with the result, but added: ''It is a relatively small month and we remain focused on our full-year goals.''

HEADLINE: New Round of Stress Tests Coming for Europe's Banks

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
PARIS -- The European Union's banking regulator said on Thursday that it would start a new health check of banks on Friday and would publish the results in June. It also announced the appointment of its first chief.
The tests will be conducted on a ''large number'' of European banks and ''will take several months to run,'' the European Banking Authority said in a statement. 
Such stress tests, measuring banks' ability to withstand economic shocks, have been carried out twice since the financial crisis struck, but failed to win investor confidence. Since the last round, published in July, further balance sheet problems have emerged, notably at Spanish and Irish lenders.
The tests this year will be run against two hypothetical economic situations: a ''baseline'' and an ''adverse'' macroeconomic case to assess the solvency of the banks involved. The adverse case, designed by the European Central Bank, will incorporate a significant deviation from the baseline forecasts and country-specific shocks on real estate prices, interest rates and sovereign debt prices.
The banking authority said it would provide banks with details by the end of this week, and would then invite feedback. The regulator plans to publish the macroeconomic assumptions in full, alongside the sample of banks involved, on March 18. It then expects to provide more details on the principles of the methodology in April.
The regulator said it was still discussing with governments ''remedial backstop measures that member states will put in place to address any weaknesses that the stress test may reveal.''
European officials are eager to avoid problems that were made in the exercise last year. ''We need to improve the overall credibility of the process, and that includes communication, range, scope, a combination of bottom-up, top-down quality control,'' France's economy minister, Christine Lagarde, said recently.
In parallel, European supervisors are conducting detailed examinations of each bank's liquid assets, or its reserves of readily available assets and cash that can be used to pay off liabilities at a given time.
But the results of these liquidity tests will not be published because they contain proprietary data and because they are extremely difficult to interpret. They change from day to day and are hard to harmonize given the range of accounting standards and balance sheet structures across the region.
In a separate operation, the International Monetary Fund is assessing the financial sector this year in several European countries, including Germany and Britain. These assessments will also provide a detailed analysis of the health of a country's banks.
And this month, the Federal Reserve plans to let American banks know how they did on its most recent round of stress tests. The Fed gave the banks one economic situation -- a recession -- to test their books against.
Regardless of this heightened global activity, there are still broad concerns that complex and potentially damaging trading activities might increasingly migrate away from traditional banks, as regulation steps up, toward what is called the shadow banking system, a loose term for firms or operations that specialize in trading and often operate offshore.
The European Banking Authority also said that a Hungarian regulator, Adam Farkas, had been selected as its first executive director. He will be in charge of the day-to-day operations.
Mr. Farkas recently served as chairman of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority and has held senior positions at private banks. The appointment will go to the European Parliament for consideration.

HEADLINE: Jobless Benefit Filings Fall to a Nearly 3-Year Low

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people requesting unemployment benefits fell last week for the third time in four weeks and reached the lowest level in nearly three years, a government report said Thursday. 
The Labor Department said applications for unemployment benefits fell by 20,000, to a seasonally adjusted 368,000, the lowest level since late May 2008.
The four-week average for applications, a less volatile figure, fell last week to 388,500. That was the lowest level since July 2008, the last time the four-week average was below 400,000.
Economists say applications that remain consistently below 375,000 tend to signal declines in the unemployment rate. Applications for benefits peaked during the recession at 651,000.
The downward trend suggests that companies are easing the pace of layoffs as the economy gains momentum. During the recession, companies slashed work forces, cut or froze workers' pay and took other aggressive steps to reduce costs.
In a second economic report on Thursday, the Labor Department said that productivity grew in the final quarter of 2010 at the fastest rate in nine months. Economists had expected a significant slowdown in growth in 2011.
Productivity grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter while labor costs fell at an annual rate of 0.6 percent. Both figures were unchanged from a preliminary report a month ago.
For the year, productivity grew 3.9 percent, the biggest increase in eight years. However, economists say they believe productivity may grow at just half that rate in 2011 as companies reach the limit on the amount of output they can squeeze out of their workers and start hiring more employees.
The service sector grew in February at the fastest rate in more than five years, according to the Institute for Supply Management. It marked the sixth straight monthly increase. The sector covers a broad range of industries including retail, health care and financial services.
A survey of top forecasters from the National Association for Business Economics this week predicted that productivity would advance 2.1 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2012. While those gains would be in line with the growth trend over the last three decades, it would represent a significant slowdown after a surge over the last two years.
The 3.9 percent jump in productivity in 2010 followed a 3.7 percent rise in 2009. Both figures were the highest since productivity rose 4.6 percent in 2002, the largest increase in a half century.
Normally, a slowdown in productivity would be considered bad for the economy. But the two-year surge came at the expense of many workers. Companies shed eight million jobs during the recession and the economy needs job growth now, even at the expense of worker productivity, economists say.
The 2.6 percent rise in productivity in the fourth quarter was the best quarterly showing since an increase of 4.6 percent in the first three months of 2010.
The 0.6 percent drop in unit labor costs was the first quarterly decline since labor costs fell at a 4.6 percent rate in the first quarter of 2010. For the year, unit labor costs declined 1.5 percent after having fallen 1.6 percent in 2009.

HEADLINE: Been Back To the Old Neighborhood?

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
Don't make the mistake of thinking you understand Margaret Walsh from the get-go, because she's not an easy gal to get a fix on. Not at first, anyway.
Embodied with an ideal balance of expertise and empathy by Frances McDormand, Margie (as her friends call her, using a hard ''g'') is the not-quite heroine of David Lindsay-Abaire's ''Good People,'' the very fine new play that opened Thursday night at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater. And discovering how Margie operates -- and where she's coming from -- is one of the more subtly surprising treats of this theater season.
Where Margie comes from is, on one level, a no-brainer. She's from South Boston, or Southie, and her most basic notions of herself are tied up in her identification with that neighborhood. She was born there, and the odds are she'll die there, never having escaped its particular culture of poverty and loyalty. Why this has to be is the gentle mystery that propels ''Good People,'' a Manhattan Theater Club production that also stars Tate Donovan and is directed with a skillfully slow hand by Daniel Sullivan. Other people escape from Southie, including a guy Margie dated in high school. Why can't she? 
For whatever reasons, the seedier milieus of Boston have of late become favorite haunts for popular crime novelists and filmmakers like Dennis Lehane (''Mystic River'') and Ben Affleck (''The Town''), a fashionable place to uncover dark secrets on mean streets. Steeped in mouthy Southie lingo and hard-knocks sociology, ''Good People'' has a few secrets of its own, but their revelations are unlikely to startle you. In this play character really is fate. And when you look back, everyone has behaved exactly in character, without any plot-bending, credibility-stretching manipulations on the part of its author.
Such integrity is less common than you might think in theater. How often do you leave a play thinking, ''There's no way she would have done that,'' or ''He wouldn't talk like that''? But as in his previous Broadway drama, the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Rabbit Hole'' (2006), Mr. Lindsay-Abaire (who grew up in South Boston) is scrupulous here about presenting people who are consistent even in their inconsistencies.
You get the feeling that this writer -- who made his name with fantasy-tinged, diabolically whimsical works like ''Fuddy Meers'' and ''Kimberly Akimbo'' -- feels a special obligation not to cheat or take shortcuts when working in naturalism. This means not only that ''Good People'' refuses to shy from the cliches that its characters would normally use, but also that there is little that's dramatically flashy or high impact.
True, Margie has been given a couple of winningly foul-mouthed, bingo-playing eccentric cronies (deliciously portrayed by Estelle Parsons and Becky Ann Baker). But the production -- designed with unobtrusively heightened, class-defining detail by John Lee Beatty (sets) and David Zinn (costumes) -- is achingly aware that what doesn't happen in people's lives counts for as much, if not more, than what does.
There's not a moment when Ms. McDormand is onstage that you don't feel Margie is assessing the absences in her existence as a single, working mother of a grown-up daughter with a child's mind. This is particularly true once she makes contact with Mike Dillon (Mr. Donovan, excellent), a guy she dated toward the end of high school (but hasn't seen in 30 years), who is now a successful fertility doctor.
Margie's reason for looking up Mike is an all-too familiar one in the current economy. She needs a job. In the play's first scene -- which lays the groundwork for everything that follows in ways you don't fully appreciate at the time -- Margie is fired by her boss, Stevie (Patrick Carroll), for excessive tardiness.
Margie knew Stevie when he was a boy, she knew his mother; she knows whom he's dating now and what people say about him behind his back. She is not above using this knowledge, easily accumulated and stored up in an insular neighborhood like Southie, for emotional blackmail. The thing about Margie, though, is that while she starts off tough, she's not so good on follow-through. And there comes a very specific moment -- it happens when Ms. McDormand bends her knees just a bit, as if the breath has gone out of her -- that you realize that not only is Margie conceding defeat here but also that she always knew she was going to.
This central paradox in Margie's character -- what might be described as a feisty defeatism -- is beautifully conveyed by Ms. McDormand, who won an Oscar for playing a far more assured figure, a tenacious Minnesota police officer in the 1996 film ''Fargo.'' In dealing with others, Margie is combative, sly, nasty and tricky. But in the very same breath she is doubtful, reluctant and self-sabotagingly kind.
This combination of elements leads Mike to describe Margie as a master of passive aggression when she shows up, uninvited, at his blandly expensive-looking office.
Certainly Margie knows what buttons to push (including by using the term ''lace-curtain Irish'') to trigger waves of guilt in her ex-boyfriend, who has lost nearly all contact with the old neighborhood. She wrangles an invitation to a party at Mike's home that weekend, given by his wife, Kate (Renee Elise Goldsberry in a spot-on performance as a bourgeois princess).
Mike's home is the setting for most of the second act, and I don't want to tell you too much about what happens there. If you're a New York theater addict, you probably know that Ms. Goldsberry (who appeared in the musical ''The Color Purple'') is African-American. But just because ''Good People'' is about South Boston, a site notorious for racial strife, doesn't mean that Mr. Lindsay-Abaire is going to set a match to working-class prejudices. He's more clever than that. He plays the race card here only to suggest that for his purposes it's irrelevant.
The social dichotomy being explored isn't a matter of black and white. It's who does and doesn't escape from where he or she comes from. Perversely, it seems, it's the person with the thickest skin who has the best chances of rising above. Mr. Donovan makes Mike an artful study in willed amnesia, and the pain that surprises him when Margie summons the ghosts of their shared past is all the more palpable by not being directly expressed.
In the arguments that erupt throughout ''Good People'' -- and they range from comradely sniping to the tossing of whatnots (a googly-eyed rabbit toy, as it happens) -- characters often accuse one another of being too mean or too nice, too soft or too hard. They're right on all counts.
Whether it's Ms. Parsons's amiably avaricious landlady or Ms. Goldsberry's reflexively compassionate suburbanite, there's nothing pure about the goodness or badness of the folks who inhabit this play. This makes them among the most fully human residents of Broadway these days.

HEADLINE: Goldman's Blankfein a Possible Witness in Insider Trial

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
Mark Wilson/Getty ImagesLloyd C. Blankfein
The chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, has emerged as a possible witness in the insider trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam. 
Mr. Blankfein has agreed to testify for the government in the trial of Mr. Rajaratnam, a founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund, according to a person with direct knowledge of the case who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Rajaratnam's trial is scheduled to start on Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan.
Federal prosecutors could call Mr. Blankfein as a witness to discuss his conversations with Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman director who on Tuesday was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of passing along confidential information about the bank to Mr. Rajaratnam.
There is, however, no guarantee that Mr. Blankfein will be called.
The government has numerous cooperating witnesses and scores of wiretapped conversations that it has said it plans to use against Mr. Rajaratnam.
But should Mr. Blankfein take the witness stand, it would add to the already intense attention surrounding the high-profile trial.
Mr. Rajaratnam is the central figure in the government's vast investigation into insider trading on Wall Street. Federal authorities arrested Mr. Rajaratnam in October 2009 and charged him with securities fraud and conspiracy.
Mr. Blankfein, 56 years old, may not be the only Goldman executive to testify.
In a letter filed with the court on Thursday, John Dowd, a lawyer for Mr. Rajaratnam, said that he was likely to call executives from Goldman and Procter & Gamble, where Mr. Gupta is a former director. The government also accused him of providing Mr. Rajaratnam with illegal tips about P.&G.
''The government's witness list includes numerous Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble representatives who will presumably provide testimony on the very issues in the S.E.C lawsuit,'' the letter says.
Were Mr. Blankfein to testify, he would likely discuss his conversations with Mr. Gupta that are at the center of the S.E.C.'s civil action against Mr. Gupta.
In one instance, the S.E.C. claims that in Mr. Gupta discussed with Mr. Rajaratnam confidential information about Goldman's quarterly earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2008. After a board call during which Mr. Blankfein and David Viniar, the chief financial officer, previewed the bank's awful quarter for the directors, Mr. Gupta is said to have hung up the phone and called Mr. Rajartnam 23 seconds later.
The next morning, the S.E.C. says, Galleon funds sold their Goldman holdings, avoiding losses of more than $3 million.
Among the other Goldman tips that the S.E.C. says Mr. Gupta provided to Mr. Rajaratnam was word that Warren E. Buffett would invest $5 billion in the bank in September 2008 as the financial crisis raged.
Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Mr. Gupta, has said that the S.E.C. accusations are ''totally baseless'' and that his client didn't trade in either Goldman or P.&G. and didn't share in any profits with Mr. Rajaratnam.
The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Mr. Blankfein may be called as a witness.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Can McKinsey Keep a Secret?

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN, ROB COX and CHRISTOPHER HUGHES

 BODY:
Can clients still trust the mighty McKinsey & Company? That's something they should be asking after the Securities and Exchange Commission, as part of its insider trading crackdown, accused Rajat K. Gupta, the elite consulting firm's former chief, of betraying Goldman Sachs's secrets.
The quality of the firm's advice has always been fair game, though not often publicly. Jeffrey R. Immelt, the General Electric chief executive, told The New York Times in December that the consulting firm offered costly advice in 2007, when it played down the risks of a financial crisis. But being wrong is a minor sin, and it's not much of a fig leaf for Mr. Immelt, either. 
The charges against Mr. Gupta are potentially much more damaging. The S.E.C. says that he leaked inside information on Goldman and Procter & Gamble, whose boards he sat on, to the Galleon Group hedge fund. The fund, founded by the indicted Raj Rajaratnam, reaped tens of millions of dollars on the tips, according to the S.E.C. Mr. Gupta's lawyer denies the claims.
Mr. Gupta worked at McKinsey for 34 years until 2007, and the association continued thereafter. He was the firm's managing director, equivalent to its chief executive, from 1993 to 2003. It seems fair to ask to what extent he became a product of the firm, or vice versa. Putting a generous spin on the S.E.C.'s detailed allegations, he enjoyed gossiping with his peers about what he was involved in -- even confidential matters.
For McKinsey clients, that's potentially even more alarming than the case of Anil Kumar, a former director of the firm, who pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy in January last year in the same broad insider trading inquiry being conducted by United States authorities. He admitted accepting $1.75 million to reveal information about clients to Mr. Rajaratnam and to knowing that the information was being used for trading.
McKinsey's reputation rests on its ability to keep secrets. Consulting firms, unlike investment banks, don't provide access to financial markets. All they offer is counsel, which relies partly upon confidences revealed by their clients. According to McKinsey's Web site, ''Our clients should never doubt that we will treat any information they give us with absolute discretion.'' The allegations against Mr. Gupta make it hard for clients not to wonder.
Valuing Glencore
It feels like 2007 again over at Glencore in Switzerland. The commodities trader's earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.26 billion, just 3 percent below the quarterly average in the boom of four years ago. It looks auspicious for this year's likely initial public offering. But the impressive financial performance doesn't guarantee that Glencore can get a flotation at the $60 billion equity valuation being mooted in the market.
Glencore's recent performance has tracked global turbulence. Earnings for 2009 were nearly 50 percent below their 2007 peak of $5.2 billion. They climbed part of the way back last year. Assume Glencore matches its peak performance this year, and a reasonable-sounding earnings multiple of 12 would see it trade at the kind of value being discussed.
But Glencore defies simplistic analysis. Earnings are distorted by heavy investment in projects yet to come on stream. Moreover the firm is a disparate mix. A sizable trading operation sits alongside listed and unlisted natural resource assets. Investors may prefer to value it on a sum-of-the-parts basis, but arriving at a reliable valuation for the unquoted businesses based on the present disclosures is a challenge.
There are three issues the group needs to address. First, it claims that its strategic and unlisted investments add value to its trading activities. Unless it can demonstrate how, investors may apply a chunky discount to any valuation.
Then, there are governance issues. Glencore needs a robust chairman and independent directors who live up to the billing. Led by Ivan Glasenberg, its chief executive and lead shareholder, the firm has hundreds of wealthy and highly driven traders operating in far-flung places. Maintaining a disciplined culture will be critical to investor confidence.
Glencore needs to demonstrate that an I.P.O. wouldn't simply be giving its traders an exit at a top-of-the-cycle valuation. The firm could restrict its directors from selling stock for four years or more, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.
It's not clear, though, how widely such restrictions would apply. Without lockups on those who are generating the current financial performance, investors will be wary of assuming it can continue.

HEADLINE: As Economic Pinch Eases, Concerns Remain for Dining Chains

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
FOR months, restaurant chains have felt better about business as customers who cut back to save money began eating out again. Now, as the spring marketing season approaches, they are concerned about what rising gasoline prices may do to their nascent recovery.
''It can't be good,'' said Dick Lynch, chief marketing officer at Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in Atlanta, part of AFC Enterprises, because ''there tends to be a correlation between gasoline prices and Q.S.R. sales'' -- Q.S.R. being the abbreviation for quick-service restaurants. 
''We are taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''We haven't seen an impact yet, but we're watching closely.''
Popeyes is promoting meal deals like a Butterfly Shrimp Tackle Box, priced at $4.99, which an actress in a television commercial, portraying an employee, compares with the seafood served by unnamed competitors: ''a squished-together fish patty in a bun.''
''Uh-uh,'' the character, named Annie, declares. ''Not in my kitchen.'' The campaign is created by GSD&M in Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group.
The fact that another chain, International Dairy Queen, is owned by the billionaire Warren E. Buffett through his company, Berkshire Hathaway, does not exempt Dairy Queen or its agency from fretting, too.
''The economy always plays a huge role'' in Dairy Queen's results, said Tor Myhren, president and chief creative officer at Grey New York, part of the Grey Group unit of WPP. Higher gasoline prices can hurt the chain because it has fewer restaurants than larger competitors, he said.
''If it's a touch harder to get to,'' Mr. Myhren asks, ''how do we separate DQ from the more convenient competitors?'' The answer, he said, can be found in a campaign that Grey New York plans to introduce on Monday. The campaign presents Dairy Queen as ''crave-worthy,'' explaining, ''When you want it, you just want it, and you're willing to go a little farther to get it.''
The campaign carries the theme ''So good it's riDQulous'' (pronounced ree-DEEK-u-luss), which tells consumers that ''if you're going to go out to treat yourself, this is the place to go,'' Mr. Myhren said, ''because at DQ, good isn't good enough.'' The ads use exaggerated humor to promote Dairy Queen menu items like Blizzard desserts, cheeseburgers and Easter cakes.
Arby's, part of the Wendy's/Arby's Group, introduced a campaign this week by BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom. The ads praise the chain's menu with the theme ''It's good mood food.''
''We feel our customers are coming back, spending a little bit more on their dining choices, so we'd like to lead with an optimistic message,'' said Robert Kraut, senior vice president for advertising and marketing communications at Arby's in Atlanta.
''We're in the food business, but we're also in the service business,'' he added. ''People want to be put in a good mood.'' To underline that, employees will get ''Good mood food cards,'' Mr. Kraut said, $5 gift cards they can give customers in ''random acts of good mood-ness.''
The campaign includes commercials, content on the Arby's Web site (arbys.com) and a presence in social media like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
There will also be an Arby's commercial on an episode of ''Jimmy Kimmel Live,'' to be delivered by Mr. Kimmel, offering a $1 coupon for a new Angus Three Cheese and Bacon sandwich to anyone who ''likes'' Arby's on Facebook.
Long John Silver's, a unit of Yum Brands, is also doing something unusual on television, teaming up with the Country Music Television cable channel, owned by Viacom, for a commercial styled like a music video. The commercial will also run on the CMT Web site (cmt.com) and the channel's Facebook page.
The commercial, which is to start appearing on Friday, features a country band called the Tail Spinners, which was created for the sponsorship. ''I don't think this band would ever win a Grammy,'' Anthony Barton, senior vice president for integrated marketing at CMT, said wryly.
The band members will also appear on shows like ''CMT Top 20 Countdown'' and ''Southern Fried Flicks,'' Mr. Barton said, and interact with a character who will portray their manager. Viewers may see the manager doing things like demanding backstage perks for his clients.
Long John Silver's ''is not a huge brand, so we've got to be scrappy and think differently,'' said Regina Lithen, senior vice president and partner at Empower MediaMarketing in Cincinnati, the agency that developed the sponsorship.
''We do have some concerns about gas prices,'' Ms. Lithen said, ''but our customer lives in close proximity to a Long John Silver's'' and ads play up that its menu fare is affordable.
The sponsorship with CMT is in addition to a campaign that Long John Silver's introduced last month by its creative agency, Northlich, also in Cincinnati. That campaign carries the theme ''We speak fish.'' It promotes menu items like the Seafood Feast, priced at $5.99.
Another restaurant chain with offbeat new ads is Chipotle Mexican Grill, with a campaign that spoofs ''limited time only'' sales. The Chipotle ads, created internally, assure customers that its ingredients are available for an ''unlimited time only.''
And a Canadian eatery, Swiss Chalet, is sponsoring a Rotisserie Channel on the Rogers Cable system, offering viewers a look, 24 hours a day, at chickens spinning on spits. It is accompanied by menu discount codes.
The campaign, which also includes the chain's Web site (swisschalet.com) and Facebook page, was created by BBDO Toronto and the Toronto office of MEC, part of the GroupM division of WPP.

HEADLINE: Europe's Bank Signals It May Raise Interest Rates to Tamp Down Inflation

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
The European Central Bank signaled Thursday that it could raise interest rates as soon as next month in response to intensifying inflationary pressures. Such a move would be likely to lead soon to higher borrowing costs for homeowners and businesses.
An interest rate increase would be the first by a top central bank to prevent the recent effects of higher oil and food prices from spreading into the broader economy. But it could add to the troubles of countries like Ireland, Greece and Portugal and, if continued, would probably further weaken Europe's economic growth prospects this year. 
''An increase of interest rates in the next meeting is possible,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the central bank, said Thursday at a news conference in Frankfurt. The next policy meeting on setting rates is set for April 7.
If interest rates rise, private banks are likely to respond by pushing up their own mortgage and deposit account rates, crimping spending power for many consumers but benefiting savers.
Mr. Trichet emphasized, however, that such an increase was ''not certain'' and that it should not be seen as ''the start of a series of interest rate increases.''
The comments surprised most analysts, who had not expected that the bank would raise rates until later in the year. They had expected it to announce that it would scale back some of its temporary measures intended to provide added liquidity for struggling banks.
''This is about as clear a signal of a rate hike that you are going to see from a central banker,'' said Nick Kounis, head of economics at ABN Amro in Amsterdam. ''The E.C.B. is once again living up to its reputation as a single-minded inflation fighter.''
Earlier, the bank decided to leave its benchmark rate at 1 percent, the record low it has held since May 2009. Mr. Trichet said that the decision was unanimous.
The euro climbed after Mr. Trichet's comments, rising to $1.3959 late in the day in New York, from $1.3860 late Wednesday, as investors anticipated higher returns on euro zone securities relative to those in the United States, Britain and Japan, where interest rates of central banks remained below 1 percent.
The central bank has a narrow mandate focusing on inflation, unlike the Federal Reserve, which has a mission that includes the ''pursuit of maximum employment.''
The E.C.B.'s official comfort zone for inflation is just below 2 percent. Yet annual inflation in the euro zone hit 2.4 percent in February, its highest level since October 2008 and up from 2.3 percent in January, according to estimates this week from Eurostat, the European statistics agency.
Recent increases in commodity prices, notably oil -- the benchmark Brent crude futures contract has risen more than 20 percent this year -- suggest to many analysts that inflation has further to rise.
Food prices are also climbing. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations said Thursday in Rome that its food price index was up 2.2 percent last month from January, reaching the highest level in inflation-adjusted and nominal terms since the agency started monitoring prices two decades ago. Higher food prices have been a factor behind unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, which in turn has pushed oil prices higher.
Mr. Trichet said that the recent increase in inflation largely reflected commodity prices and that there had not yet been evidence of its passing through to wages. ''It is essential that the recent rise in inflation does not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term,'' he said. ''Strong vigilance is warranted with a view to containing upside risks to price stability.''
While the central bank is acting against cost pressures, there is still evidence that economic activity in the region is patchy. Eurostat confirmed this week that growth was slower than expected in the fourth quarter of 2010. Gross domestic product in the euro zone, which had 16 countries in 2010, grew 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter compared with figures in the third quarter.
The three biggest economies -- Germany, France and Italy -- expanded more slowly than expected. Some countries like Portugal and Greece are still contracting, saddled by debt and lacking competitiveness relative to their peers.
Mr. Trichet responded by saying, ''Our responsibility is for 331 million people.''
Those representing consumers and unions expressed frustration at the central bank announcement.
''The dynamics set in motion by a hike will cause problems,'' said Ronald Janssen, chief economist the European Trade Union Confederation. A rate increase appears logical for Germany, where growth is solid and unemployment is falling, he added, but not for Ireland, Spain and Greece, where consumers are struggling under the pressure of tough austerity policies, higher oil prices and low wage settlements.
''It highlights a fundamental problem for the euro zone, that monetary policy is not adequate for all its members,'' Mr. Janssen said. ''The real question that needs to be addressed is how to go toward a fiscal union. But politicians are trying to avoid it.''
Several members of the central bank's governing council have been sounding the alarm about acting quickly and decisively against inflation. One possible successor to Mr. Trichet after his retirement at the end of October -- Mario Draghi of the Bank of Italy -- has himself issued such warnings recently.
Most analysts now expect the bank to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point next month. ''Mr. Trichet seems to be suggesting that monetary tightening can be gradual in the coming months,'' Mr. Kounis of ABN Amro said. ''The message seems to be that an early start does not necessarily imply a more aggressive tightening cycle.''
Still, there is no guarantee of that. Around the turn of 2006, the central bank made similar statements of caution but then proceeded to push rates up by two percentage points over the next 18 months.

HEADLINE: Big Jump in Private Jobs Bolsters Recovery Hopes

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The economic waiting game may soon be over, as businesses signal that they are finally willing to resume widespread hiring.
In all, the nation added 192,000 jobs in February, a big jump from the 63,000 added the previous month, the Labor Department reported on Friday.
The job growth was the most in nearly a year, and the 12th consecutive month of gains by companies, which added 222,000 workers last month. It followed an unusually weak report in January, when major snowstorms across the country prompted offices and factories to close.
Taken together, the first two months of the year produced growth at about the same pace as last fall.
Economists say they are hopeful the pace will soon pick up further. 
''Economic recoveries can be like a snowball rolling down a hill, in that it takes time to get some momentum,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. ''People hesitate until they feel that the recovery's durable enough, and then they have a tendency to jump in. Maybe we're finally getting to that jumping-in moment.''
Threats to a more robust recovery remain, of course, including a surge in energy and food prices, with the possibility of disruptions in oil production in the Middle East continuing to weigh on the financial markets. State and local governments are also shedding jobs, which depressed the total for February, as they grapple with budget woes.
But for now, the improvement is notable. The unemployment rate ticked down to 8.9 percent last month, falling below 9 percent for the first time in nearly two years. This rate, which comes from a survey separate from the payroll numbers and is based on the total number of Americans who want to work, has remained stubbornly high the last year. Altogether, 13.7 million people are still out of work and actively looking.
Economists say the unemployment rate could rise temporarily in the next few months, as stronger job growth lures some discouraged workers to look for jobs again. Right now, just 64.2 percent of adults are actively involved in the work force, meaning they are either in a job or actively looking for one. That is the lowest participation rate in 25 years, an indication that many Americans are either staying home, going back to school, raising children or otherwise waiting for better conditions before applying for work.
''It's a puzzle, a genuine puzzle why that number has been stuck,'' a senior economist at Credit Suisse, Jay Feldman, said. ''I expect it to recover somewhat in the coming months as the labor market improves and more people become encouraged about their job prospects.''
Other recent economic reports -- like those on unemployment claims and manufacturing -- have pointed to stronger demand for workers. The Federal Reserve, in a survey of its 12 districts, noted on Wednesday that the labor market had improved modestly, but the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told lawmakers that ''until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established.''
The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10.1 percent in this downturn. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people working part time because they cannot find full-time jobs and those so discouraged that they have given up searching, dipped to 15.9 percent in February, from 16.1 percent in January.
Job gains appeared in nearly every industry last month. Among the biggest winners were the manufacturing, construction, and professional and business services industries. Construction payrolls bounced back from a very low level in January, when severe snowstorms hindered activity.
''In some cases it's very hard to judge how big the underlying improvement there is in this data,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight.
State and local governments, squeezed by revenue shortfalls and a reluctance to raise taxes, again laid off workers. Local governments have eliminated 377,000 jobs since September 2008, when their employment last peaked.
''There's no work out here,'' said Julio Santiago, 33, a mechanic who repaired police cars and sanitation trucks for the city of Newark before he was let go last November.
He and his wife, who has been job-hunting for two years, have canceled their children's summer camp plans, cut out cable and Internet, borrowed from friends and even given away the family dog to make ends meet.
''The only work they have is only temporary work, or one or two days a week, and I can't afford to do that,'' Mr. Santiago said. ''Plus they told me they may cut my unemployment benefits if I take those jobs, even if they know I'm only getting to work a few hours a week.''
Federal payrolls were unchanged in February, but federal employees may also be at risk of significant layoffs if Republican leaders in Congress are successful with their proposed budget cuts. Economists at Goldman Sachs and elsewhere have warned that such budget cuts could ripple through the economy and lead to layoffs in the private sector. ''I am optimistic we can get to a bipartisan budget agreement, whereby the government is on a path to staying within its means without derailing the recovery and slowing the job creation engine,'' said Austan Goolsbee, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. ''What we cut, and how, matters.''
Rising prices for energy and food also remain a risk to job growth, economists say, as they leave less money for consumers and businesses to spend on other purchases that could potentially spur hiring.
The contract for future delivery of light sweet crude oil rose to $104.42 a barrel on Friday, an increase of nearly $7 for the week, depressing the major stock indexes, which were down less than 1 percent on the day.
Many economists forecast that job growth will pick up later this year to a rate of more than 200,000 a month. While that would be a welcome development compared with the modest growth in January and the bloodletting during the recession, it still is not fast enough to recover much of the ground lost.
Since the downturn began in December 2007, the economy has shed 7.5 million jobs, or about 5.4 percent of its nonfarm payrolls. If the country adds 200,000 jobs every month, it would take more than three years to return to the employment level before the recession. And that does not take into account the fact that the working-age population has continued to grow -- meaning that if the economy were healthy, it would have more jobs today than before the recession.
While gains by industry have been relatively widespread, the benefits to workers themselves have not been as universal. Workers who have already been unemployed for months or even years, for example, have had trouble getting employers to consider them. As a result, even though those out of work a few weeks have gotten new jobs, the average duration of unemployment has climbed to the unusually high level of 37.1 weeks. Many of these long-term unemployed are older workers who are considering giving up and could permanently leave the job market.
Men and women have also been affected differently by the recovery.
While men bore the brunt of job losses in the recession, requiring more women to serve as their family breadwinners, that has since changed. In the last year the share of men with jobs has risen and the share of women with jobs has fallen. In fact, the portion of women working declined to 53.2 percent in February, the lowest share since 1988.

HEADLINE: February's Jobs Report

 BODY:
Over all, the job market did not get any worse in February, and by some measures, showed signs of new life. It would be wrong, however, to regard the latest data with anything other than extreme caution. 
Unemployment declined to 8.9 percent from 9 percent in January and from 9.7 percent a year ago. Unfortunately, the improvement over the past year is mainly because of a decline in the size of the labor force -- generally, people giving up their search for work -- a quirk in the data that masks the true level of distress.
It is all too easy to disparage ''dropouts'' as slackers. But with the average spell of unemployment at a record high of 37.1 weeks, and with nearly five unemployed workers for every available job opening, their plight is not so much a personal failing as an economic catastrophe. A weakened labor force is a sign of distress and decline, presaging a slow recovery and an ailing society.
Job growth data is similarly troubling. On net, 192,000 jobs were added in February, marking 12 straight months of private-sector job gains, for a total of 1.3 million new jobs over the past year. Even if last month's pace of job creation could be sustained, it would take nearly eight years to return to the pre-recession unemployment rate of 5 percent, set in December 2007.
In the meantime, human capital -- the basis of prosperity -- is being squandered.
Recent college graduates, for instance, are still stymied by the job market. Over the past year, unemployment among college graduates under age 25 has averaged 9.5 percent. Among all workers under 25, unemployment in February was 17.7 percent. Many young people will never recoup the work experience and income growth they have been denied by today's weak economy.
And things could get worse before they get better. The economy is threatened anew by higher oil prices, a resumed slump in house prices, budget cuts by state and local governments and, on the federal level, the Republican campaign to make deep cuts in this year's spending. Make no mistake. With the labor market slack, such cuts can only do more damage.
In the months to come, the way the nation responds to joblessness will determine the strength of the recovery. Too many politicians in Washington aren't getting that message. The budget deficit is a serious long-term problem. But, until the economy recovers, the lack of jobs is the clear and present crisis.

HEADLINE: Health Care Premiums Soar as Coverage Shrinks

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Workers at a circuit-board factory here just saw their health insurance premiums rise 20 percent. At Buddy Zaremba's print shop nearby, the increase was 37 percent. And for engineers at the Woodland Design Group, they rose 43 percent.
The new federal health care law may eventually ''bend the cost curve'' downward, as proponents argue. But for now, at many workplaces here, the rising cost of health care is prompting insurance premiums to skyrocket while coverage is shrinking.
As Congress continues to debate the new health care law, health insurance costs are still rising, particularly for small businesses. Republicans are seizing on the trend as evidence that the new law includes expensive features that are driving up premiums. But the insurance industry says premiums are rising primarily because of the underlying cost of care and a growing demand for it.
Across the country, premiums have more than doubled in the last decade, with smaller companies particularly hard hit in recent years, federal officials say. 
In New Hampshire, where the population is among the healthiest in the nation, according to various surveys, the insurance market for individuals, families and small businesses is extremely fragile. More than 90 percent of private employers in New Hampshire have fewer than 50 employees. Small and medium-size employers try to shop around for health insurance, but have few alternatives from which to choose.
This year, groups of more than 20 workers have been experiencing premium increases of around 20 percent, insurance agents say, while smaller groups are seeing increases of 40 percent to 60 percent or more.
''The rate of increase is phenomenal,'' said Jean Pierre La Tourette, owner of Flora Ventures, a florist with 11 employees in Newmarket, N.H., near Portsmouth. When he was recently notified that the monthly premium for single employees at his firm was going up by $229, or 40 percent, to $789, Mr. La Tourette said, he felt ''a combination of anger and frustration.''
Economists and state regulators say health insurance is expensive primarily because health care is expensive.
''You won't really address the cost of health insurance unless you address the cost of health care itself,'' New Hampshire's insurance commissioner, Roger A. Sevigny, said.
In a letter explaining Mr. La Tourette's new rate, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield said it resulted, in part, from ''an increase in medical trends, especially the utilization of services and the underlying cost of health care, for all small-group customers.''
William P. DeLuca III and his family own several companies, including four car dealerships and the Bank of New England, which together have 550 employees in New Hampshire and eastern Massachusetts. To obtain a better rate, Mr. DeLuca said, he switched this year to Harvard Pilgrim Health Care from Tufts Health Plan. The Tufts increase would have been 23 percent, he said, while Harvard Pilgrim's was 19 percent.
''It's out of control,'' Mr. DeLuca said. ''The cost of living is barely going up 1 or 2 percent a year. But we and our employees have to absorb these huge increases in health insurance costs.''
Some insurance industry lobbyists say the new federal health care law is driving up premiums. But Vincent Capozzi, senior vice president for sales and customer service at Harvard Pilgrim, said that only one percentage point of the increases here was attributable to the federal law, mainly its requirement for free coverage of preventive services.
Another percentage point results from new state laws requiring coverage of hearing aids and certain treatments for autism, Mr. Capozzi said. Most of the remainder, he said, reflects increases in the use and cost of medical care by small-group customers, with adjustments for demographic characteristics like age.
In many cases, insurance coverage is shrinking as deductibles are increasing and choices of hospitals are more limited. Robert I. Woodland, the president of the Woodland Design Group, said his company had experienced double-digit increases in premiums for seven years, even as benefits were whittled back. Most recently, he was notified that the rates were being increased 43 percent, so the monthly premium for a single worker would be $550, up from $384.
''Essentially, we have been paying a lot more for a lot less,'' Mr. Woodland said. ''It's outrageous. I cannot imagine charging my clients 43 percent more in a single year.''
James D. Bell Jr., the president of the EPE Corporation, which assembles electronic circuit boards at its factory here, said health insurance trends were starkly different from those of his other business expenses.
''Everywhere else I see a decrease in costs as a percentage of sales when the business grows,'' Mr. Bell said. ''We can buy raw circuit boards from hundreds of suppliers in the United States and overseas. But only two or three health plans make serious bids for our business.''
In an effort to save money last year, Mr. Zaremba's company, RAM Printing, chose a health plan that required employees to pay more of the cost. The added expense had an immediate impact.
''I took a 5 percent cut in pay, because of the economy, and I was paying more for health care at the same time,'' said Gary J. Silveira, a longtime print shop employee. ''We still owe $1,000 to our family doctor; I'm paying $100 a month. I'm three months overdue in paying physical therapists who treated my son. And I skipped a few months of blood pressure and cholesterol medications just to save money.''
Obama administration officials said several provisions of the new federal health law would help make insurance more affordable.
Insurers must publicly justify large rate increases, and they must spend at least 80 percent of premium revenue on health care. Starting in 2014, each state will have a central market where consumers and small businesses can pool their purchasing power and buy insurance. In theory, the exchange could bring more insurers into the market, increase competition and drive down prices.
In his budget address on Feb. 15, Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, said hospitals were part of the problem. Instead of using their ''excess cash'' to reduce health care costs, Mr. Lynch said, ''hospitals spend it on advertising, trying to attract market share from each other, buying physician and laboratory practices across the state, and then increasing overhead charges to patients.''
He proposed ''a moratorium on the construction of new facilities by hospitals.'' Such construction, he said, is ''driving up utilization and costs.'' But the New Hampshire Hospital Association objected, saying a moratorium would block spending on new medical equipment and health information technology needed to improve care.
Governor Lynch won a fourth two-year term in November. At the same time, control of both houses of the state legislature flipped to Republicans from Democrats, putting into question state efforts to carry out the federal health law, which promises to be a big issue in the state's 2012 Republican presidential primary.
Mr. Sevigny, the insurance commissioner, had been poised to award a $610,000 contract for work on a health insurance exchange. But he pulled back the contract, financed entirely with federal money, after Republicans raised questions.
''It would be frivolous to spend taxpayer dollars on implementing a law that could very well be thrown out'' by the courts, said William L. O'Brien, speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives.
The House Republican leader, D. J. Bettencourt, said, ''We don't want to become addicted to federal money.''
Republicans are trying to block or slow the creation of insurance exchanges in several other states as well. Delays will make it more difficult for states to meet federal deadlines, and Mr. Sevigny said it was important for state officials to understand that the federal government would itself set up an exchange in any state that did not do so.
To some people hammered by rising premiums, the federal law offers a glimmer of hope.
''It's imperative that we move forward with a plan that spreads the cost of insurance over a large population,'' said Mr. La Tourette, the florist. ''I'm just thrilled that President Obama was able to get health care passed in any form. We can improve it later. I'm terrified that it will be repealed.''

HEADLINE: Fla. Supreme Court Says Governor Can Reject Rail Funds

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
The Florida Supreme Court on Friday upheld Gov. Rick Scott's decision to reject more than $2 billion in federal funds to build a high-speed rail link between Tampa and Orlando, which had been a major part of the Obama administration's plan for a nationwide network. 
The unanimous decision came on the day the federal government had given Florida as a deadline to either accept the money or see it transferred for rail projects in other states.
Mr. Scott, a Republican elected in November, again turned down the $2.4 billion on Friday, a move that appears to have effectively killed the Tampa-to-Orlando plan.
The governor's office released a statement saying that Mr. Scott was ''gratified that the court provided a clear and unanimous decision,'' and that he was ''focused on moving forward with infrastructure projects that create long-term jobs and turn Florida's economy around.''
Mr. Scott has said that he wanted no part of the project, calling it a ''boondoggle,'' because he believed Florida would be responsible for cost overruns during construction and subsequent subsidies that might be necessary to keep it operating if the link was unable to pay for itself in terms of ridership.
Mr. Scott's decision has been opposed by both Democratic and some Republican lawmakers, who have said the high-speed link would give the state's staggering economy a boost.
And in the last several weeks, in an effort to allay Mr. Scott's concerns, the federal Department of Transportation, along with the mayors of Tampa and Orlando and other Florida political leaders, had crafted an arrangement in which the contractor hired to build the rail line would have been responsible for all of its construction and operating expenses as a way to further insulate taxpayers if something went wrong.
It was not immediately clear why Mr. Scott rejected the proposal.
After Mr. Scott's original rejection of the rail project on Feb. 16, two Florida state senators -- Arthenia Joyner, a Democrat and Thad Altman a Republican -- filed a lawsuit against the governor, maintaining that he had exceeded his constitutional authority and had violated the separation of powers under the state's Constitution.
On Friday, the Supreme Court said those claims had not been supported.
The 85-mile Tampa-to-Orlando route, on which trains would have traveled as fast as 170 miles per hour, was one of two high-speed lines approved by Congress. The other would connect San Francisco and Los Angeles at speeds up to 225 miles per hour. That project has received federal pledges of about $3 billion, though the cost has been estimated to be at least $43 billion.
The Department of Transportation will evaluate its options for making the $2.4 billion available elsewhere, according to a statement Friday. California is among the states that is likely to get a portion of Florida's rejected funds.

HEADLINE: Libya's Unrest Risks Major Economic Toll for Italy

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO; Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome and Stephen Castle from Brussels.

 BODY:
ROME --In response to the murderous tactics of Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi's militias against unarmed protesters, the United States and the European Union have announced steps to freeze the regime's assets. The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into Libya's possible crimes against humanity.
But Italy gets nearly a quarter of its crude oil and 10 percent of its natural gas from Libya, has billions of dollars in lucrative contracts with the Libyan government and receives billions more in Libyan investments, has held back on freezing any assets. Officials say they are waiting for a ''coordinated'' response on whether the measure applied to Libyan sovereign funds, a ruling it said it hoped would come as soon as next week.
With Libya in turmoil and Colonel Qaddafi clinging to power, no country has more at stake than Italy, which finds itself in its most complicated diplomatic position in decades, pulled between its commitment to NATO and human rights and its scramble to protect its investments in a country that has once again become a pariah. 
''France has Tunisia; Spain, Morocco; and Italy, Libya,'' said Emma Bonino, from the opposition Democratic Party, who sits on the Italian Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee and opposed a bilateral treaty between Italy and Libya in 2008.
Since the lifting in 2004 of a United Nations trade embargo that followed Libya's 1986 bombing of a German disco, Italy has been the European Union's top arms exporter to Libya, according to union data. Its politically influential energy company, Eni, has tens of billions of dollars invested in Libya. Italy is also Libya's largest trading partner and Italian companies are building a coastal highway and have contracts in construction, railways and fiber-optics.
Losing that would take ''an enormous economic toll,'' said Andrea Nativi, the editor in chief of the Rivista Italiana Difesa, Italy's leading defense publication.
The ties go both ways. Libya, through the Libyan Investment Authority and the Libyan Central Bank, today has a 7.6 percent stake in the bank Unicredit, and the central bank's governor, Farhat Bengdara, sits on Unicredit's board.
Libyan investors also have a 2 percent stake in the Italian aerospace and defense company Finmecchanica; a less than 2 percent stake in FIAT; a stake in an offshoot of Telecom Italia and 7.5 percent of the Turin soccer club Juventus.
Banca UBAE, a major Libyan bank that handles the country's oil and gas transactions in Europe, is headquartered in Rome.
Those ties may help explain why Mr. Berlusconi has been slow at times to condemn Colonel Qaddafi's bloody crackdown. When the conflict started last month, Mr. Berlusconi said he didn't want to ''bother'' the colonel. It was only after several days that he denounced the violence. By last weekend he said Italy no longer considered Colonel Qaddafi in control of Libya.
More significantly, last week, Italy announced that it had effectively suspended its 2008 ''Friendship Treaty'' with Libya, which Mr. Berlusconi had touted as his greatest foreign policy achievement, since Libya was now in chaos.
''Italy is astonished because the accord was supposed to save it, but whom does it talk to now?'' said Sergio Romano, a political columnist and former ambassador. ''It cannot totally disavow Qaddafi but it can't sustain him because he's become unpresentable.''
In the accord, which was negotiated by several Italian governments and passed with wide bipartisan support, Italy pledged Libya $5 billion over 20 years to amend for its colonial past there. In exchange, Libya gave Italy favorable treatment for lucrative energy, infrastructure and defense contracts. It also pledged to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from its shores -- a key domestic issue in Italy -- using means questioned by human rights groups.
But the treaty also had an unusual non-aggression clause, in which Italy pledged not to use its territory for hostile acts against Libya -- a clause requested by Libya, according to Senator Lamberto Dini, a former Italian prime minister who helped negotiate the treaty and now chairs the Italian Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee.
Analysts interpreted the treaty's suspension as a signal by Italy that it would make its bases available in the event of a military intervention. There are several United States and NATO bases in Italy, and the U.S. Sixth Fleet is based near Naples. Rome has said it would approve a no-fly zone only with the backing of NATO and the United Nations.
The countries' uneasy embrace goes back a century, beginning with Italy's colonial occupation of Libya in 1911 and continuing through the establishment of a monarchy in 1951 and Colonel Qaddafi's anti-colonial dictatorship in 1969.
When Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi briskly kissed the colonel's hand on a visit to Libya last March, the Godfather moment revealed more than the personal bond between two of the world's most colorful leaders. It reflected the decades of close ties.
In 1986, Prime Minister Bettino Craxi saved Colonel Qaddafi's life by warning him that the United States was about to bomb Tripoli in retaliation for the bombing of the German disco, Mr. Craxi's son, Bobo Craxi, said in an interview.
Perhaps the leading player in Italy's Libya policy is Eni, the Italian energy utility, which has been operating in Libya since 1959 and is widely perceived as the second pillar of Italian foreign policy after NATO, especially after Italy gave up nuclear power in the early 1980s.
Over the years, Eni ''never flaunted its power, but it exercised it,'' said Mr. Romano, the former ambassador. Among diplomats, the company's chief executive is widely considered at least as influential as any cabinet member.
Libya is Eni's largest source of oil and gas and home to one fifth of the company's developed oil fields. After the 2008 accord, Eni pledged to invest $28 billion in Libya to extend its oil and gas contracts into 2040 and develop new oil fields. The company said this week that that Libya owns less than 2 percent of the company.
Since the unrest, Eni has roughly halved operations in Libya. Last month it evacuated almost all of its personnel and shut down its Greenstream pipeline, which runs from Libya to Sicily and carries 10 percent of Italy's natural gas supply.
''Of the companies that are exposed in Libya, Eni on a volume basis has the most at risk,'' said Claudia Pessagno, an equity analyst with IHS Herald, which monitors the petroleum market.
A spokesman for Eni declined to comment.
While Mr. Berlusconi has condemned Colonel Qaddafi, he does not seem to have had a perceptible impact on his erstwhile friend.
In the view of Mr. Dini, Mr. Berlusconi's sway over Colonel Qaddafi is ''not necessarily very much.'' He said he hoped the bilateral treaty could be reactivated in ''a new Libya,'' without Colonel Qaddafi at its helm.
But with the colonel showing no signs of leaving, it remains unclear who will come next. ''Since no one knows whom to deal with, they're measuring their words, and waiting,'' Mr. Romano said. ''What else can they do?''

HEADLINE: Armies of Expensive Lawyers, Replaced by Cheaper Software

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
When five television studios became entangled in a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against CBS, the cost was immense. As part of the obscure task of ''discovery'' -- providing documents relevant to a lawsuit -- the studios examined six million documents at a cost of more than $2.2 million, much of it to pay for a platoon of lawyers and paralegals who worked for months at high hourly rates.
But that was in 1978. Now, thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, ''e-discovery'' software can analyze documents in a fraction of the time for a fraction of the cost. In January, for example, Blackstone Discovery of Palo Alto, Calif., helped analyze 1.5 million documents for less than $100,000.
Some programs go beyond just finding documents with relevant terms at computer speeds. They can extract relevant concepts -- like documents relevant to social protest in the Middle East -- even in the absence of specific terms, and deduce patterns of behavior that would have eluded lawyers examining millions of documents. 
''From a legal staffing viewpoint, it means that a lot of people who used to be allocated to conduct document review are no longer able to be billed out,'' said Bill Herr, who as a lawyer at a major chemical company used to muster auditoriums of lawyers to read documents for weeks on end. ''People get bored, people get headaches. Computers don't.''
Computers are getting better at mimicking human reasoning -- as viewers of ''Jeopardy!'' found out when they saw Watson beat its human opponents -- and they are claiming work once done by people in high-paying professions. The number of computer chip designers, for example, has largely stagnated because powerful software programs replace the work once done by legions of logic designers and draftsmen.
Software is also making its way into tasks that were the exclusive province of human decision makers, like loan and mortgage officers and tax accountants.
These new forms of automation have renewed the debate over the economic consequences of technological progress.
David H. Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says the United States economy is being ''hollowed out.'' New jobs, he says, are coming at the bottom of the economic pyramid, jobs in the middle are being lost to automation and outsourcing, and now job growth at the top is slowing because of automation.
''There is no reason to think that technology creates unemployment,'' Professor Autor said. ''Over the long run we find things for people to do. The harder question is, does changing technology always lead to better jobs? The answer is no.''
Automation of higher-level jobs is accelerating because of progress in computer science and linguistics. Only recently have researchers been able to test and refine algorithms on vast data samples, including a huge trove of e-mail from the Enron Corporation.
''The economic impact will be huge,'' said Tom Mitchell, chairman of the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ''We're at the beginning of a 10-year period where we're going to transition from computers that can't understand language to a point where computers can understand quite a bit about language.''
Nowhere are these advances clearer than in the legal world.
E-discovery technologies generally fall into two broad categories that can be described as ''linguistic'' and ''sociological.''
The most basic linguistic approach uses specific search words to find and sort relevant documents. More advanced programs filter documents through a large web of word and phrase definitions. A user who types ''dog'' will also find documents that mention ''man's best friend'' and even the notion of a ''walk.''
The sociological approach adds an inferential layer of analysis, mimicking the deductive powers of a human Sherlock Holmes. Engineers and linguists at Cataphora, an information-sifting company based in Silicon Valley, have their software mine documents for the activities and interactions of people -- who did what when, and who talks to whom. The software seeks to visualize chains of events. It identifies discussions that might have taken place across e-mail, instant messages and telephone calls.
Then the computer pounces, so to speak, capturing ''digital anomalies'' that white-collar criminals often create in trying to hide their activities.
For example, it finds ''call me'' moments -- those incidents when an employee decides to hide a particular action by having a private conversation. This usually involves switching media, perhaps from an e-mail conversation to instant messaging, telephone or even a face-to-face encounter.
''It doesn't use keywords at all,'' said Elizabeth Charnock, Cataphora's founder. ''But it's a means of showing who leaked information, who's influential in the organization or when a sensitive document like an S.E.C. filing is being edited an unusual number of times, or an unusual number of ways, by an unusual type or number of people.''
The Cataphora software can also recognize the sentiment in an e-mail message -- whether a person is positive or negative, or what the company calls ''loud talking'' -- unusual emphasis that might give hints that a document is about a stressful situation. The software can also detect subtle changes in the style of an e-mail communication.
A shift in an author's e-mail style, from breezy to unusually formal, can raise a red flag about illegal activity.
''You tend to split a lot fewer infinitives when you think the F.B.I. might be reading your mail,'' said Steve Roberts, Cataphora's chief technology officer.
Another e-discovery company in Silicon Valley, Clearwell, has developed software that analyzes documents to find concepts rather than specific keywords, shortening the time required to locate relevant material in litigation.
Last year, Clearwell software was used by the law firm DLA Piper to search through a half-million documents under a court-imposed deadline of one week. Clearwell's software analyzed and sorted 570,000 documents (each document can be many pages) in two days. The law firm used just one more day to identify 3,070 documents that were relevant to the court-ordered discovery motion.
Clearwell's software uses language analysis and a visual way of representing general concepts found in documents to make it possible for a single lawyer to do work that might have once required hundreds.
''The catch here is information overload,'' said Aaref A. Hilaly, Clearwell's chief executive. ''How do you zoom in to just the specific set of documents or facts that are relevant to the specific question? It's not about search; it's about sifting, and that's what e-discovery software enables.''
For Neil Fraser, a lawyer at Milberg, a law firm based in New York, the Cataphora software provides a way to better understand the internal workings of corporations he sues, particularly when the real decision makers may be hidden from view.
He says the software allows him to find the ex-Pfc. Wintergreens in an organization -- a reference to a lowly character in the novel ''Catch-22'' who wielded great power because he distributed mail to generals and was able to withhold it or dispatch it as he saw fit.
Such tools owe a debt to an unlikely, though appropriate, source: the electronic mail database known as the Enron Corpus.
In October 2003, Andrew McCallum, a computer scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, read that the federal government had a collection of more than five million messages from the prosecution of Enron.
He bought a copy of the database for $10,000 and made it freely available to academic and corporate researchers. Since then, it has become the foundation of a wealth of new science -- and its value has endured, since privacy constraints usually keep large collections of e-mail out of reach. ''It's made a massive difference in the research community,'' Dr. McCallum said.
The Enron Corpus has led to a better understanding of how language is used and how social networks function, and it has improved efforts to uncover social groups based on e-mail communication.
Now artificial intelligence software has taken a seat at the negotiating table.
Two months ago, Autonomy, an e-discovery company based in Britain, worked with defense lawyers in a lawsuit brought against a large oil and gas company. The plaintiffs showed up during a pretrial negotiation with a list of words intended to be used to help select documents for use in the lawsuit.
''The plaintiffs asked for 500 keywords to search on,'' said Mike Sullivan, chief executive of Autonomy Protect, the company's e-discovery division.
In response, he said, the defense lawyers used those words to analyze their own documents during the negotiations, and those results helped them bargain more effectively, Mr. Sullivan said.
Some specialists acknowledge that the technology has limits. ''The documents that the process kicks out still have to be read by someone,'' said Herbert L. Roitblat of OrcaTec, a consulting firm in Altanta.
Quantifying the employment impact of these new technologies is difficult. Mike Lynch, the founder of Autonomy, is convinced that ''legal is a sector that will likely employ fewer, not more, people in the U.S. in the future.'' He estimated that the shift from manual document discovery to e-discovery would lead to a manpower reduction in which one lawyer would suffice for work that once required 500 and that the newest generation of software, which can detect duplicates and find clusters of important documents on a particular topic, could cut the head count by another 50 percent.
The computers seem to be good at their new jobs. Mr. Herr, the former chemical company lawyer, used e-discovery software to reanalyze work his company's lawyers did in the 1980s and '90s. His human colleagues had been only 60 percent accurate, he found.
''Think about how much money had been spent to be slightly better than a coin toss,'' he said.
Smarter Than You Think: Articles in this series are examining the recent advances in artificial intelligence and robotics and their potential impact on society.

HEADLINE: Poison Pen Politics

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
We may be embarking on a new era in politics, in which candidates and officials are just as likely to be brought down by bad writing as adultery.
Today, let us consider the case of the Florida State Senate president, Mike Haridopolos.
Haridopolos is of interest to us non-Floridians for several reasons. One is his wavy blond hair, which curves around his 40-year-old forehead in a perfect dip and may be setting a whole new post-John-Edwards political hair standard. 
Second, he is an early favorite to win the Republican nomination to take on United States Senator Bill Nelson, one of the Democratic incumbents expected to face a tough re-election battle in 2012.
''We're only four seats short of a majority,'' Haridopolos told a TV interviewer this week. ''I can be one of those four seats ... and join Marco Rubio as a Florida U.S. senator.'' Rubio, who was just elected in November, is a young man with great hair himself. If Haridopolos were to join him in Washington, they would definitely wrest the hottest-Senate-delegation title away from New York's Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer.
But first Haridopolos is going to have to get past some current political unpleasantness about the fact that, a few years back, he got a community college in his district to pay him $152,000 to write a book on Florida government.
Which, The Associated Press pointed out recently, was supposed to become a textbook but wound up being a single 175-page, double-spaced manuscript stashed away in the Brevard Community College administration office.
Furor ensued. Florida journalists pointed out that on a per-copy basis, Haridopolos made 61,000 times more than J.K. Rowling did for the Harry Potter series.
I am hoping that the next defining series of political scandals will be about illegitimate prose. You will remember that last year, the leading candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Colorado was torpedoed by charges that he had plagiarized chunks of ''Musings on Water,'' a manuscript that a conservative foundation had paid him $300,000 to write.
Many of us were most fascinated by the idea that you could get $300,000 for musing about water. But the voters were upset about the plagiarism part. The candidate, Scott McInnis, lost the nomination to Dan Maes, a dark horse who arguably turned out to be the worst candidate for a major post in a year when his competition included Alvin Greene, the guy running for the Senate in South Carolina whose economic development program involved getting the unemployed to build action figures of Alvin Greene.
Haridopolos's tome, ''Florida Legislative History and Process,'' is Literary Scandal Two, and if we get just one more we will have an official trend, suggesting that politicians can now get in more trouble with a laptop than a lap dance.
Wait! This just in! The director of the London School of Economics has resigned following charges that Seif Qaddafi, son of you-know-who, plagiarized chunks of his Ph.D. dissertation. Seif was awarded a doctorate from the London School of Economics shortly after Libya made a huge donation to the school. (This is not the Qaddafi son who got arrested for beating the servants with a coat hanger in a Swiss hotel, causing Libya to begin a campaign to have Switzerland removed from Europe. That was Hannibal, and he is not a big writer. Seif is the one you see on TV telling reporters that his father is in high spirits.)
But back to State Senator Haridopolos. He is a dedicated fiscal conservative, and when a reporter asked him whether the taxpayers got their money's worth from his book, he replied: ''I don't know. How much are you worth?'' We take this as a sign of incipient testiness.
One thing about crimes against writing is that journalists tend to take them more personally than crimes against marriage. But, generally, politicians are protected from their worst literary sins by the fact that nobody actually ever reads the books they produce.
Now the community college has agreed to make ''Florida Legislative History and Process'' available on Kindle, and both voters and writers will be able to judge for themselves whether Haridopolos is right when he blames the whole controversy on the fact that he is ''running for office, trying to change America.''
Frank Cerabino of The Palm Beach Post gave the manuscript a quick read and reported that Haridopolos ''somehow managed to write a political history of Florida that completely skips over the Florida recount of the 2000 election.'' But he was most taken by the section entitled ''Running for Office,'' in which Haridopolos advised: ''It is essential to study the issues before deciding to run.''
Other reviewers fixated on another insider tip: ''A cellphone will be essential.'' Although I am kind of partial to: ''Most importantly, a candidate should avoid wasting money on useless novelty items such as wooden nickels.''
Or wooden prose.

HEADLINE: Cutting the Budget, and Then What?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The New Normal'' (column, March 1), David Brooks proposes two criteria for budget-cutting: ''make everybody hurt'' and ''trim from the old to invest in the young.''
How can this lead to good public policy? It overlooks completely the benefits from measures such as tax increases. 
My wife and I are elderly and depend in part on Social Security and Medicare. We would gladly endure cuts in these benefits to improve the lives of children, particularly our nine grandchildren.
Let's remember, though, that the reason we want to reduce the deficit is that it would likely encourage economic growth and benefit everybody.
So instead of making everybody hurt, we should try to make everybody better off. Let's start by discontinuing the Bush tax cut for millionaires and use the money to help states pay for the education of our children.
Peter Helmberger Madison, Wis., March 1, 2011
To the Editor:
As members of the Minnesota House of Representatives, we are puzzled by the assumption so visible in David Brooks's column that the only question in attacking the fiscal crisis in the states and in Washington is what to cut and what not to cut.
In our state there is now a broad and bipartisan consensus that we can't just cut our way out of this budget challenge, nor just tax our way out. The problems are structural and long-term. We also have to think our way out -- to redesign the public sector. We need to innovate to get better value.
So this legislative session we are starting to design new ways to solve public problems and to achieve public objectives. The old discussion about doing more or doing less is turning into a discussion about ''doing different.''
We do understand that redesign will take time, and that it will not solve the immediate problem of balancing the state budget. But cutting-and-taxing budget after budget would be a disaster for our state.
We think Minnesota is committed to redesign, and it seems to us that a creative effort to ''do different'' should be a part of the solution in other states and at the national level as well.
Carol McFarlane Paul Marquart St. Paul, March 1, 2011
To the Editor:
David Brooks, in his calls for cuts, is endorsing triage for a sick society. This type of tough love is clearly what's needed if we are to remain a leading nation, and address the central problems that threaten the country.
It used to be what Republicans stood for. Unfortunately, what governs their actions today is politics, so we get a sort of reverse triage that avoids urgent problems and ensures our decline.
Ross Williams Milan, N.Y., March 1, 2011
To the Editor:
Politicians and administrators, David Brooks says, are cutting what's ''politically easy,'' which often includes school ''athletics, band, cheerleading, art and music.'' These are exactly the programs that keep children in school and build character. Must the debate about the value of the arts and athletics in public education continue?
Many of us graduated with memories of field trips to concerts and plays, and have fond memories of the discipline learned from team sports. As adults, we enjoy a lifelong love of museums, theater and the fun of rallying around our favorite pro sports team.
Kudos to Mr. Brooks, who gladly takes on the states for their disregard of the disciplines and pursuits that contribute to an educated person's character.
Robert Geary Portland, Ore., March 1, 2011
To the Editor:
Republicans say that we cannot afford government entitlements and that it is therefore necessary to cut, cut, cut. What these Republicans are really saying is that those entitlement programs are for ''other people, not my people.'' They are for ''other situations, not my situation.''
That family without money for basic services and basic needs, that family is not mine, and because this will never be me, I can look the other away and cut, cut, cut.

HEADLINE: Concerns Grow as Iraq Feels Its Premier Strengthen His Grip on Power

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and JACK HEALY; Yasir Ghazi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- As protesters throughout the Arab world challenge their authoritarian leaders, Iraqis, government officials and regional experts see increasing signs that Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki is expanding his power, undermining the fragile democracy struggling to take hold here.
A ruling in January by Iraq's highest court -- sought by Mr. Maliki -- gave him control of once independent agencies responsible for running the country's central bank, conducting elections and investigating corruption.
A month after that ruling, two leading human rights groups said that forces that reported directly to Mr. Maliki, in violation of the country's Constitution, were running secret jails where detainees had been tortured.
And in July, Iraq's high court ruled that members of Parliament no longer had the power to propose legislation. Instead, all new laws would have to be proposed by Mr. Maliki's cabinet or the president and then passed to the Parliament for a vote. 
Political experts said they knew of no other parliamentary democracy that had such restrictions.
With influence from the United States waning as the military prepares to withdraw at the end of the year, Mr. Maliki's critics say that one legacy of the eight-year American occupation is a democratically elected leader from the country's Shiite majority who has far more power than the Constitution intended.
Critics said that the court ruling in January was a particularly damaging blow to the country's voting process and feeble economy. Sean Kane, the program officer for Iraq at the United States Institute of Peace, a Congressionally financed research center, said that the decision appeared to contradict Iraq's Constitution, which he said stated that the commissions had varying levels of responsibility to Parliament.
Referring to the recent court ruling, Aliya Nasaif, a lawmaker from the Iraqiya coalition, a rival to Mr. Maliki's State of Law bloc, said: ''Because there is no law, you will find him overwhelming other institutions. This is the beginning of dictatorship. We are regressing by centuries.''
Mr. Maliki has tried to respond to public discontent by giving his cabinet 100 days to come up with ways to improve services. He has also promised to cut his pay and not seek a third term in 2014.
An official for the United States Embassy said that Mr. Maliki and his advisers were trying to signal that they understood the outrage of Iraqis over corruption and poverty.
Those concessions, however, have done little to mollify Iraqis, and thousands took to the streets last week, sometimes violently, to protest the government's failure to provide electricity and jobs.
Rights groups criticized the government for what they called a violent crackdown on those demonstrations, saying that scores of people -- including journalists -- were beaten and detained.
On Friday, protesters took the streets again, although there were far fewer reports of violence. Nevertheless, in the southern city of Basra, several journalists at a protest reported that they had been beaten by security forces.
Mr. Maliki, an uncharismatic but canny politician who was elected prime minister in 2006, has been credited with helping reduce the violence that once threatened to tear Iraq apart.
But his critics say those victories have come at a cost. They accuse Mr. Maliki of taking a stronger hand over Iraq's powerful police and military forces by leaving the slots of defense and interior minister open indefinitely, allowing him to act as the head of both agencies.
''The developments in recent months have provoked real concern across the Iraqi political spectrum, and the responsibility now rests largely with the Parliament to check the prime minister's power,'' said Jason Gluck, a rule of law adviser at the United States Institute of Peace and an adviser to the Iraqi Parliament in 2007. ''Whether the diverse political parties in Parliament can effectively do so will be a critical test for Iraq's burgeoning democracy.''
One of Mr. Maliki's top advisers, Ali al-Moussawi, said that the once independent agencies had ''irregularities and problems'' in the past because of ''the lack of supervision.''
Mr. Moussawi said the new oversight would focus on administrative matters but would not interfere with the overall missions of the institutions.
''The noise against the court decision is for political reasons,'' Mr. Moussawi said. ''Those who make this noise are not doing it for the sake of these bodies but for political gains.''
Mr. Maliki had been seen as a fairly weak leader until 2008, when he ordered an Iraqi military offensive against Shiite militias, which had taken control of parts of southern Iraq. His critics say he continued to strengthen his power by using his security forces to resolve political disputes, particularly in Kurdistan.
Mr. Maliki narrowly lost in the March 2010 election and appeared significantly weakened. But he muscled his way to a second term after favorable decisions from the election commission and the high court, allowing him to assemble a wide-ranging coalition government in December.
Joost Hiltermann, an Iraq expert for the International Crisis Group, said that Mr. Maliki had benefited from the fact that Iraq has not been a top priority for the Obama administration.
Some members of Iraq's fractious Parliament, a rubber-stamp institution under Saddam Hussein, have said they would take measures to check Mr. Maliki's power, vowing to cut funds to security agencies controlled by the prime minister and to pass laws that limited him.
None of those attempts, however, have gained much traction, in large part because the opposition is so divided.
The degree of the court's independence is unclear. The Iraqi Constitution is vague on how members of the court can be removed and appointed, and what guarantees its independence.
Officials with the election commission said they were baffled by the court's decision placing them under Mr. Maliki's supervision. They also worried that Iraqis would lose faith in the credibility of local and national elections if Mr. Maliki's office began to select election monitors or to change the rules governing where voting took place, how ballots were counted and who ran polling stations.
Faraj al-Haidari, head of Iraq's election commission, said that United Nations officials had expressed their concern about the ruling to him.
Shortly after the decision was handed down, Mr. Haidari said he had received a letter from Mr. Maliki's office telling the commission to halt the appointments of 38 low-level election officials. He said the commission had refused.
Fear has also extended to the central bank, where officials said they worried that Mr. Maliki would now have the power to order the institution to print money to cover Iraq's growing budget deficits. Such a move would weaken the value of Iraq's anemic currency and lead to rapid inflation.
''Our fear is that they will now see it as their money,'' said the bank's senior adviser, Mudher M. Salih Kasim.

HEADLINE: Raid by F.B.I. Was Fatal Hit To Hedge Fund

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
David Ganek faced two stark choices: try to keep running his hedge fund after a raid by the F.B.I., or shut it down.
Mr. Ganek decided to capitulate, not even trying to persuade investors to keep their $4 billion in his hedge fund, Level Global Investors, people close to the fund said. Less than three months after the raid, he told investors he would return their money.
It was a sharp reversal from last fall, when Level Global foresaw a growth spurt that could make it a $5 billion to $7 billion hedge fund, investors say. The fund was on the verge of receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in new money. It had plans to increase staff and expand. An investment fund run by Goldman Sachs had taken a minority stake in Level Global several months earlier.
But on a cold morning in late November, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the Midtown Manhattan offices of Level Global, as well as the offices of three other hedge funds, grabbing files and computers, as part of a broad investigation into insider trading on Wall Street. 
While no one at Level Global has been accused of any wrongdoing, the fund could not survive the raid's blow to its reputation. The episode illustrates how vulnerable hedge funds - even large, successful ones - can be when investors grow nervous. Moreover, it shows the difficult choices hedge fund managers have when their fund has been ensnared in an investigation. In this case, those choices fell on Mr. Ganek, 47, the trader and art world socialite.
The investors in Level Global, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meetings were private, said that in the days after the raid, Mr. Ganek expressed doubt about the firm's survival. In conversations with these investors, he recalled that the F.B.I. had barged into the firm's offices and demanded a lot of information. He didn't know much else, he told them.
''I don't know what we're going to do,'' Mr. Ganek told one investor, when asked about the future of the fund.
Anthony R. Chiasson, who founded the firm with Mr. Ganek in 2003, seemed to be barely involved during the last days of Level Global, investors say.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Ganek, who owned a larger share of the hedge fund, and Mr. Chiasson declined to be interviewed.
As Mr. Ganek met with other investors, the stress was evident on his face. Though he maintained an even tone, those who know him say they could see that the open-ended investigation was wearing him down.
Investors were happy - if not overwhelmed - with the fund's returns, which averaged roughly 9 percent a year since 2003, including only modest losses during the financial crisis.
After the raid, however, investors asked for $750 million back, and those who had planned to invest new money withdrew.
It was a far cry from the love affair investors had with Level Global at the beginning. At the founding of the firm, part of the appeal was the mystique of Mr. Ganek, who was considered a profit center when he worked as a trader for Steven A. Cohen's hedge fund, SAC Advisors. Mr. Ganek, who ran a technology team, and Mr. Chiasson, a technology analyst, left the colossal hedge fund at a time when SAC was posting some of the biggest gains in its history. The pair were among the earliest spinoffs from Mr. Cohen's fund, which has since become something of a breeding ground for hedge fund managers.
To investors, Mr. Ganek pitched Level as a fund inherently negative on the market, an appealing strategy to those looking for a more cautious approach, despite what some considered high fees. And he kept true to that vision: While Level often underperformed the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index during boom times, the hedge fund weathered the turbulence of 2008 admirably, investors say.
In the early years, the operation was scrappy, former employees remember. Though it began with $550 million, at the time a huge amount for a new hedge fund, the office atmosphere had the air of a start-up. Mr. Ganek sat on the floor with his traders, barking orders and reading off headlines from the Bloomberg terminal. Mr. Chiasson, by contrast, was a less intense manager, sitting with his analysts and walking over to speak to employees when he needed something.
That contrasting dynamic seemed to persist in their personal lives, as well. As their firm grew, Mr. Ganek's prominence ballooned on the Manhattan social scene, especially in the worlds of art and philanthropy where he and his wife, the novelist Danielle Ganek, were mainstays of auctions and glitzy galas. Mr. Chiasson, for his part, eschewed the spotlight.
In the years after founding Level Global, the Ganeks gained reputations as prominent collectors of modern art, though they had been collecting for nearly 20 years. The walls of their $19 million home at 740 Park Avenue, one of the city's most prestigious co-ops, were at varying times graced by the works of Damien Hirst, Richard Prince and Jeff Koons. Mr. Ganek even commissioned Ed Ruscha, a modernist known for his one-word paintings, to fashion a work incorporating the word ''Level'' for the hedge fund's offices.
Mr. Ganek, the son of a New York money manager, and his wife donated a collection of Diane Arbus photographs to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and he was named to the Guggenheim Museum board of trustees.
Mr. Chiasson, 37, who grew up near Portland, Me., has kept a far lower profile in his more than 15 years on Wall Street. Rather than gravitate toward the city's high society, he serves on the board of trustees at Babson College, where he graduated in 1995, and has donated generously to the school, including a million-dollar gift in 2010 for a summer program to help develop the entrepreneurial projects of students.
He also sits on the board of his high school, a private Jesuit college preparatory in his hometown, in addition to serving on numerous committees there.
In the weeks after his firm was raided, Mr. Chiasson briefly appeared at an alumni event in New York for the high school, and attendees said he appeared upbeat.
After starting his career as an equity analyst at Salomon Brothers, Mr. Chiasson decided to move over to the buy side and joined SAC, where he eventually worked on the technology team alongside Mr. Ganek. When the pair started their own operation, they decided to name it Level. Mr. Chiasson, who lives on the Upper East Side with his wife and child, once described that decision as: ''Level is a palindrome which connotes balance and adaptability - two key investing traits.''
Mr. Chiasson was seen as something of a consensus builder at the firm, where he managed the team of analysts as head of research. This week he began to unwind at least one of his connections to the firm. In 2006, Mr. Chiasson took a $3.3 million loan against his $4.2 million home on East 96th Street and invested it in Level Global, according to city records and a person close to him. This week, anticipating the return of that money, Mr. Chiasson paid the loan off in its entirety, according to city records.
In the end, however, it was Mr. Ganek who spoke for the firm. Though previous investor letters were signed by both founders, the Feb. 11 one announcing the fund's closure bore only Mr. Ganek's name. ''Unfortunately, the ongoing government investigation presents significant challenges to maintaining our collective focus,'' he wrote in the letter.
At the office that day, Mr. Ganek stood before his 61 employees and announced his decision to end the firm's highly successful run. He stuck around offering handshakes and hugs to his employees, many of whom were let go that day. Afterward, he took the day off to unwind and attended his son's squash game, a person close to him said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China Is Said To Set Goals To Save Energy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- With oil prices at their highest level in more than two years because of unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, the Chinese government plans to announce strict five-year goals for energy conservation in the next two weeks, China energy specialists said Friday.
Bejing's emphasis on saving energy reflects concerns about national security and the effects of high fuel costs on inflation, China's export competitiveness and the country's pollution problems.
Any energy policy moves by Beijing hold global implications, given that China is the world's biggest consumer of energy and largest emitter of greenhouse gases. And even the new efficiency goals assume that China's overall energy consumption will grow, to meet the needs of the nation's 1.3 billion people and its rapidly expanding economy. 
As a net importer of oil, China tends to view its energy needs as a matter of national security. And so, even as Beijing tries to quell any signs of the Arab world's social unrest striking a political chord with Chinese citizens, the government is also intent on not letting similar upheaval impinge on its energy needs.
Zhang Guobao, who was China's longtime energy czar until his retirement in January and is still a power broker on energy issues, said Friday that China must undertake an ''arduous'' task to protect its security. ''Oil security is the most important part of achieving energy security,'' Mr. Zhang told the official Xinhua news agency. ''Preparations for alternative energies should be made as soon as possible.''
China has placed a big bet on renewable energy, emerging as the world's biggest and lowest-cost manufacturer of wind turbines and solar panels. But the country remains heavily reliant on coal for its electricity. And its oil imports are surging after auto sales have surpassed the American market in each of the last two years.
China has also moved ahead of the United States as the biggest buyer of oil and natural gas from Saudi Arabia, which has so far avoided social upheaval but is on Mideast analysts' watch lists. That oil is shipped in tankers that travel along sea lanes controlled by India and the United States, which adds to Beijing's jitters.
Iran, hardly a bastion of stability, is another large supplier of crude oil to China.
And while Russia in the current geopolitical context is looking like a relatively secure supplier of energy, a large pipeline to China from Russia, completed this winter, so far supplies only 3 percent of China's crude oil.
An important feature of the five-year plan is its call to double the share of natural gas in Chinese energy consumption, to 8 percent in 2015 from 4 percent last year, according to Fatih Birol, the chief economist of the multilateral International Energy Agency in Paris. This will make China a natural buyer of large quantities of Russian gas, making it a competitor to Europe, which already relies heavily on gas from Russia.
According to an estimate by Wood Mackenzie, a global energy consulting firm, China imports nearly two-thirds of its oil and is on track to pass the United States in the percentage of imported oil this year. China was a net exporter as recently as 1992, before the demands of its economic boom created an insatiable energy appetite at home.
As part of its effort to curb oil demand, the Chinese government has already been pursuing an aggressive program to develop electric cars, although these would run at least initially on a national grid that still relies heavily on coal.
China aims to limit energy consumption in 2015 to four billion metric tons of coal or its equivalent in other fuels, Mr. Zhang said. An energy specialist in Beijing said that he had also been told the same figure by several people.
Even a goal of four billion metric tons of coal or its equivalent represents an annual increase of 4.24 percent from last year's consumption of a little more than 3.2 billion tons.
No decisions have been made yet on how the almost entirely state-owned energy sector would allocate the limits by city, province or electric utility. This is already causing considerable anxiety within China, said the specialist, who insisted on anonymity because of the government's sensitivity about goals that have not yet been announced.
''It's a political target, it's being taken without a lot of internal consultation,'' he said, before adding a Chinese proverb to describe the unhappy reaction of power producers and users already briefed on the new policy: ''It's like a whole lot of ants are being thrown in a hot wok.''
The Chinese economy has repeatedly grown considerably faster than government forecasts. But the government has come much closer to its energy goals because it owns all of the electricity distribution systems. And it has controlling stakes in the oil, gas and electricity companies and many coal mining companies.
The last five year-plan, which ended on Dec. 31, called for the country to reduce by 20 percent the energy it used per renminbi of economic output in 2010, compared to 2005. To try meeting that goal, Beijing required the governments of every province and city to achieve 20 percent improvements. Local officials, in turn, set similar goals for the 200 largest companies in each province and city.
But China fell badly behind its goal in late 2009 and early last year. The government's economic stimulus program, in response to the global financial crisis, produced huge spending on highways, high-speed rail lines and other infrastructure that required lots of steel and cement, which are energy-intensive to produce.
Premier Wen Jiabao responded last May by starting a national campaign to improve energy efficiency and soon vowed an ''iron hand''to enforce compliance. By September, the government was ordering production lines to close at 2,000 factories.
The campaign reached extremes last autumn and early winter, with some town officials shutting off electricity and heat to businesses, homes and even hospitals in desperate bids to avoid censure for missing their goals.
Despite the measures, the government fell slightly short. Senior officials initially said in January that the country had ''basically'' met the 20 percent goal. But statistics issued since then show an improvement of only 19.1 percent over the last five years.
Meeting the new target of no more than four billion metric tons of coal or its equivalent will require further improvements in efficiency if the economy expands 7 percent a year in the coming years.
Much greater efficiency gains would be needed if the economy grows even faster, as most economists predict. The Chinese economy expanded 10.3 percent last year.
Mr. Wen and others for years have resisted setting total energy consumption goals and have only issued efficiency goals -- precisely because overall consumption goals could require drastic measures to meet if the economy surges.
There was no immediate explanation available on Friday, other than troubles in the Arab world, for why the government had now decided to embrace an overall target.
The goals in China's new five-year plan are consistent with the International Energy Agency's ''new policies'' plan for climate change, a middle course that represents an improvement from current policies, Mr. Birol said. But he noted that the Chinese goals did not go far enough to meet what the agency considers necessary to prevent world temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius, an increase that many scientists fear as potentially leading to very broad environmental changes.
Mr. Zhang and other Chinese officials have made little mention of climate change, which has ranked far behind energy security as a priority in Chinese policy making.
Zhou Yongkang, one of the nine members of the Politburo Standing Committee that runs China and the top law enforcement official of the Chinese Communist Party, is an oil engineer who spent most of his career rising to the top of the country's oil industry. He retains considerable influence over energy policy even though his job now is crushing internal dissent.
Most recently, Mr. Zhou has overseen efforts to round up dissidents and make sure that the ''Jasmine Revolution'' does not spread from the Arab region to China. Premier Wen and other top officials have also warned recently that rising prices for many commodities pose a threat to social stability.

HEADLINE: Another N.F.L. Extension Signals Some Optimism

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the sides still far apart on the economic issues at the heart of their dispute, the N.F.L. and the players union agreed to give themselves another week to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement that would avert the game's first work stoppage in more than two decades.
After taking a break from talks for the weekend, the sides will have five days before the new deadline at midnight Friday. 
While the extension provided a jolt of optimism that a protracted labor crisis could be avoided, it does not mean that the path to a new deal is assured. There remain enough separations between the parties, and enough factions among owners, that there was not even initial unanimity among the members of the owners' management council executive committee to extend the deadline for talks. Commissioner Roger Goodell had to convince some members of the 10-man committee that there was an upside to extending the deadline.
According to people familiar with the talks, the sides have moved closer on non-economic issues in negotiations: the rookie wage scale; post-career benefits and health care; and the 18-game season and the attendant cutbacks in physical contact during off-season workouts and practice weeks.
But they have made only slight progress on the issue that is the biggest impediment to a deal: how to divide the $9 billion in annual revenue and how much the owners should receive in cost credits beyond the $1 billion they already receive.
The owners had initially asked for another $1 billion off the top of the revenue pool, a proposal that prompted players to repeatedly ask for owners to show them full financial statements to prove why they need such a substantial increase. As the negotiations continue next week, it is likely players will again demand to see more information to justify the owners' request.
Still, after months of public rancor, even the language of negotiators has softened in the last two days, when movement toward an extension began Wednesday night.George Cohen, the federal mediator, is especially adept at making all parties feel equally heard, it was said by people involved in negotiations, especially players who have taken an active role with the union's leader, DeMaurice Smith.
On Friday, Smith said that after the commitment to engage in another round of negotiations, players ''look forward to a deal coming out of that,'' the most hopeful he has sounded throughout the process.
And the owners' lead negotiator, Jeff Pash, spoke of compromise, a word that had been rarely used in the almost three years since owners opted out of the current agreement in 2008.
''I think we are at a stage where the issues have been joined, there has been a tremendous amount of discussion, it's time for us really to dig, to dig deep, and try to find solutions and try to be creative and try to compromise in a way that will work for everybody,'' Pash said Friday. ''It's a challenge, we've got very serious issues, we've got significant differences. But we are committed to collective bargaining. All over this country, collective bargaining is being challenged. We're committed to it. We believe it can work.''
The extension allows negotiators to step back from the precipice on which they have been perched for days. During Thursday's talks it became clear, said one person who was in the negotiating room, that neither side had a thirst to use the weapons it had amassed for an all-out labor fight -- the union dissolving itself, and a lockout by the owners -- and that both sides now viewed March as a serious deadline.
The threat of the process known as decertification by the players, combined with the owners' desire to avoid the Minneapolis courtroom of the federal judge David S. Doty, played into the owners' move to try to work out a deal now, before a work stoppage.
Doty has consistently ruled in the players' favor during his years of overseeing the collective bargaining agreement, most recently this week, when he determined that the owners had violated terms of the agreement by negotiating television contracts that gave them guaranteed money even during a lockout in exchange for what might have been lesser money collected. His ruling not only put into jeopardy the $4 billion in revenue the owners thought they'd have access to during a lockout, but it also raised the possibility that he could award damages.
That decision, although it was expected by owners, and the prospect that Doty would preside over antitrust lawsuits filed by players in the event of decertification, sent a chill through owners. They are likely to make Doty's removal from oversight of the collective bargaining agreement part of the talks next week.
The threat of Doty has not disappeared with the extension. With the deadline pushed back, the union has until 5 p.m. Eastern next Friday to file decertification papers with Doty's court. That, though, would happen only if there were not a deal or another extension. While the football world anxiously waits for an outcome, Cohen made the point that the N.F.L. has been involved in mediated talks just 11 days, a short period by his standards. He could press the sides to accept another extension next week if a deal is not reached by then.
Players were said to be tiring of a process that has still not produced movement on the financial issues that concern them most, and they could be reluctant to accept another extension. But the owners did not rule it out, presenting the possibility that it could take much of March to determine the N.F.L.'s fate.
''As I've repeated over and over again, this is going to get resolved through negotiations,'' Goodell said Friday. ''Not through litigation. So talking is better than litigating.''

HEADLINE: Where William Tell Is an Amateur

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
NEWARK -- You can buy all sorts of stuff from the concessionaires at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, but the things you may want the most after seeing this year's show aren't for sale. 
At the top of the list is a giant bicycle with huge tires that look like chocolate doughnuts; a group of clowns have a great time with it, and it seems as if you could too. A close second are the springy gizmos the show's dancer-gymnasts strap on their legs that enable them to leap abnormal heights and distances. Combined with glow-in-the-dark costumes, they create a cool effect that would make you the life of any neighborhood party.
Alas, you'll go home with much less impressive trinkets, and possibly a headache, from this loud and pizazzy show, titled ''Fully Charged.'' But any youngsters you have brought with you will be, well, fully charged by the end, especially after taking in the show's blazing high point: a human cannonball (actually shot from a giant crossbow) named Brian Miser who is propelled across the arena while on fire. There's something you won't see every day, unless something goes terribly wrong at your annual crossbow-and-barbecue party.
New Yorkers will have to trek to New Jersey or Long Island to get their circus itch scratched this year; construction has kept the Ringling troupe from its usual residency at Madison Square Garden. The substitute is an extended run at the Izod Center in the Meadowlands (after a stop last weekend at the Prudential Center in Newark), followed by five days at the Nassau Coliseum.
Brian Crawford Scott steps in as the new ringmaster and certainly has the necessary bombast, though a somewhat generic singing voice. The kids won't care about that, of course; they'll be more interested in Tabayara Maluenda's elephants, horses, zebras and tigers. Lost in the noise and the arena setting is some pretty amusing clowning. That circus art, at least, is made for a small tent, but given the economies of scale, is rarely seen in one these days.
''Fully Charged'' runs through March 13 at the Izod Center in East Rutherford, N.J., and from March 16 through 20 at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y.; (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com.

PERSON: Mikhail Simonov 

HEADLINE: Mikhail Simonov, 81, Designer Of Soviet Air Force Workhorse

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
MOSCOW (AP) -- Mikhail Simonov, an aircraft designer whose Sukhoi jet fighter became an essential part of the Soviet defense industry and a cash cow for post-Communist Russia, died here on Friday. He was 81. 
His death was announced by the Sukhoi Company.
Developed to counter the United States' F-15 fighter, Mr. Simonov's twin-engine, twin-fin Su-27 was first used by the Soviet Union's air force in the early 1980s and won respect in the West for its range of over 2,000 miles, its agility and its ability to fly at 2.35 times the speed of sound. It was a star of international air shows, performing aerobatics that few other fighter planes could accomplish.
The Su-27's thrust-to-weight ratio and sophisticated control system allowed it to perform exceptional maneuvers at very low speeds. In a stunt called the cobra, a pilot could raise the plane's nose so that it literally stood on its tail for a few seconds.
When state defense orders ground to a near halt after the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, Mr. Simonov played a critical role in winning lucrative export deals. The government sold hundreds of fighters to China, India and other foreign customers under contracts worth billions of dollars.
The Su-27 also remained a mainstay of the Russian Air Force.
Mr. Simonov started working as an aviation engineer in the 1950s and joined the Sukhoi design bureau as a deputy chief designer in 1970. During the next nine years he led the development of the Su-24 bomber, the Su-25 ground attack plane and the Su-27. He was the deputy minister of aircraft industries from 1979 to 1983.
While Mr. Simonov upgraded the original Su-27 design, work on a prospective fifth-generation fighter -- the Sukhoi T-50 -- to compete with the United States' F-22 Raptor has stalled amid the post-Soviet industrial decline.
The Sukhoi T-50 made its maiden flight last year, nearly 20 years after the Raptor's first prototype took to the air. Russian officials say it will take at least five more years for the new jet to enter service.

HEADLINE: The Chasm Between Consumers and the Fed

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
INFLATION in the United States is low, and seems to be going down if it is moving at all. The Federal Reserve thinks it will be years before there is any significant inflation.
But that is not the way many Americans see it. Gasoline prices are on the rise as the Libyan fighting intensifies, and some food items have risen. The high price of gold -- more than $1,400 an ounce -- is viewed by many, including some in Congress, as proof that rampant inflation is near.
Testifying in Congress this week, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, tried to be reassuring. ''The most likely outcome is that the recent rise in commodity prices will lead to, at most, a temporary and relatively modest increase in U.S. consumer price inflation,'' he said. 
Yet inflation anxiety is rising.
''Are the Fed and the public on different planets?'' Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, asked in a speech last month. ''There seems to be a disconnect between what the Fed is saying and what people are experiencing when they fill up their gas tanks or read about rising food prices around the world.''
The inflation rate most closely monitored by the Fed is one few noneconomists have ever heard of -- the personal consumption expenditure deflator. In concept, it is similar to the Consumer Price Index, but it is based on changes in prices of items that are actually used during a period, rather than on a fixed basket of purchases. This week, the Fed announced that the index level for January was up just 1.2 percent from a year earlier.
The increase in the core rate -- the rate excluding volatile food and energy prices -- was only 0.8 percent. As can be seen in the accompanying chart, it has never been lower in the years since the government began keeping the figure in 1959.
The Fed's goal is to keep the inflation rate at or near 2 percent, and it does not expect a significant increase for at least a few years. In January, nearly all members of the Fed's Open Market Committee thought that both the core rate and the overall rate would not rise above that figure through 2013, as can also be seen from the chart. The stock market is generally thought to do better when inflation is falling, but Martin Fridson, the global credit strategist for BNP Paribas Investment Partners, points out that is not always the case. There is, he says, a time when inflation is too low.
The accompanying chart, based on a report by Mr. Fridson, shows that from the 1940s through the 1990s, there generally was a relationship. The more inflation declined in a decade from inflation in the previous decade, the better the stock market did.
But in two decades, the 1930s and the first decade of this century, inflation fell from already low levels and the stock market suffered. ''Below a certain level of inflation,'' Mr. Fridson said, ''a further decline reflects economic weakness more than it reflects a salutary reining in of excessive monetary creation.''
If that is correct, then it could be that both investors and those simply concerned with promoting economic growth should, as Mr. Fridson wrote, hope that Mr. Bernanke ''fails in his stated goal of holding inflation to 2 percent or less.''
Online Correction: March 4, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of the chart that accompanies this column misstated the ''Average Annual Inflation Rate'' for the 1960s as 2 percent and the ''Change from Prior Decade'' as 2.3 percent.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Is Lower Inflation Bad News?: As a general rule, the stock market does better during periods of declining inflation than it does when prices are rising. But there are two exceptions -- the 1930s and the first decade of this century. It appears that declines from already low inflation rates alarm investors. Figures show compound annual total return for the S.&P. 500 for each decade, and the change in the annual inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, for each decade compared with the previous one.

HEADLINE: A Plan to Make It Harder for Banks to Foreclose on Homeowners

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
State attorneys general have presented the nation's five biggest banks with a list of demands that could drastically alter the foreclosure process and give the government sweeping authority over how mortgage servicers deal with millions of Americans in danger of losing their homes.
Under the blueprint, banks would be prohibited from starting foreclosure proceedings while a borrower was actively trying to lower the interest rate or ease other terms of the home loan, a process known as a mortgage modification. 
Any borrower who successfully made three payments in a trial modification would be given a permanent modification. When a modification was denied, it would be automatically reviewed by an ombudsman or independent review panel.
The proposed changes, which will be discussed by the attorneys general when they meet in Washington early next week, would compel the banks to treat each borrower in default individually.
It was the banks' attempt to process foreclosures on a large scale that led to robo-signing, in which lawyers and bank officials signed thousands of documents a month after only a cursory review.
The ensuing furor over robo-signing, and other abuses like foreclosures that proceeded with missing documentation, prompted the attorneys general and regulators to begin a broad investigation last fall.
The blueprint from the attorneys general, obtained by The New York Times, is still just a draft, and weeks, if not months, of tough negotiations with the banks remain. Several big banks, including Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, declined to comment.
The government's current program to help troubled home borrowers, known as HAMP, continues to face fierce criticism. Both conservatives and liberals have found fault with the program, which aided far fewer homeowners than originally promised.
The latest proposal, delivered to the banks late Thursday, represents an expansion of powers for the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which government officials say has taken a more aggressive stance in the talks than some other banking regulators.
The big banks are already wary of the new bureau and its overseer, Elizabeth Warren, a former Harvard law professor who has been sharply critical of the financial services industry and has pushed for a separate financial penalty of $20 billion or more.
''This further cements the C.F.P.B.'s authority in the financial space and puts them at the top of the pyramid when it comes to the mortgage modification fight,'' said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst at MF Global in Washington. ''From the perspective of the banks, this is the last place you want to be.''
On Capitol Hill, many conservatives are also wary of Ms. Warren, a sentiment echoed by Representative Scott Garrett, an influential Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee.
''I have deep concerns that an unconfirmed political appointee is making calls that affect the safety and soundness of our financial institutions,'' Mr. Garrett said in a statement. ''This is another attempt by the Obama administration to circumvent the rule of law and unilaterally implement its failed housing agenda at the expense of responsible homeowners.''
In addition to the attorneys general and the consumer bureau, the package is backed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Treasury, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission.
If adopted in anything like its current form, the proposal would probably compel banks to hire many more customer service employees, or slow the foreclosure process even further. Many households are already in foreclosure for more than 500 days.
But a program aimed at reducing the volume of foreclosures would affect far more than the families in distress. It would also help reshape the housing market.
About two million households are in foreclosure, and 2.2 million more are severely delinquent. Housing analysts have been waiting for these properties to make their way back onto the market, where they will swell available inventories and, at least initially, depress prices. Housing prices are already on the verge of falling through the floor established in the spring of 2009.
Giving some of these households loan modifications, allowing families to stay in their houses at least for a while, might help stabilize the market. But it also might prolong the day of reckoning, shifting a housing recovery to 2013 or 2014.
''Do you rip the Band-Aid off and deal with a shorter and sharper housing decline that ultimately puts homes in the hands of borrowers who can afford them for the long term?'' said Mike Larson of Weiss Research. ''Or do you let this drag on and on?''
Indeed, the big banks are already arguing that the recommendations, especially the consumer bureau's new powers, will slow the foreclosure process and inhibit lending in the future. Banks would have to provide the agency with their formulas for determining if and when modifications would proceed, as well as quarterly reports on their internal procedures.
Training documents and videos for employees at the servicing centers would have to be reviewed by the consumer bureau and the attorneys general, who would also appoint an independent monitor to examine the banks' compliance with any eventual settlement.
Among the provisions being proposed, the banks would have to reward their employees for pursing modifications over foreclosures. Late fees would be curtailed. A fund would compensate borrowers who were victims of banks' misconduct, while mortgage balances would be cut in ''appropriate circumstances.''
The initial reaction to the proposed changes by those who work with families in default ranged from quietly optimistic to disbelief that the banks could be compelled to change. Many earlier programs to provide homeowner relief were voluntary and did not achieve expectations.
''If these changes are enforceable and enforced, it will make a significant difference,'' said Michael Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending. But he said it would require the banks to make radical changes: ''This is very hands-on, time-intensive, one-off stuff.''
Walter Hackett, a former banker and managing attorney at Inland Counties Legal Services in Riverside, Calif., was less hopeful. ''For 20 years I've watched bankers try to find ways around the rules,'' he said. ''They are adept.''

HEADLINE: Power of Apparel in a Single Look That Conveys a Message

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
To tour an assembly plant in Canada, Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler, wore a black sweater and a checked oxford shirt.
At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Mr. Marchionne wore a black sweater and a checked oxford shirt. And at a Saturday night gala honoring Lee A. Iacocca in Los Angeles, he wore a black sweater and a checked oxford shirt.
Mr. Marchionne, who last year earned more than 5 million euros ($6.9 million) and owns luxury houses in three countries, has donned a monochromatic wardrobe similar to that worn by other top-flight executives. He has discovered the power of dressing down, and not just on Fridays.
''The message he wanted to pass is not wearing a tie, not wearing a suit, means we are more flexible and what really matters is not the uniform but something else,'' said Cristiano Carlutti, the former head of used cars at Fiat, which Mr. Marchionne also heads. 
Today, corporate executives have a wider choice of what to wear than ever before. Stylists and personal shoppers reserve exclusive clothes, Hong Kong tailors make office visits and silk ties from France can be delivered overnight.
Yet the bare-bones personal uniform is being seen in some corner offices as the ultimate power suit.
''I always used to feel sorry for them,'' David Wolfe, creative director of the trend-forecasting company the Doneger Group, said of the single-outfit executives. ''Now, maybe, I think they're smart.''
He added, ''How do you stand out if everybody's trendy? The only way is to be beyond the trend.''
Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, wears hoodies and sneakers. Andrea Jung, chief executive of Avon Products, sticks with sleeveless sheaths -- often red -- and pearls. The television personality Simon Cowell and the fashion designer Roberto Cavalli wear jeans, T-shirts and black blazers.
Joe Scarborough, the host of MSNBC's ''Morning Joe,'' takes regular ribbings about his day-in, day-out fleece jacket and jeans. A Facebook group is campaigning for Michael Kors, a designer and judge on the show ''Project Runway,'' to change his ensemble (also jeans, T-shirt and black blazer), which he has worn for nearly all eight seasons of the show.
Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, wears New Balance sneakers, Levi's and black mock turtlenecks, while Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief of Oracle, dons black mock turtlenecks, usually topped with a blazer.
The motivations vary, but every uniform sends a message. Mr. Scarborough, a Republican who is the host of a program on a left-leaning cable network, may be signaling that he is a ''mellow, fleece-wearing Republican that Democrats love to like,'' wrote New York magazine. Mr. Jobs, by most accounts, prefers the nondescript attire as a way to de-emphasize individuality in favor of promoting a collective approach at Apple. And Thierry Rautureau, a Seattle chef who tops every outfit with a hat, wears the distinctive style for branding purposes.
Mr. Wolfe, the fashion forecaster, switched to a single outfit last summer as a protest against how accessible trends had become.
''It is fashion snobbery or elitism that made me think, 'I want to make sure people know I'm not just a player in a game that too many people are playing,' '' he said.
While he used to go to work in ''Tibetan Indian clothes, cowboy outfits, a baseball uniform one season, often street-cleaner jumpsuits and things like that,'' he said, he has altered his look in the last several months to wearing white L. L. Bean oxford shirts and Levi's 501s every day.
''People are really coming to grips with the fact that the recession is the new normal. We're not going to get over it and go back to a wild and crazy extravagant time right away. I think that's starting to affect the way people are presenting themselves to the world at large, with a very conservative fashion approach,'' he said.
Some executives land on a statement piece that broadcasts their brand, as Mr. Rautureau did when he wore a fedora to one of his restaurants.
''A great customer of mine was sitting at the first table, and looked at me, and went, 'Oh, the chef in the hat,' '' he said. ''I snapped my finger and went, 'Marketing, marketing, marketing.' ''
Mr. Rautureau trademarked the chef-in-the-hat name, and has amassed about 20 hats -- straw, cowboy and felt -- that he wears whenever he leaves his house. ''It has been very successful in terms of, obviously, recognition and branding -- I can tell you, everywhere I go, they know the guy in the hat, the chef in the hat,'' he said. ''So it's easy to be catchy.''
Still, Mr. Rautureau concedes that he may have gotten too attached to his signature chapeau. After a fund-raiser in Cincinnati, he was mugged while walking back to his hotel, and a group of teenagers ran off with his hat.
''Now, most normal people would have run away and go to the hotel, which was only like two or three blocks away,'' Mr. Rautureau said. ''Instead, I went back, and said I need my hat back. And of course that was a dumb move because we get in a fight and they take my wallet, and blah blah blah. That was the most dangerous move I've ever made, because of my hat.''
For Mr. Jobs, the turtleneck-and-jeans outfit seems to be about reducing his persona to spotlight the product.
''He didn't want any individual to kind of overshadow the brand, and that includes him,'' said Steve Chazin, a former Apple marketing executive. One of the first moves Mr. Jobs made when he returned to Apple in the mid-1990s was to get rid of the developers' names that used to appear in a dialogue box when programs were started.
''He didn't want people thinking he was special,'' said Mr. Chazin, the author of ''Marketing Apple.''
Mr. Marchionne's outfits also seemed to carry a certain message, said Mr. Carlutti, the former Fiat executive.
''You have to understand that Fiat, before he joined the company, was very formal,'' he said, and Mr. Marchionne wanted to ''break the formality,'' by replacing solid office doors with glass ones, for instance, and declining to dress up.
Of course, by sticking to sweaters and slacks, Mr. Marchionne basically ensured that everyone else would continue to wear suits, Mr. Carlutti said.
''The majority was afraid of seeming to copy the boss, so they stick to their normal dressing,'' he said. Indeed, when Mr. Carlutti had his job interview with Mr. Marchionne, he spent the morning debating what to wear.
''That was a big, big dilemma, because if you wear a tie, he may consider you too formal, too rigid,'' he said. ''If you don't wear a tie, he may think you try to imitate his casual style. So you never win, basically. In the end I wore a tie, which I usually don't.''
The auto chief is now spreading his style in his new city. In February, he met with the Detroit mayor, David Bing, to show Chrysler's Super Bowl commercial, ''Imported From Detroit.'' And he presented Mr. Bing, who usually dresses in suits, with a gift: a black sweater (no oxford shirt).
The mayor put on the sweater for a news conference the day he got it. But even though he admires Mr. Marchionne's style, he has no plans to adopt it, said a spokeswoman, Karen Dumas, in an e-mail message.
''The mayor has his own style, with which he is very comfortable -- tailored suits and custom, monogrammed shirts. It's tried, true and has worked for him this long, so he doesn't feel the need to switch up now,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Fannie and Freddie Eye the Exit

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
A PROPOSAL to phase out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled enterprises that for decades have underpinned the American housing industry, is in draft form right now. But industry experts say the plan will most likely affect borrowers even before it is finalized.
Consumers could see higher borrowing costs in the next year or so, along with a more limited number of financing choices, the experts say, because some of the proposed changes do not require Congressional approval and appear to already be in the works. 
''There's a lot of uncertainty in the process,'' said Barry Zigas, the director of housing policy at the Consumer Federation of America, ''but you're probably going to get a better deal on a fixed-rate loan sooner rather than later.''
Mr. Zigas added that the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage -- the plain-vanilla option favored by buyers for decades -- might become harder to find and more expensive, because without agencies like Fannie and Freddie to buy these loans, banks may be less willing to extend credit at a fixed rate over such a long term.
John Mechem, a spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association, agreed with that assessment. ''Traditionally,'' he explained, ''banks have been less willing to keep 30-year fixed-rate mortgages on their balance sheets, so in the absence of a vibrant securitization market, banks would more heavily favor adjustable-rate products.''
The plan, which calls for winding down Fannie and Freddie over the next five to seven years, was drafted by the Treasury Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the White House, and was sent to Congress on Feb. 11. It proposes three options.
The most extensive of these options makes banks and other private lenders responsible for the entire mortgage industry, with the government helping only veterans, rural consumers and the neediest of borrowers.
Another option proposes limited assistance and government guarantees, in the form of borrower-paid fees or taxpayer-financed insurance, for most mortgages, in the event of a financial crisis like the subprime meltdown that began in 2008. The third envisions more government oversight of the mortgage industry and provides investors in home loans with ''catastrophic reinsurance'' in the event of a crisis.
The phase-out proposal also calls for a more limited role for the Federal Housing Administration, the insurer of low-down-payment mortgages that have grown popular among first-time buyers and those with weak credit or low income. It suggests raising the minimum down payment to 10 percent from 3.5 percent, and imposing that 10 percent minimum for Fannie and Freddie loans. F.H.A. is raising the mortgage insurance premium already -- it is set to increase next month, to 1.1 or 1.15 percent of the loan amount for 30-year fixed-rate loans. The agency was considering a jump to 2.25 percent.
The proposal also calls for lowering the size of loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can insure; the limit, for loans in high-cost areas, is already set to drop, on Oct. 1, to $625,500 from $729,750. Larger, ''jumbo'' loans typically carry higher rates.
Some of the proposals -- like those for lowering loan limits and raising the insurance premium and certain fees on Fannie, Freddie or F.H.A. loans -- do not require Congressional approval. As a result, borrowers can expect to see those fees, tacked on to the interest rate of the loan, rise at least a quarter of a percentage point, according to Sarah Rosen Wartell, the executive vice president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. ''This is all but certain in the short term,'' she said.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were created after the Depression to help Americans buy homes, but the agencies, buffeted by the mortgage crisis, have received more than $150 billion in taxpayer help. Fannie, Freddie and F.H.A. buy or insure about 97 percent of residential mortgages.

HEADLINE: Don't Touch Social Security

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Paying for Old Age,'' by Henry T. C. Hu and Terrance Odean (Op-Ed, Feb. 26): 
Professors Hu and Odean's proposal for government-guaranteed annuities is spot on.
There was a time, years ago, when, after a lifetime of work, one could retire comfortably based on the ''three-legged stool'': Social Security, private savings and an employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plan (a fixed monthly payment based on salary and years of employment, often government-insured).
No more. Starting in the 1980s, companies terminated defined benefit plans and substituted defined contribution plans, the now-infamous 401(k). This switch greatly benefited employers: it shifted the financial risks of investment and longevity to employees, and significantly reduced the companies' cost. Wall Street earned big bucks for managing employee investments.
With the recession, the danger of this arrangement is plain. Many older workers have lost their savings along with their jobs. Meanwhile, deficit hawks threaten Social Security.
Congress should not touch Social Security until the professors' plan, or one like it, becomes law.

HEADLINE: BROKE TOWN U.S.A.

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN

 BODY:
Vallejo, a city about 25 miles north of San Francisco, offers a sneak preview of what could be the latest version of economic disaster. When the foreclosure wave hit, local tax revenue evaporated. The city managers couldn't make their budget and eliminated financing for the local museum, the symphony and the senior center. The city begged the public-employee unions for pay cuts -- all to no avail. In May 2008, Vallejo filed for bankruptcy. The filing drew little national attention; most people were too busy watching banks fail to worry about cities. But while the banks have largely recovered, Vallejo is still in bankruptcy. The police force has shrunk from 153 officers to 92. Calls for any but the most serious crimes go unanswered. Residents who complain about prostitutes or vandals are told to fill out a form. Three of the city's firehouses were closed. Last summer, a fire ravaged a house in one of the city's better neighborhoods; one of the firetrucks came from another town, 15 miles away. Is this America's future? 
Cities across America are facing dire financial distress. Meredith Whitney, a banking analyst turned independent adviser who correctly predicted the banking meltdown, has issued an Armageddon-like prediction of mass municipal defaults. Others -- notably Newt Gingrich -- have suggested that state governments as well as cities should be allowed to file for bankruptcy. Congress held a hearing to examine the idea.
These forecasts of apocalypse have touched a nerve. Americans, still reeling from the devastating impact of the mortgage debacle, are fearful that the next economic disaster is only a matter of time. To anyone reading the headlines of budget deficits and staggering pension liabilities, it takes little imagination to conclude that the next big one will be government itself. The problems of cities are everywhere. The city council of Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, has enlisted a big New York law firm to explore bankruptcy as a means of restructuring a crushing debt. Central Falls, R.I., is in receivership. Hamtramck, Mich., a small city within Detroit's borders, says it could run out of money next month. Hamtramck has only 90 employees, yet it is saddled with the pensions and health care obligations of 252 retirees. Detroit itself is at risk. Large deficits will mean closing about half of the city's schools and will push high-school class sizes to 60 students.
These and other struggling locales do not begin to approach Whitney's forecast of hundreds of billions in municipal defaults this year. (It would take defaults by 40 cities with as much debt as Detroit to reach even $100 billion.) Some industry experts accuse Whitney of exaggerating the crisis and of worsening the cities' problems by frightening away investors. Whitney's theory is that states, whose finances are also in desperate shape, will cut off local aid to preserve their own budgets; cities that have been subsisting on government transfers would become fiscal orphans and, in a financial sense, unworkable. She has not elaborated on her thesis beyond a few well-chosen television appearances. (She declined to talk to me.) But in the two months following Whitney's warning, investors unloaded about $25 billion in shares of mutual funds that invest in municipal bonds. The selling spree sent the prices of these munis, typically among the most reliable investments, into a free fall.
If muni bonds were to default (causing investors permanent harm, as distinct from the temporary discomfort of price fluctuations), ordinary Americans would lose big. Munis are bonds issued by state and local governments, as well as agencies like hospitals, with the interest going to bondholders tax-free. Their relative safety, plus the tax break, has made them a favorite among individual investors, who own about two-thirds of the total, either directly or via mutual funds.
But what if the burden of municipal woes falls elsewhere than on bondholders? Yes, cities and states have creditors. They also have citizens who rely on their services and who pay the taxes, and they have public employees who are dependent on stable public-sector jobs and often-ample benefits. Whitney isn't wrong about a crisis in local government; the crisis is here. The question is, will it be articulated in terms of bond defaults or larger kindergarten classes -- or no kindergarten classes at all? The efforts in Wisconsin and elsewhere to squash organized labor suggest that politicians are no longer so willing to protect public employees. Teachers and nurses are likely to suffer well in advance of investors.
The United States has nearly $3 trillion in municipal bonds outstanding. Though some are backed by specific projects like airports and toll roads, most are general-obligation bonds; local taxes are used to pay the interest on those bonds before other expenses. Unlike a corporation, whose revenue can disappear, cities do not go away -- or at least, most of them don't. Detroit is in trouble because of its shrinking population, as are any number of towns in the former steel region of Western Pennsylvania. Many former industrial cities are burdened with governments that are out of proportion to their shrunken tax bases. Local budgets were stretched even before the recession; now, diminished tax receipts have threatened their ability to balance budgets. Bondholders in those municipalities have reason to sweat.
For areas with a stable economy, however, solvency is largely a matter of political will. Historically, far fewer than 1 percent of municipal bonds fail, and most that do tend to be issued for quasi public projects rather than cities. Typical is a monorail that links Las Vegas casinos -- and that defaulted for lack of riders. In 2008, a record 166 issues defaulted, but the great majority were Florida land developments; essentially, builders used the tax code to finance sewers and water lines and then walked away when the mortgage bubble burst. The issues were small; defaults in 2008 totaled $8.5 billion. Last year, defaults fell to $2.8 billion.
Chastened by their failure to foresee the mortgage bust, the credit agencies have downgraded munis as the cities' troubles have accelerated. But the agencies that evaluate muni bonds are paid to worry about bondholders, not about kindergartners or local fire departments; consequently, they are not alarmed. Moody's says it expects defaults to rise in 2011. But the agencies do not predict a default epidemic. ''Munis are not like subprime bonds,'' Eric Friedland, a managing director at Fitch Ratings, said.
Government entities do seem less exposed to the sort of chain-reaction panic that undid banks. Lehman Brothers needed financing every day; when confidence disappeared, Lehman disappeared, too. Cities are generally not dependent on short-term financing. (A sizable exception involves some $80 billion in variable credit lines expiring over the next six months -- which could force some governments to scramble.)
Another factor that tilts against default is that states and cities carry much less debt relative to the size of their economies than do troubled national governments like those of Greece or Spain (or the United States, for that matter). And muni debts generally come due in a steady stream -- not all at once. Robert Kurtter, a managing director at Moody's, says, ''State and local governments really don't have a crushing debt problem.''
Which is not to say they don't have a problem. For most of the past decade, local government was a growth business. Avid consumption and the real estate boom spurred an abundance of sales- and property-tax receipts; with dollars flowing in, governments got used to spending more and borrowing more. Then, in the recession, tax revenues dried up, while demands for services kept rising. For the last few years, both cities and states have faced severe, recurring budget gaps.
As part of the 2009 stimulus package, Washington gave the states $150 billion. The states became dependent on a higher level of federal aid -- 35 percent of their budgets, compared with about 25 percent before. But the stimulus is ending, and the states will have to cut.
Determining who will suffer from budget cuts is a political and a legal calculation. The cities' problem is that annual spending is greater than revenue; that imbalance does not entitle them to walk away from bond payments. Moreover, states and cities devote less than 10 percent of their revenue to annual debt service. In other words, they have ways of balancing budgets without defaulting. Lately, governments have been taking a chain saw to ordinary spending. The cuts sometimes reflect a retreat from what was once conceived as the essential mission of government. Education is being hit hard. Arizona is seeking a federal waiver to remove 280,000 adults from Medicaid rolls. Massachusetts is stripping out funds for homeless shelters. New Jersey has canceled a commuter-rail tunnel under the Hudson River. If the government doesn't build a rail tunnel, who will?
States are also cutting aid to cities -- much as Whitney forecast -- aggravating the loss of local tax revenues. Camden, N.J., which has one of the highest crime rates in the country, has dismissed nearly half its police force. Michigan cities have seen aid diminish by $4 billion. In San Diego, where the city has cut other spending to pay for spiraling pension costs, residents have formed 56 ''maintenance assessment districts'' to take care of parks and patch up sidewalks. When the city failed to pass a hospitality tax, local hotels banded together and agreed to charge a 2 percent visitors' fee. Scott Lewis, who writes about politics for the Web site Voice of San Diego, says, ''I think the city is dissolving.''
In Wisconsin, Scott Walker, the new governor, declared that the state was ''broke.'' He does not mean that Madison intends to default on its obligations to debt holders; he means that public employees will have to increase contributions toward their benefits in an amount equal to 7 percent of their pay. For some employees, the cuts will mean real hardship. Public institutions like schools are also likely to suffer. Though elected officials prefer not to mention it, taxpayers will also have to ante up. Illinois sharply raised its income tax; Arizona voted for a sales-tax increase. Both of those states had markedly low tax rates to begin with, but Illinois's case should be troubling to bondholders. Even after raising taxes, the state is planning to borrow about $12 billion to cover pensions and past-due bills -- pushing both benefit costs and current expenses into the future.
The deficit problems have, at times, seemed to blend with the issue of pensions into a single, giant mess. As E. J. McMahon of the Manhattan Institute observes, ''This is a conflating of different things.'' States and cities have to put money aside to pay for future pensions, and the portion of that obligation that is ''unfunded'' represents a huge liability -- from $1 trillion to $3.5 trillion, depending on your assumptions about future pension-fund investment returns. This underfunding won't be felt in a big bang but as a continuous burden for years to come.
Nonetheless, because governments are required to make catch-up payments to those funds, the pension problem is worsening the current budget squeeze. In some cities, the pressure is suffocating. In Miami, according to Fitch, the pension-fund obligation eats up 25 percent of the city budget. In Philadelphia, which has neglected to make payments, the pension fund could be exhausted as early as 2015, says Joshua Rauh of the Kellogg School at Northwestern. Rob Dubow, the city's finance director, insists that ''we'll make contributions to make sure that doesn't happen.'' The city has budgeted a huge $460 million contribution next year. ''The real story'' of the pension debacle, Dubow says, ''is that it will leave less money for police and fire and sanitation.''
For a long while, government budget-cutting obeyed a distinctive political calculus: pensions were considered untouchable, so jobs were eliminated instead. Now, governments are going after pensions. Many states have taken the easy step of reducing benefits for new employees. Benefits for existing workers were considered inviolable. But some, like New Mexico and Mississippi, are dunning employees for higher contributions, and Wisconsin may follow. Minnesota and Colorado have watered down pension cost-of-living increases; both have been sued.
Whether such efforts will significantly ease the states' burdens may depend on the courts. In Illinois, where the pension underfunding is among the most egregious, the state constitution says that ''benefits shall not be diminished.'' This language has long been interpreted to mean that when a public employee is promised a pension that increases with each year of service, the rate of accrual can never be changed. Sidley Austin, a law firm in Chicago hired by a pro-business civic group, has circulated a memo arguing that the clause refers only to benefits already earned -- not to the rate of accrual in the future. That interpretation, if acted on by the Legislature, would shatter previous notions of pension protections. Sidley also makes the even-more-explosive argument that if Illinois's pension funds dried up, the state could not be forced to contribute more. Let pensioners go hungry.
That is unlikely. Even in Illinois, pensions will be paid. Failure to do so would embroil the government in court for years. That may be the hope of ideologues, who envision that the courts -- or possibly even a bankruptcy filing -- could be used to alter employee contracts. In the 1930s, progressives persuaded Congress to let cities declare bankruptcy to escape the clutches of creditors. Now, conservatives want Congress to authorize states to file for bankruptcy. ''Some people on the right see it as a chance to whack the public unions,'' says David Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has written in favor of state bankruptcy. It's not hard to fathom why Gingrich, who as speaker of the House in the 1990s briefly shut down the U.S. government, would favor default by the states.
But the fantasy of using bankruptcy to suspend government runs up against a hard truth: even in bankruptcy, cities and states don't disappear -- nor do their obligations. Orange County, Calif., which entered bankruptcy in the mid-1990s after its treasurer ran up massive losses in derivatives, ultimately paid every cent it owed. ''Among the reasons so few [cities] choose to go this option is, it's not clear what they gain,'' Kurtter of Moody's says.
Another reason is that cities are creatures of their states, which fear a negative impact on their own credit. Connecticut prevented Bridgeport from declaring bankruptcy in the '90s, and Michigan is stopping Hamtramck now. In Pennsylvania, about 20 municipalities are operating under a program to nurse insolvent cities back to health. The program has helped Pittsburgh, despite its woefully underfunded pension plan, to slowly improve its credit.
Harrisburg is a different story. A former mayor wanted to create a destination city with a series of ambitious projects, including a Wild West museum. He also approved an expensive plan to refurbish an incinerator so that it could become a moneymaker -- a project that has buried Harrisburg under a mountain of debt. There are other Harrisburgs, cities undone by foolhardy projects, but these cases are particular, not systemic.
Vallejo, which ran out of money when the economy imploded, is more representative. A blue-collar city of 110,000, it had been hurting since a naval base closed in the 1990s. In 2007, the Wal-Mart left town. Then, with the recession, property taxes crashed from $29 million to $20 million. Vallejo cut back on street repairs and vehicle maintenance and reduced its staff by a third. The city sought pay cuts from the police and fire unions, whose members' pay and benefits accounted for about 80 percent of the budget; the unions offered to defer pay raises. The council considered, but rejected, the idea of putting a tax increase to a referendum. Rob Stout, the outgoing finance director, who noted that the police chief is retiring on a $200,000 pension, says the general attitude was one of resistance to footing the bill.
Vallejo was a failure of political will. It is also an example of why bankruptcies for cities don't work. All the constituencies who might have hoped to avoid hardship are being walloped anyway. Labor costs are being cut (though not pensions) and holders of $54 million in city bonds will suffer losses -- how much won't be known for years. Even Marc Levinson, a partner with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, which represents the city, calls the bankruptcy a waste of money and time. ''It's better to cut a deal than go through the pain we have in Vallejo,'' he says. Pain is coming regardless. In some cities, bondholders will be burned. But America's failing governments may be one of those crises whose full impact is not registered in the muni market, or in any market. Until voters can agree on what government services they want and will pay for, it is possible that bondholders will bank the profits while taxpayers, employees and citizens share the losses.

HEADLINE: Charting a Climb From the Depths

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
For months, New York City brokers have been saying that sales in luxury real estate, the last segment of the market to back away from the edge of a cliff, were rebounding. But one week sales were up, one week they were down. One month they were down, one quarter they were up.
And even the most Pollyanna-ish real estate watchers usually added a mouthful of caveats to any declaration of victory.
Now the least Pollyanna-ish real estate watchers are looking at a February surge in contracts signed on properties listed for more than $4 million as quite something. That is because 70 of the listings went into contract last month, the highest number of any month going back to January 2007, well before the housing crisis crushed the high-end market. 
Because of the lag time between contracts signed and deals closed - typically two to four months - contracts tend to be a pretty good indicator of current market conditions.
Donna Olshan, the president of Olshan Realty, which produces a weekly report on luxury market sales and contracts, said that although February could still be an anomaly, ''every week was strong, so we're moving from accident to pattern and actually being able to ask, 'Will this be a trend?' ''
But here comes one caveat: snow. February's gains could be the result of January's losses and leftover inventory, as only the most intrepid house hunters ventured out to look on the many snowy, icy, freezing days of the month, several brokers said. An analysis by Streeteasy.com showed 42 of these high-end properties went into contract in January. In context, though, that is still a pretty strong January. The 42 represents 5 more contracts signed than in January of 2007, 7 more than in January 2008, 25 more than in January 2009, and 5 more than in January 2010.
Ms. Olshan's reports showed that in the first three days of this week alone, 12 contracts were signed on properties listed for $4 million or more.
Wall Street bonuses, which typically drive high-end sales from the start of the year through the spring, were down over last year, but total compensation is up, which could partly explain the increase, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.
Dorothy Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, which listed the $18.9 million town house at 109 Waverly Place that was recorded as going into contract on Feb. 24 for an undisclosed amount, said she believed that greater consumer confidence was driving the increase.
''It's a herd mentality,'' she said, adding that buyers may be seeing ''a window of opportunity'' now: interest rates are still low, and prices could rise because a significant drop in the number of new developments coming on line in the next few years.
Another caveat: ''I don't know if prices will go up,'' Ms. Herman said. ''Our best guess is that 2011 is a transition year, and in 2012 they might go up.''
A Tower Reinvented for Lovers of Fun and Dogs
So you're a developer and you decide to undertake the construction of an $800 million 63-story glass tower in the middle of Manhattan. It's 2007, the financing is secured and real estate is hot.
But then the sky falls on the housing market and you've poured the concrete for the foundation of this towering tower near Times Square, and because you're a developer of new construction, you decide to put the project on hold for almost a year.
Time to regroup, dig deep into creative marketing and gather intelligence on who might rent and buy in this building at a time when prospective renters, and particularly buyers, are going to be skittish, to say the least.
The Related Companies did that before unveiling its latest and highly anticipated development, a mixed-use rental and condo building on 42nd Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues, known as MiMA, for the middle of Manhattan.
There was one obvious thing to do with the new project: Witnessing the increased strength of the rental market over the last year, the developer carved up the space to add 40 more rentals to the 623 it was going to market. It kept the same number of condos - 151 units, on the highest floors.
Besides MiMA, the company has developed 13 other condominium projects in the city, including the Time Warner Center, its last endeavor of this scale, and Superior Ink, the West Village condominium designed by Robert A.M. Stern; it also owns 17 luxury rental buildings in the city.
Related routinely survey residents moving in and out of its buildings - roughly 5,000 so far - to strategize on each of its new projects.
But in this instance, while the MiMA project was on hold, the company conducted an intense demographic survey of 1,300 renters and owners living mostly in Manhattan that went beyond the usual questions about age, income, ethnicity and family composition. The research looked at hobbies, values, self-perceptions and behavioral characteristics, and found that people who might live in MiMA perceived themselves as ''confident, straightforward, fun, loving, aspiring and caring.''
Likely residents were ''social and love to play the role of host,'' the survey found. Also, they strongly identified as dog owners and spent a lot of money on their pets. They liked working out, playing sports, ''living in a happening neighborhood,'' attending the theater and playing games. They also considered home ''a reflection of self and success.''
''We took a bet, but we really believed in the project,'' said Jeff T. Blau, the president of the Related Companies.
And after the housing crisis, ''We said, 'Hold on a sec, let's figure out a redesign, let's expand the health club and add more amenities.' ''
These findings from the survey were useful in determining that the project would not merely offer a ''pet spa,'' like some of Related's other buildings, but something called ''Dog City.'' In Dog City, there are play spaces (indoor and outdoor), grooming services, a veterinarian on site, and a coordinator of dog play dates.
The building contains a private Equinox fitness center (Related owns Equinox, but this is the first of its buildings to include an Equinox gym open only to residents), a game room with billiard and poker tables, a basketball court, a film screening room with a popcorn machine and an outdoor screening area on a third-floor terrace.
It remains to be seen whether all the research and amenities will pay off, as rentals go on the market now for occupancy in late April and sales begin in May for occupancy in the summer.
For rentals, studios will start at $2,895 a month; one-bedrooms at $3,495; and two- bedrooms at $5,995. For condos, studios will start at $695,000; one-bedrooms at $950,000; two-bedrooms at $1.75 million. Prices for penthouses and three-bedrooms have not been released.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

But, as the show's tagline puts it, ''It takes a con to catch a con.'' Or, in this case, three (Jimmi Simpson, Malcolm Goodwin and Serinda Swan), who receive upgraded accommodations and time shaved off their sentences in exchange for their efforts. ''Law & Order'' it's not. ''Matt and I really wanted to do a show where the heroes weren't earnest,'' Mr. Santora said, about the series's humor and verbal sparring, in an interview in The New York Times. ''Nothing is more boring than a procedural show where everyone is in lock step and acting as if it's the most important work in the world. I'd rather gouge my eyes out than watch one of them.'' 
10 A.M. (Fox) FOX NEWS SUNDAY WITH CHRIS WALLACE Margie Phelps, a lawyer for the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan., and a daughter of its founder, the Rev. Fred Phelps, discusses the Supreme Court ruling in Snyder v. Phelps that found the church not liable for a $5 million jury award to Albert Snyder, the father of a Marine who was killed in Iraq. Church members appeared at the funeral with signs like ''America Is Doomed.'' The church contends that the deaths of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan are God's way of punishing the United States for its tolerance of homosexuality.

HEADLINE: New Laws To Control Immigration Pass in Utah

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Utah Legislature has approved an immigration package that includes an enforcement law reminiscent of Arizona's but is tempered by a bill for a guest worker program for illegal immigrants. 
The measures, approved by the State Senate and House on Friday night, would allow illegal immigrants to get a permit to work in the state. They also include a requirement that the police check the immigrant status of anyone stopped for a felony or serious misdemeanor.
Supporters said that the package balanced economic needs and compassion; opponents argued that it would probably encourage more illegal immigration.
State lawmakers initially balked at the enforcement measure because of a likely backlash feared by some. But State Representative Stephen Sandstrom, a Republican, garnered enough support after amending it to focus on more serious crimes.
An Arizona law approved last year drew nationwide attention over provisions requiring the police, while enforcing other laws, to question a person's immigration status if they had reasonable suspicion they were here illegally. A federal judge ordered that aspect of the law put on hold.
Representative Bill Wright, a Republican who sponsored the Utah bill creating the guest worker program, said that if the state could secure a federal waiver, the program could become a model for the rest of the country.
The bill would allow illegal immigrants to get a permit to live and work in Utah with their families.
The most vocal critic of that provision, Representative Chris Herrod, a Republican, said that a guest worker program would draw more illegal immigrants to the state.
''People think we'll be seen as compassionate,'' Mr. Herrod said. ''People will actually see us as weak. They will see we don't care about the rule of law.''

HEADLINE: Egyptian Army's Business Side Blurs Lines of U.S. Military Aid

BYLINE: By ARAM ROSTON and DAVID ROHDE; Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Cairo.

 BODY:
In the late 1990s, the Pentagon announced that it would contribute tens of millions of dollars to a 650-bed International Medical Center that the Egyptian military was building in the desert outside Cairo. The money, for medical equipment, training and logistical support, would help improve health care for Egyptian soldiers.
Within a few years, though, an American training team realized that the Egyptian military was benefiting in a different way. The medical center was, as one Pentagon official called it, ''a commercial enterprise,'' and many of its patients were civilians, not Egyptian soldiers. The hospital was even venturing into medical tourism; its Web site promotes ''a lavishly furnished Royal Suite'' for international patients.
An American doctor who has worked there, Wayne F. Yakes, recalls what his hosts told him about the hospital: ''It was built with U.S. tax dollars under President Bill Clinton.'' Put simply, he said, ''We bought it for them.'' 
Eventually, the United States moved to cut off financing and even recoup some of the money, said several former American military officials. The Pentagon, after all, is supposed to pay only for projects with a military purpose.
Yet with Washington giving Cairo $1.3 billion a year in military aid, the hospital episode shows that Egypt's for-profit military has sometimes found ways to use that aid to further its economic interests. A review of the aid program raises questions about a variety of ventures -- from the acquisition of a fleet of luxury Gulfstream jets to a company making Jeeps for commercial sale as well as for the army.
Now, as the generals steer Egypt toward a new civilian government after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak, those questions about the aid program echo a broader uneasiness, especially in the pro-democracy movement: will a military so deeply invested in a system that conferred great economic and political power be willing to let go?
''It will be a very sore point in the near future, I'm sure, that the generals, the Supreme military council, is a de facto, separate government with an economy in its own right,'' said Christopher Davidson, an expert on Egypt and a professor at Durham University in England.
Some experts and former American military officials say the aid from Washington -- roughly $40 billion since the program's inception as part of the 1979 Camp David peace accord signed by Israel and Egypt -- has served to shore up a military bureaucracy prone to insider dealing and corruption.
Robert Springborg, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School who studies Egypt's military, said that by paying for expensive weapons systems, the aid program ''has enabled the Egyptian military then to use resources it has for other purposes.''
In part because of concerns about diversion of funds, only a sliver of the money from the American aid program actually goes to the Egyptian military. Instead, the Pentagon directly pays American companies that it has chosen to manufacture and ship the tanks, planes, guns and ammunition to Egypt.
Egyptian opposition groups have said that Mr. Mubarak and senior generals were nonetheless able to divert money. But American officials insist that the design of the program -- known as Foreign Military Sales -- ensures that money cannot be stolen.
Edward W. Ross, a former official at the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees the sales, said he was irked by allegations that Egyptians could have pocketed money. ''That money goes to the Federal Reserve,'' he said, ''and then it is only released to a U.S. contractor.''
Keeping Aid Flowing
Even so, the United States has considerably less control over how goods are used once they arrive in Egypt. In interviews, several former American military officials said that keeping the aid flowing often seemed to trump questions of how effective it was. Some of them asked to remain anonymous because they did not want to alienate the Egyptian military. The yearly $1.3 billion, one retired colonel explained, is viewed as ''an entitlement.''
At times, American officials have argued with Egyptian generals over whether certain equipment was actually for military use. That was the case with the Gulfstream jets.
The retired colonel, who worked at the American Embassy's Office of Military Cooperation in Cairo, said that the Egyptians assured him the planes would be used for ''mapping,'' but that he was skeptical. ''It was obvious to us that these were going to be used at least in part for V.I.P. travel,'' the colonel said.
Officers tried to block the deal, he recalled, but ''our contacts at the Ministry of Defense were applying pressure'' to make sure the sale went through.
A former high-ranking Pentagon official said he also protested. ''I remember that it was made very clear to the Egyptians that 'You use this for military purposes and not for a luxury airline for V.I.P.'s,' '' he said.
But the Egyptian military did indeed use the Gulfstreams for the V.I.P.'s, and the luxury jets became a popular symbol of the Mubarak government's excess.
Egyptian military officials declined to comment for this article.
Over the years, the Gulfstream fleet -- which now totals nine jets -- has cost American taxpayers $333 million, government officials said. The most recent purchase was in 2002, but the Pentagon continues to pay $10 million a year to service the planes.
The Pentagon referred questions about military aid for Egypt to the State Department, which has formal jurisdiction. In an e-mail response to questions, a State Department spokesman said the aid ''assists Egypt in maintaining a strong and disciplined defense force, which is imperative at this time, and critical to ensuring Egypt's continued role as a regional leader able to act as a moderating influence.''
Few Americans worked more closely with Egypt's military than Maj. Gen. Michael A. Collings, a retired Air Force officer who was the top-ranking United States military representative in Egypt from 2006 to 2008. He served as the American Embassy's senior defense representative and chief of the Office of Military Cooperation.
Corruption Concerns
General Collings said the Americans were not able to track the for-profit arm of the Egyptian military -- a conglomerate that runs factories, farms and high-tech corporations. ''How much goes back from the actual sale to the military so they can buy other equipment? I don't know,'' he said. ''I do know that a fair amount goes back to the senior officers that are in charge of these particular factories.''
While insisting that there was ''no way, shape or form'' that American aid money had been stolen, General Collings said he was disturbed by what he described as endemic corruption in the upper ranks of the Egyptian military. ''My concern is for the Egyptian people who have suffered enough,'' he said. ''They deserve better.''
While he was posted in Egypt, he said, senior Egyptian military officials told him of a corruption scheme in which Mr. Mubarak handed out cash to the generals leading each branch of the armed forces -- army, navy, air force and air defense force. ''There was a systematic process by which money was given and distributed through the top ranks of the regime,'' General Collings said.
A former high-ranking Egyptian officer confirmed General Collings's account. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns for his safety.
The two former American military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they had not heard those allegations.
On top of the $1.3 billion in annual military aid, the Egyptian armed forces collect millions more from a joint military exercise, called Bright Stars, held in Egypt every two years. General Collings said the United States paid dearly to local companies chosen by the Egyptian military to provide equipment.
In what he called an unusual arrangement, every item is rented. ''Fifty cents a chair'' per day, he recalled. ''A buck fifty for a table. It varied.''
The retired colonel who served in Egypt recalled similar concerns. ''We felt some of the charges were very high,'' he said.
Even with the built-in safeguards, some of the Egyptian military's for-profit ventures have created quandaries for administrators of the Foreign Military Sales program, according to experts. In some cases, military products and for-profit goods sold to civilians are manufactured inside a single armed forces-owned complex.
The Egyptian military has a joint venture with Chrysler to make Jeeps, which are common on Egypt's desert roads and in the army. The joint venture manufactures the civilian Jeep Wrangler, for sale in Egyptian car dealerships and across the Middle East, as well as a Jeep Wrangler used by the Egyptian Army.
Last year, the American military awarded two Foreign Military Sales contracts to Chrysler in Detroit. One, for $26 million, was for 750 unassembled Jeeps. The other, announced in November, was for $7 million to ship tools and spare parts for Jeep Wranglers to the Egyptian Ministry of Defense.
Mr. Springborg, the expert on the Egyptian military, said he was skeptical that, in cases like this, the Egyptians could maintain a firewall between production of civilian and military items.
''Who is drawing these lines?'' he said, emphasizing that he was expressing his personal views, not those of the American government. ''That is the great difficulty of drawing a line in a military that has emphasized so much of its economic function.''
The company that manufactures Jeeps in Egypt is a joint venture between Chrysler and a subsidiary of the Egyptian military. A Chrysler spokesman denied that there was any diversion and said the model of Jeep used by the Egyptian Army was different from the commercial vehicle.
''All components imported for assembly of military vehicles are strictly for use in the military vehicles and under no circumstances are they used for nonmilitary assembly,'' he said in an e-mail. He said no American military funds ''are used to support the production of the civilian/retail sales.''
Another area to look at, Mr. Springborg said, is the production of the well-known M1A1 Abrams tank, which the Egyptian military builds under license with American-made parts. The Pentagon pays General Dynamics to ship tank kits to Egypt, where military workers assemble them.
Former American officers consider the tank manufacturing plant a giant jobs program. ''It's as much about providing jobs as it is buying military hardware,'' General Collings said.
In 2007, the Defense Department announced the sale of 125 more unassembled tanks to Egypt, at an estimated cost of $890 million. So far, Egypt has more than 800 of the tanks.
''There are two assembly lines where they make that tank,'' a former senior American military official said. ''They are all in the same huge building.''
Next to the tank production line that receives the American aid, he said, workers are assembling an Egyptian construction vehicle for commercial sale. He said American auditors visited the plant often to ensure that aid was not diverted from the tank-production side of the building.
A Desert Oasis
As for the International Medical Center, repeated telephone calls to the public relations department failed to win permission for a visit, and two reporters who showed up at the front gate were turned away for lack of a permit from military security.
From that distance, the six-story hospital, on a desert road about 45 minutes east of Cairo, appears to be an oasis in a mostly barren landscape. Three wings jut out from the main building, all with white walls and green glass. The glass, including large bubbles framing the end of each wing, shimmers in the bright winter sunshine as window washers -- a novelty in Egypt -- inch down the walls.
Towering palms line the entrance drive, while inside, sprinklers shoot water across carefully trimmed trees, lawns and flower beds. Security cameras survey the outside walls.
According to the State Department, the Egyptian government built the medical center with its own funds, while the American military aid program contributed $162.8 million for equipment, operations and maintenance.
The former American military officials involved in Egypt said they believed that the financing was cut off five years ago.
But the spigot, it turns out, has not been turned all the way off. Last summer, the Pentagon gave a sole-source, $4.6 million contract to a Florida company called TeKontrol to train hospital staff members for 13 months. Halting the financing, a contract document explained, ''could potentially impact the desires of the Egyptian Ministry of Defense'' to win international accreditation for the hospital.

HEADLINE: A Boon to the Economy Faces Repeal in Montana

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
BOZEMAN, Mont. -- With his electrician's tool belt and company logo cap, Rick Schmidt looks every bit the small-business owner he in fact is. That he often reeks of marijuana these days ... well, it is just part of the job, he said.
''I went on a service call the other day -- walked in and a guy said to me, 'What have you been smoking?' '' said Mr. Schmidt, 39.
For Gallatin Electric, a six-employee company founded by Mr. Schmidt's father, Richard, as for other businesses in this corner of south-central Montana, medical marijuana has been central to surviving hard times as the construction industry and the second-home market collapsed. Not the smoking of it, the growing of it or even the selling of it, but the fully legal, taxable revenues being collected from the industry's new, emerging class of entrepreneurs. Three of the four electricians on staff at Gallatin, Mr. Schmidt said, are there only because of the work building indoor marijuana factories. 
Questions about who really benefits from medical marijuana are now gripping Montana. In the Legislature, a resurgent Republican majority elected last fall is leading a drive to repeal the six-year-old voter-approved statute permitting the use of marijuana for medical purposes, which opponents argue is promoting recreational use and crime.
If repeal forces succeed -- the House last month voted strongly for repeal, and the Senate is now considering it -- Montana would be the first to recant among the 15 states and the District of Columbia that have such laws.
In Bozeman, a college and tourism town north of Yellowstone National Park, construction jobs and tax collections dried up just as the marijuana business was blossoming; residents and politicians here say the interconnection of economics and legal drugs would be much more complicated to undo.
Economic ripples or entanglements extend in every direction, business people like the Schmidts say -- gardening supply companies where marijuana growers are buying equipment, mainstream bakeries that are contracting for pot-laced pastries, and even the state's biggest utility, NorthWestern Energy, which is seeing a surge in electricity use by the new factories. Medical marijuana, measured by numbers of patients, has roughly quadrupled in Montana in the last year.
''It's new territory we're treading in here,'' said Brad Van Wert, a sales associate at Independent Power Systems, a Bozeman company that completed its first solar installation last month -- a six-kilowatt rooftop solar array, costing about $40,000 -- for a medical marijuana provider called Sensible Alternatives.
Mr. Van Wert said that his company was assertively going after this new market, and that marijuana entrepreneurs, facing big tax bills, were responding to the appeal of a 30 percent tax credit offered by the state for expansion of renewable energy.
The Bozeman City Council passed regulations last year sharply restricting the numbers of storefront suppliers downtown. But growers and providers say that even though the regulations restricted their numbers, they also created a climate of legitimacy that has made other businesses more comfortable in dealing with them for equipment and supplies.
And unlike the situation in sunny California or Colorado, where medical marijuana has similarly surged, growing marijuana indoors is all but mandatory here, a fact that has compounded the capital expenditures for start-ups and spread the economic benefits around further still. An industry group formed by marijuana growers estimates that they spend $12 million annually around the state, and that 1,400 jobs were created mostly in the last year in a state of only 975,000 people.
''Twenty-five thousand dollars a month,'' one new grower and medical marijuana provider, Rob Dobrowski, said of his outlay for electricity alone, mainly for his light-intensive grow operation that supplies four stores around the state.
Mr. Dobrowski was a construction contractor until the recession hit, as were two of his brothers who have joined him in the business. He said he now employs 33 people, from a standing start of zero a year ago.
Bozeman's mayor, Jeff Krauss, a Republican, said he thought there was an element of economic fairness to be considered in the debate about medical marijuana's future. ''I don't think anybody passed it thinking we were creating an industry,'' he said, referring to the 2004 voter referendum. But like it or not, he said, it has become one, and legal investments in the millions of dollars have been made.
''Somewhere around 25 people have made anywhere from a $60,000 to a $100,000 bet on this industry,'' Mr. Krauss said, referring to the local startups and their capital costs.
''Now the Legislature has got us saying, 'Ha, too bad, you lose,' '' Mr. Krauss added. ''Boy is that a bad message to send when we're in the doldrums.''
One owner of a gardening supply company in the Bozeman area estimated that a person could essentially buy a job for $15,000, beginning a small growing operation with 100 plants. Especially for construction trade workers who were used to being self-employed before the recession, the owner said, the rhythms of the new industry feel familiar.
''Forty to 50 percent of customers come from construction,'' said the owner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because her national suppliers threatened to stop doing business with her if their products were openly associated with marijuana. ''Plumbers, electricians, the whole genre of working-class, blue-collar Montana.''
There are shadowy corners in the supposedly compassionate world of medical marijuana. The owner of one downtown pastry shop, where the sale of marijuana cookies and brownies accounts for about 15 percent of revenue, said he broke off a relationship with his first marijuana provider, who wanted the baker to use less marijuana in the products and falsify the ingredients to save the grower production costs.
And it is easy to find workers in this new economy who were in the illegal pot world before. But it is also easy to find people like Josh Werle, 29, who took a job as a grower at a company called A Kinder Caregiver after work as a commercial painter dried up.
Mr. Werle, a fourth-generation Montanan, said his family had seen many industries fade and fail over the decades -- from railroads to agriculture, and now, in his case, construction. He said he had also worried about his health as a painter, breathing fumes all day. But the economy is what finally pushed him out.
''I never envisioned myself working in this,'' said Tara Gregorich, 29, who graduated last May from Montana State University with a degree in environmental horticultural science. She sat under the lights in an industrial grow room, legs splayed around a plant that she was trimming lower shoots from to encourage growth. ''But this is one of the few industries in Montana that is year-round.''
At Gallatin Electric, Rick Schmidt said he still made a sharp distinction between medical marijuana and street drugs. Illegal drug dealers, he said, ''should have the book thrown at them.''
But he thinks medical use probably does have benefits.
Mr. Schmidt said his father-in-law, who suffers from post-polio syndrome, was considering applying for a medical marijuana card.

HEADLINE: Inside the List

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
BLOOD SIMPLE: By day, Deborah Harkness is a highly regarded historian of 17th-century science and proprietor of the award-winning blog Good Wine Under $20. By night, she's a crazed vampire compiling tasting notes on the blood of graduate students -- or so her first novel, ''A Discovery of Witches,'' might lead you to believe. The story of an American academic who finds a magic book (and some Chateau d'Yquem-soaked hot paranormal romance) in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, ''Discovery'' notches its second week at No. 2 on the hardcover fiction list. That's an impressive showing for a writer whose previous book, ''The Jewel House: Elizabethan London and the Scientific Revolution,'' had an initial print run in the mid-four figures. 
But then Harkness, who teaches at the University of Southern California, isn't the first academic to score with a heavily promoted mash-up of Stephenie Meyer's ''Twilight'' and A. S. Byatt's ''Possession.'' Back in 2009, Katherine Howe, a Ph.D. candidate in American and New England studies at Boston University, had a five-week run on the hardcover list with ''The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane,'' a historical mystery about a Harvard graduate student who discovers a mysterious key tucked in a musty family Bible and gets drawn into the story of an ancestor accused in the Salem witch trials. Diana Bishop, the heroine of Harkness's book, is also a direct descendant of an accused Salem witch -- though it should be noted that in contrast with Howe's protagonist, she hails from New Haven. Anyone taking bets on the outcome of a paranormal Harvard-Yale game? And which side would Daniel Drezner, the Tufts professor behind the recent study ''Theories of International Politics and Zombies,'' be on? Published in January by Princeton University Press, the book offers no clues, but Drezner does have this to say about a former Princeton wrestler who is still hanging around near the top of this week's hardcover nonfiction list: ''Zombies have been an obvious metaphor for medical maladies, mob rule and Marxist dialectics. Some international relations scholars would posit that interest in zombies is an indirect attempt to get a cognitive grip on what former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously referred to as the 'unknown unknowns' in international security.''
RED SCARE: Some have characterized the hysteria prompted by Amy Chua's ''Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother'' (still crouching at No. 7 on the hardcover nonfiction list) as a symptom of American fears of surging China. Another book on this week's list, Dambisa Moyo's ''How the West Was Lost: Fifty Years of Economic Folly -- and the Stark Choices Ahead'' (No. 6), addresses fears of decline more directly. Moyo, a Zambian economist with resume lines from Oxford, Harvard and Goldman Sachs (who's her Tiger Mother?), caused a ruckus in 2009 with ''Dead Aid,'' which called for halting all foreign assistance to Africa within 10 years, on the grounds that the flood of money cripples self-sufficiency. Reviews of her latest polemic have been mixed. The Oxford economist Paul Collier, writing in The Observer, applauded Moyo's ''brave alarum against our economic and social complacency.'' But the market stalwarts at The Economist were less enthusiastic, writing: ''Here are two predictions about the world economy. First, the West's malaise and the rise of emerging economies will yield a mountain of books. Second, few of these are likely to be as bad as 'How the West Was Lost.' ''

HEADLINE: Is Islam The Problem?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
CAIRO
A wise visitor from outer space who dropped in on Earth a millennium ago might have assumed that the Americas would eventually be colonized not by primitive Europeans but by the more advanced Arab civilization -- and that as a result we Americans would all be speaking Arabic today.
Yet after about 1200, the Middle East took a long break: it stagnated economically, and today it is marked by high levels of illiteracy and autocracy. So as the region erupts in protests seeking democracy, a basic question arises: What took so long? And, a politically incorrect question: Could the reason for the Middle East's backwardness be Islam? 
The sociologist Max Weber and other scholars have argued that Islam is inherently a poor foundation for capitalism, and some have pointed in particular to Islamic qualms about paying interest on loans.
But that doesn't seem right. Other experts note that Islam in some ways is more pro-business than other major religions. The Prophet Muhammad was a successful merchant and much more sympathetic to the wealthy than Jesus was. And the Middle East was a global center of culture and commerce in, say, the 12th century: if Islam stifles business now, why didn't it then?
As for hostility toward interest on loans, similar teachings are found in Jewish and Christian texts, and what the Koran bans isn't interest as such but ''riba,'' an extreme form of usury that could lead to enslavement for failing to pay debts. Until the late 18th century, Muslims were as likely to be money-lenders in the Middle East as Christians or Jews. And today paying interest is routine even in the most conservative Muslim countries.
Many Arabs have an alternative theory about the reason for the region's backwardness: Western colonialism. But that seems equally specious and has the sequencing wrong. ''For all its discontents, the Middle East's colonial period brought fundamental transformation, not stagnation; rising literacy and education, not spreading ignorance; and enrichment at unprecedented rates, not immiserization,'' writes Timur Kuran, a Duke University economic historian, in a meticulously researched new book, ''The Long Divergence: How Islamic Law Held Back the Middle East.''
Professor Kuran's book offers the best explanation yet for why the Middle East has lagged. After poring over ancient business records, Professor Kuran persuasively argues that what held the Middle East back wasn't Islam as such, or colonialism, but rather various secondary Islamic legal practices that are no longer relevant today.
It's a sophisticated argument that a column can't do justice to, but for example, one impediment was inheritance law. Western systems most commonly passed all property intact to the eldest son, thus preserving large estates. In contrast, Islamic law stipulated a much fairer division of assets (including some to daughters), but this meant that large estates fragmented. One upshot was that private capital accumulation faltered and couldn't support major investments to usher in an industrial revolution.
Professor Kuran also focuses on the Islamic partnership, which tended to be the vehicle for businesses. Islamic partnerships dissolved whenever any member died, and so they tended to include only a few partners -- making it difficult to compete with European industrial and financial corporations backed by hundreds of shareholders.
The emergence of banks in Europe led long-term British interest rates to drop by two-thirds leading up to the Industrial Revolution. No such drop occurred in the Arab world until the colonial period.
These traditional impediments are no longer a problem in the 21st century. Muslim countries now have banks, corporations, and stock and bond markets, and inheritance law now isn't an obstacle to capital accumulation. So if Professor Kuran's diagnosis is correct, that should bode well for the region -- and Turkey's boom in recent years underscores the potential for a renaissance.
Yet one challenge is psychological. Many Arabs blame outsiders for their backwardness, and cope by rejecting modernity and the outside world. It's a disgrace that an area that once produced outstanding science and culture (giving us words like algebra) now is an educational underachiever, especially for girls.
The crisis in the Arab world provides a chance for a new start. I hope we'll have some tough, honest conversations on all sides about what went wrong -- as a starting point for a new and more hopeful trajectory.
The Muslim Brotherhood has often used the slogan, ''Islam is the solution.'' And to the West, the unstated feeling upon looking across the bleak Middle East landscape has often been: ''Islam is the problem.'' Professor Kuran's research suggests that, at least looking forward, the more correct view is: Islam isn't the problem and it isn't the solution, it's simply a religion -- meaning that the break is over, there are no excuses, and it's time to move forward again.

HEADLINE: DOCTORS INC.; Talk Doesn't Pay, So Psychiatry Turns Instead to Drug Therapy

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
DOYLESTOWN, Pa. -- Alone with his psychiatrist, the patient confided that his newborn had serious health problems, his distraught wife was screaming at him and he had started drinking again. With his life and second marriage falling apart, the man said he needed help.
But the psychiatrist, Dr. Donald Levin, stopped him and said: ''Hold it. I'm not your therapist. I could adjust your medications, but I don't think that's appropriate.''
Like many of the nation's 48,000 psychiatrists, Dr. Levin, in large part because of changes in how much insurance will pay, no longer provides talk therapy, the form of psychiatry popularized by Sigmund Freud that dominated the profession for decades. Instead, he prescribes medication, usually after a brief consultation with each patient. So Dr. Levin sent the man away with a referral to a less costly therapist and a personal crisis unexplored and unresolved.
Medicine is rapidly changing in the United States from a cottage industry to one dominated by large hospital groups and corporations, but the new efficiencies can be accompanied by a telling loss of intimacy between doctors and patients. And no specialty has suffered this loss more profoundly than psychiatry. 
Trained as a traditional psychiatrist at Michael Reese Hospital, a sprawling Chicago medical center that has since closed, Dr. Levin, 68, first established a private practice in 1972, when talk therapy was in its heyday.
Then, like many psychiatrists, he treated 50 to 60 patients in once- or twice-weekly talk-therapy sessions of 45 minutes each. Now, like many of his peers, he treats 1,200 people in mostly 15-minute visits for prescription adjustments that are sometimes months apart. Then, he knew his patients' inner lives better than he knew his wife's; now, he often cannot remember their names. Then, his goal was to help his patients become happy and fulfilled; now, it is just to keep them functional.
Dr. Levin has found the transition difficult. He now resists helping patients to manage their lives better. ''I had to train myself not to get too interested in their problems,'' he said, ''and not to get sidetracked trying to be a semi-therapist.''
Brief consultations have become common in psychiatry, said Dr. Steven S. Sharfstein, a former president of the American Psychiatric Association and the president and chief executive of Sheppard Pratt Health System, Maryland's largest behavioral health system.
''It's a practice that's very reminiscent of primary care,'' Dr. Sharfstein said. ''They check up on people; they pull out the prescription pad; they order tests.''
With thinning hair, a gray beard and rimless glasses, Dr. Levin looks every bit the psychiatrist pictured for decades in New Yorker cartoons. His office, just above Dog Daze Canine Hair Designs in this suburb of Philadelphia, has matching leather chairs, and African masks and a moose head on the wall. But there is no couch or daybed; Dr. Levin has neither the time nor the space for patients to lie down anymore.
On a recent day, a 50-year-old man visited Dr. Levin to get his prescriptions renewed, an encounter that took about 12 minutes.
Two years ago, the man developed rheumatoid arthritis and became severely depressed. His family doctor prescribed an antidepressant, to no effect. He went on medical leave from his job at an insurance company, withdrew to his basement and rarely ventured out.
''I became like a bear hibernating,'' he said.
Missing the Intrigue
He looked for a psychiatrist who would provide talk therapy, write prescriptions if needed and accept his insurance. He found none. He settled on Dr. Levin, who persuaded him to get talk therapy from a psychologist and spent months adjusting a mix of medications that now includes different antidepressants and an antipsychotic. The man eventually returned to work and now goes out to movies and friends' houses.
The man's recovery has been gratifying for Dr. Levin, but the brevity of his appointments -- like those of all of his patients -- leaves him unfulfilled.
''I miss the mystery and intrigue of psychotherapy,'' he said. ''Now I feel like a good Volkswagen mechanic.''
''I'm good at it,'' Dr. Levin went on, ''but there's not a lot to master in medications. It's like '2001: A Space Odyssey,' where you had Hal the supercomputer juxtaposed with the ape with the bone. I feel like I'm the ape with the bone now.''
The switch from talk therapy to medications has swept psychiatric practices and hospitals, leaving many older psychiatrists feeling unhappy and inadequate. A 2005 government survey found that just 11 percent of psychiatrists provided talk therapy to all patients, a share that had been falling for years and has most likely fallen more since. Psychiatric hospitals that once offered patients months of talk therapy now discharge them within days with only pills.
Recent studies suggest that talk therapy may be as good as or better than drugs in the treatment of depression, but fewer than half of depressed patients now get such therapy compared with the vast majority 20 years ago. Insurance company reimbursement rates and policies that discourage talk therapy are part of the reason. A psychiatrist can earn $150 for three 15-minute medication visits compared with $90 for a 45-minute talk therapy session.
Competition from psychologists and social workers -- who unlike psychiatrists do not attend medical school, so they can often afford to charge less -- is the reason that talk therapy is priced at a lower rate. There is no evidence that psychiatrists provide higher quality talk therapy than psychologists or social workers.
Of course, there are thousands of psychiatrists who still offer talk therapy to all their patients, but they care mostly for the worried wealthy who pay in cash. In New York City, for instance, a select group of psychiatrists charge $600 or more per hour to treat investment bankers, and top child psychiatrists charge $2,000 and more for initial evaluations.
When he started in psychiatry, Dr. Levin kept his own schedule in a spiral notebook and paid college students to spend four hours a month sending out bills. But in 1985, he started a series of jobs in hospitals and did not return to full-time private practice until 2000, when he and more than a dozen other psychiatrists with whom he had worked were shocked to learn that insurers would no longer pay what they had planned to charge for talk therapy.
''At first, all of us held steadfast, saying we spent years learning the craft of psychotherapy and weren't relinquishing it because of parsimonious policies by managed care,'' Dr. Levin said. ''But one by one, we accepted that that craft was no longer economically viable. Most of us had kids in college. And to have your income reduced that dramatically was a shock to all of us. It took me at least five years to emotionally accept that I was never going back to doing what I did before and what I loved.''
He could have accepted less money and could have provided time to patients even when insurers did not pay, but, he said, ''I want to retire with the lifestyle that my wife and I have been living for the last 40 years.''
''Nobody wants to go backwards, moneywise, in their career,'' he said. ''Would you?''
Dr. Levin would not reveal his income. In 2009, the median annual compensation for psychiatrists was about $191,000, according to surveys by a medical trade group. To maintain their incomes, physicians often respond to fee cuts by increasing the volume of services they provide, but psychiatrists rarely earn enough to compensate for their additional training. Most would have been better off financially choosing other medical specialties.
Dr. Louisa Lance, a former colleague of Dr. Levin's, practices the old style of psychiatry from an office next to her house, 14 miles from Dr. Levin's office. She sees new patients for 90 minutes and schedules follow-up appointments for 45 minutes. Everyone gets talk therapy. Cutting ties with insurers was frightening since it meant relying solely on word-of-mouth, rather than referrals within insurers' networks, Dr. Lance said, but she cannot imagine seeing patients for just 15 minutes. She charges $200 for most appointments and treats fewer patients in a week than Dr. Levin treats in a day.
''Medication is important,'' she said, ''but it's the relationship that gets people better.''
Dr. Levin's initial efforts to get insurers to reimburse him and persuade his clients to make their co-payments were less than successful. His office assistants were so sympathetic to his tearful patients that they often failed to collect. So in 2004, he begged his wife, Laura Levin -- a licensed talk therapist herself, as a social worker -- to take over the business end of the practice.
Ms. Levin created accounting systems, bought two powerful computers, licensed a computer scheduling program from a nearby hospital and hired independent contractors to haggle with insurers and call patients to remind them of appointments. She imposed a variety of fees on patients: $50 for a missed appointment, $25 for a faxed prescription refill and $10 extra for a missed co-payment.
As soon as a patient arrives, Ms. Levin asks firmly for a co-payment, which can be as much as $50. She schedules follow-up appointments without asking for preferred times or dates because she does not want to spend precious minutes as patients search their calendars. If patients say they cannot make the appointments she scheduled, Ms. Levin changes them.
''This is about volume,'' she said, ''and if we spend two minutes extra or five minutes extra with every one of 40 patients a day, that means we're here two hours longer every day. And we just can't do it.''
She said that she would like to be more giving of herself, particularly to patients who are clearly troubled. But she has disciplined herself to confine her interactions to the business at hand. ''The reality is that I'm not the therapist anymore,'' she said, words that echoed her husband's.
Drawing the Line
Ms. Levin, 63, maintains a lengthy waiting list, and many of the requests are heartbreaking. On a January day, a pregnant mother of a 3-year-old called to say that her husband was so depressed he could not rouse himself from bed. Could he have an immediate appointment? Dr. Levin's first opening was a month away.
''I get a call like that every day, and I find it really distressing,'' Ms. Levin said. ''But do we work 12 hours every day instead of 11? At some point, you have to make a choice.''
Initial consultations are 45 minutes, while second and later visits are 15. In those first 45 minutes, Dr. Levin takes extensive medical, psychiatric and family histories. He was trained to allow patients to tell their stories in their own unhurried way with few interruptions, but now he asks a rapid-fire series of questions in something akin to a directed interview. Even so, patients sometimes fail to tell him their most important symptoms until the end of the allotted time.
''There was a guy who came in today, a 56-year-old man with a series of business failures who thinks he has A.D.D.,'' or attention deficit disorder, Dr. Levin said. ''So I go through the whole thing and ask a series of questions about A.D.D., and it's not until the very end when he says, 'On Oct. 28, I thought life was so bad, I was thinking about killing myself.' ''
With that, Dr. Levin began to consider an entirely different diagnosis from the man's pattern of symptoms: excessive worry, irritability, difficulty falling asleep, muscle tension in his back and shoulders, persistent financial woes, the early death of his father, the disorganization of his mother.
''The thread that runs throughout this guy's life is anxiety, not A.D.D. -- although anxiety can impair concentration,'' said Dr. Levin, who prescribed an antidepressant that he hoped would moderate the man's anxiety. And he pressed the patient to see a therapist, advice patients frequently ignore. The visit took 55 minutes, putting Dr. Levin behind schedule.
In 15-minute consultations, Dr. Levin asks for quick updates on sleep, mood, energy, concentration, appetite, irritability and problems like sexual dysfunction that can result from psychotropic medications.
''And people want to tell me about what's going on in their lives as far as stress,'' Dr. Levin said, ''and I'm forced to keep saying: 'I'm not your therapist. I'm not here to help you figure out how to get along with your boss, what you do that's self-defeating, and what alternative choices you have.' ''
Dr. Levin, wearing no-iron khakis, a button-down blue shirt with no tie, blue blazer and loafers, had a cheery greeting for his morning patients before ushering them into his office. Emerging 15 minutes later after each session, he would walk into Ms. Levin's adjoining office to pick up the next chart, announce the name of the patient in the waiting room and usher that person into his office.
He paused at noon to spend 15 minutes eating an Asian chicken salad with Ramen noodles. He got halfway through the salad when an urgent call from a patient made him put down his fork, one of about 20 such calls he gets every day.
By afternoon, he had dispensed with the cheery greetings. At 6 p.m., his waiting room empty, Dr. Levin heaved a sigh after emerging from his office with his 39th patient. Then the bell on his entry door tinkled again, and another patient came up the stairs.
''Oh, I thought I was done,'' Dr. Levin said, disappointed. Ms. Levin handed him the last patient's chart.
Quick Decisions
The Levins said they did not know how long they could work 11-hour days. ''And if the stock market hadn't gone down two years ago, we probably wouldn't be working this hard now,'' Ms. Levin said.
Dr. Levin said that the quality of treatment he offers was poorer than when he was younger. For instance, he was trained to adopt an unhurried analytic calm during treatment sessions. ''But my office is like a bus station now,'' he said. ''How can I have an analytic calm?''
And years ago, he often saw patients 10 or more times before arriving at a diagnosis. Now, he makes that decision in the first 45-minute visit. ''You have to have a diagnosis to get paid,'' he said with a shrug. ''I play the game.''
In interviews, six of Dr. Levin's patients -- their identities, like those of the other patients, are being withheld to protect their privacy -- said they liked him despite the brief visits. ''I don't need a half-hour or an hour to talk,'' said a stone mason who has panic attacks and depression and is prescribed an antidepressant. ''Just give me some medication, and that's it. I'm O.K.''
Another patient, a licensed therapist who has post-partum depression worsened by several miscarriages, said she sees Dr. Levin every four weeks, which is as often as her insurer will pay for the visits. Dr. Levin has prescribed antidepressants as well as drugs to combat anxiety. She also sees a therapist, ''and it's really, really been helping me, especially with my anxiety,'' she said.
She said she likes Dr. Levin and feels that he listens to her.
Dr. Levin expressed some astonishment that his patients admire him as much as they do.
''The sad thing is that I'm very important to them, but I barely know them,'' he said. ''I feel shame about that, but that's probably because I was trained in a different era.''
The Levins's youngest son, Matthew, is now training to be a psychiatrist, and Dr. Donald Levin said he hoped that his son would not feel his ambivalence about their profession since he will not have experienced an era when psychiatrists lavished time on every patient. Before the 1920s, many psychiatrists were stuck in asylums treating confined patients covered in filth, so most of the 20th century was unusually good for the profession.
In a telephone interview from the University of California, Irvine, where he is completing the last of his training to become a child and adolescent psychiatrist, Dr. Matthew Levin said, ''I'm concerned that I may be put in a position where I'd be forced to sacrifice patient care to make a living, and I'm hoping to avoid that.''

HEADLINE: Born to Be an Engineer

BYLINE: By PAUL YAROSSI. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I can recollect my grandfather explaining the spelling of our family name, Yarossi, to me when I was young. We're Italian, but there's no ''y'' in the Italian alphabet. My grandfather arrived in the United States through Ellis Island. He said that when he stated his name, Iarossi, at the arrivals desk, the inspector wrote ''Yarossi'' and asked him if that was how to spell it. My grandfather said, ''If I say 'yes', can I enter the country?'' The inspector answered that he could. ''Then that's how you spell it,'' my grandfather said.
My mother's father started one construction company, and two of my uncles started others. I was always around people who were building driveways, sidewalks, patios and other projects. It all drew me to construction. I also had an aptitude for math, so engineering was a natural choice. 
When I was 15, I started working for my grandfather, pushing a wheelbarrow, shoveling dirt, raking and mixing concrete -- anything he needed. I learned how to be a mason. It was good work; you were outside and it kept you in shape. After working my way up, I was able to drive a dump truck.
When I graduated from Manhattan College in New York in 1973 with a degree in civil engineering, my grandfather offered me $4.50 an hour. HNTB offered me $5, so I took the higher-paying job.
Starting out, I worked on sewer projects, flood insurance studies, river hydraulics and drainage systems. We sat at drafting tables in those days. As a new engineer, I even bound reports. I also did design work under a more experienced engineer.
Once I was assigned to produce the drawings for an irrigation system in a private development. It was a Friday before Labor Day, and we had to give the drawings to the client on Tuesday. My boss took a look at them and said they were all wrong. He was furious. I thought it was the end of my career. I stayed until 2 or 3 a.m., fixing them. The big lesson was that they don't teach you everything in college.
When I woke up the next day I realized what makes a good manager. My boss had given me a good talking to, but he had also showed me how to correct my mistake and then stayed and helped me.
About 20 years ago, while inspecting a drainage pipe for a tunnel project in Milwaukee, several colleagues and I had to walk two miles through a pipe six feet in diameter. Once we were through the pipe, I noticed that all that the other inspectors' hats were scratched on top. I'm 5 feet 5, so I was the only one who had sailed through. We had a good laugh.
This is my 38th year with HNTB. I've learned that you shouldn't limit yourself to one area in a company. I've worked on highways, airports and bridges. I also learned to volunteer when someone needed help, even if there was no glory in it. In this business, there's no ceremony like the Emmys. Civil engineers generally do their job well when no one knows they're there.
We have a great transportation system in our country, but it needs some work. In the 1950s, legislation accelerated the creation of our highway system, which in turn became an economic driver for the country. We need to find the same sense of urgency today about surface transportation, to keep our country competitive and to improve our quality of life.
My wife tells me that every time we pass under a bridge on the highway, I look up to see how it was built. When I pass through a construction zone, I'm always interested in the traffic pattern that the engineers chose. When you're an engineer, you're always checking the condition of the road you're on.

HEADLINE: Organized Labor Hopes Attacks by Some States Help Nurture Comeback

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Wisconsin's governor, Scott Walker, began his crusade against collective bargaining by public employees, his state's unions seemed woefully outmatched. But Wisconsin's beleaguered labor movement woke up and mobilized, through e-mail blasts, phone trees and Facebook, getting tens of thousands of supporters to rally in Madison against the legislation and surprising itself that it could muster such a show of force so quickly.
For now, the two sides are at a stalemate, with protesters still swarming the Capitol and Democratic senators hiding in Illinois to deny the Republican majority the quorum needed to pass Mr. Walker's bill. Meanwhile, governors in other states, most notably New Jersey and Ohio, have gone on the offensive against labor, deriding teachers' unions, tenure and generous pensions.
Organized labor has been on a long decline, but the recent attacks against it in Wisconsin and elsewhere have had a surprising result -- they have energized the nation's unions. Instead of just playing defense to protect benefits and bargaining rights, labor leaders are plotting some offense, with several saying Mr. Walker may have unwittingly nurtured a comeback by unions. 
As the Wisconsin showdown has unfolded, several recent national opinion polls have shown strong public backing for unions. And labor leaders say public awareness, especially among younger people, of what unions do has clearly increased.
''The challenge for us is to take this moment and turn it into a movement,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. She acknowledged that she was not sure whether labor could accomplish that, but union leaders are quietly forging strategies to propel labor's cause beyond the immediate statehouse battles.
At the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s winter meeting in Washington last week, labor leaders were laying plans to enlist some of the thousands of union members who have protested in Madison; Indianapolis; Columbus, Ohio; and elsewhere to work in the campaign by the Communications Workers of America to unionize 20,000 T-Mobile workers.
Similarly, union leaders want to harness some of this activism as well as the newfound cooperation between private sector and public sector unions to get hundreds of organizers to help unionize 45,000 airport security employees.
And the Service Employees International Union is seeking to channel the spirit and energy of Wisconsin into its immense new campaign in 15 cities, including Chicago, Detroit and Houston, to unionize tens of thousands of low-wage private sector workers as well as to get them to fight foreclosures and budget cuts. Mary Kay Henry, the S.E.I.U.'s president, said she hoped the protests in Wisconsin and Ohio would give a particular lift to her union's efforts in Milwaukee and Cleveland.
But many labor experts say that talk of a union resurgence is overly optimistic and that labor leaders may be flattering -- even deluding -- themselves.
Harry C. Katz, dean of the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said many powerful forces militate against a labor rebound. High unemployment, globalization of manufacturing and corporate opposition will continue to drag down unions, especially private sector ones, he said. In the public sector, mounting budget deficits and newly empowered Republican leaders are potent threats.
''I would worry more about whether unions can hold off the onslaught than whether they can get a big snapback,'' Mr. Katz said.
But Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor studies at the University of California, Berkeley, said unions might be able to capitalize on the current crisis. ''Labor does best when its back is against the wall,'' he said. ''It's hard to predict who's going to win in Madison. It could be labor's D-Day, where a tough battle leads to important victories down the road, or it could be labor's Dunkirk, where it becomes a bitter retreat.''
Richard Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, has talked repeatedly over the past decade about how labor was going to somehow reverse its slide, but last week, he sounded the most upbeat in years. ''We've never seen the incredible solidarity that we're seeing right now,'' he said. ''People are giving us another look. They're saying, 'We support collective bargaining.' ''
Union supporters held more than 100 rallies across the nation last Saturday, from Asheville, N.C., to Sacramento, including one in Madison that attracted 70,000 people, according to the police. Seventy steelworkers from Minnesota's Iron Range took a seven-hour bus ride to Madison to demonstrate, while 161 union supporters flew in from Los Angeles. Clergy groups, college students and women's groups have also thrown their weight behind labor's fight.
''The kind of energy we've seen mobilized, we haven't seen in a generation,'' Mr. Shaiken said. ''It's like the civil rights movement of the 1960s.''
Democrats and even some Republicans have said the attacks on unions could backfire by mobilizing labor to go all-out to defeat Republicans in the 2012 elections. ''We need to win 25 seats to take back the House, and we need to re-energize our base, and Republican overreaching like this is definitely giving us a boost,'' said Representative Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Before Wisconsin erupted, things were looking grim for unions. They had achieved few major gains during President Obama's first two years in office. And even though unions spent huge amounts to elect Democrats last November, Republicans rolled to victory, including in Wisconsin and Ohio, traditional labor strongholds. Several prominent corporations, including Harley-Davidson, had pressured their unions into accepting humbling contracts that called for a far lower pay scale for new employees.
And public sentiment toward unions and the percentage of private sector workers who belonged to unions had slid to new lows, with many people blaming the auto workers' generous contracts for pushing Detroit's automakers toward collapse.
Stopping that downward momentum, let alone reversing it, is a huge challenge. On Thursday, Mr. Obama dealt labor another blow by agreeing to let Mexican trucks carry goods across the border, a move the Teamsters have long opposed.
Phil Kerpen, vice president for policy at Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group that backs Governor Walker, said most workers see little value in joining a union.
''It's very unlikely that you'll see any resurgence in private sector unionization,'' he said, ''because most workers are worried that unions will put their employer out of business and they'll lose their job.'' Indeed, in today's tough economic environment, unions are often in the position of negotiating concessions rather than raises and better benefits.
If Mr. Walker emerges victorious in his battle with labor, he may well claim the mantle of President Ronald Reagan, who crushed the air traffic controllers' union in 1981 after thousands of workers walked off the job illegally. But if unions somehow succeed in blocking his effort to cripple collective bargaining, they will have arguably won their biggest, most visible victory in years -- and that, they hope, will give them some real momentum.
''This might be the beginning of a real resurgence for labor,'' said Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
Professor Apologizes For Sex-Toy Demonstration
CHICAGO (AP) -- A Northwestern University psychology professor, J. Michael Bailey, apologized Saturday for letting a couple demonstrate the use of a sex toy after one of his classes, but he said he still saw ''absolutely no harm'' in what happened. Professor Bailey said he regretted hurting Northwestern's reputation and ''upsetting so many people in this particular manner.''
The incident took place Feb. 21. After a class on human sexuality, Professor Bailey invited students to stay for an optional discussion of sexual fetishes. He repeatedly warned that it would be graphic; about 100 students attended.
The discussion included a woman who stripped and allowed her partner to use a sex toy on her.
Initially, Northwestern defended the demonstration. Then the president, Morton Schapiro, said he was troubled and disappointed by the incident and promised an investigation.

HEADLINE: Turmoil in Libya Poses Threat to Italy's Economy

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO; Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome, and Stephen Castle from Brussels.

 BODY:
ROME -- In response to the murderous tactics of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's militias against unarmed protesters, the United States and the European Union have announced steps to freeze the government's assets, and the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into possible crimes against humanity.
But Italy -- which gets nearly a quarter of its crude oil and 10 percent of its natural gas from Libya, has billions of dollars in lucrative contracts with the Libyan government and receives billions more in Libyan investments -- has held back on freezing any assets. Officials say they are waiting for a ''coordinated'' response from the European Union about whether the measure applies to Libyan sovereign funds, a ruling that Italy said it hoped would come as soon as next week.
With Libya in turmoil and Colonel Qaddafi clinging to power, no country has more at stake than Italy, which finds itself in its most complicated diplomatic position in decades, pulled between its commitment to NATO and human rights and its scramble to protect its investments in a country that has once again become a pariah. 
''France has Tunisia; Spain, Morocco; and Italy, Libya,'' said Emma Bonino, a member of the center-left opposition, who sits on the Italian Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee. She opposed a bilateral treaty between Italy and Libya in 2008.
Since 2004, when the United Nations lifted a trade embargo that was imposed after Libya's 1986 bombing of a German disco, Italy has been the European Union's top arms exporter to Libya, according to union data. Its politically influential energy company, Eni, has tens of billions of dollars invested in Libya. Italy is also Libya's largest trading partner, and Italian companies are building a coastal highway and have contracts in construction, railways and fiber optics.
Losing that would take ''an enormous economic toll,'' said Andrea Nativi, the editor in chief of Rivista Italiana Difesa, Italy's leading defense publication.
The ties go both ways. Libya, through the Libyan Investment Authority and the Libyan Central Bank, has a 7.6 percent stake in the Italian bank UniCredit, and the central bank's governor, Farhat Bengdara, sits on UniCredit's board.
Libyan investors also have a 2 percent stake in the Italian aerospace and defense company Finmeccanica, a less than 2 percent stake in Fiat, a stake in an offshoot of Telecom Italia and 7.5 percent of the Turin soccer club Juventus.
Libya's Banca UBAE, which handles the country's oil and gas transactions in Europe, has its headquarters in Rome.
Those ties may help explain why Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been slow to condemn Colonel Qaddafi's bloody crackdown. When the conflict started last month, Mr. Berlusconi said he did not want to ''bother'' the colonel. It was only after several days that he denounced the violence. By last weekend, he said Italy no longer considered Colonel Qaddafi in control of Libya.
More significantly, last week Italy announced that it had effectively suspended its 2008 ''Friendship Treaty'' with Libya, which Mr. Berlusconi had touted as his greatest foreign policy achievement, since Libya was in chaos.
''Italy is astonished because the accord was supposed to save it, but whom does it talk to now?'' said Sergio Romano, a political columnist and former ambassador. ''It cannot totally disavow Qaddafi, but it can't sustain him because he's become unpresentable.''
In the accord, which was negotiated by several Italian governments and passed with wide bipartisan support, Italy pledged Libya $5 billion over 20 years to amend for its colonial past there. In exchange, Libya gave Italy favorable treatment in lucrative energy, infrastructure and defense contracts. It also pledged to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from its shores -- a key domestic issue in Italy -- using means questioned by human rights groups.
But the treaty also had an unusual nonaggression clause, in which Italy pledged not to use its territory for hostile acts against Libya -- a clause requested by Libya, said Senator Lamberto Dini, a former Italian prime minister who helped negotiate the treaty and is now the chairman of the Italian Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee.
Analysts interpreted the treaty's suspension as a signal by Italy that it would make its bases available in the event of military intervention. There are several United States and NATO bases in Italy, and the United States Sixth Fleet is based near Naples. Rome has said it will approve a no-flight zone only with the backing of NATO and the United Nations.
The countries' uneasy embrace goes back a century, beginning with Italy's colonial occupation of Libya in 1911 and continuing through the establishment of a monarchy in 1951 and Colonel Qaddafi's anticolonial dictatorship in 1969.
When Mr. Berlusconi briskly kissed the colonel's hand on a visit to Libya last March, the Godfather moment revealed more than the personal bond between two of the world's most colorful leaders. It reflected decades of close ties.
In 1986, Prime Minister Bettino Craxi saved Colonel Qaddafi's life by warning him that the United States was about to bomb Tripoli in retaliation for the German disco bombing, Mr. Craxi's son, Bobo Craxi, said in an interview.
Perhaps the leading player in Italy's Libya policy is Eni, the Italian energy utility, which has been operating in Libya since 1959 and is widely perceived as the second pillar of Italian foreign policy after NATO, especially after Italy gave up nuclear power in the early 1980s.
Over the years, Eni ''never flaunted its power, but it exercised it,'' said Mr. Romano, the former ambassador. Among diplomats, the company's chief executive is widely considered to be at least as influential as any cabinet member.
Libya is Eni's largest source of oil and gas and is home to one-fifth of the company's developed oil fields. After the 2008 accord, Eni pledged to invest $28 billion in Libya to extend its oil and gas contracts into 2040 and develop new fields. The company said last week that Libya owned less than 2 percent of the company.
Since the unrest, Eni has roughly halved it operations in Libya. Last month it evacuated almost all of its personnel and shut down its Greenstream pipeline, which runs from Libya to Sicily and carries 10 percent of Italy's natural gas supply.
''Of the companies that are exposed in Libya, Eni on a volume basis has the most at risk,'' said Claudia Pessagno, an equity analyst with IHS Herald, which monitors the petroleum market.
A spokesman for Eni declined to comment.
While Mr. Berlusconi has condemned Colonel Qaddafi, he does not seem to have had a perceptible impact on his erstwhile friend.
In the view of Mr. Dini, Mr. Berlusconi's sway over Colonel Qaddafi is ''not necessarily very much.'' He said he hoped the bilateral treaty could be reactivated in ''a new Libya,'' one without Colonel Qaddafi.
But with the Libyan leader showing no signs of leaving, it remains unclear who will come next. ''Since no one knows whom to deal with, they're measuring their words, and waiting,'' Mr. Romano said. ''What else can they do?''

HEADLINE: THE LIBERATION OF LORI BERENSON

BYLINE: By JENNIFER EGAN

 BODY:
Lori Berenson has always loved to walk. When she was a high-school student in Manhattan in the mid-1980s, she walked home at night from her job at Pasta & Cheese, on the Upper East Side, to the apartment where she grew up, on East 25th Street. When she began her prison sentence in Peru, in 1996, for collaborating with a terrorist group, convicted terrorists had to spend 231/2 hours a day inside their cells. Even then, Berenson walked in the 6-by-9-foot space she and another woman shared -- two steps forward, two steps backward -- for hours. ''People ask, what did you miss most?'' she said in August, two and a half months after she was released on parole, having served nearly 15 years of a 20-year sentence. ''This was definitely it.'' 
It was after dark, and we were taking a rapid, circuitous walk through a park that clutches the crumbly cliff tops in the Miraflores district of Lima, where Berenson and her 15-month-old son, Salvador, had been living since her release. (Berenson's parole requires that she remain in Peru until 2015.) They were sharing an apartment with a family friend and, temporarily, Berenson's parents, who were visiting from New York. Berenson had recently separated from her husband -- Salvador's father -- whom she'd met in prison while he, too, was serving a sentence for terrorism. Soon after his release in 2003, they married, and Salvador was conceived during a conjugal visit. The boy spent his first year of life with Berenson in the women's prison in Chorrillos, Lima.
In the gusty winter darkness, bicyclists and skateboarders wheeled along paved paths that snaked among graffiti-carved cacti and fluorescently lighted soccer games. Berenson insisted we wait until dark to go out; since her parole, she has been hounded by strangers who scream obscenities or call her ''assassin'' and ''murderer.'' Just that day, on her way back from the playground with her mother and Salvador, ''this woman said: 'You're under house arrest! You should be in your house!' She was with a cellphone, taking pictures. I don't like going to the park, because people stare at you and make you feel as though you're not welcome.''
Berenson wasn't under house arrest, but she might as well have been; the media frenzy surrounding her release on May 27 meant that during her first 10 days of freedom, she never went outside. A horde of photographers stormed the car in which she was driven away from the prison -- three cameramen thrust themselves into the backseat; more jumped onto the roof, leaving dents; a TV van crashed into the back. Another gantlet awaited her outside her apartment building, surging against the surrounding gate with such pressure that it buckled. For many days, the press lingered outside, interviewing Miraflorans incensed at having Berenson in their midst.
Such an outpouring of rage at a 40-year-old woman, mother to a toddler, who was convicted in her mid-20s of abetting a terrorist plot that never took place, is a measure of the degree to which Peruvians are still traumatized by the violence that convulsed their country during the years when the Shining Path warred with the military and nearly 70,000 Peruvians were killed. It also underscores the fact that terrorism, all but defunct in Peru for more than a decade, is still a hot political issue.
In person, Berenson is an unlikely fulcrum for all this drama. She is slight and mild-mannered, with wire-rimmed glasses, an inquisitive gaze and wavy brown hair that she often wears in a single braid down her back. She dresses simply -- often in jeans, occasionally dangly earrings. Her speech is polite and a little stiff, in the manner of both a native English-speaker who has lived much of her life in another language, and a person who resists self-revelation. When she's comfortable, a dry sense of humor emerges -- a willingness to laugh at her predicament. She is most forthcoming on general topics: Peruvian politics, the economy and its inequities. Personal questions she often greets with a hurried, ''Yes, yes, yes,'' or ''Oh, no, no,'' as if she were physically brushing the query away. You feel that she would go to almost any length to avoid exposing her emotional life to a relative stranger: deny its existence -- even forget it, as she appeared to when I asked, on our walk, what part of her early life she remembered as especially happy. ''I don't know,'' she said. ''I haven't thought of that.''
Berenson was first detained on Nov. 30, 1995, when she was 26. She and another woman were pulled off a public bus after leaving the Peruvian Congress building. Berenson had journalist's credentials and assignments from two American publications; the other woman, whom Berenson said she'd hired as a photographer, was the wife of Nestor Cerpa, a leader of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, or M.R.T.A. Within hours of the women's arrest, police officers raided a house Berenson had rented with a male friend who was an M.R.T.A. member. (She had moved out before the raid.) The police engaged in an 11-hour gun battle with M.R.T.A. fighters who were holed up inside; M.R.T.A. members and one police officer were killed before the M.R.T.A. surrendered. The M.R.T.A. was a much smaller insurgent group than the dominant Shining Path, and historically less violent. But on the top two floors of the house, which Berenson had sublet to another M.R.T.A. leader, the police discovered a large cache of weapons and ammunition, along with evidence of a plan to forcibly seize the Congress and hold its members hostage. Berenson claimed she was innocent: she had known the people by different names, she said, had no idea they were M.R.T.A. members and had never visited the top two floors of the house after subletting them for what she thought was going to be a school.
Five weeks after her arrest, on Jan. 8, 1996, Berenson was taken to a small auditorium in the headquarters of Dincote, Peru's antiterrorist police, and presented to the press. Her performance was indelible: she took the stage bellowing in Spanish, hands clenched at her sides, long dark hair tumbling down both sides of her face. After denouncing suffering and injustice in Peru, she denied that she was a terrorist by shouting: ''In the M.R.T.A. there are no criminal terrorists. It is a revolutionary movement!'' -- words that, to Peruvian ears, amounted to a confession. She looked scary: big, ungoverned and enraged. To this day, clips from that 15-year-old tirade are part of any news story about her on Peruvian TV; stills from it, in which she appears to be baring her teeth, appeared on the front pages of Peruvian newspapers when she was paroled. Her father told me ruefully: ''Forty-four seconds, and it ruined her life. It doesn't take much.''
There are practical explanations for Berenson's behavior that day; she was told by the military police that there were no microphones and that she would have to shout to be heard. She spent the prior four days in a rat-ridden cell with a woman who had five gunshot wounds; Berenson was strung out and sleepless. Before facing the media, she had no access to her lawyer. She was arrested at a time when the Peruvian government, under President Alberto Fujimori, had achieved a state of hyperefficiency at shutting terrorism down. Fujimori was elected in 1990, at the height of Shining Path aggression, and in 1992 he dissolved the Congress, suspended the Constitution and passed a number of laws that gave the military expanded powers to fight terrorism. The leader of the Shining Path, Abimael Guzman, was captured that year. By the time of Berenson's arrest, thousands of people had been imprisoned for terrorism, many innocent; Fujimori's Law of Repentance offered strong incentives to name names, and little evidence was required to convict. (Fujimori himself is now serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations committed during his government's war against the Shining Path.)
Recalling her mind-set that day, Berenson told me: ''I was indignant about the whole judicial process. The lawyer had already told me they were asking for 30 years, no parole. It was like: I have nothing to lose. I saw such inhumanity, particularly in the case of the people who were wounded. And thinking that no one would ever hear about it. I just said, Well, I know someone will listen to me if I say something. That was the most naive and stupid thing I did, was thinking that by saying that, it would be helpful.''
It was helpful to Fujimori, who got credit for locking up a dangerous American who now personified, in the public mind, the irrational violence that had racked Peru. Cynthia McClintock, a professor of political science at George Washington University who has studied Peru since the 1970s, told me: ''That she was going to be behind bars served Fujimori's purpose of highlighting the success of his intelligence work, and the government's judicial process. They did a very good job of showing the activists in these movements in their worst way.''
It was also helpful to the prosecution, which upped its request from 30 years to life in prison without parole. Three days later, Berenson was convicted of treason against the Peruvian State for being an M.R.T.A. leader and financier. She was sentenced, along with 22 others, by hooded military judges -- then a customary procedure for dealing with accused terrorists. Her parents were not allowed to be present.
It's hard not to wonder -- as people close to Berenson do -- whether things might have unfolded differently for her had she cowered, rather than shouted, before the press, or betrayed even a modicum of the panic and despair most people would have felt in such circumstances. But anyone close to Berenson knows that she would never expose herself in that way -- indeed, her toughness may extend to not even perceiving her own vulnerability in the way most people would. ''When they sentenced me to life, I started cracking up,'' she told me. ''It might have been sort of a nervous reaction. They started saying things I supposedly had done, and it was like, What? What's going on? It was insane.''
A few days later, she was transferred with a group of about 40 prisoners to the infamous Yanamayo prison in Puno: unheated, at an altitude of 12,000 feet. They were flown in a cargo plane with their heads covered, guarded by armed soldiers, then moved onto a bus. ''I don't remember it being particularly scary,'' she told me. ''My logic at that time was different: you're put in this bus, you can't really hold on because you're handcuffed behind your back, and you need to hold on because you might fall on your face.'' She chuckled, remembering. ''And so that was your concern.''
Not perceiving your own vulnerability is a bit like not perceiving physical pain; it may allow you to tolerate extremes that would crush other people -- as Berenson certainly has -- but it can also hinder your ability to calculate personal risk. For all of her emotional self-protectiveness, at critical junctures Berenson has been unwilling, or possibly unable, to perceive the dangers incurred by her words or actions. ''My coming here, in retrospect I can say it wasn't the best decision,'' she told me, with a wry laugh, ''but I was fascinated by the diversity of cultures and peoples, and I guess I didn't see the consequences of not just coming here but getting involved.''
Berenson's emotional opacity has made her the locus of myriad contradictory visions: to many Peruvians, she is chilly and unrepentant; to Americans who worked for her release and visited her in prison, she is brave and stoic -- almost saintly. But what I heard most often, especially from women, was that Berenson had reminded them of themselves: young, passionate, risk-taking. Robin Kirk, director of the Duke Human Rights Center, who worked in Peru as a journalist throughout the dangerous upheaval of the 1980s, said she identified with Berenson but also -- as a mother -- with Berenson's parents: ''Your bright, adventurous child goes off, and you have to be supportive, of course, but what kind of things are going to happen to change their lives? For me, it was all for the better; I would never have traded that experience in Peru. And I had good luck.''
Lori Berenson had a middle-class Manhattan childhood. Her parents were professors: Rhoda taught physics at Nassau Community College; Mark taught statistics at Baruch College. Her sister, Kathy, now a research psychologist, is two years older. When Lori was in kindergarten, the family moved from Queens to an apartment in the East Midtown Plaza housing complex, in the East 20s (her parents still live there), and Lori went to Public School 40 and Junior High School 104. The Berensons were neither overtly political nor religious. ''I'm not from a political family at all,'' Berenson told me.
By all accounts, Lori was a busy, sociable, highly musical child. She played the lead in junior-high productions of ''Annie'' and ''Jesus Christ Superstar.'' An organized, diligent student, she was the sort of kid who resists telling her parents exactly what she's up to. ''They come home at 3 o'clock; 'How was your day?' '' Rhoda recalled. ''For Lori, it was: 'It was great. I'm leaving.' '' She continued, ''Quite honestly, she does take after me.''
All three female Berensons are profoundly private -- to an extent that seems quaint in our self-exposing era. In October, Kathy explained to me why she preferred not to provide childhood anecdotes about Lori: ''To some extent, my private memories of me and my sister as a child are all I have left that hasn't been already given over to this traumatic series of events,'' she said, with visible discomfort. ''So it's both my private nature and my sense that we've already given it all away.''
Mark Berenson, Lori's father, is the vivid exception: effusive and mercurial, prone to occasional exaggeration and oversharing, he routinely embarrasses his wife and daughters. The writer of many textbooks on statistics and a self-professed workaholic, he berated himself for not having listened enough when Lori might have wanted to talk as a child. ''I was not a good parent,'' he told me, over his wife's protests that he was better than most men his age. ''I called for them at school, I took them home, but they were talking, and it went in one ear and out the other.'' According to Mark, when Lori left for Central America, she made him a mixed tape that began with Peter, Paul and Mary's ''Leaving on a Jet Plane,'' followed by Harry Chapin's ''Cat's in the Cradle'' -- that classic ballad of parental neglect. ''She zinged it to me,'' he said.
A love of animals prompted Lori to become a vegetarian by age 8 -- in 1978 -- with such well-reasoned vehemence that her mother and sister soon followed suit. At 12, she began spending her summers in the Hamptons as a mother's helper, the first of many jobs she held, and saving serious money.
In 1980, when Lori was 11, three American nuns were murdered in El Salvador. ''That stayed in my head,'' she told me. ''I remember hearing about it, seeing a movie about it, saying: 'Wow, it's terrible, it's not fair. They were helping poor people.' I wanted to be a nun. Of course, you can't do it if you're not religious. You adopt another kind of religion, I guess, and that was sort of what I did.''
Berenson is not a creator of romantic self-narratives. When she speaks of adopting another kind of religion, she means that at M.I.T., where she arrived in 1987, after graduating from LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, she had a conversion experience. She began working for Prof. Martin Diskin, who was doing research on the policies of granting political asylum to refugees from Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. She learned that those who received asylum were likely to be the ones fleeing groups that the United States opposed: the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, or the guerrillas fighting in El Salvador.
''The others would get sent back to be killed, even though they had been tortured,'' she told me. ''Why wouldn't you give someone who's being pursued refugee status? Politics. My awakening to the world.''
Berenson spoke of this revelation with a forceful clarity I rarely heard in discussions of her personal experience, which she tends to minimize. Her political views, expressed in periodic statements from prison that her parents posted on their FreeLori.org Web site, haven't measurably changed over the years; on the contrary, her discovery of a world built on oppression, exploitation and imperialism has -- in Berenson's view -- been ratified by her experience in Peru. ''I realized that behind suffering was politics. It wasn't just like, Oh, these people are poor and they're destined to suffer. No. There are interests behind that -- political, economic -- in having a social class be relegated to dying in misery, and being exploited, and being harmed, and suffering repression.''
At M.I.T., Berenson lived in co-ed housing off-campus. Her roommate, Kristen Gardner, still a close friend, recalled: ''She had a great sense of humor, she played the guitar. We both had a lot of friends who were involved in politics. Neither of us were big partiers. It was very down-to-earth.''
During spring break of that freshman year, Berenson joined an interfaith religious delegation to El Salvador. ''When I got there, there was something about it that I just loved,'' she told me. ''I loved the hills. I've been a city person all of my life, and saying, Wait a minute, this is a different world, and I want to be part of this world.''
She lasted only one more semester at M.I.T. ''In high school, I was a dedicated student,'' she told me. ''I was excessively disciplined. And I just decided it was all wrong -- my vocation was something else.''
Mark Berenson recalled her decision with a lingering air of helplessness. ''What could we do?'' he said. ''She had her own money. We taught her to be independent. So we said: 'O.K. Go.' Hoping that it wouldn't be a horror.''
After Christmas break of her sophomore year, Berenson went to El Salvador for three months with a student delegation. Back in the United States, she worked briefly for the Committee in Solidarity With the People of El Salvador, or Cispes, in New York and Washington. ''And then someone asked me if I would be willing to work with an F.M.L.N. representation in Washington.''
The F.M.L.N., or Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, is now the ruling party of El Salvador; its candidate was elected president in 2009. But in 1989, when Berenson took the job, the F.M.L.N. was an aggregate of five Marxist guerrilla groups locked in a long civil war with the oligarchy of El Salvador. In early 1990, Berenson moved to Nicaragua to work for the F.M.L.N. there. The work was mostly secretarial, but she also had contact with the Salvadoran refugee community. When a cease-fire was declared and peace accords signed in 1992, Berenson moved to San Salvador and became the secretary of one of the F.M.L.N.'s commanding generals, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, a signer of the peace accords (he is now vice president of El Salvador). Though she wrote letters home and made occasional visits, she was distant from her parents during her years in Central America. They never knew her exact role with the F.M.L.N. until after her arrest.
Close proximity to a successful guerrilla war, peace negotiation and ensuing political legitimacy must have been a heady experience for a person of 22, but Berenson would acknowledge this only theoretically: ''It was feeling like I was part of a project that was going to help resolve problems of inequality -- social, economic.'' As I puzzled over her reluctance to evoke that triumphant moment, I found myself recalling her sister's reason for not divulging childhood memories: that in giving them away, she would diffuse their private power.
By 1994, two years into the peace, Berenson had grown unhappy. She married a Salvadoran economics student, but the marriage quickly foundered. ''In civilian life, the urgency wasn't the same,'' she told me. ''Since I had dedicated 12 hours a day -- almost 24 hours -- exclusively to a project that was positive, once I stopped having that level of dedication, I felt as though there was something wrong.''
Berenson left El Salvador in October 1994, traveled in South America and arrived in Peru in November with plans to stay.
The morning after our walk in August, under the depthless white sky that seems to hang over Lima in winter, I visited Berenson in her apartment, on the corner of a quiet residential street. Parolees are expected to live with family; because Berenson is separated from her husband, her friend Marie Manrique -- Salvador's godmother -- is serving that function. Berenson was supposed to have moved into Manrique's apartment in another neighborhood, but shortly before her release, the antiterrorist police came to the home of Manrique's landlord and asked whether she knew that Lori Berenson would be moving in. The landlord hadn't known, and she threatened to evict Manrique. There was a last-minute scramble for new housing; a succession of landlords refused to have Berenson under their roofs. The current apartment, which came furnished, is more expensive than they'd like (Berenson's parents pay the rent), and a sixth-floor walk-up is not ideal for a toddler and a stroller, but they were lucky to get it.
Berenson and Salvador share a bedroom beside a kitchen alcove, where a flight of steps leads down to the front door. Berenson hadn't fully unpacked, and several fat woven-plastic bags with black prison markings were barricading the top of the stairs to keep Salvador from tumbling down. He settled for tossing a small car over the bags, listening with satisfaction as it ricocheted down the stairs and smiling impishly. He was 15 months old; a sturdy, sweet-faced boy with dark curls and a fierce attachment to his mother, whom he liked to keep in sight at all times.
Mark and Rhoda Berenson were getting ready to take Salvador to the park, as they did each day. Mark is tall and boyish, with a clipped gray mustache and beard; Rhoda is tiny and serene, clearly the anchor of the two. Together, they form a kind of living encyclopedia of their daughter's legal history, finishing each other's sentences as they narrate a litany of close calls, near misses and what ifs. (What if they'd hired the Miami lawyer they refer to as Mr. Slick, who cost $60,000? What if Lori had gone to Oberlin instead of M.I.T.?) Since Berenson's arrest, they'd devoted themselves to her release, both retiring early from their jobs and, for a time, renting a Washington office to lobby members of Congress. (In recent years, they accepted new teaching positions.) During the four months in 1998-99 that Berenson spent isolated at Socabaya prison near Arequipa, her parents alternated visits every two weeks: flying to Lima, spending the night on the airport floor, catching another flight at dawn. In fact, Berenson's greatest source of conflict with her parents arose from her wish that they would do less. At a certain point, she told me, ''I just said: 'To hell with it. It's over. We lost.' '' She begged her parents to suspend their efforts. ''It's very painful to see them wasting their lives away,'' she said. ''And it just created an expectation of something changing when I knew nothing was going to change.''
From the start, the Berensons' chief hope was that the United States government would effect their daughter's release. Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who in 1989 worked with the State Department to negotiate the freedom of a young American woman in El Salvador under uncannily similar circumstances, said the State Department's efforts fell short in Berenson's case. ''The government in Washington didn't act with alertness in the way that a government committed to protecting its own citizens ought to,'' he told me.
But Dennis Jett, who was the United States ambassador to Peru from 1996 to 1999, vigorously rejected the notion that the State Department could have done more. ''What leverage do we have over Peru?''he asked. ''I think this is a colonial, somewhat-racist mentality that these countries are always wrong, and all we have to do is apply pressure on any underdeveloped country'' and it will deem an American prisoner innocent.
As Mark and Rhoda Berenson prepared to leave for the park with Salvador, he realized that his mother wasn't going along and began to cry for her. Berenson hugged him tightly at the top of the stairs and kissed him goodbye. Her tenderness with her son is a striking contrast to her usual reserve, and his wish to cling to her was made more poignant by the fact that her parole was in jeopardy. The state prosecutor had appealed it within days of her release in May, challenging whether she'd served enough time (prisoners can reduce their sentences through work or study, and Berenson had done so), as well as whether her psychological reports -- which must affirm a prisoner's rehabilitation -- were credible.
If her parole was revoked, she would have to return to jail for five more years. By law, Salvador could remain with her until age 3, but by now he'd grown used to running freely in the park. ''He's had a taste of life outside of prison,'' she said. ''I don't think it's going to be easy for him to go back.'' Salvador could return to New York with his grandparents (as he would have to in nearly two years), but he was still so small, and nursing overnight.
''I'm tense, and I'm very tense with him,'' she told me. ''I feel bad about it.'' She had been trying, subtly, to prepare Salvador for a possible future separation. ''When we're alone together or he's going to sleep, I tell him that I love him and I'll always love him, but I may not be with him physically always,'' she said.
There was an enforced intimacy about life in the Chorrillos prison. Berenson was among women from the M.R.T.A., some of whom she'd known from other prisons, and likened to a big family. Her history of good behavior meant that she was allowed to move freely between her cell and a communal courtyard. ''I used to be with Salvador from 6 a.m. until about 7 at night, and then sometimes we'd get together to watch the news with other inmates from 7 to 8,'' Berenson told me. ''I'd take him into the cell and close the door, and it's like a playpen. I could make his food or mush his banana.'' But when she needed to wash clothes or clean the cell, she would avail herself of ''aunties,'' fellow inmates who enjoyed caring for Salvador. ''They'd give him his dinner and a bath, and I would join them at 8:30 or something, depending on how many clothes I had to wash.''
Berenson says she met Salvador's father, Anibal Apari, at Yanamayo prison, where Apari was transferred as part of a 15-year sentence for being an M.R.T.A. militant. Now a lawyer who often litigates on behalf of prisoners (despite their separation, he was defending Berenson's right to parole), Apari is a rangy, thoughtful man, easily moved to laughter. When I spoke with him in his office in December, he affectionately recalled hearing Berenson's notorious press presentation while in another prison, on a contraband radio. ''Of course everyone said, 'Well, now she's sunk,' '' he told me through a translator. ''I only heard her; I didn't see her. I thought it was courageous, a bit ingenuous.''
When Apari was moved to Yanamayo prison a few months later, he spotted Berenson on his second day. Prisoners for terrorism were housed apart and separated by group. He was able to get someone to deliver her a note wrapped in Scotch tape. She sent back a note of her own.
''When you're in prison, the only way you can show affection is through gestures,'' he said. ''The authorities allowed us once a week to exchange presents with the women. Some people sent sweets or candies. I sent a yellow scarf to Lori. It's cold up there, of course. I saw her with my scarf on -- that's a sign. There was a spontaneous chemistry between us, a natural feeling.'' They overlapped at Yanamayo for a year; then Berenson was moved to Socabaya prison. They communicated by mail from that point on; Apari would send a letter via his father in Chile, who would send it to Berenson's father in New York, who would send it to Berenson in Peru. The cycle took about two months. When Apari was released on parole, in 2003, they were married while Berenson was at Huacariz prison.
Berenson said, ''The idea was that once we were both free, we would celebrate it in a different manner.'' Apari was allowed two conjugal visits each month, and for the first four or five years, he visited often. Berenson wouldn't discuss the details of why the marriage didn't work out, but she told me: ''The last couple of years, he came less. I knew there must be a reason for that.'' In their final year, Apari visited only twice, and on one of those visits, Salvador was conceived. The couple separated before their son was born. In retrospect, Berenson said, she wasn't surprised that the stresses of prison proved too much for them. ''We were far away,'' she said. ''A lot of not being able to express emotions for a long time. It's very common.''
At the mention of the separation, Apari grew sober, uneasy. ''It doesn't make me happy,'' he said, ''but these things happen.''
Apari became involved with the M.R.T.A. as a young man through his Lima neighborhood, long before Berenson arrived in Peru. He stressed what I'd heard from others: that the group had come into existence in the early 1980s largely to oppose the neo-Maoist Shining Path. Robin Kirk, who covered the Shining Path as a journalist, told me: ''The Shining Path, especially for Latin America, was absolutely new. It was like a cult. The Khmer Rouge in Spanish.'' Abimael Guzman, a philosophy professor, formed the group in 1970 and served as its prophet and commander in chief, later directing his militants to kill anyone who rejected their principles or failed to do their bidding. There was a scant social program; the vision was simply to wipe out the past and let the future take care of itself.
''In a way, the M.R.T.A. wanted to show that you can have an armed struggle in a different way,'' Apari told me. ''More like the Sandinistas, like what happened in Cuba, where politics were the most important thing, and weapons were simply a means. When confrontation was impossible to avoid, it should be done respecting the adversary.'' This formula proved successful in Latin American countries in addition to El Salvador; the current presidents of Brazil, Uruguay and Nicaragua are all former guerrillas. But the violent unreason of the Shining Path made Peru a different case, and toward the end, many say, the M.R.T.A. began to emulate its more cutthroat rival.
The Peruvian historian Nelson Manrique told me, through a translator: ''A lot of the M.R.T.A. leaders were sent to prison, and those who took the lead were the more-militant leaders, which gave it a different sort of character. They said: 'We're acting like little nuns. We're not growing, and the Shining Path, which is brutal, is growing.' ''
By the time Berenson arrived in Lima in 1994, the Shining Path was severely diminished, and the M.R.T.A. had been reduced to a skeleton crew with one big idea left: to seize a public place, take hostages and demand the release of M.R.T.A. prisoners. A year after Berenson was jailed, the group did exactly that: 14 of its members, led by Nestor Cerpa, stormed the residence of the Japanese ambassador to Peru during a party, and held it, along with 72 hostages, for four months. (Berenson was one of the inmates whose release the M.R.T.A. sought, but none were liberated; the siege ended with a commando raid of the residence by government forces, who killed or executed all 14 M.R.T.A. members.)
Berenson's life sentence was nullified in 2000 by the Fujimori government, which stated that new evidence had come to light that she was not an M.R.T.A. leader. She was granted a new civilian trial in 2001, although much of the evidence against her was the same. Throughout that three-month trial, which was televised, Berenson asserted her innocence, insisting that she hadn't known her various associates were M.R.T.A. members yet also refusing to condemn the group. While this time she was absolved of being a member of the M.R.T.A., she was still convicted of collaboration: renting the house for the group and entering Congress in the guise of a journalist, with the intention of assisting in a takeover. She received a new sentence of 20 years, including time served.
Today, while Berenson refuses to discuss in detail what happened during the year she spent in Peru before her arrest, she does admit that she knew her associates were M.R.T.A. members (without knowing their real names -- a customary practice in subversive groups) and willingly helped them to rent the house. ''It might not have been intentional, but the bottom line is: I did collaborate with them,'' she said.
''Shortly before I was detained, I had the sense that things were out of my control,'' she told me, referring to activities in the rented house. ''I didn't imagine what it was, the magnitude of it. But I knew enough to have been able to say, I should get out of this.'' Instead, she said, ''I avoided the situation. I rented another place. Very head in the sand.''
What she never knew, she still insists, was that weapons were being amassed in the house, or that violent action was being planned. She maintained that her visits to Congress were genuine journalistic explorations. ''At that time in Fujimori's dictatorship, Congress was the only place that there was some sort of democratic process.'' She called the notion that she was casing the building for a takeover ''ridiculous,'' since anything she might have seen there was public knowledge.
No one I spoke with in Peru seems ever to have believed Berenson's original claim of total ignorance, and such an obvious untruth may have been self-defeating -- not just legally, but by further damaging her image. When I asked Berenson why she had hewed to that story during her civilian trial, she told me it was because she was innocent of the charge of posing as a journalist for the purpose of seizing Congress. More critically, had she admitted any inside knowledge of the group, she said, the Fujimori government would have pressured her to implicate those around her. ''They wanted me to say: 'I condemn them. They are horrible people. They're terrorists who obliged me to do this.' Look, I didn't believe in social justice since I was young to get up there and blame someone else for my own wrongdoings. Maybe I was naive, maybe I was convinced of things that weren't true, and I intentionally avoided dealing with reality. But no one put me at gunpoint.'' When I pressed her on whether the M.R.T.A. trapped her, she responded, ''I was willingly trapped.''
The days I spent with Berenson in August were marked by the drumbeat of her approaching parole hearing, scheduled for Aug. 16. The day before, while her parents took Salvador to the park, she came out to lunch with Marie Manrique and me in a neighborhood far from Miraflores -- the first time she ventured to a restaurant since her release.
Manrique, who is half-Peruvian but grew up in the United States, is Berenson's age, open-faced and garrulous; she worked for years in human rights and is now studying political journalism. She first read about Berenson in 1996 and began visiting her in prison a few years later.
I asked how her Peruvian friends felt about Manrique's making Berenson's parole possible by living with her. Reactions were mixed, she said; she'd just received an e-mail from a friend who referred to Berenson as soberbia, meaning ''haughty.''
''You know, I can't win,'' Berenson said unhappily. ''I'm quiet, I don't joke around. I'm just like that.''
''Here's a question,'' Manrique said. ''You didn't cry.''
She meant that Berenson had never once broken down in public -- a fact Peruvians saw as proof of her coldness and lack of remorse.
''I've always been a very private person,'' Berenson said. ''I sometimes have cried in front of people -- I haven't intended to -- it's something I'd definitely avoid doing. For dignity.''
Berenson told us that on the day she left prison last May, she avoided saying goodbye to her fellow inmates -- to women she regarded as family -- purely to prevent being exposed in an emotional state when she appeared before the phalanx of press that was waiting outside. ''I said goodbye from the door, and they said, 'Oh, you're coming back,' and I said, 'No.' ''
Manrique suggested that letting her emotions show at tomorrow's hearing -- even just a little -- would only make her more sympathetic.
''They would just make fun of it,'' Berenson said.
''I give that to you,'' Manrique said. ''Some press would be like, 'She's faking.' But then other people would be like, 'O.K., there's something under that hard veneer, and it's a person that's worried about five and a half more years in prison.' If something cracks for a few seconds, it's O.K.''
Berenson considered. ''For me, it would be much harder to crack and be able to control it,'' she said.
At the hearing, she seemed relaxed. She wore a pair of gray slacks with a matching jacket and silver hoop earrings. It was a small, crammed courtroom. Berenson was allowed five minutes to speak, during which she apologized if her presence in Peru contributed to violence and expressed her wish to be with her family and to raise her son.
Back at the apartment that evening, she was upbeat. ''I think I did it better than I've ever done before,'' she said. ''Public speaking is not my strong point.''
Although the three judges would have 15 days to render a decision, Berenson had already begun packing; she felt that the decision would come fast and would probably go against her. Like virtually everyone I spoke to, she believed that the furor around her parole had been politically engineered (her address was printed in newspapers and broadcast on TV) and that politics would most likely land her back in prison.
''Her release fell into the lap of the reactionary right in Peru, and it was like a gift from Santa Claus,'' Jo-Marie Burt, an associate professor of political science at George Mason University, told me. ''What they try to do is manipulate the fact of Lori's release, use it politically to discredit the judiciary, which is in the process of prosecuting a handful of members of the armed and police forces for gross abuses of human rights.'' These forces are believed to be responsible for roughly 45 percent of the nearly 70,000 killed over two decades of conflict.
I left Berenson's apartment that night wondering whether she was being alarmist. But less than 48 hours later, she and Salvador were back in jail; because of the last-minute change in Berenson's housing, the police had inspected the Miraflores apartment after the court papers had been filed. Berenson would have to remain in prison until the technicality was addressed. Then, assuming that she was paroled again, another hearing would be scheduled to decide the issues.
Berenson turned herself in at the U.S. Embassy; the press was tipped off and mobbed her on the way to a holding cell. Carrying Salvador, she stepped from a car into an aggressive throng of cameras, all of which captured his panicked tears and Berenson's visible strain as she tried to shield him and push her way to the door.
Berenson and Salvador were still in jail two months later, in mid-October. The clerical problem had been quickly solved, but the state prosecutor was trying other legal maneuvers to prevent her from being paroled again.
Salvador had been running a high fever and was on antibiotics; he wept and clung to Berenson when she tried to leave him with the woman in the next cell while she went to speak briefly with the prison doctor. She'd been having bouts of vertigo -- a recurrent, undiagnosed problem. Since her return to jail, it had been so severe that she'd had to crawl sometimes to keep from falling.
She and Salvador were sharing their cell with another inmate; the bottom bunk, where they slept, had sheets decorated with lions, birds and zebras. The front wall of the cell was bars draped with linens for privacy. A single fluorescent bulb hung from the ceiling, but natural light came through frosted hallway windows. Clothing hung from hangers attached to loops of string suspended from the ceiling. In the corner opposite the bed was a kind of stall that seemed to be both toilet and sink; there was a hole at the bottom and two wedges on which to place your feet. The water ran cold, but the prison would provide warm water to bathe the baby.
After returning with Salvador from the doctor, Berenson tucked him into his stroller under a blanket that said, ''Te quiero mucho,'' and squatted on the orange concrete floor to read him Dr. Seuss's ''Mister Brown Can Moo!'' Then she reclined the seat so he could lie back for his nap and pushed him into the small, dusty outdoor area populated by moth-eaten-looking doves.
Berenson walked back and forth, pushing the stroller, for more than an hour. Certainly prison life had improved since Fujimori's reign; for the first year she was at Yanamayo, Berenson was not allowed a single visitor. After that, she could see her family for only a half-hour through a double layer of mesh that made them hard to see and impossible to touch. Prisoners in for terrorism weren't allowed music, radios or any media -- they were utterly cut off. In Yanamayo, the guards often withheld water; inmates blocked up the drains of the prison yard during storms so they could collect the dirty rainwater. Berenson joined other prisoners to protest these conditions with hunger strikes, but now she underplayed the hardships and spoke warmly of the community: singing together; calling out chess moves in virtual games; the euphoria of someone's being released.
At the beginning, many terrorist prisoners, like Berenson, had life sentences. ''It was somewhat carefree because you didn't have any concrete sense of the future,'' she told me. ''In 2003 a lot of people had new trials'' and received reduced sentences. ''There was definitely a sense of, O.K., this is the amount of time I'm going to be here.'' Berenson's second trial had already happened. In 2002, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights declared it unfair and therefore invalid. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in Costa Rica, agreed to review the case amid widespread expectations that Berenson could be freed. But in 2004, after heavy lobbying from Peru, the court took the highly unusual step of reversing its commission and upholding the validity of Berenson's civilian trial. (The court is charged only with assessing due process, not innocence or guilt.)
During this time, Berenson was managing a bakery in the Huacariz prison, in Cajamarca, supplying the jail with bread and sweets. ''There is some satisfaction of doing something with your hands: it begins, it ends, you clean up and it's gone,'' she said. But in retrospect, she seemed to regret her utter commitment to that job.
''It was all day and sometimes all night. I think I got so absorbed in the whole thing, I just felt time was passing in vain. I could have done other things -- reading, writing.''
Recently, she enrolled in an online translation course at New York University and, with Manrique's help, was managing to keep pace from jail. As for her broader goal, it was still unclear. ''I'm not going to have anything to do with a violent organization,'' she told me, ''but that does not mean that I accept the status quo; I have to do something about it.''
Berenson was granted parole a second time -- still contested, and therefore conditional -- and released from jail on Nov. 5, 2010, two and a half months after her reimprisonment. She and Salvador made a quiet return to the Miraflores apartment, without the uproar of the last time. When I visited the next month, in early December, the sun was finally shining and the heavy, gray waves below the Miraflores cliffs were studded with surfers. When I arrived at Berenson's apartment, after dark, she seemed harried and worn out. She was still awaiting a date for her next parole hearing. Salvador was recovering from the croup, and her vertigo was so severe that day that she was afraid to bathe him without someone nearby. Her parents had gone back to their jobs in New York, and she was grappling with the problem of trying -- without child care -- to create some kind of routine.
She'd had fewer confrontations outdoors, she said, but she seemed haunted by some recent ones. A woman said, both to Berenson and her father, on separate occasions when they were with Salvador: ''Watch after that kid. Something is going to happen to him.'' Another time, a woman with two dogs called Berenson ''garbage.''
''She came up behind me and gave an order to the dogs, and they were put on the alert. Salvador was on the ground, so that really bothered me. She started yelling: 'Why are you in this park? You should be embarrassed to be in this park.' ''
I sat in the living room while Berenson bathed her son in a deep bathroom sink. He was cranky and fretful. ''Que quieres, bebe. . .?'' she asked him gently. She dried him off and dressed him in a diaper and pajamas, and Salvador lay back in her arms on the couch, clutching a handful of her hair as he drank his bottle and began to drowse. Berenson carried him to their bed and tucked him in.
Mother and son seemed a lonely pair that night, in a dim apartment, surrounded by a city she believed was hostile. ''I was much freer in jail, in a certain way,'' she said. ''I wasn't ostracized. Is there any way I would ever be able to function in this country? Or have they created a situation such that the only place they want me to function is in jail?''
On Jan. 24, after another hearing before three judges, Berenson's parole was sustained; by law, she must remain in Lima until 2015, at which point she must leave the country forever. The decision is final. The press reaction was surprisingly muted, as if the paroxysm of her first release and return to jail with Salvador had drained it of energy.
Last month, about three weeks later, I spoke to Berenson via Skype. It was summer in Peru, and she'd cut her hair to shoulder-length. There was crashing in the background; Salvador was throwing things and crowing joyfully.
Berenson seemed more forthcoming and ready to laugh. The harassment had subsided enough that she'd started taking long walks around Lima with Salvador in his stroller. ''As I become familiar with it, I find it more livable,'' she said of the city. ''It's incredibly huge. And it's quite pretty.''
It was hard, she said, to shake off the dependent state of being a prisoner. ''I'm asking Marie for help because I don't realize that I can just deal with it,'' she said. ''I think most Peruvians who were in jail go out to their families, their friends. My social base in Lima is basically Marie. It's not rebuilding my place in society -- it's building it from scratch, constructing absolutely everything.''
In the 15 years Berenson spent in prison, her peers have moved from early adulthood into middle age. ''The world has changed,'' she told me in August. ''Internet, giant malls.'' Technologically, she's catching up, and has grown comfortable using e-mail and Skype. But at 41, she is still grappling with the fallout of youthful choices that have ended badly: her vocation; her marriage; her love of Latin America. The passion that fueled her move there seems to have left a kind of void, and beyond the need to support herself and her son, her future remains a blank.
Of course, Berenson's future won't really be her own until her parole ends; for now, she is raising Salvador alone in Peru, with limited options. If she ever feels despair or defeat at these conditions, she wouldn't show it -- not at 26, with a life sentence in front of her, and not now. Her capacity to absorb fear and discomfort is partly what has saved her -- and also, most likely, what got her into trouble in the first place. But this is speculation; Berenson resists such storytelling, leaving the rest of us to our own devices in trying to unlock the mystery of her biography. What she can't elude is our desire to do so: a notoriety she has sustained, uncomfortably, for most of her adulthood. ''I am always conscious,'' she said, ''of who I am.''

HEADLINE: DEATH TAKES A RAIN CHECK

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
One morning in early January, David Murdock awoke to an unsettling sensation. At first he didn't recognize it and then he couldn't believe it, because for years -- decades, really -- he maintained what was, in his immodest estimation, perfect health. But now there was this undeniable imperfection, a scratchiness and swollenness familiar only from the distant past. Incredibly, infuriatingly, he had a sore throat.
''I never have anything go wrong,'' he said later. ''Never have a backache. Never have a headache. Never have anything else.'' This would make him a lucky man no matter his age. Because he is 87, it makes him an unusually robust specimen, which is what he must be if he is to defy the odds (and maybe even the gods) and live as long as he intends to. He wants to reach 125, and sees no reason he can't, provided that he continues eating the way he has for the last quarter century: with a methodical, messianic correctness that he believes can, and will, ward off major disease and minor ailment alike. 
So that sore throat wasn't just an irritant. It was a challenge to the whole gut-centered worldview on which his bid for extreme longevity rests. ''I went back in my mind: what am I not eating enough of?'' he told me. Definitely not fruits and vegetables: he crams as many as 20 of them, including pulverized banana peels and the ground-up rinds of oranges, into the smoothies he drinks two to three times a day, to keep his body brimming with fiber and vitamins. Probably not protein: he eats plenty of seafood, egg whites, beans and nuts to compensate for his avoidance of dairy, red meat and poultry, which are consigned to a list of forbidden foods that also includes alcohol, sugar and salt.
''I couldn't figure it out,'' he said. So he made a frustrated peace with his malady, which was gone in 36 hours and, he stressed, not all that bad. ''I wasn't really struggling with it,'' he said. ''But my voice changed a little bit. I always have a powerful voice.'' Indeed, he speaks so loudly at times, and in such a declamatory manner, that it cows people, who sometimes assume they've angered him. ''When I open my mouth,'' he noted, ''the room rings.''
The room ringing just then was the vast, stately common area of his vast, stately North Carolina lodge, which sits on more than 500 acres of woods and meadows where a flock of rare black Welsh sheep -- which he keeps as pets, certainly not as chops and cheese in the making -- roam under the protection of four Great Pyrenees dogs. He got the dogs after a donkey and two llamas entrusted with guarding the flock from predators failed at the task. The donkey and llamas still hang out with their fleecy charges, but they are purely ornamental.
Murdock loves to collect things: animals, orchids, Chippendale mirrors, Czechoslovakian chandeliers. He keeps yet another black Welsh flock at one of his two homes in Southern California, a 2,200-acre ranch whose zoological bounty extends to a herd of longhorn cattle, about 800 koi in a manmade lake and 16 horses -- down from a population of more than 550, most of them Arabians, 35 years ago -- with their own exercise pool. He has five homes in all, one on the small Hawaiian island of Lanai, which he owns almost in its entirety. He shuttles among them in a private jet. Forbes magazine's most recent list of the 400 richest Americans put him at No. 130, with an estimated net worth of $2.7 billion, thanks to real estate development and majority stakes in an array of companies, most notably Dole. Five years earlier the estimate was $4.2 billion, but the recession took its toll.
His affluence has enabled him to turn his private fixation on diet and longevity into a public one. I went to see him first in North Carolina in late January. It is there, outside of Charlotte, in a city named Kannapolis near his lodge, that he has spent some $500 million of his fortune in recent years to construct the North Carolina Research Campus, a scientific center dedicated to his conviction that plants, eaten in copious quantities and the right variety, hold the promise of optimal health and maximal life span. The campus is a grand and grandiose sight, a cluster of mammoth Georgian-style buildings that dwarf everything around them. They call to mind an august, aged university, but the brick is without blemish, and there is no ivy.
Inside are world-class laboratories with cutting-edge equipment and emblems of the ostentation with which Murdock approaches much of what he does. He made two separate trips to the mountaintop quarries in Carrara, Italy, to select the 125 tons of off-white marble that cover the floor and even the walls of the central atrium of the main building, called the David H. Murdock Core Laboratory. He also commissioned, for the atrium's dome, an enormous painted mural with outsize, hypervivid representations of about two dozen foods at the center of his diet, including grapes as large as Frisbees, radishes bigger than beach balls and a pineapple the size of a schooner. This kaleidoscopic orgy of antioxidants is presented as a wreath around a soaring eagle, whose wingspan was lengthened at the last minute, to about 18 feet from 12, at his request. The bird symbolizes him.
There are health nuts, and then there is Murdock: health paragon, patron and proselytizer, with a biography as colorful as that mural, a determination to write a few more chapters of it still and a paradox of sorts at the center of it all. What set him on this quest was a loss that no amplitude of wellness can restore, and even if he teased out his days into eternity, he would be hard pressed to fill them with the contentment they once had.
Murdock stands only 5-foot-8, and while he perhaps doesn't look each and every one of his many years, his skin is deeply wrinkled, and his hair is entirely white. His hearing has dulled, so that he frequently misunderstands the questions he is asked, though it's possible in some instances that he simply decides not to answer them and to talk about something else instead. He thrums with willfulness.
''I never had a boss in my whole life,'' he says, owning up to what he labels a ''dictatorial'' streak. ''I've totally destroyed anybody's ability to tell me what to do.''
His energy, more than his appearance, makes him seem younger than he is. At his lodge he leapt from his chair every 20 minutes to grab unwieldy four-foot-long logs and hurl them into a stone fireplace two stories tall. The gesture was not only irresistible metaphor -- he didn't want the flame to die -- but also showy proof of his strength. He tries to fit in weight lifting several times a week, and that, combined with brisk walks on a treadmill and his diet, helps keep his weight at about 140 pounds, though he has always been naturally slender, even when he ate what he pleased. He doesn't count calories or believe in extreme caloric restriction as a way to extend life. But he does believe that excess weight is a sure way to abbreviate it, and reprimands friends, acquaintances and even strangers who are heavy.
In 2006, when he first met with D. H. Griffin, whose demolition company was to prepare the site for the research campus, he took note of Griffin's size. At 5-foot-11, he weighed about 285 pounds.
''You're probably going to die before this job's done, because you're so fat and unhealthy,'' Murdock told Griffin, as Griffin recalls, adding that Griffin's family would wind up paying extra money for an extra-large coffin. Later he did something more constructive: he offered Griffin a bonus if he lost 30 pounds. Griffin did and collected $100,000. He has since regained 22 of them.
In restaurants Murdock will push the butter dish toward the server and say, ''Take the death off the table.'' He will ask employees or friends who are putting sugar in coffee or milk in tea why they want to kill themselves and will upbraid people leaving healthful food unfinished about the vitamins they're squandering.
I experienced this during a visit in early February to his California ranch, where I joined him for lunch: a six-fruit smoothie; a mixed-leaf salad with toasted walnuts, fennel and blood orange; a soup with more than eight vegetables and beans; a sliver of grilled Dover sole on a bed of baby carrots, broccoli and brown rice.
''How did you like your soup?'' he asked me after one of his household staff members removed it. I said it was just fine.
''Did you eat all your juice?'' he added, referring to the broth. I said I had left perhaps an inch of it.
He shot me a stern look. ''You got a little bit of it,'' he said. ''I get a lot -- every bit I can.'' He shrugged his shoulders. ''That's O.K. You'll go before me.''
There was dessert, too: flourless cookies made with dark chocolate and walnuts, both rich in antioxidants, and sweetened not with sugar but with honey. He quickly polished one off and then called out to the kitchen to say that he wanted the cookies to make an encore appearance after dinner, so he could have another then. Five minutes later, still cookie-struck, he walked into the kitchen to ask that a few be packed up for him to have handy through the afternoon.
Murdock grew up in the tiny town of Wayne, Ohio, the middle child of three and the only son. He didn't see much of his father, a traveling salesman with an inconsistent income, but was close to his mother, who took in laundry and scrubbed floors to help make ends meet. He softens when he recalls sitting in her lap while she read to him, a memory that he says hasn't been dimmed by the length of her absence. She died, from cancer, when she was just 42 and he 17.
By then he was living on his own, having dropped out of school at 14. He has dyslexia, though no one initially realized it, and never managed grades better than D's. ''Everybody laughed at me,'' he says. ''They thought I was an imbecile.'' He traded classwork for changing oil and pumping gas; he lived in a room above the service station.
When he talks about his childhood, his lack of formal education is one of two themes he brings up again and again, usually to cast it as an inadvertent gift. He says that because he felt the need to compensate for it, he read prodigiously and, he stresses, without the narrowness of focus he notices in many conventionally learned people. Biographies of Andrew Carnegie, Socratic dialogues, Shakespearean sonnets, ''The Prince''-- he devoured it all over time. He also studied something called brain acceleration, which he says taught him to think about three things at once. ''I'll match wits with anybody,'' he says. ''I don't care if they have the top degree in the world.'' He notes that everyone on his research campus's board is a Ph.D. or an M.D. But he, the high-school dropout, presides over the meetings.
The other theme is how low the point from which he rose to riches was. After finishing several years of service in the U.S. Army at age 22, he was not only penniless but also homeless, and slept for a while under a bush in a Detroit park. He would cadge free coffee from a friend employed at a greasy spoon. A man who worked for a loan company met Murdock there, learned that he was a veteran and offered to help.
With the man's assistance, he rounded up $1,200 in loans and bought that diner, which he whipped into freshly scrubbed, newly painted shape. He sold it a year and a half later for $1,900, spent $75 of the profit on a car, set out for California and stopped along the way in Phoenix, where the opportunity to make money was too good to pass up. He stayed for 17 years, buying cheap land and constructing affordable houses for all the people moving South and West after World War II. ''I was building as fast as I could break ground,'' he says. ''Bang, bang, bang: I could hardly get a house finished before it was sold.''
Houses and small office buildings were followed by larger office buildings, in Arizona and California and eventually the Midwest. To invest all the money pouring in, he bought stock, then more stock, then whole companies. He acquired control of International Mining in 1978 and in the early 1980s became the largest shareholder in Occidental Petroleum by selling the company his 18 percent interest in Iowa Beef. (That was back when he and filet were on friendly terms.) He took over Dole, part of a larger company, Castle & Cooke, which he acquired control of in 1985.
It was a heady ride, and his partner for the headiest stretch of it was a raven-haired, German-born beauty who became his wife in 1967, when he was in his mid-40s and she was in her late 20s. Her name was Gabriele. Although he was married twice before, he hadn't fathered any children. With Gabriele he had two boys, who joined a son of hers whom he adopted. He moved his base of operations from Arizona to California and, for his new family, bought the legendary Conrad Hilton estate in Beverly Hills. Soon afterward, for weekend getaways, he also bought the ranch, in Ventura County, about a 30-minute drive away. For the three boys, he got all those animals, and for Gabriele, jewels, gowns, fresh flowers -- whatever she wanted.
''He adored her,'' says E. Rolland Dickson, Murdock's personal physician at the Mayo Clinic and a longtime close friend, adding that even 15 years into the marriage, ''he had that look of a young guy on his honeymoon.''
He and Gabriele traveled the world; he chose one trip, she the next. Murdock says: ''She always wanted to do what I wanted to do, and I always wanted to do what she wanted to do. It's very hard to find somebody that way.''
And harder still to lose her. In 1983 she was given a diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer. There was no effective treatment, though he looked wide and far. The couple took a suite at a hotel adjacent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Determined to heal her somehow, he wondered about nutrition and began to do extensive research into what she -- and he, in support of her -- should eat. The answer was more or less the kind of diet he has stuck to ever since.
Because many cancers have environmental links and the one she got didn't run in her family, he suspects that lifestyle was a culprit, and is convinced that if the two of them had eaten better sooner, she would have been spared the surgery, the radiation, the chemotherapy, the wheelchair, the year and a half of hope and fear and pain. ''If I had known what I know today,'' he says, ''I could have saved my wife's life. And I think I could have saved my mother's life too.'' Gabriele Murdock died 18 years into their marriage, in 1985. She was 43.
Less than a year later, the oldest of the couple's three sons, Eugene, drowned in the estate's pool, apparently after accidentally hitting his head. He was 23. Even then death wasn't done with the family Murdock and Gabriele created. About seven years ago, the second of the three boys, David II, had a fatal car crash as he sped down the Santa Monica Freeway. He was 36. The family is down to just Murdock and his youngest son, Justin, now 38, who helps run NovaRx, a biotechnology firm in which Murdock owns a controlling share. Murdock did marry a fourth time, and then a fifth, but neither union lasted long. He has been single for more than a decade now, though he frequently makes passing references to ''my wife,'' meaning Gabriele and only Gabriele, photographs of whom dominate his homes. The other wives don't show up.
''I had a lot of tragedy,'' he told me one of the few times he engaged the topic of his family's steady, cruel erosion. The room wasn't ringing, and he turned his face away.
For a few years after losing Gabriele and Eugene, he couldn't find the energy for much of anything and delegated many business dealings to subordinates. When his zest finally returned, he was consumed by the subject of what and how he and Gabriele should have eaten. He pored over medical journals, befriended and debriefed experts, gave speeches. Bit by bit his entire world became one of well-being. Out behind the orchid conservatory on his California ranch, he constructed tens of thousands of square feet of additional greenhouse space, where a small posse of gardeners tend an encyclopedic array of produce. If he can't find something at the grocery store, he can probably just pluck it from here. When I walked through the greenhouses recently, I spotted Swiss chard, cabbage, celery, onions, spinach, beets, radishes/, eggplant, artichokes, red peppers, rhubarb, baby bananas, strawberries, grapefruit, kumquats, clementines, lemons, star fruit and a whole lot else I couldn't immediately identify. Where Willy Wonka had rivers of chocolate, Murdock has thickets of cruciferous vegetables.
At Dole's headquarters in Westlake Village, Calif., just a 15-minute drive from the ranch, employees eat in a subsidized cafeteria where salad is plentiful and chicken nuggets unthinkable, and they have free access to a company gym where personal training, also subsidized, is $30 an hour. The exhortation to eat right is so pervasive that if you call Dole and are put on hold, you don't hear Muzak but, instead, sunny dietary bromides and nutrition news bulletins.
Across the street is a hotel, completed in 2006 and operated by the Four Seasons, that Murdock built to house the California Health and Longevity Institute, a combination medical suite, spa and demonstration kitchen. Clients can be screened for various cancers, have their body fat measured inside a special pod and get an earful about quinoa, along with a cooking tutorial. On the hotel's room-service menus, in place of heart-shaped symbols designating low-cholesterol selections, there are L-shaped symbols designating dishes that might, by dint of fiber or antioxidants or omega-3 fatty acids, promote longevity. The hummus wears such a tag; so does the multigrain penne with a meatless tomato sauce.
The institute and hotel are meant to turn a profit -- and do, a small one -- and they underscore how interconnected Murdock's evangelism and business interests have become. As does the research campus. Dole is the world's largest producer of fruits and vegetables, so studies into their health benefits have a huge potential upside for the company. Many of the foods under the microscope are foods Dole sells.
Blueberries, for example. Murdock lured Mary Ann Lila, a world-renowned blueberry authority, to the research campus from the University of Illinois, where, she says, she simply didn't have anything like the instant access to specialized equipment that Murdock has made possible. The campus has a particularly impressive lineup of high-powered nuclear magnetic-resonance machines, which analyze compounds on a molecular level. Lila -- technically affiliated now with North Carolina State University -- and colleagues are using the fastest of these to look for the unknown natural compounds in blueberries that will speed their efforts to maximize the fruit's medicinal properties. They believe blueberries could help combat several diseases, including obesity.
Other researchers on campus are investigating such matters as the extent to which quercetin, found in the skins of apples, can have an anti-inflammatory effect; whether Chia seeds are as useful a source of omega-3 fatty acids as, say, halibut; and how significantly and reliably a certain type of fermented Chinese tea can lower bad cholesterol. But while they're working in a setting created by Murdock, they're for the most part from the faculties of leading North Carolina universities that aren't formally affiliated with Dole, and they might well be doing this work anywhere. Besides which, Murdock's own fortunes aren't tethered to how well Dole does, with or without the boost of campus research. Over the decades he has collected companies the way he has collected sheep, and owns the one, for example, that provided all the red brick for the campus.
Murdock checks in with researchers regularly and impatiently, asking them why science is so stubbornly sluggish. He moves fast. Little more than two years elapsed between the demolition of six million square feet of shuttered textile mills and the opening of the campus in October 2008. He chose this location because he owned those mills in the early 1980s, long before the textile industry tanked, and still had land and investments all around them. He has had the lodge nearby for almost three decades.
The luxury with which the campus is furnished is almost as remarkable as the speed with which it materialized. There are tables carved from rare Hawaiian palm trees; desks from India whose black marble surfaces have lapis lazuli and jade inlays; marble statuettes. Lila cracks: ''Normally, when you have a lab and someone's wheeling in liquid nitrogen, you don't have to worry about them hitting a Ming vase. But we have a different paradigm here.''
This lavishness is just one clue that the campus reflects a passion as much as it does a business strategy. Another is the millions Murdock is spending on the Murdock Study, with the goal of enrolling 50,000 Kannapolis-area residents, taking full blood work from them, storing it in a refrigerated warehouse with backup generators for the backup generators and annually monitoring the residents' health. The hope is that the study will help determine what biological markers today can tell doctors about the onset of disease decades later. The results won't be proprietary to Dole.
Murdock says that he wants to slay such killers as diabetes, heart disease and, of course, cancer, and the scientists around him say that in some epically optimistic corner of his mind, he quite possibly believes he can. Unable to save Gabriele or the boys, he's out to save the world. It's certainly not his own health that stands to benefit most from the campus, because the nutrients studied there are ones he's already consuming in abundance, to cover his bases. What the research is more likely to do, at least during his lifetime, is validate that he knows better than anybody else.
Dreamers have pursued longevity -- and, in some cases, immortality -- in all sorts of wacky and exacting ways, from hyperbaric chambers to cryogenics. And they have sought to fine-tune their bodies with all manner of rigorously proscribed diets: only raw foods; only plants; only the flesh, fruit and nuts that prehistoric humans, not yet wise to agriculture, would have hunted and foraged.
Murdock's methods are, in that context, utterly mainstream, an example of extraordinary discipline rather than frontier science. Sure, the rinds and peels -- which he explains by saying that the parts of fruits most directly sun-kissed are bound to harbor the most energy -- may be a little strange. But they're not dangerous-strange, and a plant-based diet that's low in animal fat while still allowing for protein sources beyond legumes has emerged as the consensus recommendation of most medical professionals. Murdock never neglects protein: the breakfast he ate just hours before our lunch included not only a smoothie and 10-grain cereal in almond milk but also a bevy of sardines.
He is careful to get a little bit of daily sun, which is crucial for proper absorption of vitamin D, but not too much, lest he court skin cancer. He tries to go to bed no later than 11 p.m. and to get more than six hours of sleep every night. Perhaps the only real eyebrow raiser in his regimen is his rejection of any medicine that isn't truly necessary. When he had that sore throat, he didn't suck on a lozenge or swallow aspirin. When he has had precancerous growths removed from his face, he has passed on anesthetics.
''I just turned my brain on and said, 'Cut!' '' he said. ''Of course it hurt. But I controlled that.''
The doctors who work with Murdock say that he has ideal blood pressure, clear arteries, good muscle tone. But they doubt that these will carry him to 125. They point out that he didn't adopt his healthful ways until his 60s, and they note that genes often trump behavior. Although Murdock's father lived well into his 90s, his mother died young, and his sisters are both dead.
The life expectancy for an American man born today is only 751/2, and demographic data suggest that an American man who has made it to 87 can expect, on average, another 51/4 years. The longest life span on record is 1221/2, and that belonged to a woman -- French, of course -- who died in 1997. Her closest male competitors reached only 1151/2.
As for beating those statistics, ''There's been no documented intervention that has been shown to radically extend duration of life -- ever,'' says S. Jay Olshansky, an expert on aging who teaches at the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Told of Murdock's health-minded habits, Olshansky said that just about all of them were prudent ways of probably ''letting his body live out to its genetic potential,'' but added, ''He'll be disappointed when he doesn't reach 125.''
Robert Califf, a Duke University cardiologist who sits on the research campus board, says that even Murdock's laudable diet isn't a provable longevity booster. ''You can do short-term studies that give you a lot of information about biology,'' Califf says. ''But knowing whether eating a food actually causes you to live longer than not eating that food: the answer to that will only come with a study of an entire generation.''
If he could live to 125, why he would want to? More than his hearing will ebb. He may never find the right companion for the long fade-out. Although he says that he'd ideally like to marry again, he acknowledges that few women are suited to his degree of autonomy and wanderlust.
I got the feeling that part of what pushes him toward 125 is the sheer challenge. Years are yet another thing to collect, and he likes racking up accomplishments others haven't. He bragged to me several times about once transplanting a centuries-old tree larger than any ever successfully moved. And he drew my attention to scores of massive, oddly shaped boulders from Thailand's River Kwai that decorate the grounds of the ranch, the residence where he spends most of his time (he sold the former Hilton estate 10 years ago). Each weighs several tons; he brought over six shiploads. ''These are the only boulders that ever left Thailand,'' he says. ''You can't take them out now.''
He says that he still gets pleasure from them, and from much of the rest of his gilded life, and that he doesn't know what, if anything, comes after. ''There have been billions of people born and billions of people died, and people think God's going to be standing at the gate ready to shake hands with everybody who's coming through?'' he says. Although he is a churchgoing Christian, death, he concedes, could simply be blackness, nullity.
During my last visit with him, Murdock took me out to see the koi. He enjoys tossing them their pellets of food from the red wood bridge that arches over the lake, and in particular delights in the way he merely has to stamp his feet to make them come swimming toward the bridge in a frenzy, eager for sustenance from on high.
''You want to know what I like and what makes me happy?'' he said as we stood on the bridge. ''Just having these fish makes me happy. Every one is alive because of me.'' He pointed out that some were ordinary and some magnificent -- just like people, he said -- and told me that after a female releases her eggs, she tries to ward off lesser males, so stronger ones fertilize them. ''It's the survival of the fittest in all aspects of the world.''
We began tossing out pellets by the handful. He told me that I wasn't using enough muscle and showed me how it was done.
Then he frowned. The koi, he said, weren't lunging and thrashing. Had someone fed them too recently? Was someone feeding them too often? He vowed to look into it, declaiming the same fault in the fish that he finds in so many of the planet's inhabitants.
''They're not eating the way I like them to,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As Goes Wisconsin...

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
The protesters who camped out in the Wisconsin Capitol building in Madison for nearly three weeks hung a handwritten placard over the marble bust of Robert La Follette, the state's titan of progressivism.
''What Would Bob Do?'' it begged, a plaintive appeal to recall the state's history on the forefront for workers' rights as the protesters try to fend off Scott Walker, the new Republican governor, who insists that he will not compromise in his bid to all but eliminate collective bargaining for public unions.
A particular indignation inflects the chanting of the protesters, who had taken over the Capitol before a judge ordered them to leave Thursday: How could workers' rights be on the line here, of all places -- the state that was the first to establish workers' compensation and unemployment insurance, the birthplace of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the giant public employees' union?
But that history tells only part of the story. In Wisconsin, and the Midwest more broadly, there has long existed a tension between those who would expand workers' rights and those who believe that they are the impediment to prosperity. The region has been the model as much for anti-union campaigns as it has been for workers' rights. 
And the events in Wisconsin have often had consequences for the rest of the country. For instance, when Wisconsin gave public employees the right to collectively bargain in 1959, the state was on the cutting edge; President John F. Kennedy soon extended the same benefit to federal workers. Ronald Reagan, as governor of California, also gave employees of local and municipal governments that benefit.
But Wisconsin was also the first state to rein in the power of unions, the result of a pushback from conservatives who believed that the federal Wagner Act, which required employers in the private sector to recognize and collectively bargain with unions, had been too generous. In 1939, the state passed a bill that presaged the Taft-Hartley Act, the federal law enacted in 1947 that prohibited many strikes and proscribed picketing, and allowed states to pass right-to-work laws against closed union shops.
One of the key authors of that federal legislation was the chief of labor relations at Allis-Chalmers, a Milwaukee-area farm equipment and machine manufacturing company that had fended off an epic strike earlier that year. Now the nation is watching to see which side wins in the battle between Mr. Walker and the flood of unions, local and national, that has surrounded the Capitol to fight him.
''The play by the governor is part of a longer history and a longer struggle over ideas and social policy,'' said Rosemary Feurer, a labor historian at Northern Illinois University. ''When I see this I think, history doesn't repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme.''
In her book, ''Radical Unionism in the Midwest, 1900-1950,'' Professor Feurer recounts how companies in the electrical industry in St. Louis started a network known as the Metal Trades Association in the first part of the 20th century to fight union organizing. The association had been alarmed by union protests that erupted violently with the Haymarket Square riot in 1886 and the demands for an eight-hour day, which started with the 1894 Pullman strike in Illinois -- an early effort by Eugene V. Debs, the former Indiana legislator and future Socialist Party candidate for president.
''That left a legacy of the 1930s and '40s for employers to form deep right-wing networks,'' Professor Feurer said.
That network, she argues, was the precursor to the Midwestern groups that have now been assisting the fight against the unions in Wisconsin, Ohio and Indiana: the Bradley Foundation, based in Milwaukee, and Koch Industries, based in Wichita, Kan. David H. and Charles G. Koch, the billionaire brothers behind the energy and manufacturing conglomerate that bears their name, have been large donors to Mr. Walker in Wisconsin, as has their advocacy group, Americans for Prosperity, which first opened an office in Wisconsin in 2005.
''They are surprised by how much people have been galvanized against Walker,'' Professor Feurer said, ''because they have been so successful in the private sector in breaking the unions and connecting them to the idea that unions and the fight for rights is somehow un-American.''
The ferment in the Midwest -- a place that many people on the coasts assume just waits around for revolutionary ideas to be flown in, like day-old sushi -- exists in part because the region has been the center of so much of the industry where the union movement first took hold.
''That environment bred very different ideas of political freedom and justice,'' said Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown whose book ''The Populist Persuasion'' traces the growth of populism both left and right. ''On the one hand, there were the business conservatives who believed that their skills and entrepreneurial energy had enabled the country to become rich. On the other hand, the people who worked for them thought they were leeching from them.''
''There's always been people who think like Scott Walker,'' he added, ''just as there was Eugene V. Debs and Walter Reuther,'' the famous union leaders.
The existence of a strong progressive tradition, particularly in Wisconsin, provoked an inevitable resistance.
''I don't think there's a particularly anti-union tradition that doesn't exit in other states,'' said William Powell Jones, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin in Madison who is writing a history of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and public employee unions. ''I think it's that there's a progressive, pro-union trend that doesn't exist elsewhere, and there's been conflict over that tradition.''
This, in part, is what makes Wisconsin such a swing state in elections. ''Its not that it's a moderate state,'' Professor Jones said. ''It's that there is strength on both sides.''
Those two sides have often been able to co-exist.
Socialist mayors were running Milwaukee at the same time Joseph McCarthy was representing the state in the United States Senate, raging against communism and un-American activities. Michael A. Gordon, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, recalled one of those mayors, Frank P. Zeidler, telling him that he and McCarthy had lunch whenever the senator was in town.
But the pendulum began a more permanent swing with the deindustrialization of the Midwest.
When Wisconsin extended collective bargaining to public employee unions in 1959, said Jonathan Kasparek, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin in Waukesha, politicians and the general public considered it an issue of basic fairness. Private workers had the right to do so; it was accepted ''as a matter of common sense,'' he said, that public workers should, too.
But with many heavy manufacturing plants closed, there are fewer private-sector employees in unions.
The ads that Americans for Prosperity and others are running on television now talk about fairness again, but through a different prism, Professor Kasparek said. ''It's that the state workers aren't paying their fair share, that they're given this special privilege that normal workers don't get.''
Mr. Walker has called this a fight to balance the budget. But with the unions already agreeing to his financial concessions, it looks more like an ideological one.
''This is our moment,'' the governor said in a call with a prankster whom he believed to be David Koch.
The unions, too, recognize that this is a critical moment, which explains the flood of demonstrators coming in from outside the state.
As the Midwest has been a model before, Professor Jones said, ''the winning side here will be emboldened elsewhere.''
Correction: March 13, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the legacy of union battles in the Midwest misidentified the group of public employees in California who were granted collective bargaining rights by Ronald Reagan when he was governor. It was the employees of local and municipal governments, not state workers.

HEADLINE: Colombia Leader Seeks Wide-Ranging Changes, and Looks Beyond the U.S.

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jenny Carolina Gonzalez contributed reporting from Bogota, Colombia.

 BODY:
NEIVA, Colombia -- President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia glows when speaking of a plan by Chinese and European investors to build a city for 250,000 people near the Caribbean coast. His foreign minister has circled the globe in the seven months that Mr. Santos has been president, visiting places like Cambodia, but not Washington.
In a reconciliation that has taken many in Latin America by surprise, Mr. Santos is now so friendly with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who just last year was accusing Mr. Santos of plotting to assassinate him, that he takes delight in referring to Mr. Chavez as ''my new best friend.''
Mr. Santos, in a wide-ranging interview here, insisted that the United States, which has long considered Colombia its top ally in the region, remains a ''great partner,'' even as some in Colombia's establishment grow increasingly frustrated with a stalled trade deal and a steady reduction in American counterinsurgency aid. 
But he also emphasized a remarkable foreign policy move under way in which Colombia is shifting its gaze from the United States to Asia, repairing ties with Venezuela and Ecuador and adopting a measured posture within Latin America that stands in stark contrast to the hawkish style of Mr. Santos's conservative predecessor, Alvaro Uribe.
''I consider myself very pro-American; I want to continue and even strengthen our relationship, but it's common sense and common logic to diversify your international relations, especially in a world that is changing,'' said Mr. Santos, 59.
Retooling foreign policy is not the only abrupt change Mr. Santos is seeking in Colombia, which has received $6.5 billion in security and development aid from the United States since 2000. Startling some in Colombia's more conservative sectors, he is also pushing projects aimed at reducing Colombia's alarming income inequality.
The expansion of a program to return land to thousands of farmers who were forced to flee their homes during the country's long civil war, improvements in tax collection and a broad upgrade in Colombia's infrastructure rank among the most ambitious of the president's proposals.
Smiling broadly, Mr. Santos, the Harvard-educated scion of a Bogota publishing family that is one of Colombia's most powerful clans, said he would be pleased if these social projects resulted in his being called a ''traitor to his class'' by the end of his presidency, a nod to the title of the biography of President Franklin D. Roosevelt by H. W. Brands.
''If in four years they are going to call me the small Roosevelt of Colombia, then I would be honored,'' said Mr. Santos, an unabashed admirer of the New Deal. He said the connection went deeper, explaining that Roosevelt asked his great-uncle, Eduardo Santos, a former president of Colombia, to build support in Latin America for what would become the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe after World War II.
Seizing on an approval rating of nearly 80 percent, Mr. Santos is taking his ideas to different parts of the country. He allowed a reporter and a photographer on a recent trip that included a stop in Neiva.
Inaugurating a low-income housing complex here, Mr. Santos, who was a journalist and a trade negotiator before running for president, peppered his speech with references to the Swiss architect Le Corbusier and James J. Heckman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the University of Chicago. The audience fidgeted.
Then Mr. Santos, who as defense minister in Mr. Uribe's administration orchestrated crushing blows against the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, denounced the rebel group for shifting into gold mining to finance itself. The audience applauded.
Although he campaigned last year as Mr. Uribe's heir, Mr. Santos has tried to distance himself from his predecessor. Mr. Uribe remains widely admired in Colombia for his strides against the FARC despite being tarnished by scandals, including the revelation of ties between paramilitary death squads and some top allies.
Mr. Santos's emergence as one of Latin America's most visible leaders involves a new seat on the United Nations Security Council and an ambitious effort to achieve greater integration among Colombia and market-oriented countries like Chile, Mexico and Peru. ''This will in a way counterbalance Brazil,'' he said, referring to the region's rising power. ''It's not against Brazil; it's to unite the region.''
The move out of the shadow of Mr. Uribe, who showed scant delight at international meetings, has something to do with Colombia's shifting political winds. Fatigue toward Washington, which stood by Mr. Uribe, is clearly setting in here.
Semana, an influential newsmagazine, ran an article last week titled ''With Friends Like These,'' lamenting the delayed trade deal, which has stalled amid concerns over the killings of union officials. Another article focused on WikiLeaks cables that described the Colombian presidential palace as resembling, in Semana's view, ''a branch of the U.S. Embassy.''
(Some voices go even further in expressing disdain for Washington's new indifference toward Colombia. The financial magazine Dinero published a cartoon this year referring to the trade deal that showed President Obama's smiling face morphing into a middle-finger salute.)
While Mr. Obama is bypassing Bogota in a trip to Latin America this month that includes stops in Brazil, Chile and El Salvador, some Colombia watchers say it makes sense on both sides. ''It would be humiliating for Santos to greet Obama without the free trade agreement,'' said Christopher Sabatini, senior director for policy at the Council of the Americas in New York.
Meanwhile, new options are emerging, notably with China. Mr. Santos said that Chinese delegations ''are coming almost every week.'' He said that a Chinese proposal to build a $7.6 billion rail system that includes a land-based rival to the Panama Canal, first reported by The Financial Times in February, remained on the table.
While viability studies for the canal alternative are advancing, Mr. Santos said his government was evaluating a related project involving Chinese and European investors to build a city for as many as 250,000 people south of Cartagena. That project, which would be designed by the Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill, would include an industrial park to manufacture products for export throughout the Americas.
Despite considering such plans, Mr. Santos said he hoped that the United States would refocus attention away from its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan toward its own hemisphere, where American influence is waning.
''I ask myself, 'What is the real strategic interest of the U.S. in Afghanistan?' '' he said, while regretting cuts in Washington's $350 million aid package to Colombia, which ''is peanuts compared to what you're spending'' elsewhere.
''What I say to many of the Americans, 'It's in your interest to stop neglecting Latin America,' '' said Mr. Santos, adding that the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East might have a ''positive collateral effect'' of stirring interest closer to home. ''I think this is the moment for the U.S. to reshuffle their cards.''

 BODY:
TIMOTHY EGAN Mike Huckabee is supposed to be the Republican with a heart, the guy who said Mexicans are people, too, during the 2008 race for the White House. He's the weight-loss humanist who refused to join that anti-common-sense fringe of his party bashing Michelle Obama for suggesting that children eat more vegetables. 
But beneath the veneer of Aw-Shucks-Huck is a public figure, and possible presidential candidate, who has shown a pattern of telling outright falsehoods about himself and the president.
This week, he backstepped from an extraordinary interview in which he had claimed, several times, that President Obama grew up in Kenya. But before that, Huckabee had created a shell of mistruths about a felon he helped to free early when he was governor of Arkansas. This man went on to murder four police officers in Washington State.
This is troubling for a man who may one day be asked to make momentous decisions based on facts.
-- Excerpt from
''The Fictions of Mike Huckabee''
WILLIAM D. COHAN There are plenty of people suspicious about the trading in silver, and now they have the Web to explore and to expand their conspiracy narratives. This time around -- according to bloggers and commenters on sites with names like Silverseek, 321Gold and Seeking Alpha -- silver shot up in price after a whistleblower exposed an alleged conspiracy to keep the price artificially low despite the inflationary pressure of the Fed's cheap money policy. (Some even suspect that the Fed itself was behind the effort to keep silver prices low, as a way to keep the dollar's value artificially high.) Trying to unravel the mysterious rise in silver's price is a conspiracy theorist's dream, replete with powerful bankers, informants, suspicious car accidents and a now a squeeze on short sellers.
Most intriguingly, however, much of the speculation seems highly plausible.

HEADLINE: State Workers and N.Y.'s Fiscal Crisis

 BODY:
At a time when public school students are being forced into ever more crowded classrooms, and poor families will lose state medical benefits, New York State is paying 10 times more for state employees' pensions than it did just a decade ago.
That huge increase is largely because of Albany's outsized generosity to the state's powerful employees' unions in the early years of the last decade, made worse when the recession pushed down pension fund earnings, forcing the state to make up the difference.
Although taxpayers are on the hook for the recession's costs, most state employees pay only 3 percent of their salaries to their pensions, half the level of most state employees elsewhere. Their health insurance payments are about half those in the private sector.
In all, the salaries and benefits of state employees add up to $18.5 billion, or a fifth of New York's operating budget. Unless those costs are reined in, New York will find itself unable to provide even essential services. 
To point out these alarming facts is not to be anti- union, or anti-worker. In recent weeks, Republican politicians in the Midwest have distorted what should be a serious discussion about state employees' benefits, cynically using it as a pretext to crush unions.
New York does not need that sort of destructive game playing. What it needs is a sober examination of the high costs of wages and benefits, and some serious proposals to rein them in while remaining fair to hard-working government employees.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has pursued a reasonable course, making it clear that he expects public unions to make sacrifices, starting with a salary freeze. He wants to require greater employee contributions to pensions and health benefits, with a goal of saving $450 million.
Negotiations begin this month, but so far union leaders have publicly resisted Mr. Cuomo's proposals. If they don't budge, Mr. Cuomo says he will have to lay off up to 9,800 workers. That would damage the state's struggling economy. Some compromise must be found.
Here are the three most expensive areas of spending that need to be addressed:
WAGES Last April, in the midst of one of the worst financial crises that New York and the nation have ever faced, the state's unionized workers got a 4 percent pay raise that cost $400 million. It came on top of 3 percent raises in each of the previous three years. These raises were negotiated long before the recession began, by a Legislature that routinely gave in to unions that remain among the biggest political contributors in Albany.
During the same period, many private-sector workers had their pay or hours cut. Private-sector wages in New York dropped nearly 9 percent in 2008. In 2009, Gov. David Paterson pleaded with the unions to give up the raises to help the state out of its crisis. Union leaders attacked him in corrosive television ads, and Mr. Paterson eventually caved, settling for an agreement that reduced pension payments to new employees. The deal wasn't enough to address New York's serious fiscal problems.
The average salary for New York's full-time state employees in 2009 (even before the last round of raises) was $63,382, well above the state's average personal income that year of $46,957. Mr. Cuomo's proposed salary freeze for many of the state's 236,000 employees is an important step to rein in New York's out-of-control payroll. It could save between $200 million and $400 million.
He may need to go further. Even after the current labor contract runs out on April 1, more than 50,000 workers are in line for step increases and longevity pay negotiated in that contract, which will cost about $140 million. A clause in the state labor law known as the Triborough Amendment allows contract provisions for all workers to proceed until a new contract is reached.
This clause, unique to New York, was a well-meaning attempt to give some balance to state unions, which by law are not allowed to strike and had no leverage to draw management to the table in flush years. The problem with the Triborough Amendment is that it gives the unions far less incentive to bargain, as we saw last year.
The amendment should be re-examined. Allowing the state to cut wages or benefits without a contract would be unfair, especially given the no-strike law. But the state should, at least, have the power to freeze wages and benefits once a contract runs out, which would give both sides an incentive to bargain.
PENSIONS In 2000, employee pensions cost New York State taxpayers $100 million. They now cost $1.5 billion, and will be more than $2 billion in 2014. Wall Street's troubles are a big part of that. But so are state politics. The Legislature, ever eager to curry favor with powerful unions, added sweeteners to pensions and allowed employees to stop making contributions after 10 years.
In 2009, Albany began to recognize the deep hole it had dug. Under the state Constitution, a worker's pension benefits cannot be cut back once granted. So under the agreement Mr. Paterson reached with the unions, a more rigorous tier was created for nonuniformed employees hired after 2009. It raised their retirement age from 55 to 62, required pension contributions every year instead of just the first 10, and capped the amount of overtime that is calculated in pension benefits.
The deal did not go far enough. New employees can still retire with full benefits at 62, while most American workers must wait until 65. They can still drive up pension payments by earning overtime in their final years, up to a $15,000 cap. And most important, they have to contribute only 3 percent of their pay to their pension; the national norm for public employees is double that.
In the next few weeks, Mr. Cuomo will propose a less-generous tier for new employees. Ideally, it will address all of these problems: pushing the full-retirement age to 65, raising employee contributions to 6 percent, and ending the use of overtime in calculating payments.
An investigation by The Times last year found that 3,700 retired public workers were getting six-figure pensions, largely because of overtime abuse, and that number is expected to grow. The system even allows workers on full pensions to double-dip and return to state employment, a practice the Legislature should end. Recently, Gannett Newspapers found more than 2,000 people collecting both state salaries and pensions.
It is also worth considering giving new employees the option to join what is known as a defined-contribution system, similar to the 401(k) plans widely in use in the private sector, and reducing the reliance on a guaranteed benefit system that has proved so ruinously expensive. The 401(k) system shifts the risk of a falling stock market to the employee instead of the state, but in the long run may be necessary to protect vital state services from economic downturns.
HEALTH INSURANCE As national health care costs have soared, the state's payments for employees' and retirees' care has more than doubled in the last decade. This fiscal year, the state will pay $3 billion; that is projected to keep growing by $300 million to $400 million a year.
Health care contributions by state retirees are considerably lower than for workers in the private sector or the federal government, and will almost certainly have to be raised as baby boomers retire.
Current state employees pay 10 percent of their health insurance premiums for single policies, and 25 percent for family policies, which is roughly in line with national averages for the public sector. But it is considerably less than most private workers pay -- 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively.
If the state is unable to achieve the necessary savings in wages and pensions, it may need to seek higher insurance contributions for all state workers. That benefit is not protected by the state Constitution.
Unlike Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Governor Cuomo is not trying to break the unions. He is pressing them to accept a salary freeze and a reduction in benefits for new workers. The unions need to negotiate seriously.
We are also urging the governor to rethink his pledge to cap property taxes and allow a tax surcharge on high incomes to expire at the end of this year. That would bring the state an additional $2 billion this fiscal year, and $4 billion the following year -- not enough to solve the fiscal crisis, but a serious down payment.
The state's middle-class workers will have to make real sacrifices. New York's many wealthy residents, all of whom are benefiting substantially from a new federal tax break, should have to pay their fair share as well.
This is part of a series of editorials about the fiscal crisis in New York State and in other states around the country.

HEADLINE: To Quiet Critics, Romney Puts '12 Focus on Jobs

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
BARTLETT, N.H. -- As Mitt Romney travels the country lining up contributors and influential Republicans for a second presidential bid, he is presenting himself as a ready-to-lead executive, gambling that a fluency in economic matters distinguishes him from other candidates and can help overcome concerns about authenticity that dogged his first race.
Mr. Romney makes the case, in private meetings with business owners and in appearances like a dinner speech here Saturday, that the halting economic recovery -- even after solid job growth in February, the unemployment rate remains at 8.9 percent -- provides a compelling rationale that he is the strongest candidate to create jobs and take on President Obama.
''I like President Obama,'' Mr. Romney said, ''but he doesn't have a clue how jobs are created.'' 
The message is well suited to Mr. Romney's background as a successful executive and former governor, as well as the man who rescued the 2002 Winter Games from financial trouble. But it may also be his best opportunity to try to steer around criticism over the health care plan he created in Massachusetts, which to many Republicans looks distressingly similar to the federal law signed last year by Mr. Obama.
And it offers him a chance to sidestep the concerns of social conservatives, some of whom question his commitment to their causes and are uncomfortable with his Mormon faith.
As he moves closer to formally opening his campaign, Mr. Romney has taken a far different approach than he did the last time. To avoid the risk of overexposure and early scrutiny, he is operating in a cautious, low-key fashion, building allies among Republicans by doling out money to candidates from his political action committee and testing themes on donors and other supporters with limited news coverage.
Mr. Romney is trying to present a more relaxed image to combat impressions that he is unapproachable and stiff. He has not been seen in a necktie for months -- not in television appearances, meetings with donors or political dinners, including the one Saturday evening, where he was one of the few men wearing an open-collared shirt.
He turned up in the pit area of the Daytona 500 last month, mingling with race car drivers while wearing a Bass Pro Shops shirt. And last week, Mr. Romney, who put his wealth four years ago around $200 million, walked into Tommy's Barber Shop in an Atlanta strip mall for a haircut. (Aides sent out a picture of him in the barber's chair via Twitter.)
In the early maneuvering for the 2012 race, Mr. Romney has aimed his fire at Mr. Obama rather than any of his prospective Republican rivals, attacking the president as a weak leader who pursued a European-style big-government agenda for his first two years in office instead of focusing on jobs.
''The president points out that he inherited an economic crisis,'' Mr. Romney told about 300 people at the Attitash Grand Summit Hotel. ''He did, and he promptly made it worse.''
''The consequence is soaring numbers of Americans enduring unemployment, foreclosures and bankruptcies,'' he continued. ''This is the Obama Misery Index, and we're not going to let the American people be fooled.''
So far Mr. Romney has offered few specific details beyond general Republican philosophies, saying only that the country needs ''to believe in free enterprise, capitalism, limited government, federalism.'' He delivered his speech with the aid of a Tele-prompter and laughed as he recalled the ''humbling experience'' of his last campaign. ''I made more than my share of gaffes here,'' he said.
He selected this town nestled in the White Mountains about 125 miles north of Manchester to offer one of the first extensive previews of his campaign themes. He shook hands with nearly everyone at the Carroll County Republican dinner in his first public visit to the state that holds the opening primary of the 2012 nominating season, a contest critical to his success.
''I spent my career in the private sector,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I know how jobs are created and how jobs are lost.''
In his 2008 race, Mr. Romney shed moderate stances on abortion and gay rights to align with a conservative electorate, prompting questions about whether his positions were driven by politics or conviction. This time, a concentration on jobs and the economy signals a return to themes he struck during his successful bid for governor in 2002. Yet his record as governor also provides one of his biggest obstacles.
More even than his faith and his social-conservative credentials, questions about the health insurance plan he signed into law in Massachusetts have left him open to criticism from his party.
The White House has joined in, showering unhelpful praise on the plan, which, like the federal law, includes a mandate for residents to carry insurance.
Mr. Romney defended the program again on Saturday night, saying that it was ''unique to Massachusetts'' and should not be imposed on other states. But his criticism of the national law -- ''I would repeal Obamacare, if I were ever in a position to do so,'' he declared -- has been overshadowed by his Republican rivals' trying to conflate the two.
He devoted only a few moments of his speech to health care and tried to lighten the mood, saying: ''You may have noticed that the president and his people spend more time talking about me and Massachusetts health care than 'Entertainment Tonight' spends talking about Charlie Sheen.''
Several Republican strategists who worked on Mr. Romney's first presidential campaign said they had urged him to try to get ahead of the controversy a year ago during the national health care debate. But they said their suggestions had been overruled.
''He made a huge mistake not litigating his health care record when Obamacare was on the table,'' said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist who advised the early stages of Mr. Romney's last race. ''He should have been the leading opponent and said, 'I can tell you better than anyone, don't do this.' But now he's chosen to litigate this during a campaign, which is the worst time to do it.''
The health care law, particularly the individual mandate, has been a catalyst for the anti-Obama energy of Tea Party supporters. But Mr. Romney and his advisers argue that voters will be more concerned with the economy and job creation.
Doug Gross, a prominent Iowa Republican and state chairman of Mr. Romney's last campaign, said Mr. Romney had a chance to create new appeal if he could present himself as genuine and not as someone chasing voters far to the right.
''He was a relatively moderate governor of a Northeastern state, and he tried to come to Iowa to be a social conservative and it didn't work,'' Mr. Gross said. ''If he can't be perceived as a true fiscal conservative and a limited government guy -- the burden of proof is against him. He's got to overcome the burden.''
Mr. Gross and more than a dozen other former supporters who are not aligned with other candidates said they worried whether Mr. Romney could withstand scrutiny without being tempted to reinvent himself again. But they urged him to campaign in Iowa, even with its heavy social conservative presence, because economic concerns topped nearly everyone's priority list.
Four years ago, Mr. Romney focused considerable attention on the Iowa caucuses, which open the nominating contest, only to finish well behind former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who spent a fraction of the money Mr. Romney did but surged with the support of evangelical voters and social conservatives. Mr. Romney has yet to settle on a strategy this year, but aides said it would include all states.
As he mingled with Republicans here, Mr. Romney offered no hints about when he intended to formally open his candidacy. Delaying an announcement, his aides believe, postpones a bull's eye that accompanies being perceived as a front-runner. Yet he has a fully formed campaign apparatus and national fund-raising network ready to fire up whenever he gives the signal.

HEADLINE: MERS? It May Have Swallowed Your Loan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL and GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
FOR more than a decade, the American real estate market resembled an overstuffed novel, which is to say, it was an engrossing piece of fiction.
Mortgage brokers hip deep in profits handed out no-doc mortgages to people with fictional incomes. Wall Street shopped bundles of those loans to investors, no matter how unappetizing the details. And federal regulators gave sleepy nods.
That world largely collapsed under the weight of its improbabilities in 2008.
But a piece of that world survives on Library Street in Reston, Va., where an obscure business, the MERS Corporation, claims to hold title to roughly half of all the home mortgages in the nation -- an astonishing 60 million loans. 
Never heard of MERS? That's fine with the mortgage banking industry--as MERS is starting to overheat and sputter. If its many detractors are correct, this private corporation, with a full-time staff of fewer than 50 employees, could turn out to be a very public problem for the mortgage industry.
Judges, lawmakers, lawyers and housing experts are raising piercing questions about MERS, which stands for Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, whose private mortgage registry has all but replaced the nation's public land ownership records. Most questions boil down to this:
How can MERS claim title to those mortgages, and foreclose on homeowners, when it has not invested a dollar in a single loan?
And, more fundamentally: Given the evidence that many banks have cut corners and made colossal foreclosure mistakes, does anyone know who owns what or owes what to whom anymore?
The answers have implications for all American homeowners, but particularly the millions struggling to save their homes from foreclosure. How the MERS story plays out could deal another blow to an ailing real estate market, even as the spring buying season gets under way.
MERS has distanced itself from the dubious behavior of some of its members, and the company itself has not been accused of wrongdoing. But the legal challenges to MERS, its practices and its records are mounting.
The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled last year that MERS could no longer file foreclosure proceedings there, because it does not actually make or service any loans. Last month in Utah, a local judge made the no-less-striking decision to let a homeowner rip up his mortgage and walk away debt-free. MERS had claimed ownership of the mortgage, but the judge did not recognize its legal standing.
''The state court is attracted like a moth to the flame to the legal owner, and that isn't MERS,'' says Walter T. Keane, the Salt Lake City lawyer who represented the homeowner in that case.
And, on Long Island, a federal bankruptcy judge ruled in February that MERS could no longer act as an ''agent'' for the owners of mortgage notes. He acknowledged that his decision could erode the foundation of the mortgage business.
But this, Judge Robert E Grossman said, was not his fault.
''This court does not accept the argument that because MERS may be involved with 50 percent of all residential mortgages in the country,'' he wrote, ''that is reason enough for this court to turn a blind eye to the fact that this process does not comply with the law.''
With MERS under scrutiny, its chief executive, R. K. Arnold, who had been with the company since its founding in 1995, resigned earlier this year.
A BIRTH certificate, a marriage license, a death certificate: these public documents note many life milestones.
For generations of Americans, public mortgage documents, often logged in longhand down at the county records office, provided a clear indication of homeownership.
But by the 1990s, the centuries-old system of land records was showing its age. Many county clerk's offices looked like something out of Dickens, with mortgage papers stacked high. Some clerks had fallen two years behind in recording mortgages.
For a mortgage banking industry in a hurry, this represented money lost. Most banks no longer hold onto mortgages until loans are paid off. Instead, they sell the loans to Wall Street, which bundles them into investments through a process known as securitization.
MERS, industry executives hoped, would pull record-keeping into the Internet age, even as it privatized it. Streamlining record-keeping, the banks argued, would make mortgages more affordable.
But for the mortgage industry, MERS was mostly about speed -- and profits. MERS, founded 16 years ago by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and big banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, cut out the county clerks and became the owner of record, no matter how many times loans were transferred. MERS appears to sell loans to MERS ad infinitum.
This high-speed system made securitization easier and cheaper. But critics say the MERS system made it far more difficult for homeowners to contest foreclosures, as ownership was harder to ascertain.
MERS was flawed at conception, those critics say. The bankers who midwifed its birth hired Covington & Burling, a prominent Washington law firm, to research their proposal. Covington produced a memo that offered assurances that MERS could operate legally nationwide. No one, however, conducted a state-by-state study of real estate laws.
''They didn't do the deep homework,'' said an official involved in those discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because he has clients involved with MERS. ''So as far as anyone can tell their real theory was: 'If we can get everyone on board, no judge will want to upend something that is reasonable and sensible and would screw up 70 percent of loans.' ''
County officials appealed to Congress, arguing that MERS was of dubious legality. But this was the 1990s, an era of deregulation, and the mortgage industry won.
''We lost our revenue stream, and Americans lost the ability to immediately know who owned a piece of property,'' said Mark Monacelli, the St. Louis County recorder in Duluth, Minn.
And so MERS took off. Its board gave its senior vice president, William Hultman, the rather extraordinary power to deputize an unlimited number of ''vice presidents'' and ''assistant secretaries'' drawn from the ranks of the mortgage industry.
The ''nomination'' process was near instantaneous. A bank entered a name into MERS's Web site, and, in a blink, MERS produced a ''certifying resolution,'' signed by Mr. Hultman. The corporate seal was available to those deputies for $25.
As personnel policies go, this was a touch loose. Precisely how loose became clear when a lawyer questioned Mr. Hultman in April 2010 in a lawsuit related to its foreclosure against an Atlantic City cab driver.
How many vice presidents and assistant secretaries have you appointed? the lawyer asked.
''I don't know that number,'' Mr. Hultman replied.
Approximately?
''I wouldn't even be able to tell you, right now.''
In the thousands?
''Yes.''
Each of those deputies could file loan transfers and foreclosures in MERS's name. The goal, as with almost everything about the mortgage business at that time, was speed. Speed meant money.
ALAN GRAYSON has seen MERS's record-keeping up close. From 2009 until this year, he served as the United States representative for Florida's Eighth Congressional District -- in the Orlando area, which was ravaged by foreclosures. Thousands of constituents poured through his office, hoping to fend off foreclosures. Almost all had papers bearing the MERS name.
''In many foreclosures, the MERS paperwork was squirrelly,'' Mr. Grayson said. With no real legal authority, he says, Fannie and the banks eliminated the old system and replaced it with a privatized one that was unreliable.
A spokeswoman for MERS declined interview requests. In an e-mail, she noted that several state courts have ruled in MERS's favor of late. She expressed confidence that MERS's policies complied with state laws, even if MERS's members occasionally strayed.
''At times, some MERS members have failed to follow those procedures and/or established state foreclosure rules,'' the spokeswoman, Karmela Lejarde, wrote, ''or to properly explain MERS and document MERS relationships in legal pleadings.''
Such cases, she said, ''are outliers, reflecting case-specific problems in process, and did not repudiate the MERS business model.''
MERS's legal troubles, however, aren't going away. In August, the Ohio secretary of state referred to federal prosecutors in Cleveland accusations that notaries deputized by MERS were signing hundreds of documents without any personal knowledge of them. The attorney general of Massachusetts is examining a complaint by a county registrar that MERS owes the state tens of millions of dollars in unpaid fees.
As far back as 2001, Ed Romaine, the clerk for Suffolk County, on eastern Long Island, refused to register mortgages in MERS's name, partly because of complaints that the company's records didn't square with public ones. The state Court of Appeals later ruled that he had overstepped his powers.
But Judith S. Kaye, the state's chief judge at the time, filed a partial dissent. She worried that MERS, by speeding up property transfers, was pouring oil on the subprime fires. The MERS system, she wrote, ill serves ''innocent purchasers.''
''I was trying to say something didn't smell right, feel right or look right,'' Ms. Kaye said in a recent interview.
Little about MERS was transparent. Asked as part of a lawsuit against MERS in September 2009 to produce minutes about the formation of the corporation, Mr. Arnold, the former C.E.O., testified that ''writing was not one of the characteristics of our meetings.''
MERS officials say they conduct audits, but in testimony could not say how often or what these measured. In 2006, Mr. Arnold stated that original mortgage notes were held in a secure ''custodial facility'' with ''stainless steel vaults.'' MERS, he testified, could quickly produce every one of those files.
As for homeowners, Mr. Arnold said they could log on to the MERS system to identify their loan servicer, who, in turn, could identify the true owner of their mortgage note. ''The servicer is really the best source for all that information,'' Mr. Arnold said.
The reality turns out to be a lot messier. Federal bankruptcy courts and state courts have found that MERS and its member banks often confused and misrepresented who owned mortgage notes. In thousands of cases, they apparently lost or mistakenly destroyed loan documents.
The problems, at MERS and elsewhere, became so severe last fall that many banks temporarily suspended foreclosures.
Some experts in corporate governance say the legal furor over MERS is overstated. Others describe it as a useful corporation nearly drowning in a flood tide of mortgage foreclosures. But not even the mortgage giant Fannie Mae, an investor in MERS, depends on it these days.
''We would never rely on it to find ownership,'' says Janis Smith, a Fannie Mae spokeswoman, noting it has its own records.
Apparently with good reason. Alan M. White, a law professor at the Valparaiso University School of Law in Indiana, last year matched MERS's ownership records against those in the public domain.
The results were not encouraging. ''Fewer than 30 percent of the mortgages had an accurate record in MERS,'' Mr. White says. ''I kind of assumed that MERS at least kept an accurate list of current ownership. They don't. MERS is going to make solving the foreclosure problem vastly more expensive.''
THE Sarmientos are one of thousands of American families who have tried to pierce the MERS veil.
Several years back, they bought a two-family home in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn for $723,000. They financed the purchase with two mortgages from Lend America, a subprime lender that is now defunct.
But when the recession blew in, Jose Sarmiento, a chef, saw his work hours get cut in half. He fell behind on his mortgages, and MERS later assigned the loans to U.S. Bank as a prelude to filing a foreclosure motion.
Then, with the help of a lawyer from South Brooklyn Legal Services, Mr. Sarmiento began turning over some stones. He found that MERS might have violated tax laws by waiting too long before transferring his mortgage. He also found that MERS could not prove that it had transferred both note and mortgage, as required by law.
One might argue that these are just legal nits. But Mr. Sarmiento, 59, shakes his head. He is trying to work out a payment plan through the federal government, but the roadblocks are many. ''I'm tired; I've been fighting for two years already to save my house,'' he says. ''I feel like I never know who really owns this home.''
Officials at MERS appear to recognize that they are swimming in dangerous waters. Several federal agencies are investigating MERS, and, in response, the company recently sent a note laying out a raft of reforms. It advised members not to foreclose in MERS's name. It also told them to record mortgage transfers in county records, even if state law does not require it.
MERS will no longer accept unverified new officers. If members ignore these rules, MERS says, it will revoke memberships.
That hasn't stopped judges from asking questions of MERS. And few are doing so with more puckish vigor than Arthur M. Schack, a State Supreme Court judge in Brooklyn.
Judge Schack has twice rejected a foreclosure case brought by Countrywide Home Loans, now part of Bank of America. He had particular sport with Keri Selman, who in Countrywide's court filings claimed to hold three jobs: as a foreclosure specialist for Countrywide Home Loans, as a servicing agent for Bank of New York and as an assistant vice president of MERS. Ms. Selman, the judge said, is a ''milliner's delight by virtue of the number of hats that she wears.''
At heart, Judge Schack is scratching at the notion that MERS is a legal fiction. If MERS owned nothing, how could it bounce mortgages around for more than a decade? And how could it file millions of foreclosure motions?
These cases, Judge Schack wrote in February 2009, ''force the court to determine if MERS, as nominee, acted with the utmost good faith and loyalty in the performance of its duties.''
The answer, he strongly suggested, was no.

AEROTROPOLIS
The Way We'll Live Next
By John D. Kasarda and Greg Lindsay
Illustrated. 466 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $30
To find yourself at La Guardia Airport, that repository of bad food, dim lighting, unsettlingly indistinct odors and too-short runways, is to be inclined toward embracing John D. Kasarda and Greg Lindsay and all they have to say about the future of travel and modern life.
Kasarda, a professor in the business school at the University of North Carolina who has consulted with four White House administrations and numerous cities and governments, believes that something very different from La Guardia is transforming our world: the gleaming ''aerotropolis,'' with a state-of-the-art airport at its center, surrounded by customized transportation links, fine restaurants, designer shopping and nearby corporate suburbs connecting workers umbilically to the global marketplace. The aerotropolis, he says, represents not just a redesign of travel but a vital new economic paradigm. From the United States to Holland to Dubai, no nation in this ''frictionless'' age of fast-paced and highly competitive trade can long survive without airport hub cities built to spec. 
Kasarda's theories are presented in the ambitious ''Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next,'' which is written by Lindsay, who as the journalist onboard fulfills the role of eager messenger. Kasarda is less co-author than inspirational Yoda, supplying the vision and the immutable ''laws'' of development for 21st-century life -- emphasis on location, accessibility and speed. Lindsay, meanwhile, flies around the world, conducting interviews, seeking evidence, translating Kasarda's technical jargon into a lively if sometimes flawed work of pop behavioral economics.
Lindsay explains that in Kasarda's view, the aerotropolis is to the 21st century what the port was to the 16th, 17th and 18th: an indispensable building block upon which nations, economies and cultures will rise or fall. The ''biggest build-out'' of cities ''in human history will reset the global pecking order,'' Lindsay writes, adding that to Kasarda, the aerotropolis offers an ''antidote'' to overcrowded megalopolises while ''imposing a hierarchy of needs on cities so that they openly and honestly express their true purpose: creating work for their inhabitants and competitiveness for their nations.''
O.K., you may be tempted to say. Anything to escape La Guardia. But read on, and it's difficult to resist tossing out exceptions to Kasarda's assertions. London, Paris, Rome and, yes, New York are on any short list of great cities that have so far survived without being proper aerotropolises. And there are more than a few aerotropolises -- Louisville, Memphis and Hyderabad, India, not to mention Dallas-Fort Worth -- whose airports have beautiful runways and spectacular warehouses, whose suburbs are elegantly appointed and whose corporate parks send glass structures rising toward the sky, but which nonetheless fall a few watts short of electrifying ''global cities.''
''Aerotropolis'' offers intriguing arguments and hypotheticals, but it too often feels overwrought and overstuffed. Kasarda insists on the inevitability of his vision, and while Lindsay acknowledges a shadow or two of doubt, he most often concludes that we have but one choice: to jump aboard Kasarda's plane.
Which is not to say that the authors fail as provocateurs. Lindsay explains well, for instance, why Los Angeles has put itself at a competitive disadvantage by failing to build a world-class airport. He quotes the operations manager at Los Angeles International, who says that ''80 percent of all /iPods sold at Christmas last year'' went through LAX, most of them delivered from Hong Kong by Cathay Pacific 747s. But those same planes are as likely to cruise over Los Angeles, with ''its tangle of runways and freeways,'' to a proper aerotropolis, like Dallas-Fort Worth. Los Angeles ''has begun a slow descent into flyover country as far as cargo is concerned,'' Lindsay writes. ''It's Yogi Berra logic: nobody lands there anymore; it's too crowded.''
Nor does Lindsay shy from pointing out the underside of the aerotropolis. He describes the proliferation of ''relovilles,'' suburbs populated by ''relos,'' the corporate-/ladder-climbing men and women regularly uprooted by their employers. In relovilles, ''homes, subdivisions, office parks and even cities become disposable,'' Lindsay writes. ''Life . . . has about as much permanence as a plane ticket. In the aerotropolis, that's not weird, it's normal.''
He also draws an effective portrait of the alienated life of the airport-hopping corporate manager. Although you might think, ''I've seen this George Clooney movie before,'' Lindsay explores the ramifications of the itinerant lifestyle sensitively, suggesting that our ''freedom'' to live anywhere with wireless Internet service and a great hub is a bittersweet gift.
''Aerotropolis'' is bracing in its dissection of the conceit of locavorism, the insistence that locally produced and consumed food is suffused with moral virtue. So restaurants in Burlington, Vt., love to use only the best organic tomatoes from the Mad River Valley; the better bistros in Sausalito, Calif., reserve a place for the finest Sacramento radishes. As Lindsay explains, this cannot possibly be the end of it, in terms of economics or morality. To forgo coffee from Ethiopia or roses from Kenya because a jet burns fuel delivering those products is to condemn millions of African farmers to a short and brutish life. African roses, ''planted in the earth and left to bloom under the equatorial sun,'' use far less energy than northern roses raised in greenhouses with fertilizer drips. The virtuous shopper risks beggaring the poorest of the world's citizens.
Lindsay is less persuasive when discussing air travel's effects on global warming. Taking on theories about peak oil, scarcity, carbon emissions -- anything that might argue against flight -- he concludes, ''Aviation's contributions to our well-being are larger and growing more rapidly than its carbon emissions.'' But this is too breathless. He omits research suggesting that jet contrails' impact on climate change, particularly in certain regions, is likely to grow as air traffic increases. It would have been enough for him to note, as he does in a section called ''The Doom/slayers,'' that James Hansen, the NASA climate scientist, has said that coal-burning plants and buildings are vastly more damaging than airplanes, and that grounding planes as a solution to climate change would be terrifically disruptive.
More problematic is Kasarda and Lindsay's tendency to stand causality on its head. They offer a string of factoids to establish the predestined centrality of the aerotropolis: one in six Americans lives within a short driving distance of the 25 busiest hubs; businessmen fly because they trust best those whom they can see. But couldn't it be true that airport hubs tend to grow up around busy cities? That meeting face to face isn't always best for business? (A lot of people peered into Bernie Madoff's eyes and still handed over their money.)
Kasarda's impatience with human agency is no less troubling. Nations, he says, can ignore his counsel, but a penalty attends. Nimbys in Britain fighting the expansion of runways are shoving their way into history's dustbin, he argues, soon to be surpassed by avid aerotropolis adopters in Amsterdam or Dubai. ''High-functioning autocracies such as Dubai's don't faze him,'' Lindsay writes. ''If anything, they're the only ones who move fast enough.'' It took as long for the English to air their grievances over Heathrow's Terminal 5 as it did for Beijing to wrest an aero/tropolis from raw earth, Lindsay notes. To create its city, the Chinese government also flattened 15 villages, forcing 10,000 people to resettle. The Chinese ministry in charge of the project noted that ''democracy sacrifices efficiency.'' Kasarda, we are told, was ''awed'' by this rationale.
The authors of ''Aerotropolis'' are perhaps to be congratulated for their bluntness and their provocations. But I could not shake the sense that something had gone missing from their vision of our future -- something like a soul.

HEADLINE: It's Time To Face The Fiscal Illusion

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
FISCAL policy debates often focus on technocratic questions about how much money the government should spend and when, yet the actual course of events depends not on the experts but on politics. The more that our government runs up unfunded obligations and debt, the more we are setting a trap for ourselves.
James M. Buchanan, a Nobel laureate in economics -- and my former colleague and now professor emeritus at George Mason University -- argued that deficit spending would evolve into a permanent disconnect between spending and revenue, precisely because it brings short-term gains. We end up institutionalizing irresponsibility in the federal government, the largest and most central institution in our society. As we fail to make progress on entitlement reform with each passing year, Professor Buchanan's essentially moral critique of deficit spending looks more prophetic. 
We are fooling ourselves most of all. United States government debt in public hands is now more than $9 trillion, but most people still don't realize what it will take to pay that off.
Here's an example: Say that you have $20,000 in Treasury bills. You probably believe that you own $20,000 in wealth. This will encourage you to spend and come up with ambitious plans. Yet someone -- quite possibly you -- will be taxed in the future to pay off the government debt. The $20,000 may be needed in order to do that.
The illusion is this: A government bond represents both a current asset and a future liability, yet for most people, those future tax payments feel less concrete and less real than the dollars they're holding in a money market account.
The field of behavioral economics analyzes imperfections in market decision-making, but the biggest practical problems often involve our inaccurate perceptions of what the public sector is up to and how much it will affect us.
In this case, the sorry truth is that our savings aren't worth as much as many of us think, and a rude awakening is coming. One way or another, some of our savings will be taxed away to make good on governmental commitments, like future Medicare benefits, which we currently are framing as personal free lunches.
Keynesian economics talks of the ''fiscal illusion'' created by government debt: the issuance of such debt can stimulate the economy in the short run by encouraging a false perception of wealth and thus bolstering consumer spending. But, eventually, the books must balance. There is then a fiscal crunch, a sudden retrenchment of plans and great rancor over budgets, as we have been seeing lately at both the federal and the state level.
The famous Keynesian rejoinder, ''In the long run we are all dead,'' is less comforting when that long run comes into sight. Short-run planning is a hard carousel to stop, especially when there are frequent election cycles, but the federal government must act soon. Limiting Medicare and Social Security spending involves re-indexing benefits, adjusting eligibility ages, shifting the growth rates of costs and making other changes that have their full fiscal impact only over the longer run.
Yet we are postponing even these actions. Experts' recommendations might lead us toward a fiscal smooth landing, but at this point the fiscal illusion -- and not the advice of experts -- is in control. So Professor Buchanan's argument is ringing true.
The technocratic Keynesian recommendation was to run deficits in bad times and surpluses in good times. But except for one stretch during the Clinton administration, this notion has been broken since the early 1980s. In the United States, at least, Keynesian economics has failed to find the necessary political institutions to enact and sustain a wise version of the theory.
Now that fiscal constraints are starting to bite, many politicians are afraid to reform or even to discuss changes in the largest problem areas: Medicare and Medicaid. Yes, some laudable cost controls on Medicare are embedded in the new health care law, but they're not enough. Most likely, we will end up making other spending cuts that won't solve our fiscal problems -- and in areas that could instead benefit from Keynesian employment stimulus. These kinds of knee-jerk, poorly reasoned decisions are what happens when fiscal illusion reigns.
Fiscal austerity may sometimes sound like a dogmatic religion, but fixed principles often help us do the right thing, especially when temptation beckons. Professor Buchanan argued that the real choice was between a religion of budget balance and a rule of illusion. Seeking an optimal technocratic path is not on the menu.
SO, given this mess, what should be done?
As Matthew Yglesias from the Center for American Progress has proposed,President Obama could pledge to veto any budget that increases the projected medium-term deficit, relative to the status quo. He should include in that veto threat any deficit increases that arise from annual budgetary gimmicks like patches to the alternative minimum tax or the ''doc fix'' adjustment of Medicare reimbursement rates.
Such an announcement would not fix health care costs, but it would force us to recognize them, and would move us away from purely short-term planning. It would force the government to consider both spending cuts and tax increases.
In any case, the rigor of the numbers will soon sweep away the fiscal illusion. The only question is whether we will end the charade on our own terms or continue to play the fool.

MOBY-DUCK
The True Story of 28,800 Bath ToysLost at Sea and of the Beachcombers, Oceanographers, Environmentalists, and Fools, Including the Author, Who Went in Search of Them
By Donovan Hohn
402 pp. Viking. $27.95.
''Hast seen the white whale?'' a Melville-loving officer aboard a research vessel asks Donovan Hohn, in his dazzling ''Moby-Duck,'' whenever they pass in the ship's corridor.
''Hast seen the yellow duck?'' Hohn cheerfully responds.
The answer is always no, but this hardly dampens Hohn's enthusiasm for his Moby -- a load of bath toys that plummeted off a storm-wracked container ship in the northern Pacific in 1992. The maritime misfortune was exciting for beachcombers, who would find the toys on North American coastlines for years to come, and it provided data for scientists who study ocean currents. It also spurred the map-loving Hohn, a dozen years on, to give up his Manhattan teaching gig and embark upon what could have been a fairly straightforward investigation. Where did the ducks come from, where did they drift, and why? 
But Hohn isn't a Harper's editor (and winner of the Academy of American Poets Prize) for nothing. There's a philosophical aspect to his quest as well -- a search for a watery wilderness that would ''refresh my capacity for awe'' (which is why Hohn looks forward, while riding a container ship across the North Pacific in winter, ''to a little Sturm and possibly some Drang'') and a desire to make a journey that would ''turn a map into a world.'' The duck's world is large, it turns out, and the desire to chart it puts Hohn on seagoing vessels of varying sizes and seaworthiness with captains courageous and cranky.
At once frivolous and freighted with cultural symbolism, the plastic duck makes a perfect subject for a writer of Hohn's ambition. ''What misanthrope, what damp, drizzly November of a sourpuss, upon beholding a rubber duck afloat, does not feel a Crayola ray of sunshine brightening his gloomy heart?'' he asks. But both the birth and the afterlife of the duck, Hohn soon learns, are toxic. Adrift on the ocean, the toys can become coated with ''persistent organic pollutants'' like polyvinyl chloride, bisphenol A and phthalates. Photodegraded into smaller pieces, they can be fatally ingested by sea creatures and will endure, in swirling gyres, for years.
As the ducks drift, so drifts Hohn, from the China-based toy industry to the depths of polymer chemistry; from a history of childhood to Sesame Street's ''Rubber Duckie'' and the role of animals in art; from early Arctic exploration to modern maritime disasters and the study of hydrography. Hohn is game to learn as much as he can, and his scholarship is impressive. But his real interests are far more abstract: the nature of quests, the line between fable and fact, the distinction between the natural and the man-made worlds, and the impossibility of fully understanding one's place -- to say nothing of a toy duck's -- in relation to the universe.
Presenting himself as a hapless innocent -- all ''I had no intention'' and ''I certainly never expected'' -- Hohn guides us expertly through the swirling currents of his own psyche, upon which so much of this book's considerable charm depends. We learn that the author is not really cut out to chase ducks: he's ''a weakling with a bad back,'' asthmatic, myopic, afraid of heights and sharks. Swimming in deep water off Hawaii inspires in him a terror that passes only after he scampers -- ''You might think that it would be impossible to scamper in flippers, but I can attest otherwise'' -- back aboard the catamaran, where he stays. Triumphant in the intellectual realm, the author quivers at, and makes great comedy of, physical danger. At one point, he hydroplanes around a slippery deck in a nighttime North Atlantic gale, sleep-deprived, hypothermic and soaked to the skin while wrestling heavy equipment and absorbing the curses of a crew boss. The nightmare ends with vomit and a 14-hour sleep. -
Over and again, Hohn returns (like Melville) to the themes of memory, childhood and impending fatherhood. He ruminates upon the relationship between seeing and knowing (standing at a taffrail, he enjoys ''the reunion of a thing and its word''), and the problem of translating words to images and images, like maps, into words. In following the ducks' illusory trail, he writes, ''I've strived to raise, if only by a megapixel or two, the resolution of my own mental model of the world.''
Why does this sort of imagining matter? Because how we imagine a place determines, among other things, how we value it, and therefore how far we may go to ''save'' it. In the case of trashed beaches, salvation comes either through back-end activities like feel-good citizen cleanups or, more promisingly, front-end policies that cut our use of nonessential plastics. At this point in Hohn's narrative, the ducks aren't a symbol or a metaphor. They are pure pollution, allowing him to deliver a nuanced critique of such cleanups and a sharp analysis of the public relations, or make-believe, behind them.
''Moby-Duck'' succeeds as harebrained adventure, as a cautionary environmental tale, as a deconstruction of consumer demand, and as a meditation on wilderness and imagination. Hohn moves easily between the micro and the macro, weaving personal histories into science and industry as he roams. In the Harper's manner, he luxuriates in extended descriptions (which sometimes spill into lengthy endnotes) of objects, oddballs and his reactions to everything he sees. Listening to an oceanographer expound, in his organic garden, on zero-waste policies and closed-loop manufacturing, Hohn writes, ''My upbringing in Northern California had taught me to distrust utopian strangers who talked about 'economic paradigms,' no matter how tasty their bananas.'' In a Chinese toy factory, he pulls a 16-year-old duck from his pocket and fits the toy into its original mold. ''For a moment I half expect some sort of cosmic magic to occur -- rays of yellow light to come shooting from the mold, a portal to open in the space-time continuum. Instead, I just stand there muttering, idiotically, 'Wow. . . Wow.' ''
At times, I reacted similarly to ''Moby-Duck.'' Hohn seems to have it all: deep intelligence, a strikingly original voice, humility and a hunger to suss out everything a yellow duck may literally or metaphorically touch. Naturally, he can't, but the chase is, after all, the thing.

HEADLINE: How to Stop Trading Away the Future

BYLINE: By NANCY F. KOEHN

 BODY:
THE world's leading economies are facing crises related to their vulnerability to booms and busts, rising income inequality, unsustainable government obligations, climate change and a widespread erosion of public trust, according to Diane Coyle, an economist and consultant.
In ''The Economics of Enough: How to Run the Economy as if the Future Matters'' (Princeton University Press), Ms. Coyle adds a knowledgeable and earnest voice to the discussion about how to face these global challenges. 
In many countries, she writes, policy makers have responded to economic crises by ''borrowing from the future on a massive scale.'' In the book's first section, she describes how the recent financial crisis greatly increased public debts as governments turned to bailouts.
These new loans, she writes, were piled on top of ''existing government burdens, sometimes acknowledged, more often off the books either as a deliberate sleight of hand or because they are implicit in the promise of future pension and welfare payments.''
In country after country, the results have been big budget deficits. In some major industrialized countries, like the United States and Britain, these deficits as measured against gross domestic product are expected to be among the largest since World War II. In the United States, for example, the deficit has recently been projected to be about 11 percent of G.D.P.
Add in the financial obligations of future welfare and pension payments for aging populations, as well as governments' inability to raise taxes in line with spending, and we have the makings of an economic disaster that, Ms. Coyle says, ''will unfold more slowly than the financial crisis but is if anything more severe.''
The promises that governments have made to pay pension, health care and other benefits to their citizens cannot be kept, Ms. Coyle argues. ''The only question is how they will be broken,'' she says, ''given the enormous political strains involved in fundamentally changing what people will get from their governments.''
Climate change and the larger issue of environmental sustainability are another challenge, Ms. Coyle argues, in which the balance between our actions today and our responsibilities to the future is out of whack. One does not have to look far to find evidence of depleting fishing stocks, accelerated extinctions of species, water shortages and atmospheric changes to realize that we are using up natural resources at a rapid rate.
What will this depletion, which is fed by current consumption, mean for future generations? Ms. Coyle writes that we ''do want more in order to be happier -- but how much more is feasible without destroying the natural and social environment, and how much more is fair to the people who will come after us?''
Borrowing from the future this way shows our inability, or refusal, to assume responsibility for the impact of today's choices on tomorrow's prospects, Ms. Coyle says.
Three elements -- measurement, values and institutions -- are needed to bring about a better balance between the present and future, she writes.
In the area of measurement, she says we must adopt broader, longer-term measures of economic well-being than G.D.P. Such metrics would account for health, education, the environment, employment, purchasing power and other conditions. They might also measure the stocks of the world's resources -- from fish in the ocean to human capital -- in addition to the annual flows of national income calculated in G.D.P.
The book is thinner in its suggestions on values. Ms. Coyle rightfully points to markets' importance in coordinating the complexity and variety of the global economy. But, she argues, markets are also inherently social institutions and thus vulnerable to prevailing norms.
In the lead-up to the financial crisis, for example, collective greed in the financial sector spilled over into other industries as executives and government policy makers justified ever-larger pay and bonus packages. This, she says, corroded trust in business and government, increased economic inequality and ate away at the social fabric -- present and future.
So far, so good. But how, exactly, can we make markets moral? And toward which specific ends? On these questions, the book is largely silent.
Ms. Coyle also deals with the need to adapt institutions to new and future realities. In doing so, she says, we need to realize that ''the debate about whether 'free markets' or 'intervention' is best, which has so dominated politics and policy for decades, is pointless.'' We need both well-functioning markets and effective government, she says, and each category feeds on the other: markets work best when governments work well, and vice versa.
Unfortunately, Ms. Coyle says, ''government failure has become a widespread reality.'' We see this, she argues, not only in nations' inability to reform their financial systems, but also in their inability to maintain fiscal discipline, reduce economic inequality and effectively govern economic markets. We need institutions that address important market failures, elicit public support and input, and consider the welfare of future generations by working from much longer time horizons, she writes.
IN the book's final section, Ms. Coyle briefly outlines several steps toward recalibrating the present and the future. These include publishing assessments of governments' true debt burdens, encouraging individual savings, reducing economic inequality by taxing bonuses and influencing public norms, and conducting Internet experiments to increase direct public involvement in policy-making.
Ms. Coyle has written a thoughtful, sprawling work. I was impressed with both the magnitude of the subject matter and her keen grasp of it, but was also hungry for more attention to the role of the individual. What can each of us do, here and now, to be better stewards of our collective well-being and of that of our children and their children? Despite her silence on this question, Ms. Coyle has made an important contribution to the debate on the nature of global capitalism.

THREE STAGES OF AMAZEMENT
By Carol Edgarian
298 pp. Scribner. $25.
The economy may still be sluggish, but it's been a veritable boom time for novels concerning the problems of people of privilege, those particularly American tragedies where folks with money, education and nice teeth invent elaborate ways to mess up their lives. In the last year or so, we had ''The Financial Lives of the Poets,'' by Jess Walter; ''Model Home,'' by Eric Puchner; ''The Privileges,'' by Jonathan Dee; ''Union Atlantic,'' by Adam Haslett; and ''Dear Money,'' by Martha McPhee. Joining the pack is Carol Edgarian's ''Three Stages of Amazement,'' an expansive novel (with a lamentably fussy title) about the intricate economies of the American marriage. 
It begins New Year's Eve 2008. Barack Obama has just been elected president, and the ''extraordinarily ordinary'' Lena Rusch, an overly capable heroine in the style of a 21st-century Lily Bart, is giving a party on credit. The evening, with its modest bounty (crab and a last-minute shopping list that includes ''butter, candles, ice''), is meant to be a corrective to the prior, very bad year. Ten months earlier, Lena, in her early 40s, gave birth to twins prematurely. One died, and the surviving twin, Willa, has seizures and chronic pneumonia. The doctors warn of cognitive delays: ''Cerebral palsy was a term sometimes used. Lena stopped her ears.'' Another mother cruelly yet evocatively calls the baby ''a squash.''
Lena's husband, Charlie Pepper, is a doctor, which would be an asset to Willa's care if he were ever home. Charlie has quit full-time doctoring to develop the appropriately named Nimbus, a robot that allows surgeons to operate from remote locations. Unfortunately, the demands of chasing Nimbus have forced Charlie to conduct his family life from a remote location, too. Beyond that, he has picked a lousy time to be a pioneer. Silicon Valley venture capital has dried up, and San Francisco, where he has moved his family in the way of countless prospectors before him, is pricey. The Rusch-Pepper clan, which includes a young son, Theo, is financially strained, emotionally exhausted and altogether amazed at the unexpected, downward turn in their fortunes. These are people who had ''arrived in San Francisco ready for luck.''
And then, luck finds them. Well, sort of. Cal Rusch, ''one of Silicon Valley's oldest and most savvy venture capitalists,'' starts sniffing around the Nimbus. Because this is a novel, Cal is also Lena's estranged Uncle Cal. With only a few months of financing left and no other options, Charlie has to choose between further alienating his already aggrieved wife and salvaging his business. Love or money, as the old saw goes. Of course, Charlie chooses money, both before speaking to his wife and before the money has even officially been offered. Lest you think this is a spoiler, the question in the book is never whether Charlie will take the money -- Edgarian tells us by the end of Chapter 1 that he will. The question is whether Charlie and Lena's marriage will survive this latest arrangement.
Just up the hill, another marriage, another party. The couple are Cal and Ivy Rusch, who have been married for nearly 50 years, and the party is to celebrate the engagement of their 30-something daughter, Paige. While Charlie and Lena are members of the squeezed upper middle class, Cal and Ivy -- both gorgeously prickly characters -- are the superrich. It turns out that the superrich aren't so different after all: Lena's most intimate relationship is with her nanny, Glo; Ivy's is with her butler, Paco; money can't protect either couple from the failings of the human body, not for very long, at least.
No, the superrich aren't so very different except that they throw much better, or at least bigger, parties: ''The Rusches rarely opened their doors to a crowd, but when they did, they opened them wide. The cost of the night would exceed a million dollars. Seven hundred and two guests; 10,000 passed hors d'oeuvre.'' In contrast with Lena's spread, the food at the Rusch's gala is described for nearly a page, the lavish detail bringing to mind ''The Age of Innocence,'' that classic problems-of-people-of-privilege novel: ''chefs from Chez Panisse, Rose's Cafe and Jardiniere. . . . Moroccan lamb meatballs, halibut and shrimp cakes with romesco, brioche panini with fontina and truffle oil, roasted pepper and Serrano ham, fried risotto balls, tuna tartare with chermoula on toast, fried polenta with mushroom duxelle. There was a kitchen with six Japanese chefs for sushi.''
Interestingly for a book about the intimacies of marriage, many of its important scenes are social occasions -- the two already mentioned, a child's birthday party, a funeral. If parties are something of an organizing principle for the novel, perhaps Edgarian's point is that we learn as much about a couple by how they behave in public as in private: the secret looks that can mean it's time to leave, or to get drinks; the way a wife laughs at a husband's shopworn story. Consider how Lena reinvents herself for the Rusches' party: ''By sheer will, she had turned herself into the brightest flower. Charlie would remember that. He would remember, too, that Lena picked up the pace and went in first.''
While aspects of the plot can seem contrived at first -- not only is Cal Lena's uncle, but her ex-boyfriend works at Cal's company -- the resolution is beautiful and as messy and complicated as real life. In one devilish episode, Charlie and Lena attempt to take a much-needed vacation. Charlie has promised Lena to turn off his mobile phone, but somehow he forgets, and en route to their getaway he can already feel the phone's seductive vibrations in his pocket. At the cabin, Charlie has no cell coverage and so climbs a tree (''an inhospitable tree, if ever there was'') to find three bars of reception. He has broken one more promise to his wife, and Lena will discover this latest treachery while dressed in lingerie bought especially for the weekend. ''Charlie was in the tree all right. He was in the tree -- as she was on the ground. What a picture they made: the middle-aged woman in a thong, the husband up in a tree, hunched back to the wind, talking on his cell. They were fools, she and Charlie.'' There is comedy here, and tragedy, and no small amount of poetry. Marriages, not unlike stock markets, have their peaks and valleys, too.
On some level, we know that Lena and Charlie will be all right. Despite the contemporary setting, it isn't the global economic crisis that has brought on their troubles, but the usual combination of sloppy, best-case-scenario thinking and midlife crises. If Nimbus fails, Charlie can always go back to his lucrative career as a surgeon. And in the short term, the Rusch-Peppers still have health care, a nanny, a roof over their heads and the ability to shop at Whole Foods-type stores. That they can even contemplate separation means they are richer than many. Couples argue about money, but in a bad economy, the poor stick together. Divorce and the contemplation of happiness are both luxury items.
''Three Stages of Amazement'' is Edgarian's second novel. Her first, ''Rise the Euphrates,'' was published 17 years and several media ages ago, back when chain bookstores were on the rise and authors of literary fiction were expected to cultivate mystery as opposed to followers. It's a long absence from the scene, especially in a culture with limited memory. Here's hoping her third novel arrives sooner.

''If we can identify how the pathology of Whiteness was constructed,'' the narrator, Chris Jaynes, proposes early in ''Pym,'' Mat Johnson's relentlessly entertaining new novel, ''then we can learn how to dismantle it.'' For Jaynes, the only black male professor at an ''intimate, good but not great'' college, the project of making whiteness visible has led to an obsession with ''The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket,'' the only novel by Edgar Allan Poe.
It's as good a place as any to begin. Toni Morrison has written that ''no early American writer is more important to the concept of American Africanism than Poe,'' and his single work of long fiction is a simmering trove of racial terror. Poe's protagonist, Pym, is a hapless seafarer whose adventures culminate in the discovery and exploitation of Tsalal, a tropical island located improbably close to Antarctica and populated by primitive natives so dark even their teeth are black. ''Horrors from the pit of the antebellum subconscious,'' Jaynes calls them. 
The Tsalalians soon rebel, making them, in Jaynes's eyes, the only indigenous population ever to successfully thwart colonization. Pym flees by canoe, and the story ends abruptly, with an image that has flummoxed and fascinated readers ever since: as Pym rows toward a chasm, an enormous, shrouded human figure rises before him, with skin ''the perfect whiteness of the snow.''
Jaynes lays out all this and more in a rollicking early set piece, managing to make literary criticism as funny and /action-/packed as anything to come. That is very funny and action-packed indeed, as the professor -- at loose ends after being denied tenure because he won't dignify the school's diversity committee with his presence -- finds evidence to suggest that Pym's adventures were real. He resolves to set sail for Antarctica and Tsalal, in search of history and redemption.
Conveniently, Jaynes's older cousin Booker, ''the world's only civil rights activist turned deep-sea diver,'' is keen on getting into the lucrative business of turning glaciers into bottled beverages. (Drinking from the tap has been taboo since the Dayton Dirty Water Disaster, one of many elliptically mentioned harbingers of doom in the novel.) Booker asks Jaynes to assemble an all-black skeleton crew, partly so their fledgling company can receive minority-business tax breaks and partly because he doesn't trust white people.
Jaynes recruits his childhood friend Garth Frierson, an unemployed bus driver whose greatest pleasures are gorging on Little Debbie snacks and making pilgrimages to gaze upon the anodyne landscapes immortalized by the planet's most popular artist, Thomas Karvel (rumored to be waiting out the world's troubles in Antarctica, of all places). Jaynes also invites his much-pined-for ex-girlfriend, Angela Latham; predictably enough, she arrives with an unctuous new husband, Nathaniel, in tow. Rounding out the group are the water treatment engineers Jeffree and Carlton Damon Carter -- a gay couple who run a popular blog documenting their real-life action-hero exploits -- and Booker's dog, White Folks.
With the exception of Garth, this supporting cast is far from robust in the personality department. Angela is so faintly drawn it's hard to empathize with Jaynes's attraction to her, the Damon Carters are a one-line joke and Nathaniel smells disposable the moment he appears. Fortunately, Johnson doesn't need any of them to lift much weight, because Jaynes's riff-heavy, insight-studded narration carries the load. And before long, the novel veers into territory so fantastical that character development seems very much beside the point.
Scholars may debate whether Poe's robed, melanin-deficient giant is a symbol of perfection, death or the impenetrability of whiteness, but the creatures Jaynes discovers living in a subterranean village hollowed from the ice are undoubtedly monsters. Hulking and albino, the Neanderthal-like Tekelians (or ''snow honkies,'' as Booker calls them) have been monitoring the newcomers all along.
The beings demonstrate an immediate voracity for Little Debbie products, but communication between natives and visitors falters until an intermediary emerges in the person of Arthur Gordon Pym, who appears to owe both his amazing longevity and his constant inebriation to the wondrous properties of a foul Tekelian liquor.
Pym venerates the Tekelians as gods and will speak only to the light-skinned Jaynes, assuming his darker crewmates are his chattel. Nonetheless, the double-centenarian helps broker a deal: a pair of Tekelians will accompany the party back to civilization, in return for a certain quantity of prepackaged desserts to be delivered upon their return. This is stymied when Jaynes and company return to base camp and discover that a rash of terrorist bombings has knocked all of civilization offline, or perhaps obliterated it entirely. Unable to pay their debt, the crew is forced into slavery.
Before all is done, there will be escapes and traitors, cross-species alliances and daring sacrifices, to say nothing of the world's least eco-friendly and most jingoistic biosphere.
It's no easy task to balance social satire against life-threatening adventure, the allegory against the gory, but Johnson's hand is steady and his ability to play against Poe's text masterly.
At times, the racial pathologies Jaynes seeks to confront almost overwhelm his abilities as an interrogator, looming over the novel as inscrutably as Poe's snow man and forcing the narrator to retreat into a kind of repeated, one-note refrain. ''The case was perpetually made, stuck in closing arguments with judgment ever forthcoming,'' Jaynes says of his cousin's collection of slavery artifacts, and occasionally the same feels true of ''Pym.'' But far more often, the book is polyphonous and incisive, an uproarious and hard-driving journey toward the heart of whiteness.

HEADLINE: Early Music Is Enjoying Its Moment

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KENYON

 BODY:
ARTISTIC revolutions rarely happen overnight, and if they do happen quickly, they do not necessarily spread uniformly. In recent decades the early-music movement has provoked a radical shift in performance styles throughout much of the music world. As an eccentric, irrelevant outsider in cultural life, the movement has managed to transform attitudes toward tradition and has wrought major changes in orchestral practice. A movement that started in powerful opposition to modern conventions has become increasingly integrated with mainstream performance.
But New York, an early leader in the movement through the medieval and Renaissance explorations of Noah Greenberg and the New York Pro Musica Antiqua in the 1950s and '60s, more recently lagged behind in crucial ways. Now, during the coming weeks, in a sort of serendipitous festival, the city plays host to some of today's outstanding early-music ensembles and conductors and puts forward a leading period-instrument ensemble of its own being nurtured at the Juilliard School, Juilliard415.
Can there be any more telling indication that the worlds of period and modern performance are becoming ever more closely reconciled and intertwined than the entry of Juilliard, long a bastion of modern, machine-tooled virtuosity, onto the scene? Juilliard students are learning to perform on gut strings, wooden flutes and valveless horns in what now passes for proper period style. 
William Christie, the American harpsichordist and conductor long resident in France, whose dazzling ensemble, Les Arts Florissants (some three decades old), presents music by Rameau at Alice Tully Hall on Friday and Saturday evening, has played a major role in the development of a historical performance program at the Juilliard School, now in its second year.
''We are so excited and so thrilled that we really cannot believe it is happening to us,'' Mr. Christie said recently. ''Here, after all the years when there was such a negative and unloving reaction to the whole idea of old instruments, we have a terrific commitment from the school and an enthusiasm that's spreading through the students. I think everyone would say that it has created a real buzz, and the students are fascinated by the idea of what it can bring to their music-making.''
Ara Guzelimian, dean of the Juilliard School, agrees that the injection of energy has been remarkable. ''One of the most surprising things about the program is how quickly and easily it has been integrated into the fabric of the school as a whole,'' he said. ''This year alone we are mounting two fully staged operas with the vocal arts department, and we have a waiting list of modern-instrument students who want to take period-instrument lessons.''
This wide-ranging fascination with the fruits of historical study may, as Mr. Christie surmises, be partly because ''the kids see a new opportunity to earn a living.''
''But it goes much deeper than that,'' he added. ''They are much more sophisticated in their attitude. They show a recognition that this way of performing is now a central part of our musical lives.''
In that sense the early-music revolution, which began on the fringes, can claim to have triumphed. It has also evolved: the very term ''early music,'' which originally denoted a repertory (pre-Classical, later pre-Romantic) and the instruments appropriate to it, has come to stand more broadly for a performance aesthetic, an approach to music in the context of its time that has been carried into 19th- and even 20th-century repertory.
The movement's spirit of inquiry and adventure is now completely embedded in our way of making music and thinking about it. With the added perspective of these latest gains, it may be useful to take a fresh look at how this all came about.
For the past generation pioneers of the early-music movement have worked with modern orchestras and have carried their insights into that area. At the beginning this was an occasional specialist event, a toe dipped briefly in the historical water. But the approach has become well established as part of an increasingly diverse musical mainstream. Great conductors are newly fascinated with the products of the historical performance movement.
The two most recent conductors of the period-instrument Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in London have been David Zinman (the American who conducts the Tonhalle Orchestra of Zurich) in Beethoven and Vladimir Jurowski (the Russian conductor of the London Philharmonic) in Wagner and Liszt. The emphasis here is shifting onto the conductor and his interpretive style rather than the instruments. When the conductor Ivan Fischer presented his fascinating Beethoven symphony cycle in New York last spring, split between the modern-instrument Budapest Festival Orchestra and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, it was his powerfully individual approach to the music, rather than the instruments that were used, that shone through all the concerts and gave the series its character.
Another measure of the success of the early-music approach is the number of conductors who have not themselves worked with period instruments but have been inexorably affected by their sounds and textures, their transparency and clarity, notably Bernard Haitink and Mariss Jansons. A special case is Claudio Abbado, whose young Orchestra Mozart plays on old and new instruments for different projects, and it is sometimes hard to tell them apart. You sense that in the process, Mr. Abbado is renewing himself as well as the music.
For much early repertory, old instruments hold their own. When Roger Norrington arrives at Alice Tully Hall with the Age of Enlightenment orchestra on March 16, he will be conducting the quirky, startling music of C. P. E. Bach using a period band (as he did in his EMI recordings of Beethoven symphonies with the London Classical Players), even though, for the last decade and more, he has been making a series of remarkable broadcasts and recordings with the modern-instrument Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra. There he took his distinctive quest for period style from Haydn and Mozart as far forward as Mahler and Elgar, eliminating the vibrato that modern string players use to create what he calls a ''pure tone'' modeled on that of the Vienna Philharmonic of the 1930s.
''The performance style is just as different from the conventional Mahler sound as anything using old instruments,'' Mr. Norrington said. ''The players are so agile and flexible they can now adapt.''
But for C. P. E. Bach, Mr. Norrington said, ''the injection of knowledge and passion about every little detail'' gives the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment the edge.
''They are brilliant at teasing out what the music really means,'' he added.
In the 1980s there was an intense polarization between the sometimes esoteric investigators of early music and many serious musicians who derided their efforts as irrelevant. A reviewer in Gramophone magazine sniffed that we needed a revival of period strings as much as we needed a revival of period dentistry. The intense battle was chronicled in The New York Times under headlines like ''Musicians Are at War Over the 'Right' Way to Play.'' A leader of the movement then was Christopher Hogwood, who created the modern version of the Academy of Ancient Music at the beginning of the trend, and whose early Mozart symphony recordings were up there with Luciano Pavarotti in the Billboard charts during the 1980s.
A scholar as well as a director, Mr. Hogwood arrives to conduct Juilliard415 in works by Haydn and Geminiani at Alice Tully Hall on March 19. Mr. Hogwood was one of those who, making an eloquent case for this activity in the early days, was thought by some to have gone too far in arguing the rightness of the early-music approach and the wrongness of everything else. But he now defends the approach as ''very, very necessary.''
''As performers you must be convinced,'' he said. ''You can't go charging into battle saying, 'Maybe, maybe not.' '' Now we have a younger generation of players who are committed to stylistic variety. So much has changed.''
New York has had a continued presence in the early-music world through the concert series Music Before 1800 at Corpus Christi Church, and decades ago groups like the Aulos Ensemble, Concert Royal and Pomerium Musices were leaders in their field. But Boston and its early-music festival led the way, and attempts to create period orchestras, like the Classical Band under Trevor Pinnock, failed to establish themselves.
Now the Juilliard program and its associated concerts and operas are exactly right for the times, and right for audiences that have responded to all this music-making without worrying about the finer historical points in dispute. All orchestras are increasingly thinking afresh about the way they work, and a new dynamic (a positive artistic dynamic as well as an economic one) is blowing a blast of fresh air through venerable institutions from New York to Los Angeles.
The music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, Simon Rattle, is passionately committed to period instruments and continues to conduct the Age of Enlightenment orchestra. That orchestra has introduced Night Shift concerts -- late-night informal events with drinks and conversation that have drawn new, younger audiences -- as well as a training program that puts younger players next to experienced leaders.
So what next? Has the need for the early-music laboratory, researching and recreating the repertory of the past with precision and passion, now passed? Mr. Christie, who has been one of the most consistently successful practitioners of historical performance, thinks not.
''I really feel that the early-music movement is more important now than it has ever been,'' Mr. Christie said. ''It is marvelous how much its ideas have been taken up, but that doesn't mean you don't need it anymore. There are definite dangers in thinking you can do everything. You can't put on a Rameau opera, with its complicated tuning and ornaments and vocal style, with modern instruments.''
Mr. Norrington agrees about the continuing need for a period approach to Rameau and C. P. E. Bach, and his case for old instruments is typically forthright.
''They are our conscience,'' Mr. Norrington said. ''They keep us grounded. Every bar we play is informed by both knowledge and fantasy. Every gesture has a reason, but it has to be enlivened by fantasy. Then the way we work with modern instruments is just the same, drawn by that sprit of curiosity and adventure, to find out what the music really means, what it's telling us.''
With peace breaking out on the early-music battlefield, there are still performance conventions to be challenged and a new generation of audiences excited. Juilliard415 is playing under Monica Huggett, the artistic director of the Juilliard historical performance program, in April, then touring J. S. Bach's ''St. Matthew Passion'' with Masaaki Suzuki in May.
At the Glyndebourne Festival in England, where Mr. Christie led the hugely successful introduction of Handel operas, he will stage Rameau's ''Hippolyte et Aricie'' with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in 2013, a landmark for a composer whose ravishing music is still too little heard in major opera houses.
The revolution may have been won, but the adventure continues.

HEADLINE: Automakers' Big Green Party Is Also a Masquerade Ball

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
GENEVA
THE 81st Geneva Motor Show is being promoted as a window into the future of a more environmentally responsible and sustainable auto industry. But should a 1,115-horsepower supercar that runs on ethanol be counted among the 40 or so new ''green'' machines at the show? If so, then what does green really mean?
The Geneva show is renowned as a showcase for exotic niche vehicles from customizers, tuners and boutique manufacturers. Still, this year's gathering includes such a bumper crop of powerful supercars it seems to be sending a mixed message.
Is a greener automotive future just around the corner? Or is it last call -- and while you're pouring, let's make it a double -- at the Horsepower Ball? 
Given the sheer number of models introduced here -- officially, 170 of them -- it is hard to make broad generalizations. But at least a dozen of these debutantes produce more than 500 horsepower and cost well into six -- and even seven -- figures.
These are wildly impractical cars whose premieres might have seemed inappropriate, to say the least, at auto shows during the last two recession-scarred years. At Paris, Los Angeles, Detroit and Chicago, precious few supercars were unveiled. At Geneva, such a robust new generation has been born that the breed could be perpetuated for years.
Jaguar introduced the XKR-S, which it billed as the most powerful Jaguar ever. Although the price was not mentioned, the car will easily be the most expensive Jag as well. With a top speed of 186 miles per hour, it will not be particularly fuel-efficient, either.
Aston Martin squeezed another $200,000-plus offering into its line: the Virage. The new car's styling was influenced by the $2 million special-edition One-77; only 77 of those are being built, and as of December 60 had been sold.
Lamborghini had even greater success with its recent Reventon special edition; the company said all 20 of those $1.6 million machines sold out within hours of the model's introduction two years ago. Not surprisingly, Lamborghini channeled styling inspiration from the Reventon into its new flagship, the Aventador LP700-4, which was introduced here. The Aventador replaces the retiring Murcielago -- the marque's long-running top-line sports car.
The 700 in the Aventador's nomenclature alludes to its horsepower output. Though engineers have made the car 500 pounds lighter than the Murcielago, any weight savings seems to have been devoted to making the car capable of going faster, not to saving fuel dollars. But at a price of $370,000, the cost of fuel would seem to be a trivial concern for anyone able to afford the car.
There seems to be no shortage of buyers for these high-end supercars. A report by IHS Global Insight, an automotive research firm, predicted a 140 percent increase this year in sales of cars priced above $100,000.
Even as Ferrari introduced the FF shooting brake -- a type of jaunty wagon originally conceived to take gentlemen on the hunt -- it said the first year's production was sold out. The FF will be the first all-wheel-drive Ferrari.
Other expensive Geneva debutantes included the $500,000 Gumpert Tornante from Germany; the $950,000 GTA Spano from Spain and the $1.5 million Pagani Huayra, made in Italy.
But the most over-the-top example of automotive excess at Geneva is the Swedish-made Koenigsegg Agera R.
Because it can run on biofuel, the Agera R is considered a green vehicle. But the E-85 ethanol blend the car uses actually makes it less fuel efficient: running the ethanol blend through the twin-turbo 5-liter V-8 pushes its output to 1,115 horsepower.
The Agera is also capable of running on premium gasoline, in which case it would make only 940 horsepower -- and its top speed would be much less than the theoretical limit of 273 m.p.h. that its engineers have calculated.
No track has been found where it could be driven that fast. But business is good; the floor model was already sold to a Scandinavian businessman for more than $1.6 million.
Perhaps a more sincere effort at environmental sustainability comes from Rolls-Royce, which introduced the 102EX, an electric version of its Phantom sedan. Though the 102EX is just an experimental vehicle, Rolls-Royce said it had identified a need to explore cutting-edge methods of propulsion.
Though the show includes vehicles from manufacturers in 31 countries, the largest and most flamboyant contingent is certainly from Europe.
Several Chrysler vehicles were on display, but they had been rebadged as Lancias. Since the Fiat Group assumed control of Chrysler, the Italian company has been looking for a way to leverage its American affiliate's vehicles into its existing brand structure. Lancia, which was sorely in need of new products, was deemed the most obvious fit.
Fiat's most notable introduction here was, without a doubt, the new Alfa Romeo 4C, an evocative sports car slotted into its lineup below the sensational limited-edition $250,000 8C sports car, but above Alfa's mainstream models.
The Renault-Nissan Alliance offered two eye-catching concept cars. The Renault Captur takes the rakish, offbeat style of the Nissan Juke in a more extreme direction, and the Nissan Esflow offered a hint of what an electric sports car could be.
The fledgling American electric vehicle industry was represented by two companies: Tesla, which presented the latest underpinnings for its coming Model S sedan, and Fisker, which displayed the latest version of its promised Karma sport sedan.
A former Fiat executive, Gian Mario Rossignolo, was on hand for his revival of the De Tomaso marque after the brand's nine-year absence.
German automakers each had a few offerings, but they may be holding back products until the big Frankfurt show in September. Notable new models here included the Audi A3 concept, the BMW Vision ConnectedDrive concept and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe.
The Bulli, Volkswagen's latest effort to recreate the beloved Microbus of decades past, attracted large crowds -- but mixed reviews.
Even though the show seemed to take itself and the environment -- in the industry, if not the cosmos -- quite seriously, there was some of the whimsy that the event was known for. Two Swiss automakers, Rinspeed and Sbarro, had fun with two concepts intended to produce smiles, if not buyers.
Sbarro showed a two-seat bubble-roof concept car called the Two for 100, which could easily be confused with George Jetson's flying car from the cartoon series. Rinspeed offered the BamBoo beach cruiser, which seemed a bit out of place considering the snow flurries outside the show hall.
The Morgan Motor Company, a venerable British automaker famed for its wood-frame sports cars, resurrected a vehicle style from its century-old past: the three-wheeler. The models on display, decaled in fighter-plane livery, attracted a great deal of attention.
The show runs through March 13 at the Palexpo convention center.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Online Correction: March 3, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Ferrari FF had a waiting list of three years. The FF is sold out for 2011 production.

 BODY:
Last Sunday, Metropolitan began an occasional series showcasing portraits of immigrants in New York and the things they brought with them from home. Dozens of readers from around the world shared their own stories on nytimes.com.
Here are some of our favorites:
I came from Cuba at the end of 1960, just before the start of the Peter Pan Flights that brought thousands of Cuban kids to the United States. The restrictions imposed by the Castro regime on the lucky few with exit visas prevented me from taking much. In fact, the limit was $5 per person and a single suitcase. My cardboard suitcase was big enough to carry some clothing that would allow me to live in Minneapolis in the winter of that year. The only memento of that journey I still have and treasure is a copy of Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'' -- in a bilingual edition -- with my mother's dedication on the frontispiece and some handwritten notes in pencil. The love of great literature -- Shakespeare in particular -- and the love of my parents, who encouraged me in a career in the arts, are symbolically contained in that book. 
Rafael de Acha Cincinnati My great-grandfathers and grandfather, when they came to this country from Ireland in the late 1890s and early 1900s, must have brought *something* with them, but they didn't pass it on. There is not one thing from them. Not a single thing. Not even a photo -- all the photographs were taken after they arrived in Canada or the United States. I always found that sort of sad.
My children's father, who came to this country in 1986, had spent nine years in the Soviet gulag -- he was a political prisoner. He was released from prison through the interventions of American peace activists in the Gorbachev era, and quickly forced to leave the country. He had hardly any time to pack anything and little would have been allowed to take in any event. He arrived in the U.S. with the help of the International Organization for Migration with only a small flight bag. He was also carrying a small toothbrush he had kept in labor camp, one of the few personal possessions. In order to have it fit in the pocket of a camp uniform and not be seen and confiscated, it had to be sawed off and honed down. So it's a sort of ''travel'' toothbrush carefully polished at the end. We still keep it in a drawer.
Catherine Fitzpatrick New York I brought my family Bible.
Alfredo Connecticut Like all young Swiss men, my grandfather served in the Swiss Army. When he immigrated to New York 1922, he brought an army souvenir with him: an artillery shell at least 80 mm in diameter, roughly the size of a wine bottle. It was probably a practice round, as it no longer contained any trace of explosive, but its outer case had ballistic markings from being fired from a Howitzer.
I still have this family ''heirloom'' in my basement in Massachusetts. Every now and then, the local stations run hysterical news stories about old ordnance discovered in someone's home and the presumed danger attached to it. These stories amuse me when I think about the long journey of my grandfather's shell.
Mark Boston My dad came from Germany to the U.S. in 1938 with only a Leica camera, bringing it to sell. A generation later, in 1971, my husband and I drove a rented truck with all our possessions from New York to Montreal, including a new-to-us stove and fridge that were a gift from a friend in Queens.
But what I remember most is what my Aunt Gerda brought our family when she and her husband and their five children came from Germany to the U.S.A. in 1954. It was scary for them; they were refugees sponsored by my dad and the local church, and in spite of all these careful arrangements, the older children remember being bombed by the Allies and were worried about coming to live here! They only had a few things, but brought us a gift, a new set of wooden painted angel musicians, a little orchestra with its own angel conductor. I still have it, and every Christmas I put it on the roof of the stable of my creche.
Vivian L. Montreal Rosary and novena prayers -- anchors in an alien land. Tiger balm -- an analgesic. My personally worked out solutions to problems in math and statistics textbooks -- and on scrap paper -- items that I thought would be essential to successful graduate studies.
Terry G. Philadelphia I came in 1981, at the age of 21, to go to graduate school at Stanford -- the stereotypical Indian engineer, except perhaps for my gender. I brought with me a royal blue and parrot green sari, the first sari my dad bought me when I was 16 years old and leaving home for college.
Lots of memories were already wrapped up in that sari when I left India, and lots more are entwined in it now. It's worn out in places, and I darn it very carefully every couple of months, the only thing I actually take time to darn, especially since Dad died a little while ago and he and I had made a special trip to buy it, 34 years ago.
At that time, in India, it was weird for a father to accompany his daughter to a sari store, but I was Daddy's girl. My mom thought it an extravagant purchase, and it was.

My parents had great dreams and I think were a little shocked to find that life was hard here also. The machines were never used, but the wonderful thing about being surrounded by all they brought with them was that it gave us a great sense of pride and love for our culture and each other.

HEADLINE: Tight Budgets Mean Squeeze In Classrooms

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Millions of public school students across the nation are seeing their class sizes swell because of budget cuts and teacher layoffs, undermining a decades-long push by parents, administrators and policy makers to shrink class sizes.
Over the past two years, California, Georgia, Nevada, Ohio, Utah and Wisconsin have loosened legal restrictions on class size. And Idaho and Texas are debating whether to fit more students in classrooms.
Los Angeles has increased the average size of its ninth-grade English and math classes to 34 from 20. Eleventh- and 12th-grade classes in those two subjects have risen, on average, to 43 students.
''Because many states are facing serious budget gaps, we'll see more increases this fall,'' said Marguerite Roza, a University of Washington professor who has studied the recession's impact on schools. 
The increases are reversing a trend toward smaller classes that stretches back decades. Since the 1980s, teachers and many other educators have embraced research finding that smaller classes foster higher achievement.
Rachael Maher, a math teacher in Charlotte, N.C., said she had experienced the difference between smaller and larger classes. She has watched her seventh-grade classes grow since her school system ran into budget trouble three years ago. Before, her classes averaged 25 students; this year they average 31.
''They say it doesn't affect whether kids get what they need, but I completely disagree,'' Ms. Maher said. ''If you've gained five kids, that's five more papers to grade, five more kids who need makeup work if they're absent, five more parents to contact, five more e-mails to answer. It gets overwhelming.''
In Detroit, the authorities are so overwhelmed by financial troubles that they are debating a deficit-reduction proposal that would increase high school class sizes to 60 students. Michigan's state superintendent of public instruction, Michael P. Flanagan, said that the plan was unlikely to be put into effect, but that ''class sizes will be higher than you and I would like.''
In New York City, average elementary class sizes have grown to 23.7 students from 21.8 since 2008, according to official data.
In Utah, one of the few states that collect class size data each year, median class size has increased by several students in many grade levels since 2008. It now ranges from 22 students in kindergarten to 31 students in high school chemistry classes.
''All the budget cuts have started our class sizes on that climb upward,'' said Judy W. Park, associate superintendent of the State Office of Education in Utah. ''During the last two years, our schools have really seen it.''
Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said a number of surveys had shown that parents cared more about small classes than anything except school safety.
But budget cuts are forcing schools to raise class sizes, putting those who advocate shrinking them on the defensive.
Leonie Haimson, executive director of Class Size Matters, a group that presses for smaller classes in New York and nationally, said many states enacted policies limiting student numbers during the late 1980s and 1990s.
''But now, in the majority of states, you're seeing definite increases in class sizes because of the recession and budget cuts,'' Ms. Haimson said. ''Unfortunately we've also seen the rise of a narrative that's become dominant in education reform that insists that class size doesn't matter.''
Research that convinced many policy makers of the benefits of small classes was conducted in Tennessee.
Helen Bain, who served as the president of the nation's largest teachers union in the 1970s, became a strong advocate for the idea. When she was a seventh-grade teacher early in her career, Ms. Bain recalled, her students learned quickly in classes of 15 or 20 students, but less effectively as class sizes grew.
''When it got to 35, I told the principal, 'I can't teach this many children,' '' she said.
In the 1980s, Ms. Bain persuaded Tennessee lawmakers to finance a study comparing classes of 13 to 17 students in kindergarten through third grade with classes of 22 to 25 students. The smaller classes significantly outscored the larger classes on achievement tests.
In the decades since, researchers, including the Princeton economist Alan Krueger, have conducted studies that they say confirm and strengthen the validity of the Tennessee findings.
Others, including Eric Hanushek, a Stanford economist, have argued that the impact of small classes on achievement has been exaggerated and that giving students a skillful teacher is more cost-effective.
Those who support that notion include Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who last Sunday told governors gathered in Washington to consider paying bonuses to the best teachers to take on extra students.
Mr. Duncan said he would prefer to put his own school-age children in a classroom with 28 students led by a ''fantastic teacher'' than in one with 23 and a ''mediocre'' teacher.
Bill Gates made a similar argument to the governors, portraying the movement to reduce class sizes as one of the most expensive and fruitless efforts in American education.
The federal Department of Education collects nationwide class size data every few years, and the average has declined steadily for half a century. In 1961, the average elementary school class had 29 students, and the average high school class had 28. In 2007-8, the most recent year with data, the elementary school average was 20, and the high school average was 23.4.
Dr. Roza, who is an adviser to Mr. Gates, said she had measured a recent decline of half a percent in the total number of employees in American public education. ''That's meant some growth,'' she said, but average class sizes have not ballooned.
''Maybe the national average went up one kid,'' Dr. Roza said. ''But I don't think we've jumped to 30 kids per class.''
The nationwide movement to shrink classes dates to the early 1980s, when Texas passed a law limiting class sizes, to 22 students in elementary grades. Tennessee followed with class-size reduction measures for the early grades.
In 1996, California lawmakers approved a measure to reduce class sizes to 20 for kindergarten through third grade. Today, more than 30 states have some form of programs to reduce class sizes.
But many have been challenged since the recession.
In Texas, the state comptroller in December proposed loosening the class size limit, saying it could save $558 million in teacher salaries. That proposal has found backers in a Legislature that is weighing $10 billion in cuts from public education over two years, but teachers and parent groups are outraged.
In California, which has spent about $20 billion on a class-size reduction program, state officials deferred financing for it in 2009 and reduced penalties to districts that allowed average classes to grow above the limits.
In Florida, where voters in 2002 approved a ballot initiative amending the State Constitution to cap elementary classes at 18 students and high schools at 25, the authorities are struggling with those limits.
''If an elementary gets a 19th student during the year, they have to hire a teacher and split the class, and that makes no sense,'' said Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association.
In November, a ballot initiative that asked voters to repeal class-size limits won a majority, but it fell short of the 60 percent required to overturn a constitutional amendment.
As of late last year, Florida school districts had accumulated $41 million in penalties for exceeding the caps. Palm Beach County's penalty alone totaled $16.6 million.
This year districts have been appealing the penalties, and state officials have reduced many. Florida lawmakers are debating ways of giving school systems more flexibility without violating the law.

HEADLINE: Are State and Local Government Employees Paid Too Much?

 BODY:
It's not an easy question to answer for a number of reasons. Here's a primer on the issue.
Public workers make more ... Surveys by the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that public workers' annual compensation -- salary plus benefits -- is higher on average than private sector workers, and they suggest that the gap is growing. 
... especially when figured per hour of work. Public workers also put in significantly fewer hours per week. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, their COMPENSATION PER HOUR is much higher.
Most of the advantage is in BENEFITS. They cost state and local governments $14 an hour on average, about 70 percent more than private employers pay for their workers. But comparisons are tricky ...
Economists point out that government work tends to be in HIGHLY SKILLED categories, so it is misleading to compare the groups as a whole.
... even when comparing across smaller groups. Among SERVICE OCUPATIONS, public pay is still higher. But the public category includes firefighters and police officers; the private category includes many different kinds of jobs. Does that mean the groups are not comparable, or does it make the point that similarly qualified people can get better pay in the public sector?
In CLERICAL jobs, employers' costs are higher in government, but the gap is smaller. Public workers quit less often and are fired less often. But there are other issues. The rate at which state and local workers VOLUNTARILY QUIT is very low. Some economists argue that this confirms that they are overpaid and that private workers leave for better pay. Public workers are also FIRED AT MUCH LOWER RATES. By estimating the income loss before fired workers find new jobs, some economists argue that this is a benefit worth as much as 15 percent of their pay.
Finally, much of the debate relies on disputed accounting. Ultimately, the argument turns on things that are difficult to value, especially RETIREMENT BENEFITS. Most public employees are guaranteed a pension and have access to paid health insurance in retirement benefits that are disappearing from the private sector. What is this worth?
A lot more than federal surveys show, said Andrew G. Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute, because state and local governments are PUTTING AWAY FAR LESS than they should to finance their obligations, especially in some heavily unionized states. But Jeffrey H. Keefe, a Rutgers professor who studies the issue for the liberal Economic Policy Institute, disputes this and argues that the cost of defined benefit pensions is overestimated in federal surveys.
Mr. Biggs argues that PUBLIC RETIREE HEALTH CARE is also underestimated. He says that the value of that is huge and pushes public workers' compensation well above private workers'. Mr. Keefe cites California, where less than 1 percent of state employee retirement spending goes for this purpose. The debate goes on.
... but unionization does not always mean higher pay. In some job categories, there is VIRTUALLY NO DIFFERENCE in the compensation of public and private employees. In higher education and hospitals, there is a smaller unionization gap, a high level of similarity in job descriptions and nearly identical compensation. Generally, with progress up the skill ladder, the public job premium declines or even reverses.

HEADLINE: Changing Nature of West Hollywood, Long a Gay Haven, Becomes an Election Issue

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

 BODY:
WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -- Since its beginning, West Hollywood has offered the country's closest approximation of a gay city. It was founded by gay activists over 26 years ago, most of its City Council members are gay, and the community is famous for its concentration of gay residents and nightlife.
But an uncommonly bitter election has exposed a growing divide over what West Hollywood should represent, with prosperity and urban development pitted against the city's history as a countercultural haven. 
The six challengers in Tuesday's City Council election -- all of them gay men -- are seeking to oust three incumbents by running on platforms invoking concerns about development and gentrification pushing out younger gay residents and the edgier elements that have long distinguished West Hollywood.
''I believe we're at risk of being in a situation where West Hollywood is no different than Beverly Hills or Calabasas,'' said Scott Schmidt, one of the challengers. ''West Hollywood has a special place in the heart of the gay and lesbian community, and people want to make sure we retain what makes us special.''
West Hollywood's story is a familiar one for gay neighborhoods across the country. From the Castro in San Francisco to the West Village in New York, bathhouses and bars catering to gay men and women have been replaced with designer retail shops, high-priced apartments and playgrounds. Many lament that this gentrification has forced young gay residents into other neighborhoods in search of cheaper rent.
But the fight over whether traditional gay neighborhoods should be preserved has taken on special significance here, because West Hollywood is not just a neighborhood -- it is a city of 35,000 people with its own government, which repaves roads, builds public libraries and holds elections every two years.
Mayor John Heilman said West Hollywood was going through an inevitable evolution as gay residents gained greater acceptance in society. The city's gay population has aged and, he argued, its interests have changed. Gay residents are more likely to, say, have children and focus on family activities than stay out late at one of the gay clubs that dot Santa Monica Boulevard.
''We still have the same number of gay people, but straight people now feel comfortable going into a gay area and socializing,'' said Mr. Heilman, who is gay. ''A lot of people are proud of their identity, but they're not going out to bars all the time anymore. Their priorities have shifted as they've gotten older.''
Don Reuter, the author of the book ''Greetings from the Gayborhood,'' said gay communities nationwide were experiencing the same cultural and demographic shifts -- and backlashes against them -- as West Hollywood has.
''In every city I've been to, I hear people say, 'I wish this neighborhood was what it used to be,' '' Mr. Reuter said, adding, ''But at the same time, the gay community was asking for acceptance, and what they've gotten is acceptance.''
Since long before its founding in 1984, West Hollywood has offered a haven for social outsiders and illicit nightlife. During Prohibition, when it was a two-square-mile slice of unincorporated Los Angeles County, mobsters set up casinos and nightclubs where alcohol was served in back rooms beyond the reach of the Los Angeles police, and in the 1970s gay men started opening bars here.
Today, West Hollywood, where an estimated 40 percent of residents are gay, is a boomtown. Amid a recession that has plunged so many governments into budget crises, West Hollywood has a surplus of more than $50 million. Crime rates are down drastically, and the city has embarked on a huge project to rebuild a public parking garage, a library and a park.
Wendy Goldman, 58, who is straight and has lived in West Hollywood since its founding, said she was pleased with how the city had changed and was supporting the incumbents.
''The city's not what it used to be, it's not as rough,'' she said. ''But thank God for that.''
Yet those hoping to unseat the three incumbents argue that development has made West Hollywood less hospitable for those who have historically populated the city. Some point to a smoking ban on restaurant patios and to plans to replace a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center with a playground as evidence that the city is increasingly catering to middle-class families, rather than young people who want to let loose.
''Some of the City Council members have abandoned West Hollywood as a place for adults, and are interested in attracting a more gentrified set of people to the city,'' said John D'Amico, another challenger.
Still, some of those who express nostalgia for the city's wilder past hope that West Hollywood's future can include them, as well.
''There has been a shift in cultural values in the gay community,'' said John Duran, a councilman who is not up for re-election this year and is supporting Mr. D'Amico. ''Marriage by its nature is a conservative institution, which often brings children and monogamous relationships. But there are still glittering gay drag queens and pool-playing lesbians in this community. I'm hoping there is enough room in graying West Hollywood for both.''

HEADLINE: Dollars to Doughnuts: The Food Subsidy Puzzle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Don't End Agricultural Subsidies. Fix Them.'' (column, March 2), Mark Bittman says that if all Americans ate their recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, there wouldn't be enough to meet the need. 
If Americans didn't ''need'' Dunkin' Donuts or Pepsi, eventually that supply would diminish. The sad truth is that Americans demand junk food, and until nutrition trumps quick and tasty and cheap, carrots will rot while the cookie jar empties.
Instead of criticizing the way subsidies are now distributed and pushing farmers to grow foods Americans don't want, Mr. Bittman might want to focus on the economics of nutritive demand.
Julie Butterfield Marietta, Ga., March 2, 2011
To the Editor:
So, our bad dietary habits are the fault of foolish government, greedy farmers and malevolent agribusiness.
Is Mark Bittman myopic to the remarkable achievements of a food system that does so much for so many people for relatively little? Agriculture does have its challenges, like the need to double food production in the next 40 years to meet the needs of a world population that will rise from seven billion to nine billion. And this with less arable land, water limitations and the need to protect the environment.
Will we do it by subsidizing small and medium family farms? Unlikely!
Rurik B. Halaby Chairman, AgriCapital Corporation New York, March 2, 2011
To the Editor:
I don't like farm subsidies any more than Mark Bittman does, but they do not necessarily make unhealthy foods cheap. These programs subsidize the income of farmers in part by making food more expensive.
Our sugar program keeps foreign sugar out of the American market, driving up the domestic price of all sweeteners -- including high-fructose corn syrup.
The dairy program reduces imports as well, driving up our prices for milk and cheese. The Conservation Reserve Program takes land out of production in Kansas, which drives up the price of wheat.
Our ethanol program diverts large quantities of corn to fuel use, driving up the price of corn for both food and feed. That, in turn, makes corn products and meats artificially expensive for consumers, not artificially cheap.
Unhealthy food products may be cheap relative to income today, but not because of farm subsidies.
Robert Paarlberg Watertown, Mass., March 2, 2011
The writer, a professor of political science at Wellesley College, is the author of ''Food Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know.''

HEADLINE: Utah G.O.P. Adopts Immigration Alternative

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
In the first move by a state to extend legal recognition to illegal immigrant laborers, the Utah Legislature has passed immigration bills that include a guest worker program that would allow unauthorized foreigners to work legally in the state.
With the immigration package, passed in both chambers of the Republican-controlled Legislature late Friday, Utah made a sharp break with the hard-line trend in state immigration legislation that has been led by Arizona, which passed a strict enforcement law last April.
Utah's package includes measures to tighten enforcement against illegal immigrants that echo Arizona's tough stance -- like a requirement that the police check the immigration status of anyone arrested on a felony or a serious misdemeanor charge.
But supporters said the hybrid package offered an alternative to states, including those controlled by Republicans, that are seeking to avoid the costly political polarization and legal challenges that followed Arizona's law and that also want to recognize the need of some businesses for immigrant labor in spite of high unemployment nationally. 
The guest worker bill came after intense lobbying by business and farm groups as well as by some immigrant advocates, and it enjoyed the quiet but all-important endorsement of the Mormon Church. It is likely to raise many of the same constitutional questions as the Arizona law, including whether it intrudes on areas of immigration law reserved exclusively for the federal government. Central provisions of Arizona's law, known as S. B. 1070, were suspended by federal courts pending a lawsuit by the Obama administration.
But in contrast to Arizona's approach, Utah lawmakers framed their bill to set up a negotiation, rather than a confrontation, between the governor and the federal authorities. Gov. Gary R. Herbert, a Republican who handily won election in November, is expected to sign the bill.
''Utah is the anti-Arizona,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a group in Washington that favors legislation by Congress to grant legal status to illegal immigrants. ''Instead of indulging the fantasy that you can drive thousands of people out of your state, it combines enforcement with the idea that those who are settled should be brought into the system.''
Under one bill approved on Friday, Utah would issue a two-year work permit to illegal immigrants who could prove that they had been living and working in the state. To qualify, immigrants would have to pass a criminal background check and pay fines of up to $2,500.
The bill gives the governor until 2013 to negotiate with federal immigration authorities for a waiver for the guest worker program. Under federal law, it is a violation for an employer to knowingly hire an illegal immigrant. If no waiver has been obtained by then, the guest worker program would go into effect anyway.
Under a separate bill, also approved Friday, officers would be required to check the immigration status of anyone they arrest on a felony or serious misdemeanor charge.
Lawmakers revised that bill to remove terms borrowed from the Arizona law that would have allowed the police to ask immigration questions based on a ''reasonable suspicion'' that a person they stopped was an illegal immigrant. That provision, among others, was strongly opposed by Latinos in Arizona, who said it would lead to racial profiling.
State Representative Bill Wright, a Republican who was the sponsor of the guest worker bill in the House, said it was intended to be a practical way to deal with illegal immigrants in the state. ''I'm a very conservative Republican; I'm not moderate at all,'' he said. But, he said, ''we literally do not have the ability to remove those who are here illegally.''
The enforcement measure was sponsored by State Representative Stephen Sandstrom, a Republican who has been an outspoken proponent of following Arizona's lead on immigration.
Many groups in Utah hoped to avoid the expense and furor provoked by Arizona's bill. In November, a range of groups signed a proposal called the Utah Compact, which laid out principles that included respect for the law but also supported a free-market business approach and opposed measures that would separate families by deportation. It was signed by the Salt Lake Chamber, a statewide business group; the Roman Catholic Church; the Salt Lake City Police Department and mayor's office; and local immigration advocate groups.
The Mormon Church, which had been cautious on the issue, did not sign the compact but immediately endorsed it.
Not everyone in Utah was happy with the new immigration measures. Several hundred protesters from immigrant organizations demonstrated outside the Capitol on Saturday, calling the enforcement bill racist and urging Mr. Herbert to veto it, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.
David Leopold, the president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said Utah's bills were ''another ill-advised attempt by a state to regulate immigration.'' He warned that the effort ''dangerously treads into a policy area that is the sole province of the federal government.''
The Utah measures, coming from one of the most conservative states in the nation, open an avenue for action for Republican politicians who have been concerned that the strident tone of supporters of Arizona's law -- including Gov. Jan Brewer and Russell Pearce, the Arizona Senate majority leader who wrote the bill -- has alienated Latino voters.
Some Republican leaders have argued that to win the presidency in 2012, they need to increase Latino support in states like California, Nevada, New York and Texas. Among others, Newt Gingrich, a potential presidential candidate, and Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, have pressed fellow Republicans to moderate their speech on immigration.
''Utah thought Arizona's law would backfire,'' said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, a Republican group that has been working to draw the party toward an immigration policy with more appeal to Hispanics. ''It was not business-friendly, and it would drive away workers and investment. Utah has provided conservative arguments for passing a different kind of measure.''
Arizona's immigration enforcement law drew a boycott by the nation's most prominent Latino organizations and cost the state $86 million in lost convention and tourism business, according to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a group that opposed the measure. Mr. Pearce has proposed a new package of immigration restrictions that go far beyond last year's.
Another bill that passed the Utah House and is likely to be approved next week in the Senate would set up a partnership with Nuevo Leon State in Mexico to bring temporary farm workers to Utah through the existing federal guest worker program.
Supporters of the bills in Utah said they should be a model for action on immigration by Congress. ''It's doable,'' said Wesley Smith, director of public policy for the Salt Lake Chamber. ''The extremes have dominated the immigration debate for so long, it makes it so refreshing to see that a practical solution is possible.''

HEADLINE: Mexican Church Takes a Closer Look at Donors

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
PACHUCA, Mexico -- The large orange chapel here, with its towering cross, would be just another Roman Catholic church if not for a bronze plaque announcing that it was ''donated by Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano'' -- better known as ''the executioner,'' commander of the ruthless crime syndicate called the Zetas.
The nameplate goes on to quote Psalm 143: ''Lord, hear my prayer, answer my plea.'' But Mexican Catholics are the ones struggling with how to respond.
Ever since the chapel's financing spawned a government investigation four months ago, the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico has been trying to confront its historic ties to drug traffickers. Long dependent on gifts, but often less than discriminating about where they come from, the church is grappling with its role as thousands die in turf wars among rich, and sometimes generous, criminals. 
''The chapel put the entire church in Mexico on alert,'' said the Rev. Hugo Valdemar, a spokesman for the country's largest archdiocese, in Mexico City. ''As a result, our public posture has changed, and become much tougher.''
The church has indeed gone further than before, with public pledges to reject ''narcolimosnas,'' or ''narco alms,'' and priests linked to traffickers. A handful of outspoken bishops have also stepped up condemnations of both the cartels and the government's militaristic efforts to stop them.
But at the local level, the codependency of the church and the cartels often endures. Here in the middle-class neighborhood of Pachuca where Mr. Lazcano is said to have grown up, priests still say Mass at the chapel every Sunday, arguing that the church is not responsible for determining whether the Zetas' leader has any connection to the building that bears his name.
Catholic officials have said there are other chapels that they believe were built with drug money, in what some describe as money laundering for the soul. And yet, according to Father Valdemar -- who works closely with Mexico's conference of bishops -- the church has no formal strategy for how to deal with the cartels in their midst and no plan to develop guidelines for priests struggling with munificent killers.
The Rev. Joseph Palacios, a sociology professor at Georgetown University and a Catholic priest who has written extensively about the Mexican church, said more must be done.
''This is an endemic problem,'' Father Palacios said. ''If they just issue statements and don't analyze the roots of the situation, they aren't going to change anything.''
The church's challenge is partly historic. Mexico's 1917 Constitution separated church and state far beyond what can be found in the United States. It forbade churches of all denominations from operating primary and secondary schools, nationalized ownership of all church buildings and barred priests and other religious leaders from voting or criticizing the government, even in private.
The restrictions were lifted in 1992, but religious scholars say the church had become impoverished by that time, reliant on the wealthy and with a mentality of ''no mete en la politica'' -- don't get into politics.
For years, that culture of nonconfrontation and need has allowed narco alms to be an open secret, according to experts like George W. Grayson, the author of ''Mexico: Narco-Violence and a Failed State?'' After a Catholic cardinal was assassinated by a drug gang in 1993 (in what may or may not have been a case of mistaken identity), sociologists outlined a ''religious economy'' in which priests administered sacraments in exchange for exorbitant donations.
The Rev. Robert Coogan, 58, a Brooklyn-born Catholic prison chaplain in Saltillo, said that dubious donations had become an engrained feature of the country's religious life. He cited several instances in which Zetas offered him 6 to 10 times as much as the typical small donation for a baptism.
While he said he refused -- and now insists on providing sacraments free -- Father Coogan explained that for some priests, danger and poverty had made it easy to say, ''Hey, the guy who owns the factory, he's a bastard, but we take his money, so why not take the drug money?''
This is especially true, he said, in a country where riches are often produced by corruption and in areas where violence has pushed legitimate donors to flee. ''The church in Mexico is impoverished,'' Father Coogan said.
Some Catholic leaders have openly defended their dubious benefactors. Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who was considered Mexico's most dominant drug trafficker until he died in 1997, was publicly praised by at least one influential priest, who encouraged Mexicans to see the drug baron as a model of Catholic generosity. Mr. Carrillo Fuentes was also photographed traveling to Israel with two priests, including one who said he considered the trip appropriate because of the cartel leader's gifts to an orphanage.
But the recent surge in violence has altered the dynamic. Father Valdemar said that dozens of priests had been quietly transferred to avoid death threats and extortion attempts from drug gangs.
At the same time, cartels have been expanding their own ''alternative religiosity,'' said Alberto Hernandez, a sociologist at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana. La Familia, a cartel that is concentrated in Michoacan State, has become known for its pseudo-Christian messages left on banners over highways. Organized crime groups have also popularized unofficial saints, like Santa Muerte, or St. Death. And increasingly, they have taken on the construction of chapels and shrines.
Church officials say there are about 6,000 independently built chapels nationwide. They note that the benefactors are rarely known, but priests at nearby parishes often perform services in them.
At times, the distance between the church and the cartels is obvious: Mr. Hernandez cited an instance in Sinaloa when, after a senior cartel figure was killed, his associates shot to bits a giant image of St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, apparently because they felt he did not answer their prayers.
The Lazcano chapel, however, is a more complicated case. Despite the plaque, and Mr. Lazcano's roots in the area, the archbishop of the local diocese, Msgr. Domingo Diaz Martinez, insisted that ''whether the chapel was built dishonestly, that we cannot say.''
He noted that the authorities did not appear to have finished their investigation, which federal prosecutors confirmed. More important, he said, ''People in the community have asked for services, and when they ask, we go.''
Many of those who attended on a recent Sunday seemed to agree with both the archbishop and the priest conducting services, the Rev. Margarito Escorcia Reyes, who said after Mass that the chapel's financing and services should be judged separately.
Outside the main door, below a banner of flowers from a recent festival, Elvira Rodriguez Lopez, 59, insisted that ''the mysteries of God are great'' and that all donors should be thanked.
''It's not like the government helps us,'' she said. ''If there's someone willing to support the community, to support us, why question it?''
Even if the money that built the church might have been earned through crime, even killings? ''I'm not interested,'' she said.
Others echoed her view, but their darting eyes and quick answers revealed something different: fear. No one else interviewed outside the church was willing to provide a name. Many claimed that it was their first time visiting the chapel.
Residents of the neighborhood's homes, usually one-story structures with small gardens on the roofs, were even more wary. Conversations behind closed doors yielded a portrait of a community, without severe violence, that nonetheless felt powerless and afraid.
One 33-year-old woman brave enough to say that her name was Natalia said she wished the chapel had never been built because now she worried about who attended services, and who might be milling about. ''I don't go out at night, and when I see new people I'm worried about their associations,'' she said.
What church officials seem to have missed, she said, is that what sounds like support is partly the culture of ''nadie se mete'' -- no one gets involved. Yes, she and others said, the community cooperated with the church at first, because no one knew who was paying. But once that became clearer, said an older woman who would identify herself only as Mrs. Tellez, how could they have resisted?
''Whether we cooperated or not,'' she said, ''they would have built it.''
The Catholic Church, the government or the neighborhood -- were they too weak to stamp out the influence of the Zetas' commander, even by just removing the plaque?
''Exactly,'' Mrs. Tellez said, smiling, seemingly glad someone else said it first. ''Exactly.''

HEADLINE: How State and Local Budget Cuts Affect Children

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman's Feb. 28 column, ''Leaving Children Behind,'' illustrates a major reason why the nation's poorest citizens are children, and why the least poor are elderly: states have too much power to set benefits and eligibility for the federal programs they administer aimed at children and families, programs like Medicaid and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. 
Texas, like many conservative states, especially those with large minority populations, opts for very modest benefits through these programs.
TANF monthly grants for a family of three are $260 per month in Texas, but $675 in New Hampshire.
So what? Why shouldn't the decision on what benefits to provide children be left up to the states? Because when addressing major national social ills, like child poverty, our children should not be viewed as Texas children first, but as American children first.
Benefits for the elderly are not left to the political whims of individual states. They are properly set by Congress, insuring that Medicare and Social Security benefits are identical from Maine to Hawaii. Absent the same federal protections, pity Texas's poor children.
Michael R. Petit President Every Child Matters Education Fund Washington, March 1, 2011
To the Editor:
Of course it's become clear in these first few months of the Texas legislative session that children are being relegated to the harshest budget slashes -- they don't pay taxes and they don't vote.
Sadly, Texas is not unique. It's become a national problem.
Education is one of the best investments a government can make for its future. The University of Texas at Austin, which I attend, returns to the Texas economy $18 for every $1 the government puts in.
The time has come for Texas and the nation to analyze the facts and realize that education cuts are cuts to future growth.
Samantha Katsounas Austin, Tex., Feb. 28, 2011
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman asks how Texas ''can prosper in the long run with a future work force blighted by childhood poverty, poor health and lack of education''?
Simple! Using low taxes as enticements, Texas will continue to do what it's now doing successfully: importing well-educated and healthy workers from states and foreign countries that haven't skimped on expenditures for their children.

HEADLINE: Holding Firm on the Budget

 BODY:
After letting a highly destructive budget fight fester far too long, the White House finally stepped in late last week to negotiate with the House, which wants to eviscerate nondefense spending. Senate leaders still seem shell-shocked by that breathtaking ruthlessness, and have pleaded with the administration for help in pushing back. The White House needs to do so, and firmly. 
Last year the administration acted as referee in a similar situation and got mixed results. It allowed Republicans their cherished goal of keeping taxes low on the richest 2 percent of Americans, and even gave multimillionaires and billionaires new estate tax benefits. President Obama won an extension of jobless benefits and a cut in payroll taxes that could boost the economy.
But this is not a moment for another difference-splitting deal. The House wants to carve $61 billion out of the government for just the next seven months, which would throw hundreds of thousands of people out of work and kill off scores of vital functions. Many of them, like funding for health care reform, environmental regulation and Planned Parenthood, are on the Republicans' ideological hit list. The latest deadline for an agreement is March 18; without one, the government would close.
Republicans claim they will not agree on a penny less than $61 billion, which is too little for some more aggressive freshmen. If the Democrats try to compromise on even half that amount, they will be still be doing enormous damage to many programs and threatening a recovery that is starting to show signs of real life.
Formal talks began on Thursday, led by Vice President Joseph Biden. The White House and the Senate have countered with a more sensible proposal to cut about $6.5 billion from current spending levels, including $2 billion in Pentagon cuts that are not in the House proposal, and other reductions to job training, firefighting and federal building construction.
Though Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, called that ''outrageous,'' Democrats are under no obligation to cut more. As bad as a shutdown would be, heading much further toward the Republicans' number would do far more lasting damage to the economy.
There is nothing wrong with having a serious negotiation over long-term cuts, many of which are reasonable and necessary. It is vitally important, in fact, that the two sides begin examining ways to curb the huge growth in entitlement spending, particularly Medicare. House Speaker John Boehner said last week that he was ready to start that conversation, echoing similar calls from President Obama and many others in Washington.
But serious cuts cannot be made against the threat of a shutdown. That discussion should be had over the 2012 budget, not what's left of the 2011 fiscal year.
Mr. Biden and the Senate should make it clear to the freshman House members who are really driving their chamber's position that they will not permit reckless cuts this year. Then let the freshmen explain to an angry public why they closed the government's doors to score ideological points.

HEADLINE: Bahrain's Promised Handouts Fail to Quell Discontent

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
MANAMA, Bahrain -- The leaders of Bahrain's opposition movement said Sunday that they would not be mollified by offers of money and jobs, raising the prospect of a protracted standoff between protesters and the embattled government of this strategically important Persian Gulf island nation.
''This is about dignity and freedom -- it's not about filling our stomachs,'' said Ebrahim Sharif, a former banker who helped lead a protest on Sunday at the gates of a government building. 
Protesters in Bahrain have held daily demonstrations for the past three weeks, undeterred by a government crackdown that killed seven people. The protests continued on Sunday, with thousands of people gathering in Manama's Pearl Square, the epicenter of the movement.
Bahrain's Interior Ministry announced over the weekend that it was seeking to hire 20,000 people, a measure it said was designed to benefit job seekers and improve security in the country, which is home to a United States naval base.
The oil-rich countries of the gulf, led by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, are also reportedly considering a plan to provide billions of dollars to Bahrain and Oman as part of an effort to address social problems and quell protests.
The recent spike in oil prices has given Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, and its neighbors more scope for handouts and subsidies, part of a longstanding tradition of trading cash for domestic peace.
As protests have spread across the Arab world, the Persian Gulf countries have opened their wallets more than usual.
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia last month announced $37 billion worth of pay raises, unemployment checks and other benefits. The king of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, offered 1,000 dinars, about $2,600, for each family. In January, the government of Kuwait said each citizen would receive the equivalent of $3,500. And last week the sultan of Oman decreed that anyone without a job would be eligible for a monthly stipend of $375.
But in Bahrain and Oman, monetary concessions have yet to assuage protesters.
More than 100,000 people -- about one in five Bahraini citizens -- joined a protest in Manama on Friday where many shouted ''Down, Down Hamad!'' The king's family, which is Sunni, has ruled the Shiite-majority country for more than two centuries.
Smaller protests have also continued in Sohar, a northern industrial city in Oman, which is ruled by Sultan Qaboos bin Said.
''Poor people took the money, but are still insisting on getting political reform,'' said Abdul Jalil Khalil Ebrahim, a senior member of Wefaq, the largest opposition party in Bahrain.
Mr. Ebrahim says future payments in Bahrain by regional governments will be diminished by corruption and may not reach the people who need them. In addition, the cash does not address the central demands of protesters -- for democracy.
''They are throwing slogans to absorb the anger of people,'' Mr. Ebrahim said of the government, which is controlled by Bahrain's royal family. ''But the core of this is political, not financial.''
In response to e-mailed questions, Maysoon Sabkar, a spokeswoman for Bahrain's government, said that support from the gulf countries and the initiative to create jobs at the Interior Ministry were ''not aimed at ending protests in Bahrain, but they do form part of an overall program to make necessary improvements for the benefit of all.''
Ms. Sabkar reiterated that the government's main focus was a proposal for a national dialogue.
The opposition has refused to negotiate until the government, led by the king's uncle, Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, steps down. The prime minister has been in power 40 years.
The opposition says it plans to ratchet up pressure on the government in the coming weeks. The protests have damaged tourism and the financial industry, said Mr. Sharif, the former banker, who now heads a secular opposition party known as Wa'ad.
''We will see every week another activity that will take the momentum higher,'' Mr. Sharif said in an interview on Sunday. ''We are attacking peacefully all the institutions of the state.''

HEADLINE: Patent Woes Threatening Drug Firms

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
At the end of November, Pfizer stands to lose a $10-billion-a-year revenue stream when the patent on its blockbuster cholesterol drug Lipitor expires and cheaper generics begin to cut into the company's huge sales.
The loss poses a daunting challenge for Pfizer, one shared by nearly every major pharmaceutical company. This year alone, because of patent expirations, the drug industry will lose control over more than 10 megamedicines whose combined annual sales have neared $50 billion.
This is a sobering reversal for an industry that just a few years ago was the world's most profitable business sector but is now under pressure to reinvent itself and shed its dependence on blockbuster drugs. And it casts a spotlight on the problems drug companies now face: a drought of big drug breakthroughs and research discoveries; pressure from insurers and the government to hold down prices; regulatory vigilance and government investigations; and thousands of layoffs in research and development.
Morgan Stanley recently downgraded the entire group of multinational pharmaceutical companies based in Europe -- AstraZeneca, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Roche -- in a report titled ''An Avalanche of Risk? Downgrading to Cautious.'' The analysts wrote, ''The operating environment for pharma is worsening rapidly.'' 
The same concerns apply to drug giants in the United States. They are all struggling with research failures as they scramble to replace their cash cows, like Pfizer's multimillion-dollar gamble on a replacement for the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, which failed miserably in clinical trials. Drug companies cut 53,000 jobs last year and 61,000 in 2009, far more than most other sectors, according to the outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
''This is panic time, this is truly panic time for the industry,'' said Kenneth I. Kaitin, director of the Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. ''I don't think there's a company out there that doesn't realize they don't have enough products in the pipeline or the portfolio, don't have enough revenue to sustain their research and development.''
While industrywide research and development spending has nearly doubled to $45 billion a year over the last decade, the Food and Drug Administration has approved fewer and fewer new drugs. Pfizer and Eli Lilly had major setbacks last year in once-promising Alzheimer's drug experiments. Merck discontinued one of two major clinical trials testing its top acquisition from its merger with Schering Plough, a blood thinner that caused dangerous amounts of bleeding in some patients.
Drug company executives have begun addressing the calls for reinvention.
''We have to fix our innovative core,'' Pfizer's new president, Ian C. Read, said in an interview recently. To do that, the company is refocusing on smaller niches in cancer, inflammation, neuroscience and branded generics -- and slashing as much as 30 percent of its own research and development spending in the next two years as its scientists work on only the most potentially profitable prospects.
Consumers should see a financial benefit as lower-cost generics replace the expensive elite drugs, but may suffer in the long term if companies reduce research and do not produce new drugs that meet the public's needs.
''You don't lay off R&D if it's just a cycle,'' says Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan business school who follows the pharmaceutical industry. ''That kills progress.''
The federal government is also concerned about the slowing pace of new drugs coming from the industry. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, recently proposed a billion-dollar drug development center at the agency.
''We seem to have a systemic problem here,'' Dr. Collins said, adding that government research efforts were intended to feed the private sector, not compete with it.
Mr. Read of Pfizer says new products can replace some but not all of the patent losses.
''The hurricane is making landfall,'' said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, an analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, but he added that Pfizer is among several drug companies giving solace to shareholders by returning money through stock buybacks and dividends. Pfizer's best asset, he said, is its $20 billion stockpile of cash. Yet since 2000, Pfizer's and Merck's share prices dropped about 60 percent, while the Dow rose 19 percent.
Several of the drug titans have bought competitors with newer products to fill their own sales gaps, essentially paying cash for future revenue as their own research was flagging. In the last two years, Pfizer paid $68 billion for Wyeth, Merck paid $41 billion for Schering-Plough, Roche paid $46 billion for Genentech, and Sanofi-Aventis paid $20 billion for Genzyme.
Henry G. Grabowski, a professor of economics and director of the Duke University program in pharmaceutical health economics, likened the recent pharmaceutical megamergers to those that occurred in the banking and telecommunications industries when they were hit by financial shocks in the 1990s.
But he warned that this wave would not guarantee significant research developments in the long term.
''It's never been shown that these big horizontal mergers are good for R&D productivity,'' Dr. Grabowski said. ''I'm in a show-me mode that they get you any real advances other than some short-term cost efficiencies that wear out.''
As they move beyond the blockbuster model, companies are refining their approach toward personalized medicines and forming more partnerships. Using genetic or other tests, the plan is to sell new drugs not to millions and millions of people, but to those who would most clearly benefit.
Still, the industry faces intense pressure from generic competition and has tried every tactic to ward it off, including extended-release versions of the same medicine and new pills that combine two ingredients. But 75 percent of all prescriptions in the United States are now low-price, low-profit generic drugs.
At the same time, pharmaceutical companies are being urged by managed care and government health programs to cut prices and improve reimbursement terms for their most profitable pills.
That follows similar practices in Europe, where Germany and the Britain, among other countries, are all increasing pressure for lower drug prices.
''Europe is an ugly place to do business today and will be in five years' time,'' Christopher A. Viehbacher, chief executive of the French drug giant Sanofi-Aventis, said in an interview.
In the United States, Mr. Viehbacher said generic drugs were taking over the primary care market, leaving the best growth potential in specialty markets and in emerging nations like China, Brazil and Indonesia.
Even in those markets, health systems will not be the profit centers that the United States has been. China, emerging this year as the third-largest pharmaceutical market behind the United States and Japan, plans to cut hundreds of drug prices by an average of 40 percent.
The drug industry has long said that Americans fueled the research engine, spending much more per capita on prescriptions than in any other nation, and paying the highest prices for prescribed medicines.
Drug industry lobbyists have beaten back Democratic proposals to set prices at the lower levels of nations like Canada or to allow Medicare to directly negotiate prices. The industry, by supporting President Obama's health care overhaul, capped its contribution at $90 billion over 10 years in return for the promise of up to 32 million newly insured customers starting in 2014.
The new law also contains a major threat to drug industry profits in a little-known section that would allow centralized price-setting. Beginning in 2015, an independent board appointed by the president could lower prices across the board in Medicare unless Congress acted each year to overrule it. Medicare pays more than 20 percent of the nation's retail drug bills.
The industry has also been unsettled by the scores of fraud, bribery and kickback cases involving conduct that federal investigators contend have added billions to the nation's drug bill. The penalties have been stiff, and the settlements steep.
In 2009, Pfizer paid the largest criminal fine in the nation's history as part of a $2.3 billion settlement over marketing drugs for unapproved uses. Some analysts say larger fraud and foreign bribery cases will come. The drug companies are responding with extra-careful sales training and vows to restrain marketing zeal. But the change in corporate culture could cost them: internal documents show some of the companies have profited spectacularly from seeking federal approval of a new drug for a limited use, then marketing it far more widely off label.
Other changes are afoot that will no doubt affect the bottom line. They include growing restrictions on gifts, fees and trips to influence doctors to use their products; curbs on the ghost writing of medical journal articles and a push for more disclosure of negative study results. As the golden age of blockbuster drugs fades, so are some of the marketing excesses of the past two decades -- the tactics that helped bring in immense profits.
Some analysts see the industry's decline as an investment opportunity. They say drug stocks are good buys because of low price-to-earnings ratios, which typically reflect industry decline or investor pessimism, and high dividend yields averaging more than 4 percent a year.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 8, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about the effect of patent expirations on profits at pharmaceutical companies misstated the status of clinical trials involving a blood thinner that was Merck's top acquisition from its merger with Schering Plough. One of two major trials of the drug was stopped -- not all testing -- because some patients experienced dangerous bleeding. (The second trial is continuing, though some patients have been removed from the study.)

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
It is a truth universally acknowledged that education is the key to economic success. Everyone knows that the jobs of the future will require ever higher levels of skill. That's why, in an appearance Friday with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, President Obama declared that ''If we want more good news on the jobs front then we've got to make more investments in education.''
But what everyone knows is wrong. 
The day after the Obama-Bush event, The Times published an article about the growing use of software to perform legal research. Computers, it turns out, can quickly analyze millions of documents, cheaply performing a task that used to require armies of lawyers and paralegals. In this case, then, technological progress is actually reducing the demand for highly educated workers.
And legal research isn't an isolated example. As the article points out, software has also been replacing engineers in such tasks as chip design. More broadly, the idea that modern technology eliminates only menial jobs, that well-educated workers are clear winners, may dominate popular discussion, but it's actually decades out of date.
The fact is that since 1990 or so the U.S. job market has been characterized not by a general rise in the demand for skill, but by ''hollowing out'': both high-wage and low-wage employment have grown rapidly, but medium-wage jobs -- the kinds of jobs we count on to support a strong middle class -- have lagged behind. And the hole in the middle has been getting wider: many of the high-wage occupations that grew rapidly in the 1990s have seen much slower growth recently, even as growth in low-wage employment has accelerated.
Why is this happening? The belief that education is becoming ever more important rests on the plausible-sounding notion that advances in technology increase job opportunities for those who work with information -- loosely speaking, that computers help those who work with their minds, while hurting those who work with their hands.
Some years ago, however, the economists David Autor, Frank Levy and Richard Murnane argued that this was the wrong way to think about it. Computers, they pointed out, excel at routine tasks, ''cognitive and manual tasks that can be accomplished by following explicit rules.'' Therefore, any routine task -- a category that includes many white-collar, nonmanual jobs -- is in the firing line. Conversely, jobs that can't be carried out by following explicit rules -- a category that includes many kinds of manual labor, from truck drivers to janitors -- will tend to grow even in the face of technological progress.
And here's the thing: Most of the manual labor still being done in our economy seems to be of the kind that's hard to automate. Notably, with production workers in manufacturing down to about 6 percent of U.S. employment, there aren't many assembly-line jobs left to lose. Meanwhile, quite a lot of white-collar work currently carried out by well-educated, relatively well-paid workers may soon be computerized. Roombas are cute, but robot janitors are a long way off; computerized legal research and computer-aided medical diagnosis are already here.
And then there's globalization. Once, only manufacturing workers needed to worry about competition from overseas, but the combination of computers and telecommunications has made it possible to provide many services at long range. And research by my Princeton colleagues Alan Blinder and Alan Krueger suggests that high-wage jobs performed by highly educated workers are, if anything, more ''offshorable'' than jobs done by low-paid, less-educated workers. If they're right, growing international trade in services will further hollow out the U.S. job market.
So what does all this say about policy?
Yes, we need to fix American education. In particular, the inequalities Americans face at the starting line -- bright children from poor families are less likely to finish college than much less able children of the affluent -- aren't just an outrage; they represent a huge waste of the nation's human potential.
But there are things education can't do. In particular, the notion that putting more kids through college can restore the middle-class society we used to have is wishful thinking. It's no longer true that having a college degree guarantees that you'll get a good job, and it's becoming less true with each passing decade.
So if we want a society of broadly shared prosperity, education isn't the answer -- we'll have to go about building that society directly. We need to restore the bargaining power that labor has lost over the last 30 years, so that ordinary workers as well as superstars have the power to bargain for good wages. We need to guarantee the essentials, above all health care, to every citizen.
What we can't do is get where we need to go just by giving workers college degrees, which may be no more than tickets to jobs that don't exist or don't pay middle-class wages.

HEADLINE: 'The Event' Returns, but Perhaps Not the Enthusiasm

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Signs of fevered anticipation may not be discernible, but NBC has scheduled an event Monday night -- ''The Event,'' really -- the return of the much-talked-about drama the network introduced in September.
Whether its return from a three-month hiatus truly qualifies as an event for television is questionable, though, as even ardent fans may have forgotten it is still in the middle of its extravagant first-year story line. 
The first 10 episodes introduced a colony of aliens plotting a takeover of Earth, as well as secret prisons, strange experiments with the aging process, interspecies marriage, and lots of murky business involving the president of the United States.
Expectations for its return are not high among some because, after a strong start, ratings for the show were trending down in its final episodes aired in November. The show faced forbidding competition on Mondays at 9 in the fall, which included not only ''Monday Night Football'' on ESPN, but also ''Dancing With the Stars'' (with Bristol Palin) and ''Two and a Half Men'' (with Charlie Sheen).
The producers in charge of ''The Event,'' fully aware of their situation, have formed a plan to restart the show with the loudest, most audacious plot developments they can devise. They have even committed to giving away some of their biggest plot twists (for example, the aliens blow up the Washington Monument) in the promotions for the next batch of episodes.
(This would be a spoiler if NBC weren't giving it away in the promotions, but the biggest plot point is that these aliens have walked the Earth before, in certain highly important historical periods.)
Evan Katz and Steve Stark, the executive producers, said the show would ramp up the dramatic moments and flesh out some of the bigger characters. The president, for example, played by Blair Underwood, will undergo a change. ''You will see he is not particularly an idealist,'' Mr. Katz said in an interview
By the standards of how NBC has fared since, ''The Event'' was still posting passable ratings when it went on hiatus in November, especially when factoring in delayed viewing from digital video recorders.
The series still ranks as having the biggest percentage audience gain from time-shifted viewing of any new series this television season, adding an average of about 38 percent more viewers.
Even its last episode of the fall, which scored what looked to be a dangerously low 1.9 rating among the 18- to 49-year-old viewers that most advertisers prize, actually bounced up to a 2.6 rating with delayed viewing included. That number dwarfed what NBC has done in that time period since.
Still, the odds seem stacked against a revival for ''The Event.'' The recent track record for its genre, the highly serialized, densely plotted sci-fi saga, has been dismal.
NBC had a short-lived hit with ''Heroes,'' but repeated breaks in its story lines sapped interest. CBS tried a series called ''Jericho'' that had a loyal following, but too few came back after it took a break in its first season. The most alarming recent example was ''Flash Forward'' on ABC. The show began with a flourish, then went on hiatus from November until March and fizzled when it came back.
With those examples in mind, the fate of ''The Event'' is being closely watched by some executives who have begun to question whether any highly serialized show, especially one with a complicated sci-fi plot, can break through as a commercial success.
One top network executive, John Landgraf of FX, said he would be extremely reluctant to commit to a heavily serialized show again, after his experience with the show ''Damages.'' That ornately plotted legal drama managed to win Emmy Awards, but was a commercial disappointment for the network.
Mr. Landgraf says viewers, especially younger ones, watch such shows in ways that squeeze the network's economic model. ''They store up episodes on DVR for three or four weeks, then watch them all together,'' Mr. Landgraf said. ''By then there is no measurable data.'' Meaning the ratings for those episodes being played back do not count.
It also doesn't help ''The Event'' that the show is also something of an orphan. All the executives responsible for selecting it are gone from NBC, replaced by a new management that has no personal stake in seeing this show succeed.
Carlton Cuse, one of the executive producers of ''Lost,'' the gold standard (along with ''24'') in this genre, said ''The Event'' was facing a daunting challenge. The show got its start in the fall, accompanied by a mounting promotion and marketing campaign, he said. ''They are coming back without those benefits and with the image of being a struggling show, and with people at the network who weren't there when they were launched,'' he said.
David Nevins, now the president of entertainment for Showtime, who was an executive on ''24'' during its run, said he understood Mr. Landgraf's point about the limitations that new viewing techniques have imposed on serial dramas, but said they still should not be on the endangered list. ''The serialized show can be the most satisfying form of television,'' Mr. Nevins said. ''It creates a sense of urgency to watch, and that can be a weapon against time-shifting.''
''The Event'' will likely have a short window to prove itself, Mr. Cuse said. ''You have to create a scenario that's juicy enough and have an audience that's engaged enough that they're willing to endure that gap in the story. It's a really tall order.''
Mr. Katz said, ''I think we have the goods.'' He even has a promise for loyal viewers if they stick around for the next 12 episodes. ''I can say with confidence that it will be a climax you've never seen before.''

HEADLINE: Optimism, but Five Days And Two Big Issues Remain

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
The N.F.L.'s labor negotiations resume Monday with optimism that Commissioner Roger Goodell and the union leader, DeMaurice Smith, whose stature among wary owners has grown in recent days, are committed to making a deal and avoiding a legal fight that could imperil the regular season.
But the hope that the N.F.L. might avert an all-out labor war is tempered by a dose of reality: the two sides remain so far apart on the economic issues at the core of the negotiation -- how to divide annual revenue and a new rookie compensation system -- that it seems unlikely a deal could be finished by the Friday deadline. 
The hope, say people involved in negotiations, is that enough progress could be made by the end of the week on the key elements necessary to start a new league year -- what the salary cap will be, what the rules of free agency are and what the rookie compensation model will look like -- that the sides could then firm up the rest of the details in another week to 10 days. The league would then resume off-season business as usual, with free agency likely to open just past mid-March.
Negotiators will have to regain momentum they began to make on key issues last Wednesday and Thursday. The momentum was halted, in part, late Thursday afternoon when it was made clear that at least some people on the union side were prepared to go to court to begin the decertification process unless a 24-hour extension was immediately agreed to.
But even the extensions did not come easily, with both players and owners said to be losing patience with the long, tiring process. Goodell had to twist the arms of some of the more hawkish members of the owners' labor committee to convince them to accept one of the extensions, much as Smith has had to manage those in the union who preferred to take the fight to court.
Hanging over this week will be United States District Judge David Doty, whose ruling last Tuesday -- that the N.F.L. violated the terms of the collective bargaining agreement when it negotiated television contracts that would have paid it during a lockout -- strengthened the union's position. Owners were not surprised that Doty ruled against them; they have felt for several years that he is one-sided in his opinions.
But Doty's pointed language in the decision cemented the owners' belief that they had to get out from under the federal court -- it will be part of the negotiations -- while also probably empowering Jeffrey Kessler, the union's outside counsel. Kessler won the decision and has long been perceived as one who might prefer to take his chances in court.
The timing of Doty's decision also raised eyebrows. People on both sides of the talks say his threat to consider damages was a shot across the bow of the N.F.L. to prompt it to negotiate a deal. There is little doubt that owners want to avoid Doty again (they are unable to appeal now because the ruling is only preliminary). Doty's decision unmistakably swung a chunk of leverage to players, but in at least one way it could complicate Smith's task a bit. If he wants to continue negotiating, others in the union might argue the players could gain more from decertifying and going to Doty's court.
On Monday, George Cohen, the federal mediator overseeing the negotiations, who pressed for the extensions, will have the two sides revisit the progress that was made late last week.
The gap on the revenue split and cost credits for owners is still enormous, although perhaps narrower than the $700 million to $800 million that has been widely reported. And the details of rookie compensation limits have yet to be agreed upon. The union had proposed an alternative to a wage scale proposed by the owners that it considered onerous.
The union's alternative would create a cap on money that could be paid to an incoming rookie class, while still allowing individual negotiation of contracts.
Those are the two most critical issues in front of negotiators, although the sides are still hammering out the off-season workout rules and roster increases that would make the 18-game regular season more palatable to players.
On Friday morning, when it was apparent that an extension was in the offing, there was a definite sense of optimism from executives on both sides that a deal could be made and that they had stepped back from the brink of shutting down football. They have five more days, and perhaps a few more, to fulfill those expectations.

HEADLINE: Nintendo Faults Smartphones

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN

 BODY:
The president of Nintendo told video game developers Wednesday that smartphones were driving a trend toward lower quality, and economically unsustainable, video games.
''I fear our business is dividing in a way that that threatens the continued employment of those of us who make games,'' Satoru Iwata, the Nintendo chief, said in a keynote address at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. ''Is maintaining high value games a top priority, or not?''
The emergence of low-cost video games for smartphones has led to a major shift in the way that many people experience video games. And for a company like Nintendo, whose strategy has long relied on converting nongamers with nonthreatening offerings like Tetris and the Wii, the popularity of casual smartphone games like Angry Birds is particularly ominous. 
This threat was underscored just minutes after Mr. Iwata finished speaking, when Steven P. Jobs took the stage at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts just across the street to introduce a new version of the iPad. Among the new features of the iPad was a gyroscope, which game developers have already been using to make games for the iPhone.
While smartphone games have caught on for their ease of use and low price, video game console makers have looked to distinguish themselves by creating devices that do things that phones cannot. Nintendo's biggest response has been the 3DS, a portable 3-D gaming device that does not require glasses. The 3DS, which sold out in Japan within days of its introduction there last week, will be available in the United States on March 27. Mr. Iwata's presentation at the conference focused largely on the new device; he announced that the 3DS will have new versions of two of Nintendo's most popular titles -- Super Mario and the Legend of Zelda -- but that they will not be ready until several months after the game is introduced in the United States.
In his address, Mr. Iwata said that video games for smartphones were generally of lower quality, and that their low costs would rarely pay for the development of quality games. He also argued that a company like Nintendo, which makes both hardware and software for gaming, would always be a better ally for developers than phone manufacturers.
''When I look at retailers and I see the $1 and free software, I have to determine that the owner doesn't care about the high value of software at all,'' Mr. Iwata said.
Still, the rapidly increasing smartphone market is proving irresistible to game developers, industry analysts said. And the ubiquity of the devices is undermining the economic argument to designing more expensive games for smaller audiences.
''There's no doubt, in my mind at least, that these smartphones are legitimate game platforms and legitimate competitors,'' said Colin Sebastian, an analyst with Lazard Capital Markets. ''That argument gets harder for Nintendo to make every year.''
Meanwhile, Nintendo is moving beyond gaming with the 3DS, much as it has done with the Wii. Nintendo announced Wednesday that the 3DS would be able to stream content from Netflix. Users will also be able to pause a movie on the 3DS and restart it at the same point on a Wii, or vice versa. Nintendo is also working with movie studios to show 3-D versions of trailers on the devices. ''Green Lantern,'' which will premier in June, will be the first such trailer available.
Nintendo is also working to create a 3-D channel that will offer exclusive short form videos on the device. Mr. Iwata declined to provide specific information about the content, but said that channel would be live by midyear. The company is also working to create a version of the 3DS that will capture 3D video.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Loss of Speech Evokes the Voice of a Writer

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LARCHMONT, N.Y.
Even for the remaining hyperactive strivers who came out the winners in Darwin's economy, it's becoming a fleeting goal: Quit the job, slow down the engine, follow your passion.
So you can see what happened to Neil Selinger as a perverse Coen Brothers riff on the vanishing midlife dream -- the rare winner who still, unfathomably, loses it all. Three years ago, he quit his job as a lawyer to write and do volunteer work. Now, two years after a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, he has deteriorated with heartbreaking speed from cane to walker to wheelchair, to pureed food, an inability to speak and almost total immobility.
You could find many confounding twists in Mr. Selinger's journey, in its horror, but also in its grace -- particularly the way friends, neighbors and fellow writers have supported him in ways that have rearranged his view of the world. So as he contemplates his unexpected detour off the main road and a book party in his honor on Sunday, what he sees is not what you might expect. 
''As my muscles weakened, my writing became stronger,'' he wrote recently in an unpublished essay. ''As I slowly lost my speech, I gained my voice. As I diminished, I grew. As I lost so much, I finally started to find myself.''
Mr. Selinger grew up the quiet, bookish one in a 22-room compound in Matawan, N.J.: Sholom Aleichem meets J. D. Salinger. It served both as the headquarters of Sloan Products, the family's wholesale paper and toy business, and as a Ponderosa-like home for four generations of bickering, feuding relatives, 13 people in all. With its mismatched decor, stone pillars, imitation Chinese lanterns, white clapboard and lime-green stucco foundation, it looked, he wrote, ''like some sort of architecture experiment gone horribly wrong.''
Mr. Selinger retreated from the din by reading -- first Chip Hilton and the Hardy Boys; then the World Book Encyclopedia, then Updike, Roth, Shakespeare and Hemingway. He went to Columbia University planning to study literature, but practicality won out and he went to law school. For 31 years, he had a successful career practicing securities law, suing corporations on behalf of shareholders.
He was, friends say, not just the driven lawyer who argued cases and examined witnesses in 75 cities, 34 states and 4 Canadian provinces. At home with his wife, Rima Grad, and his three daughters, now 17, 20 and 30, he cooked, coached, and made an art of scouring the Internet to plan family vacations.
In 2007, at age 54, he was able to pack it in. He tutored at the high school. He volunteered at a food pantry and for Habitat for Humanity. And most important, he signed up for a class at the Writing Institute at Sarah Lawrence College, where he found not just his writing voice, but also a community of aspiring writers who met every other week for mutual support and feedback.
His new life did not last long. When he played basketball, he found himself stumbling and tripping for no reason. There was involuntary twitching in his arms and legs. In April 2009 came the diagnosis. Before long, the blur of ambition and energy of the man who ran a marathon and went to almost 200 Springsteen concerts began to wind down like a gizmo with a battery gone dry.
It was awful, of course, and, oddly, it wasn't. The writing group eventually moved to his house. Friends and neighbors formed a group called FANS, Friends Around Neil Selinger, who cooked, drove, walked the dog, did what was needed. The quiet boy obsessed with writing became a quiet man who wrote; the busy house full of feuds and chaos was replaced decades later by the busy house full of friends, family and neighbors who just wanted to help. He found himself awed by the decency and generosity he experienced. He thinks often of a Springsteen song with the lyrics: ''And should I fall behind, wait for me.'' He is amazed that so many people have.
His writing teacher, Steve Lewis, said Mr. Selinger always had talent, he just had to lose that lawyer's voice. But, Mr. Lewis said, as his disability has worsened, Mr. Selinger's writing has sharpened and his sense of self deepened. ''He's got sort of a Zen countenance now,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''And it's reflected in what he writes. He doesn't duck anger and despair, he doesn't duck anything, but it's all there without self-pity. His writing is richer because his experience of the moment is richer.''
On Sunday, that moment will revolve around the result of Mr. Selinger's work, a memoir, ''A Sloan Product: A Memoir of a Lost Boy,'' begun when he was healthy and finished in September when he could still type with one finger. There will be a reading and book party at the Larchmont Temple. Mr. Lewis and the five members of his writing group will read what Mr. Selinger cannot.
Meanwhile, Zen countenance intact, face weirdly aglow, Mr. Selinger continues to write. He composes pieces in his head and is learning to type them on a computer that responds to his gaze on the letters that appear on the screen. He stares and the words appear, first on the monitor and then aloud in the computer's affectless voice. ''In some ways, I am much happier,'' he writes. ''I appreciate simpler pleasures.''

HEADLINE: Obama Considers Tapping Oil Reserve

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is considering tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to rapidly rising gasoline prices brought on by turmoil in the Middle East, the White House chief of staff, William M. Daley, said on Sunday. 
''It's something that only has been done on very rare occasions,'' Mr. Daley said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, adding, ''It's something we're considering.''
Administration officials have sent mixed signals about the possibility of opening the reserve, which would add supply to the domestic oil market and tend to push down prices.
Energy Secretary Steven Chu said on Friday that the administration was monitoring prices, but he has been reluctant to endorse more aggressive steps.
''We don't want to be totally reactive so that when the price goes up, everybody panics, and when it goes back down, everybody goes back to sleep,'' he said.
A few days earlier, Mr. Chu said the administration was watching the situation closely, but it expected oil production that had been lost in Libya would be made up by production elsewhere.
Administration officials continue to emphasize the critical need for long-term steps to reduce oil use, like improving the fuel economy of cars and promoting battery-powered vehicles.
But recently, five Senate Democrats have called for opening the reserve, which is stored in four salt domes in Texas and Louisiana. And on Feb. 24, three House Democrats from New England, where oil is used to heat homes, wrote to Mr. Obama saying that while exporters could increase production, ''they also profit from oil price spikes and therefore have little incentive to quickly respond with the increased supply needed to calm markets.''
In recent days, prices for the American benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, have exceeded $100 a barrel. Oil for April delivery settled at $104.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday.
The average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline was $3.50 on Sunday, AAA reported, up from $3.12 a month earlier. Gasoline prices routinely rise as the weather turns warmer and people drive more, leading some experts to predict gasoline at $4 a gallon this summer.
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established in response to the Arab oil embargo of 1973-4. It was tapped most recently in September 2008 in response to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. At that time, the Energy Department arranged ''exchanges'' with oil companies whose normal supplies had been interrupted; the oil companies later made restitution in oil. The last time the government sold oil from the reserve to address supply interruptions was in 2005, after Hurricane Katrina.
Sales were also made in January 1991 to calm global markets as the United States invaded Kuwait, which had been occupied the previous year by Iraq.
The government suspended oil purchases when prices were approaching a peak in 2008, before the recession began. In that case, members of Congress argued that acquisitions for the reserve were contributing to higher prices, harming consumers.

HEADLINE: The Happiest Man in America, Annotated

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: How different demographic characteristics correlate with higher levels of well-being. 

 BODY:
Sunday's Week in Review featured a package on a subject that is much beloved by Economix: happiness.
Gallup has been compiling the 2010 results of its dailyGallup-Healthways Well-Being survey, which asked 1,000 randomly selected Americans daily about their quality of life: whether they're smiling, exercising, eating their vegetables, enjoying their jobs, feeling safe walking home alone at night and so on.
The results are put into an index that tries to measure the elements of "the good life," and is an alternative to other more traditional (and more limited) measures of a country's development, like unemployment or gross domestic product. After all, the ultimate goal of public policy is to give people better lives, not just to produce more stuff, which is why economists are increasingly turning to measures like Gallup's.
Gallup also asks its survey respondents other questions about their demographics, like age, gender and religion. Using the data, we asked Gallup to come up with a statistical composite of the happiest person in America, based on what demographic characteristics are most closely correlated with higher levels of well-being. Gallup said that the happiest person would be: male, Asian-American, a religious Jew, self-employed, living in Hawaii, married, has children, receiving a household income of at least $120,000.
Given this, I figured I'd write a profile of a fictional person, whom I nicknamed Moishe Chang (or sometimes Deng Xiao Shapiro). But then, lo and behold, it turned out that a real person fulfilling all these requirements actually exists! His name is Alvin Wong, and he lives in Honolulu. He says he is indeed a very happy person.
Here's a breakdown of how each of Mr. Wong's attributes contributes to happiness, with links to some of our previous coverage on these correlations. But remember, as always, correlationis not necessarily causation.
RELIGION: On average, Jews have higher levels of well-being than their counterparts of every other major faith in America. Muslims have the lowest levels of well-being. In between, from happiest to least happy, are Mormons, atheists/agnostics, Roman Catholics, "other non-Christians" and then Protestants. For people of most religions, greater levels of religiosity (like frequent church or synagogue attendance) are associated with higher levels of happiness.
GENDER: Men, on average, report slightly higher levels of well-being, a score of 67 on a scale of 0 to 100, compared to women's average score of 66.6. This modest gap is mostly because women score much lower on the physical health index, as measured by the presence of illnesses and various other physical ailments like neck pain and low energy.
RACE: Asians have by far the highest levels of well-being, followed by whites, Hispanics, blacks and then everybody who doesn't fit into those defined categories. Asians beat out their non-Asian counterparts on five out of the six well-being sub-indexes: life evaluation, emotional health, physical health, healthy behaviors and basic access to things like food and shelter. The one category where whites beat them, but just barely, is work environment.
MARITAL STATUS: Married people have far and away the highest happiness levels. The biggest differential between married people and non-married people is in the work environment index. Across the entire index, married people are followed in happiness by singletons; people with domestic partners and people who have been widowed (these two categories have equal levels of well-being); those who are divorced; and finally, people who are married but separated.
CHILDREN: People who have children are slightly happier than people who don't.
AGE: Seniors - those age 65 and older - rank as the happiest, followed by Americans under 30. The people in the middle -the ones with mortgages, teenagers, car loans and midlife crises - are perhaps understandably the ones who are more miserable.
INCOME: Income tracks very neatly with well-being. People earning under $12,000 annually lead the least happy lives, and the more money they make, generally speaking, the better off they are emotionally and physically. This probably makes sense when you consider what goes into the index, things like good health and access to basic needs like food and shelter. You can't afford to lead "the good life" if you can't afford much at all.
GEOGRAPHY: In 2010 Hawaii topped the well-being list, and West Virginia was at the bottom. If you want to zoom in further, you can see well-being rates by Congressional district. California's 14th district, one of the highest-income districts in the country that also happens to include most of Silicon Valley, ranks at the top. Michigan's 13th district, an area of high unemployment that covers parts of Detroit and the wealthier Gross Pointe suburbs, is at the very bottom of the barrel.
EMPLOYMENT: Americans who own their own businesses were the happiest on average in 2010, followed by professionals. The least happy are transportation and manufacturing workers.
HEIGHT: Randy Newman was right: Taller people are generally happier.

HEADLINE: A Film About Capitalism, and (Surprise) It's a Love Story

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- At the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., next weekend, moviegoers can see what might be the rarest bird in the documentary world: a genuine love story about capitalism.
The film, ''Something Ventured,'' is a frankly admiring look at those who went out on a limb to back upstarts like Atari, Cisco Systems, Genentech and Apple.
How the documentary fares may help tell whether a society that has been leery of big business since the financial collapse of 2008 is ready to soar with the entrepreneurs once again. 
''This film is one of the green shoots after a long winter,'' said Paul Holland, an executive producer of ''Something Ventured.'' Mr. Holland, who is a partner at the venture firm Foundation Capital, spent years developing the film with fellow producers and the directors Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine, who made the dance documentary ''Ballets Russes.''
The idea, said Mr. Holland, was to create what Mr. Geller termed '' 'Reds' for capitalism.''
''Reds,'' a paean to old Bolsheviks, was directed by Warren Beatty and received 12 Oscar nominations in 1982.
The stories in ''Something Ventured'' are told by and about a clutch of investors and innovators whose encounters in the 1960s, '70s and '80s made Silicon Valley and its environs a hotbed of technological change, business growth and job and wealth creation.
It can be tart. The music includes four versions of the song ''Money (That's What I Want),'' including a sassy, era-appropriate 1979 cover by the Flying Lizards.
But the film's beating heart is captured by Tom Perkins, whose Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers company backed the gene-splicing technology of Genentech, among other things. ''It's great if you can make money and change the world for the better at the same time,'' said Mr. Perkins, who appears at one point in a lavender shirt, black T-shirt and silvery striped jacket that look suitable for attending discos that no longer exist.
Other stars of ''Something Ventured'' include Nolan Bushnell of Atari; Sandy Lerner of Cisco; Jimmy Treybig of Tandem Computers; and a string of venture capitalists, among them Don Valentine, Dick Kramlich, and Arthur Rock.
Many who appear joined dozens of other business people to finance the picture's roughly $700,000 cost with contributions of a few thousand dollars each, Mr. Holland said.
In becoming involved, several participants said they wanted to rekindle an entrepreneurial spirit that had either waned or changed since the rough-and-tumble years when, by the film's telling, Atari was started with $250 but needed capital to push Pong, and Mr. Bushnell passed up a chance to own a third of Apple, started by his employee Steve Jobs, for $50,000.
''The target audience I hope for is every high school senior, kids about to choose a college,'' said Mr. Valentine, who still works through Sequoia Capital (which did back Apple).
Mr. Valentine, who spoke on Sunday, said entrepreneurship had not ended -- his company was a force behind Google -- but it is less often coming from those born in the United States.
''You don't understand what you have here'' is a constant refrain, he said, from Southeast Asian and Indian innovators who are sometimes mystified by an American disdain for its own business culture.
Mr. Kramlich, also speaking on Sunday, speculated that overreaching during the dot-com boom tarnished the venture business in the eyes of many.
''We're just getting back to that old-time religion,'' he said, pointing toward social networking as an example of innovation still being born.
Interviewing potential filmmakers for his project was initially awkward, said Mr. Holland, given the disdain for big business that has been a mainstay of documentaries like ''Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,'' from Alex Gibney; ''The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,'' from Morgan Spurlock; ''Inside Job,'' from Charles Ferguson; and ''Capitalism: A Love Story,'' from Michael Moore.
''Here I am, dealing with fairly typical filmmakers, with very liberal sensibilities,'' Mr. Holland, who shares executive producing credits with Molly Davis, said of his conversations.
Ms. Goldfine and Mr. Geller, who are married, were concerned that movers and shakers like Mr. Rock and Mr. Valentine, linchpins of the film, might be too wrapped up in wealth and business to be watchable. ''Would they be vulnerable? Would they open up?'' Mr. Geller said he wondered.
In fact, most did. A turning point in the documentary involves Ms. Lerner's emotional recounting of her firing from Cisco, a company she co-founded.
On camera, Mr. Valentine, one of those who fired her, said he did not believe he had ever been forgiven. On Sunday, he said he had struggled to keep Ms. Lerner in the company, but was cornered by an employees' rebellion. ''She was too tough a grader,'' he said.
Such will be the tensions on display in Texas, and later, in commercial theaters, when Zeitgeist Films releases ''Something Ventured.'' No release date is set.
Mr. Holland, raised in Virginia, became fascinated with the venture crowd when he was introduced to many of them in the early 1980s by his wife, Linda Yates, who was acquainted with the old-school investors through her family. He later became a board member of the Western Association of Venture Capitalists, a connection that helped the film.
With luck, he said, the film's interlocking tales of ambition, wealth, and occasional heartbreak, will capture imaginations -- or at least get the movie world to acknowledge that business does have a better side.
''If you want to be picky, yes, there are a bunch of rich old guys in this film,'' Mr. Holland said.
But ''these are very pointed stories about American companies that actually build things.''

HEADLINE: Mog, the Digital Music Service, Takes Aim at the TV and the Car

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
The next frontier for digital music is not a tablet or a smartphone, but two items that have been part of everyday life for decades: the car and the television set.
For years, digital music has been confined mostly to traditional computers and phones. But that limitation is slowly disappearing as the market shifts toward cloud services, which stream content from remote servers, allowing anything with an Internet connection -- like smart TVs or Blu-ray players -- to become portals for vast libraries of entertainment.
One music streaming service, Mog, is counting on this change to draw new subscribers and help it stand out in a crowded field. On Tuesday, the company will announce a string of deals that could introduce it to millions of potential new customers. LG, Samsung and Vizio will incorporate Mog into their Internet-ready televisions and other devices, and the service will become available on Sonos, a wireless system for managing music throughout the house. 
And in what the company calls the first integration of an on-demand music service into a car, Mog will also become part of BMW's Mini line. (On-demand streaming, unlike radio, lets you pick the songs you listen to.) More such deals are on the way, said David Hyman, Mog's founder.
''When you are thinking about buying into a cloud-based music service,'' Mr. Hyman said, ''I imagine you asking yourself, 'Can I use this on my phone? Can I use it in my car? Will it work in my new TV?' The value of these services goes up the more places consumers can access you.''
Mog, based in Berkeley, Calif., was founded in 2005 as a social networking site. It changed in late 2009 into a subscription streaming service, offering 10 million songs at rates of $5 a month for music on PCs alone, or $10 for additional access through mobile devices. On new TVs and home theater systems, Mog will be a preinstalled feature, and in the Mini it can be activated by plugging in a smartphone. (Mog users paying $5 will get access through their TVs, but the $10 subscription is needed for Sonos and the Mini.)
Unlike MP3s, which a customer buys once and then possesses, music accessed through the cloud needs constant contact with the service that provides it, which means the service must be available everywhere its customers spend their time. And if you're looking for ubiquity, the first places to go are the living room and the car -- both of which, analysts say, represent huge untapped markets for digital music.
''I don't think anybody in the music industry quite grasps how much of an important opportunity lies in the living room,'' said Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''And the window for that opportunity is closing ever more as every year goes by.''
In many homes, the Internet-ready television, preloaded with streaming services like Netflix and Pandora, is fast becoming a multipurpose entertainment hub. Sony has recently introduced its Qriocity service, which offers streaming music and movie subscriptions through Sony's connected devices like televisions and PlayStations.
''Home theaters and Blu-ray get a lot of attention when it comes to playing movies or TV shows, but music is a critical feature for those devices too,'' said Matthew Durgin, the head of smart TV for LG Electronics in the United States. ''In a lot of cases we put the highest-quality speakers in the living room.''
For subscription music services, the competition is intense and the rewards so far have been small. In addition to Mog, the field includes Rhapsody, Rdio and the remade Napster. Spotify, a European service, is expected to enter the American market this year. But relatively few customers have been willing to pay for streaming music. Rhapsody, online since 2001, has 750,000 users; Mog does not report its subscription numbers, but analysts estimate that they are much lower.
Apple and Google are also working on cloud-based music services, but they have been mum about their exact plans.
Mr. Hyman says he believes that the car, where people do a majority of their listening, could be digital music's biggest opportunity by far, capable of attracting millions of new subscribers. Pandora, the Internet radio service, is already in many cars, including the Mini, and 20 million subscribers pay for satellite radio from Sirius XM. But so far on-demand music has been unavailable.
''The car is the holy grail,'' said Mr. Hyman. ''I look at the satellite-radio market in America, with 20 million subscribers, and I don't see why we shouldn't be 20 million subscribers.''
Mog's controls on the Mini are integrated into the dashboard's digital display, and activated by hooking up a smartphone through the car's Mini Connected system. The program connects to the Internet through the phone, but otherwise it is handled entirely through the standard dashboard controls. Only recently have car manufacturers been able to incorporate such new features, said Rob Passaro, a senior project manager at the BMW Group.
''We interact with lots of cool technology companies, and the conversations we've always had over the years is: 'Hey, awesome service, we want to get it into the car. When can it happen?' 'Oh, in about five years,' '' Mr. Passaro said. ''Now we can move as quickly as the consumer tech industry on these things.''
To attract listeners who enjoy the sense of serendipity they get with Pandora, which creates custom music streams based on users' tastes, Mog has developed a feature that combines on-demand and radiolike service; when a digital slider is moved to one side, a stream of one artist's music will gradually filter in similar music.
''We want to be in all these places where consumers listen to music,'' Mr. Hyman said.

HEADLINE: INDIA: Despite Growth, Struggle Continues With Malnutrition Among Children

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
There's no evidence that India's growing prosperity has led to less malnutrition among Indian children, according to a new study by scientists from Harvard and the University of Michigan. 
One plausible explanation, the authors wrote, is that India's rapid economic growth ''may have benefited only the privileged sections of society.''
Technology jobs have driven the boom, but 75 percent of the population is supported by farming or manufacturing, noted S. V. Subramanian, a geographer at the Harvard School of Public Health and an author of the study. To save the children of those families, India's government may have to use its growing tax revenues for direct aid like food or food stamps, he said.
The study, published Tuesday in PLoS Medicine, looked at 77,326 children tracked in three national family health surveys conducted in 1992-93, 1998-99 and 2005-6. Among the data gathered in these huge household surveys were the heights, weights and ages of children.
The study broke down malnutrition by region. It was worst in the poorest and most crowded states like Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. It was less common in the remote mountainous northeastern states like Mizoram and Manipur, and also in Kerala, where the state government spends more on education and health. But there was little correlation between a state's economic growth and how much food most children got.
Other studies have shown that educating women and reducing birth rates do more to keep children fed than macroeconomic growth, the authors said.

HEADLINE: Florida Republicans at Odds With Their New Executive

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and GARY FINEOUT; Lizette Alvarez reported from Miami, and Gary Fineout from Tallahassee, Fla.

 BODY:
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Rick Scott, the conservative Republican billionaire who plucked the governor's job from the party establishment in November with $73 million of his own money and the backing of the Tea Party, vowed during his campaign to run the troubled state like a corporate chief executive (which he was) and not a politician (which he proudly says he is not).
And now it has become a problem, some of his fellow Republicans say.
''The governor doesn't understand there is a State Constitution and that we have three branches of government,'' said State Senator Mike Fasano, a Republican from New Port Richey who upset Mr. Scott with rough handling of his staff during a testy committee hearing. ''They are talking about the attitude that he is still the C.E.O. of his former health care corporation, and that is not going to work in this state, in Tallahassee, in my district. The people believe in three branches of government.'' 
Republican lawmakers in Florida were hoping for a smoother transition. Instead, they say, they got top-down management from a political novice.
With the Legislature convening on Tuesday for a potentially arduous two-month session that is bound to usher in major cuts in spending and jobs and radical changes to education, pensions, unemployment benefits and Medicaid, the governor will be tested on a broader, more public scale. Florida faces an estimated $3.6 billion budget shortfall this year and has a stubborn 12 percent unemployment rate.
''I think there have been some understandable growing pains because government doesn't function like a corporation,'' said Speaker Dean Cannon, a Republican from central Florida, taking a more measured tone than Mr. Fasano.
''I like Governor Scott a lot as a person and a leader,'' Mr. Cannon said. ''I think he's going through the understandable adjustment of the transition from campaigning to governance.''
In his first two months in office, the governor has irritated the State Senate's powerful Budget Committee chairman by selling two state jets without legislative permission, a constitutional no-no. The governor wanted the sale done quickly (he uses his own plane), and he succeeded.
He annoyed the ambitious Senate president, as well as a host of leaders in conservative states, by trying to kill off a database to track the fraudulent distribution of addictive prescription drugs before it was up and running. He did so without consulting lawmakers, calling the monitoring system an invasion of privacy.
Most recently, Mr. Scott rejected $2.4 billion in federal stimulus money to build a high-speed rail line from Tampa to Orlando, which he saw as too big a financial drain on state taxpayers in the long term.
His refusal to take the money prompted new bouts of discord; a staunch conservative Republican from central Florida joined forces with a Democrat in filing a lawsuit last month, and 26 lawmakers signed a letter to the federal transportation secretary urging him to basically ignore the governor and send the money anyway. (The State Supreme Court ruled in Mr. Scott's favor on Friday.)
As State Senator Arthenia L. Joyner, a lawyer and the Democrat who took Mr. Scott to court, put it at a news conference about the suit: ''It's necessary at this time, I think -- because our governor's new -- to let him know this is not a monarchy. He's not a king. This is a democracy.''
Mr. Scott's go-it-alone style of governing was on display vividly last month when he chose to unveil his two-year budget 200 miles from Tallahassee, in the rural town of Eustis, at a rally jammed with Tea Party supporters. Mr. Scott, who wants to promote business in the state and drastically reduce the government's reach, proposes slashing $4.1 billion in spending and cutting property and corporate income taxes.
''Let's start with the obvious: we can't spend more than we take in,'' Mr. Scott told the cheering crowd. ''We take in enough from hardworking Floridians. We don't need to take any more.
''Critics have said you can't cut taxes now,'' he continued. ''They are wrong. We will cut taxes now, and they should cut taxes now. Things will not improve until we grow private sector jobs, not government jobs.''
Lawmakers, though, are decidedly less optimistic about Mr. Scott's budget plan, and even less enthusiastic about his uncongenial approach to Tallahassee. From the start, the relationship between powerful state Republicans and Mr. Scott was strained.
Republican leaders supported Mr. Scott's primary opponent, Bill McCollum, and poured money into negative advertising that portrayed Mr. Scott as untrustworthy and fraudulent. Mr. Scott resigned in 1997 as the head of Columbia/HCA, the nation's largest hospital chain, amid an F.B.I. investigation. That inquiry eventually led to $1.7 billion in criminal and civil penalties for Medicare fraud.
Even some of Mr. Scott's closest allies acknowledge that he will need to downshift. After all, the real power in Florida rests with the Legislature, which now has Republican supermajorities in both chambers that can override the governor's veto.
''He has created some sore spots that will have to heal,'' said State Representative Jimmy Patronis, a Republican from Panama City and one of Mr. Scott's earliest supporters. ''You want to come in and clean house,'' he said. ''But there is a learning curve.''
Mr. Scott is single-minded in his plans to shake up Florida and create jobs. He wants to create a business-friendly environment, chop up the bureaucracy, peel away regulations and hand out $1.7 billion in tax cuts for corporations and property owners in the first year of his budget. Privatizing Medicaid and prisons is also high on the agenda.
In his budget proposal, Mr. Scott is seeking to eliminate more than 8,500 state jobs, including in the Corrections and Health Departments. His budget for the state's already lean public schools is $1.75 billion less than this year's, mostly because federal stimulus money dried up.
And he wants to cut costs in Florida's pension fund by requiring more than 600,000 government workers, including police officers, teachers, firefighters, judges and retirees, to contribute 5 percent to their retirement. New employees would use plans similar to a 401(k). This has angered state workers, who have gone without a general raise since 2006. They plan large demonstrations around Florida on Tuesday.
Politically, all of this will be difficult. State lawmakers, whose sole job is to pass a budget, have mostly shrugged off Mr. Scott's proposal. The governor's plan to slash corporate taxes, a goal his fellow Republicans share, is unlikely to get much traction this year as the state wrestles with layoffs and spending cuts.
The same goes for asking state workers to contribute 5 percent to their retirement plans. Florida has not required workers to contribute to the plan since 1975. Employees are bound to be forced to contribute something, Republican lawmakers say, but 5 percent is probably a bit steep.
''I'm not mad at them; I support them,'' State Senator J. D. Alexander, the Budget Committee chairman, said about state workers. ''Changing pay and benefits is not something I go to first.''
Cutting education financing by 10 percent also appears unpalatable. ''I would tell you the majority of the Senate has serious concerns and would not want to have to go there,'' Mr. Alexander said recently.
But there is still plenty Republicans will agree on, perhaps as early as this week. Teachers are likely to see their pay tied to student performance and their tenure rights weakened. A large number of Medicaid recipients may be shuffled into managed care. And unemployment benefits are expected to be reduced.
''This is going to test the mettle of every member of the House and Senate, Republican and Democrat alike, and new governor,'' Mike Haridopolos, the president of the State Senate, said Monday. ''This is a challenging time.''

HEADLINE: Digging Up Energy Savings Right in Your Backyard

BYLINE: By LORRAINE KREAHLING

 BODY:
Five years ago, my husband and I walked out of what was left of our historic house after a propane explosion. As the house caught fire, the cat jumped out to safety, too. When we rebuilt, we wanted to avoid burning fossil fuels in our new home, and I remembered reading an article about an architect who drilled geothermal wells to heat and cool his Lower Manhattan town house.
Many people think geothermal energy means tapping the power of geyserlike hot springs from miles underground to turn turbines and generate electricity. They may also associate it with minor earthquakes like those that halted major geothermal deep-drilling projects in northern California and in Switzerland late in 2009.
There is, however, another way to make use of geothermal energy on a much smaller scale. Ground-source heat-pump geothermal systems take advantage of the earth's constant temperature below the frost line to heat and cool buildings. 
That line varies according to latitude, but ranges in the United States from about three to six feet. Below that depth the temperature stays around 50 degrees Fahrenheit, give or take a few degrees. That is why a subterranean cave feels warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Wells for this geothermal energy usually go down in the hundreds rather than thousands of feet.
The technology is hardly new. The first successful commercial installation of ground-source heat pumps for climate control was in 1946 in an office tower in Portland, Ore. And the technology is best known in the Midwest and the South where the Department of Energy reports two-thirds of the nation's geothermal systems are located.
The trend is steadily upward, according to Steven Chalk, chief operating officer of the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The 115,442 heat pumps that shipped from manufacturers in 2009, the latest year for which statistics are available, Mr. Chalk said, ''was triple the number from a decade earlier.'' He said that 3.5 percent of homes built that year installed geothermal heat pumps.
Heat pumps are based on the same principles as a household refrigerator. The heat pump in a refrigerator transfers heat from food placed inside it to the room outside the refrigerator.
The warmth you feel at the back or base of the appliance is that transferred heat. Geothermal heat pumps extract heat from water brought in from underground, and are more efficient than air-source heat pumps.
There are two methods of getting access to groundwater, and the drilling or excavation required is one reason the systems are expensive. In open-loop geothermal systems, heat pumps extract energy or heat directly from groundwater piped in from wells.
Closed-loop systems are designed to circulate water mixed with nontoxic antifreeze through high-density polyethylene pipes. The tubing can go down in vertical wells or -- when there is enough land -- the plastic pipes can be laid out horizontally in trenches below the frost line. (Schools sometimes use their football fields for these underground Slinky-like coils.)
One reason the technology has a low profile, industry professionals suggest -- only half-joking -- is it is underground.
''You see solar panels up on a roof and wind turbines on the horizon,'' said Jack DiEnna, executive director of the Geothermal National and International Initiative, a nonprofit trade organization. ''But if your neighbors missed the day the drillers were in your backyard putting in wells, they don't know about your green heating system.''
How green is ground-source heat-pump technology? The only nonrenewable energy used is electricity. The monthly electric will bill go up, of course, but the system can eliminate a winter fuel bill, as it has ours. Summer utility bills for air-conditioning can be reduced by half or as much as two-thirds.
''Cost savings are specific to the area of the country, and depend on whether you are competing with natural gas or propane or electric resistance,'' said Gordon Bloomquist, a retired senior scientist at Washington State University, who has studied, designed and done troubleshooting on hundreds of geothermal projects. ''If electricity costs 10 cents a kilowatt, a heat pump will cost you 2.5 cents for the same amount of electric heat,'' he said.
Mr. Bloomquist echoed other experts when he said the growth of the geothermal market was hampered by the lack of proficient engineers and installers, which in turn contributed to the high cost of the systems. ''We don't have the an infrastructure with experience in a lot of places, so there is the risk of problems,'' he said, ''and this helps elevate price.''
Five years ago, my husband and I could find no one on the North Fork of Long Island who had successfully designed and installed a closed-loop system. (This would not be the case today.) We assembled a far-flung team: a designer in Canandaigua, N.Y.; a geologist from Bohemia, N.Y.; a driller from Hampton Bays, N.Y.; and a local HVAC installer who had done a few open-loop systems. I can report that troubleshooting a system with a designer several hundred miles away is not to be recommended.
The federal government is aware of the expertise deficit. The Energy Department dedicated $1,077,500 of Recovery Act funds to create national certification standards for architects, engineers, HVAC specialists, drillers, and other trades involved in geothermal installation, according to John Kelly, chief executive of the Geothermal Exchange Organization, a nonprofit trade organization that will coordinate this effort with the International Ground Source Heat Pump Association at Oklahoma State University.
And $61.9 million of Recovery Act money has been directed to cost-sharing geothermal projects in schools, hospitals, government and commercial buildings in an effort ''to show the economic feasibility of ground-source heat pumps,'' Mr. Chalk said.
The federal government has also begun to address the other major hurdle faced by consumers who want a geothermal system: the upfront cost. The price tag on the geothermal systems is sometimes twice that of a conventional heating and air-conditioning system. Again, drilling geothermal wells is expensive.
Legislation passed by Congress in 2009 offers homeowners a tax credit of 30 percent of the cost of any geothermal system that is installed by Dec. 31, 2016. Commercial projects may deduct 10 percent.
Many states, including New York State, offer tax incentives as well. And because these systems decrease the burden on the grid in times of peak demand, many utility companies offer rebates.
Four years ago, the three wells required for our three-ton system for our 2,100-square-foot home cost $9,200. The 160-foot ''wells'' are actually six-inch-wide boreholes. Besides the drilling, the price included sinking the pipe in the wells, grouting it, fusing the three lines into a manifold, and trenching out a six-foot-deep ditch to the foundation for the supply and return lines that connect to the heat pump in the basement. Looking out at our lawn today, none of this subterranean plumbing is visible.
And how is it working out? Our system will most likely pay for itself in the next two to three years. There was a period of tweaking, but we are comfortable now in summer and winter alike. Much as we felt the day we walked out of an exploded house, we feel fortunate -- both to have chosen a geothermal system and to not be burning fossil fuels.

HEADLINE: From 'End of History' Author, a Look at the Beginning and Middle

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE

 BODY:
Human social behavior has an evolutionary basis. This was the thesis in Edward O. Wilson's book ''Sociobiology'' that caused such a stir, even though most evolutionary biologists accept that at least some social behaviors, like altruism, could be favored by natural selection.
In a book to be published in April, ''The Origins of Political Order,'' Francis Fukuyama of Stanford University presents a sweeping new overview of human social structures throughout history, taking over from where Dr. Wilson's ambitious synthesis left off.
Dr. Fukuyama, a political scientist, is concerned mostly with the cultural, not biological, aspects of human society. But he explicitly assumes that human social nature is universal and is built around certain evolved behaviors like favoring relatives, reciprocal altruism, creating and following rules, and a propensity for warfare.
Because of this shared human nature, with its biological foundation, ''human politics is subject to certain recurring patterns of behavior across time and across cultures,'' he writes. It is these worldwide patterns he seeks to describe in an analysis that stretches from prehistoric times to the French Revolution. 
Previous attempts to write grand analyses of human development have tended to focus on a single causal explanation, like economics or warfare, or, as with Jared Diamond's ''Guns, Germs and Steel,'' on geography. Dr. Fukuyama's is unusual in that he considers several factors, including warfare, religion, and in particular human social behaviors like favoring kin.
Few people have yet read the book, but it has created a considerable stir in universities where he has talked about it. ''You have to be bowled over by the extraordinary breadth of approach,'' said Arthur Melzer, a political scientist at Michigan State University who invited Dr. Fukuyama to give lectures on the book. ''It's definitely a magnum opus.''
Dr. Melzer praised Dr. Fukuyama's view that societies develop politically in several different ways, followed by selection of the more successful, rather than marching along a single road to political development. ''It's the kind of theory situated between the hyper-theory of Marx or Hegel and the thick description that certain anthropologists and historians aim at,'' he said.
Georg Sorensen, a political scientist at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, also called the book a magnum opus, saying that it provides ''a new foundation for understanding political development.'' It is neither Eurocentric nor monocausal, but provides a complex, multifactor explanation of political development, Dr. Sorensen said. ''In terms of discussing political order this will be a new classic,'' he said.
Dr. Fukuyama burst into public view in 1989 with his essay ''The End of History,'' a title widely misunderstood to mean that no major turning points in history would occur in future. In fact the essay concerned the evolution of human societies and the belief by Hegel and Marx that history would be fulfilled when the ideal political order was achieved -- the liberal state, in Hegel's view; communism, in Marx's.
Unlike some scholars who flame out after a single brilliant book, Dr. Fukuyama has produced a steady and wide-ranging body of work, delving into sociology with his book ''Trust'' (1996) and into biotechnology with ''Our Posthuman Future'' (2003). He is also unusual in combining academic theory with a practical interest in economic development. He is a frequent consultant to the World Bank and other agencies.
He has a political dimension, too, and is often associated with the neoconservative movement. He signed a letter after the Sept. 11 attacks urging President Bush to overthrow Saddam Hussein. But by 2006 he had become a critic both of the invasion of Iraq and of the neoconservative movement, which he said he could no longer support.
In an interview at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, where he was attending a conference on synthetic biology, Dr. Fukuyama said he had written his new book as ''the primer I wished I had had when I started in political science.'' He has grounded it in biology because he does not share what he sees as the ''great hostility in many social sciences to take aboard information from the natural sciences.''
The book traces the development of political order from the earliest human societies, which were small groups of hunter-gatherers. The first major social development, in Dr. Fukuyama's view, was the transition from hunter-gatherer bands to tribes, made possible by religious ideas that united large numbers of people in worship of a common ancestor. Since a tribe could quickly mobilize many men for warfare, neighboring bands had to tribalize too, or be defeated.
Warfare also forced the second major social transition, from tribe to state. States are better organized than tribes and more stable, since tribes tend to dissolve in fighting after the death of a leader. Only because states offered a better chance of survival did people give up the freedom of the tribe for the coercion of the state.
Much of Dr. Fukuyama's analysis concerns how states develop from tribes. This transition, in his view, is affected by geography, history, and in particular by the order in which the different institutional components of the state are put in place. Depending on the order of events, several very different kinds of state emerged in China, India, the Islamic world and Europe, and even within Europe there have been several major variations on a common theme.
''We take institutions for granted but in fact have no idea where they come from,'' he writes. Institutions are the rules that coordinate social behavior. Just as tribes are based on the deep-seated human instinct of looking out for one's family and relatives, states depend on the human propensity to create and follow social rules.
Dr. Fukuyama emphasizes the role of China because it was the first state. The Qin dynasty, founded in 221 B.C., prevailed over tribalism, the default condition of large societies, by developing an official class loyal to the state rather than to family and kin.
Tribalism did not disappear in Europe until a thousand years later. It yielded first to feudalism, an institution in which peasants bound themselves to a lord's service in return for his protection. So when kings emerged, they seldom acquired absolute power, as did rulers in China, because they had to share power with feudal lords.
Another impediment to absolute rule in Europe, in Dr. Fukuyama's telling, was that the concept of the rule of law emerged very early, largely because of the church's development of canon law in the 11th century. So when strong rulers started to build states, they had to take account of the emerging codes of civil law.
Europeans then developed the unusual idea that it was the law that should be absolute, not the ruler. In pursuit of this principle, the English Parliament executed one king, Charles I, and deposed another, James II. This proved a durable solution to the problem of building a strong state, yet one in which the ruler was held accountable.
Other European countries developed institutions similar to those in England but failed to achieve a sustainable balance of power between the ruler and the elites. In France, the nobility rebuffed the state's efforts to tax them, so the burden fell increasingly on the peasantry until it became intolerable, leading to the French Revolution. In Hungary, the elites were so powerful that they denied the king the authority to devise an adequate defense. The Hungarian Army was annihilated by the Mongols at the battle of Mohi in 1241 and again by the Ottoman Turks at the battle of Mohacs in 1526.
Of the European powers, only England and Denmark, in Dr. Fukuyama's view, developed the three essential institutions of a strong state, the rule of law, and mechanisms to hold the ruler accountable. This successful formula then became adopted by other European states, through a kind of natural selection that favored the most successful variation.
Though institutions are the basis of the modern state, the instinct to favor family never disappears and will reassert itself whenever possible. To create a loyal administrative class, Dr. Fukuyama said, some states took the extreme measure of destroying the family, in a variety of original ways.
The Chinese emperors instituted a special cadre of eunuchs who had no family but the state, and came to be trusted more than the regular administrators. Pope Gregory VII in the 11th century imposed celibacy on Catholic priests, forcing them to choose between the church and the family.
Islamic rulers created a class free of family ties with the remarkable institution of slave soldiers. Young boys would be taken from mostly Christian families, often in the Balkans, raised as Muslims and as slaves, and trained as soldiers. The system, despite its oddity, was highly effective. The Mamluks, one of several versions of these military slaves, defeated the Mongols and ousted the Crusaders. The institution decayed from the very danger it was designed to prevent: weak sultans allowed the soldiers' sons to succeed their fathers in office, whereupon the soldiers' loyalty reverted to their families instead of the state.
Without taking human behavior into account, ''you misunderstand the nature of political institutions,'' Dr. Fukuyama said in the interview at Johns Hopkins. Such behaviors, particularly the faculty for creating rules, are the basis for social institutions, even though the content of institutions is supplied by culture. Dr. Fukuyama sees the situation as similar to that of language, in which the genes generate the neural machinery for learning language but culture supplies the content.
Institutions, though cultural, can be very hard to change. The reason is that, once they are created, people start to invest them with intrinsic value, often religious. This process ''probably had an evolutionary significance in stabilizing human societies,'' Dr. Fukuyama said, since with an accepted set of rules a society didn't have to fight everything out again every few years. The inertia of institutions explains why societies are usually so slow to change. Societies are not trapped by their past, but nor are they free in any given generation to remake themselves.
Just as institutions are hard to change, so too they are hard to develop. ''Poor countries are poor not because they lack resources,'' Dr. Fukuyama writes, ''but because they lack effective political institutions.'' The absence of a strong rule of law, in his view, is ''one of the principal reasons why poor countries can't achieve higher rates of growth.''
So does the inertia of institutions mean it is futile for the United States to try to impose democratic government on countries that have never had it, like Iraq and Afghanistan? ''It's extraordinarily difficult to create institutions in other societies,'' Dr. Fukuyama said. ''If you impose rules people don't have commitment to, they don't take. On the other hand, Japan and Korea and China itself have adopted foreign institutions at great variance with their own and have made use of them.''
The first volume of ''The Origins of Political Order'' ends with the 18th century. A second volume will bring the story to the present day. In conversation Dr. Fukuyama makes clear that the modern liberal state is still in his view the end of history.
The Chinese political system, since it has no way of holding its rulers accountable, is in the long run unstable, in his view. ''The Chinese have reasonably good technocratic leadership. They can move faster than a democracy and cut through interest groups. But that leaves them vulnerable to bad emperor problems. They think the last bad emperor they had was Mao,'' he said.
Dr. Fukuyama says he has been at pains not to write Whig history, in which the past is presented as an inevitable progression toward liberal democracy. He describes the many different states that arose in Europe in order to make clear that the English path was only one among many. Indeed the road to democracy was wholly unexpected.
''My argument is that the rule of law comes out of organized religion, and that democracy is a weird accident of history,'' he said. ''Parliaments in Europe had legal rights, and it was a complete historical accident that the English Parliament could fight a civil war and produce a constitutional settlement that became the basis of modern democracy.''
In a parallel universe with no feudalism, European rulers might have been absolute, just like those of China. But through the accident of democracy, England and then the United States created a powerful system that many others wish to emulate. The question for China, in Dr. Fukuyama's view, is whether a modern society can continue to be run through a top-down bureaucratic system with no solution to the bad emperor problem. ''If I had to bet on these two systems, I'd bet on ours,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Rises On Strength of Auto Loans

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers borrowed more in January to buy cars but were once again frugal with credit card purchases, offering a mixed sign of their confidence in the economy. 
The Federal Reserve said Monday that total borrowing rose at an annual rate of $5 billion in January, or 2.5 percent, the fourth consecutive gain. Strong car sales drove the increase. The category that includes auto loans rose 6.9 percent.
Credit card debt fell 6.4 percent in January, the 28th decline in 29 months. Americans increased their use of plastic in December for the first time since the financial crisis. But they cut back in January, even though a Social Security tax cut is giving most households an additional $1,000 to $2,000 this year.
Combined, total consumer credit equaled $2.41 trillion, a slight 0.7 percent above a three-year low hit in September. Consumer borrowing is 6.6 percent below the high reached in July 2008.
Analysts predict that consumers will borrow more in the months ahead, responding to the strengthening economy, a brighter outlook for jobs and the tax cut. The government reported Friday that the unemployment rate fell to 8.9 percent in February, the first time it had been below 9 percent in nearly two years.
Households began borrowing less and saving more as they struggled to cope with the deep recession that began in 2007. People trimmed their spending, which accounts for 70 percent of total economic activity, when the jobless rate began to rise.
The rise in auto loans was the sixth consecutive month of increases, reflecting a rebound in auto sales.
Even if economists' forecasts are accurate and borrowing increases this year, analysts are not predicting that consumers will increase debt the way they did during the housing boom.
During that time, households felt wealthier because of soaring home values. But when home prices fell, they cut back on borrowing. The trend accelerated after job losses mounted and many people struggled to get their debt under control.

HEADLINE: When Energy Efficiency Sullies the Environment

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
For the sake of a cleaner planet, should Americans wear dirtier clothes?
This is not a simple question, but then, nothing about dirty laundry is simple anymore. We've come far since the carefree days of 1996, when Consumer Reports tested some midpriced top-loaders and reported that ''any washing machine will get clothes clean.''
In this year's report, no top-loading machine got top marks for cleaning. The best performers were front-loaders costing on average more than $1,000. Even after adjusting for inflation, that's still $350 more than the top-loaders of 1996.
What happened to yesterday's top-loaders? To comply with federal energy-efficiency requirements, manufacturers made changes like reducing the quantity of hot water. The result was a bunch of what Consumer Reports called ''washday wash-outs,'' which left some clothes ''nearly as stained after washing as they were when we put them in.'' 
Now, you might think that dirtier clothes are a small price to pay to save the planet. Energy-efficiency standards have been embraced by politicians of both parties as one of the easiest ways to combat global warming. Making appliances, cars, buildings and factories more efficient is called the ''low-hanging fruit'' of strategies to cut greenhouse emissions.
But a growing number of economists say that the environmental benefits of energy efficiency have been oversold. Paradoxically, there could even be more emissions as a result of some improvements in energy efficiency, these economists say.
The problem is known as the energy rebound effect. While there's no doubt that fuel-efficient cars burn less gasoline per mile, the lower cost at the pump tends to encourage extra driving. There's also an indirect rebound effect as drivers use the money they save on gasoline to buy other things that produce greenhouse emissions, like new electronic gadgets or vacation trips on fuel-burning planes.
Some of the biggest rebound effects occur when new economic activity results from energy-efficient technologies that reduce the cost of making products like steel or generating electricity. In some cases, the overall result can be what's called ''backfire'': more energy use than would have occurred without the improved efficiency.
Another term for backfire is the Jevons Paradox, named after a 19th-century British economist who observed that while the steam engine extracted energy more efficiently from coal, it also stimulated so much economic growth that coal consumption increased. That paradox was mostly ignored by modern environmentalists, who have argued that rebound effects are much smaller today.
But economists keep finding contrary evidence. When Britain's UK Energy Research Center reviewed more than 500 studies on the subject, it rejected the assumption that rebound effects were small enough to be disregarded. The author of the 2007 report, Steve Sorrell, noted that these effects could, in some circumstances, ''potentially increase energy consumption in the long term.''
A similar conclusion comes from a survey of the literature published last month by the Breakthrough Institute, an American research group that studies ways to slow global warming. Its authors, Jesse Jenkins, Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger, warn that ''rebound effects are real and significant,'' and could sometimes erode all the expected reductions in emissions.
''Efficiency advocates try to distract attention from the rebound effect by saying that nobody will vacuum more because their vacuum cleaner is more efficient,'' Mr. Shellenberger said. ''But this misses the picture at the macro and global level, particularly when you consider all the energy that is used in manufacturing products and producing usable energy like electricity and gasoline from coal and oil. When you increase the efficiency of a steel plant in China, you'll likely see more steel production and thus more energy consumption.''
Consider what's happened with lighting over the past three centuries. As people have switched from candles to oil-powered lamps to incandescent bulbs and beyond, the amount of energy needed to produce a unit of light has plummeted. Yet people have found so many new places to light that today we spend the same proportion of our income on light as our much poorer ancestors did in 1700, according to an analysis published last year in The Journal of Physics by researchers led by Jeff Tsao of Sandia National Laboratories.
''The implications of this research are important for those who care about global warming,'' said Harry Saunders, a co-author of the article. ''Many have come to believe that new, highly-efficient solid-state lighting -- generally LED technology, like that used on the displays of stereo consoles, microwaves and digital clocks -- will result in reduced energy consumption. We find the opposite is true.''
These new lights, though, produce lots of other benefits, just as many other improvements in energy efficiency contribute to overall welfare by lowering costs and spurring economic growth. In the long run, that economic growth may spur innovative new technologies for reducing greenhouse emissions and lowering levels of carbon dioxide.
But if your immediate goal is to reduce greenhouse emissions, then it seems risky to count on reaching it by improving energy efficiency. To economists worried about rebound effects, it makes more sense to look for new carbon-free sources of energy, or to impose a direct penalty for emissions, like a tax on energy generated from fossil fuels. Whereas people respond to more fuel-efficient cars by driving more and buying other products, they respond to a gasoline tax simply by driving less.
A visible tax, of course, is not popular, which is one reason that politicians prefer to stress energy efficiency. The costs and other trade-offs of energy efficiency are often conveniently hidden from view, and the prospect of using less energy appeals to the thrifty instincts of consumers as well as to the moral sensibilities of environmentalists.
But if the benefits of energy efficiency have been oversold, then that's more reason to consider alternatives like a carbon tax, and to look more carefully at the hidden costs and trade-offs involved in setting rigid standards for efficiency. Unlike a carbon tax, which gives consumers and manufacturers an incentive to look for smart ways to save energy, a mandated standard of efficiency can reduce flexibility and force people into choices they wouldn't ordinarily make -- including ones with consequences more serious than dirty clothes.
Because of the smaller and consequently less safe cars built to meet federal fuel-efficiency standards starting in the 1980s, there were about 2,000 additional deaths on the highway every year, according to the National Research Council. And now the federal government is imposing even more stringent standards, with little objection except from a few critics like Sam Kazman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market-oriented nonprofit research group.
''Efficiency mandates have become feel-good mantras that politicians invoke,'' Mr. Kazman said. ''The results of these mandates have ranged from costly fiascos, such as once-dependable top-loading washers that no longer wash, to higher fatalities in cars downsized by fuel-efficiency rules. If the technologies were so good, they wouldn't need to be imposed on us by law.''
No matter what laws are enacted, people are going to find ways to use energy more efficiently -- that's the story of civilization. But don't count on them using less energy, no matter how dirty their clothes get.

HEADLINE: LOWERING OF FEES FOR DEBIT CARDS IS LOBBY BATTLE

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT; Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It seemed a good idea last year, when the financial crisis had turned banks into Public Enemy No. 1 and lawmakers were looking for ways to reward consumers still bitter about billion-dollar bailouts and executive bonuses.
Without much warning or debate, the Senate passed an amendment directing the Federal Reserve to reduce the hidden ''swipe fees'' that banks collect from retailers each time a customer makes a purchase with a debit card. 
Merchants, who had complained that the $20.5 billion in annual fees were biting into their profits, were elated. Banks were stunned. Their lobbyists tried to reverse the move, but when the overhaul of the nation's financial regulation was passed by Congress last July, the debit card cut survived.
Now, as the Fed faces a deadline in April to write the rules for the lower fees, banks and debit card companies are engaged in an all-out assault on Capitol Hill, enlisting a growing cadre of lawmakers and lobbyists to push for changes, delay or outright repeal. Banks contend the proposed cut in fees -- to 12 cents per transaction from an average of 44 cents -- will leave many of them unable to afford to issue debit cards to customers or will force them to raise other consumer banking charges to cover the costs. They also claim retailers will reap unfair profits.
A coalition of banks and card companies have plastered subway cars and Internet sites with ads warning, ''Bureaucrats want to take away your debit card!''
''I am appalled that our members will shoulder tremendous financial burden and still be on the hook for fraud loss while large retailers receive a giant windfall at the hands of the government,'' John P. Buckley Jr., the president of Gerber Federal Credit Union of Fremont, Mich., told a House of Representatives subcommittee last week.
This week, a trade group of convenience store owners will storm Capitol Hill with their side of the story.
''These fees are stunting business growth and hurting efforts to hire more workers and expand operations,'' Douglas Kantor, a lobbyist for the Merchants Payments Coalition, a retailer trade group, said recently.
The lobbying has been intense over the last year with the card companies and banks hiring, among others, Sam Geduldig, a former adviser to Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio and the House speaker, and Regina Mahony, formerly a senior adviser to Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, according to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks lobbyists.
Representatives of the retailers include the former Republican Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, and Sheryl Cohen, a former chief of staff for Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the Democratic senator who sponsored the financial regulation bill and is now retired.
This debate is but one area where the consequences -- intended and not -- of the sprawling Dodd-Frank financial regulation law are coming to light. In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, predicted that portions of the law would have to be reversed. ''And that's going to create very high degrees of uncertainty,'' Mr. Greenspan said, something the markets hate.
Lawmakers tried to soften the blow by exempting smaller banks from the fee cap. But now even those institutions with less than $10 billion in assets oppose the law. They say that if they continue to levy the current, higher fees, their debit cards will not be able to compete against the big banks, which will charge lower fees because they have no choice. They gained a significant ally when Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, told a Senate panel last month that he thought a two-tier fee system would not work.
Several lawmakers who supported the debit card amendment or the broader financial regulation bill as a whole are now reversing course, as the antibank climate here softens. ''I believe the Fed was given too narrow of set of rules'' with which to draft the regulation, said Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who sponsored Dodd-Frank in the House, which never voted separately on the debit-fee amendment. ''Now there is genuine political pressure to do something. It's very much in play.''
At least two Republican senators who voted for the debit card amendment last year -- David Vitter of Louisiana and Michael D. Crapo of Idaho -- have expressed reservations, urging the Fed to consider ''all costs to the issuers,'' including the cost of protecting themselves against fraudulent use of debit cards, which totaled $1.4 billion in 2009, according to the banks.
The law requires the Fed to limit debit fees to the ''reasonable and proportional'' cost of each transaction, and the Fed proposed a rule that did not yet include the cost of fraud protection.
Banks encourage consumers to use debit cards by signing for their purchases, rather than entering a personal identification number at the cash register. Card companies and banks earn higher fees on signature-debit transactions, but they also incur higher rates of fraud.
The fee cap still has some powerful backers, who say it should it take effect in July as scheduled. They are led by the amendment's original sponsor, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois.
Mr. Durbin accused the debit card companies of employing ''scare tactics'' by saying the government wants to take away cards, or that merchants might no longer accept them.
The banks are already trying to make up for the lost revenue, with lenders like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bancorp charging fees for things that once were free, like paper statements or online banking. TCF Financial, a Minnesota regional bank that relies heavily on revenue from debit card fees, has sued the Federal Reserve board to block the enactment of the Durbin amendment.
Banks and credit card companies contend that the fee cap will create a windfall for giant retailers like Home Depot and Wal-Mart, which they say generate the bulk of debit card transactions, while doing little for small retailers.
Banking lobbyists eagerly point to a conference call in which a Home Depot executive told financial analysts the proposed rule would lower its debit fees by about $35 million a year.
Small-business owners, for their part, cite what they say is the devastating impact of rising debit card fees. Small banks and credit unions say they depend on debit fees to allow them to offer other services, like free checking. ''Under the current proposal,'' Frank Michael, president of Allied Credit Union of Stockton, Calif., told the subcommittee, ''we are going to lose money on every transaction.''

HEADLINE: Oil Concerns Continue To Drive Shares Lower

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER and DAVID JOLLY; Christine Hauser contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stock indexes closed lower on Monday, driven by oil prices and a sovereign debt downgrade.
The markets had started the day higher, buoyed by deal news. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury conglomerate, said Monday that it would take control of the watchmaker Bulgari, adding another high-end brand to its formidable stable, in a deal worth $5.2 billion. In a second deal, the hard-drive maker Western Digitalsaid that it would buyHitachi Global Storage Technologies for $4.3 billion.
But later in the day, Wells Fargo reduced its recommendation on chip makers, sending many technology shares lower. Intel slid 1.6 percent, to $21.21, while JDS Uniphase fell 6.9 percent, to $25.49. 
Attention again focused on uncertainty in the Middle East. Investors worried that oil prices could rise more if unrest spreads to other major oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 79.85 points, or 0.66 percent, to 12,090.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 11.02 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1,310.13, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 39.04 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 2,745.63.
In Europe, the FTSE 100 index in London was down 0.28 percent and the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, fell 0.59 percent. The DAX in Frankfurt lost 0.24 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.74 percent.
Moody's Investors Service cut its credit rating on Greece's government debt by three notches, taking the securities deeper into junk territory, and said the outlook was negative.
In downgrading Greece's debt, Moody'swarned that Athens would have difficulty fulfilling its promises to overhaul its finances and might have to restructure debt. Moody's acted days before a meeting Friday of euro zone heads of state, who will discuss proposals by the European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, to improve economic policy coordination. Gary Baker, an equity strategist at Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch in London, said the meeting of euro zone officials on Friday was unlikely to yield any major developments but would instead be a chance for governments to look for a way to reach a comprehensive solution to the currency area's problems at meetings on March 24 and 25.
The euro fell to $1.3967 from $1.3987 late Friday, bolstered by expectations that the European Central Bank will raise its benchmark interest rate next month, a move that would make short-term European assets more attractive to money managers.
In the energy sector, the price for crude oil has been rising steadily since unrest erupted in northern Africa and the Middle East. On Monday, the price of benchmark crude for April delivery in New York trading was just above $105 a barrel after spiking near $107 a barrel in electronic trading.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil settled at $105.44, rising 1.02 percent.
''The market is going to have to sort out what's fact and what's rumor,'' Quincy Krosby, chief marketing strategist for Prudential Financial, told The Associated Press. ''They are saying, 'how high can the prices go, and more importantly for how long.' ''
In the United States, the increase in oil has pushed the average price of gasoline above $3.50 a gallon, up almost 12 percent in the last month, according to the AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report.
Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group, said gas prices exceeding $4 a gallon would hurt the American economy.
''We are looking at $4.25, and remaining there for a minimum of two months, and oil prices sticking above $135 for two months,'' he said. At that point, ''households will be so squeezed in their finances, and businesses will also reach a point where they, too, will begin to cut back on spending in anticipation of the economy really going to get hit.''
Over the weekend, the Obama administration said that it was considering tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to rapidly rising gasoline prices.
Interest rates were a little higher. The Treasury's 10-year note fell 7/32, to 100 29/32, and the yield rose to 3.51 percent, from 3.49 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: The Return of Incentive Travel

BYLINE: By SARA J. WELCH

 BODY:
Incentive trips -- all-expenses-paid excursions offered as a reward for outstanding performance -- almost disappeared after the American International Group was widely criticized for the lavish spending on one such trip in September 2008, less than a week after it got $85 billion in government bailout money.
But it now appears incentive travel is coming back. ''The burn-at-the-stake attitude toward incentive travel is gone,'' said John Tichenor, president of World Heritage Travel Group, an incentive travel company in Angels Camp, Calif. 
Incentive trips were long used by companies to motivate employees to sell more, make fewer errors or otherwise contribute to the bottom line. But in the depths of the recession, as millions of workers were being laid off, companies generally avoided any signs of excess. Now, as the economy begins to return to health, companies see a need to give their employees an incentive to work harder.
''There's much higher degree of comfort in using these tools to drive business performance and also to talk about it,'' said Steve O'Malley, president of Site International Foundation, which does fund-raising and research for the incentive travel industry. ''You have to,'' he added. ''The industry's taken two years off and now employee engagement is at stake. Many companies, if not most, are saying it's safe to get back in the water.''
Mr. O'Malley, who is also a senior vice president of Maritz Travel, an incentive planning company in Fenton, Mo., said Maritz data showed that the volume of incentive trips was increasing. ''We have 92 percent of the 2010 volume already booked just two months into the year,'' he said. And programs are also larger. ''Overall attendance is up 13 percent in terms of the number of people per program,'' he said.
The new attitude comes after much effort by the meetings and incentives industry, which began a public awareness campaign in 2009 to fight what it considered to be misperceptions about its practices.
Public criticism of the A.I.G. event and of incentive programs in general stemmed from a misunderstanding of how the trips are paid for, said Brenda Anderson, a former chief executive of Site, an organization of incentive travel executives, who is now a consultant to the industry. The money for travel comes from the incremental revenue generated by salespeople,'' she said.
''By the time the travel happens, the company has already gotten the money,'' Ms. Anderson said. ''In fact, if incentive programs are done right, they can increase revenue.'' According to a September 2009 study by the U.S. Travel Association commissioned as part of the incentive industry's awareness campaign, the return on investment for incentive travel is four to one.
Government lobbying was another component of the industry's campaign. In March 2009, the industry's leaders arranged a meeting with President Obama to defend incentive and other forms of corporate travel as legitimate business tools.
''That meeting was a watershed moment,'' said Vincent Alonzo, editor in chief of Incentive, a magazine that covers the industry. ''Obama had criticized the A.I.G. trip during his campaign, but after the meeting he shifted his rhetoric.''
Capitol Hill soon followed suit.
But even with public perceptions shifting, many companies were reluctant to return to the use of luxury travel as an employee reward -- or, at least, to admit it publicly. Texas Roadhouse, a restaurant chain based in Louisville, Ky., was a rare exception in 2009. Its chief executive, G. J. Hart, appeared on CNBC at the time defending his incentive program.
''I didn't have anything to hide,'' Mr. Hart said in an interview later. ''We do this for the right reason -- to recognize and reward the people who work hard every day to take care of our guests.''
Most companies continue to tone down their incentive programs because they do not want to appear too lavish, incentive planners said. ''They'll go domestic instead of international, or stay at a Hyatt instead of a Four Seasons,'' said Harith Wickrema, an incentive planner in Willow Grove, Pa., who also teaches tourism and hospitality at Temple University in Philadelphia. A company may opt for a four-star hotel even though it is more expensive than a five-star hotel offering a deal, he said, because ''perception is more important than reality.''
In another nod to economic reality, more clients are requesting that community service activities be included in their incentive programs.
Whatever the public perception of these programs, the companies running them say they derive many benefits beyond the extra revenue generated by people trying to qualify.
''We get back so much more than we invest,'' said Gary Read, chief executive of Nimsoft, a software company in Redwood City, Calif., that sends its top 10 salespeople and their spouses on an incentive trip every year. ''The relationships the winners build, the camaraderie -- plus there's the factor of other employees looking at these trips and saying, 'Next year I'm going to be there.' ''
Kevin Lambert, who traveled to St. Barts last April as one of Nimsoft's incentive winners, said he was a big fan. ''All our income is from commissions, and having that trip as the big carrot you're aiming for keeps you going during the low points.''
Mr. Lambert added that bringing along his wife was a further benefit. ''I'm on the road three out of every four weeks and my wife has to put up with it,'' he said. ''Now she has a broader appreciation for what I do, and it feels more like we're in this together.''

HEADLINE: Peace-Building That Pays Off

BYLINE: By ANTHONY C. ZINNI. 
Anthony C. Zinni, a retired Marine general, was commander in chief of the United States Central Command from 1997 to 2000.

 BODY:
Williamsburg, Va.
IN voting last month to eliminate financing for the United States Institute of Peace, members of the House of Representatives did not do their research. You will find the institute's competent work behind practically every American success in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has undertaken missions from the Balkans and Sudan to the Philippines and Somalia, where I supported the institute's efforts to mediate conflicts, promote the rule of law and encourage democracy.
This week, as the Senate considers alternatives to the House budget bill, we should remember that the stakes for national security and peace-building are high. The institute was created in 1984, when the cold war was still at its height. Congressional leaders guided by Senator Spark M. Matsunaga, a Hawaii Democrat, saw the need for an institution that would strengthen the nation's ability to limit international violence and manage global conflict. President Ronald Reagan signed the act creating the institute. A bipartisan majority of Congress has supported it since -- until now. 
The Institute of Peace is like the Marine Corps or special forces for foreign affairs and peace-building. When others are fleeing conflict around the world, you'll usually find institute staff members going in. They were working in Afghanistan before 9/11 and were among the first nonmilitary personnel on the ground after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The institute's headquarters in Baghdad has twice been damaged by rocket and mortar attacks. At the height of the Iraq insurgency, when virtually every other American and international group pulled out their personnel, the State and Defense Departments requested that the institute stay. Under fire regularly, it was the only United States organization outside of those departments that did not flee Baghdad.
But the institute's value goes beyond the bravery and commitment of its staff. In 2007, when the Army's 10th Mountain Division arrived in Mahmudiya, a city of half a million in the ''triangle of death'' dominated by Al Qaeda south of Baghdad, officers asked the institute to mediate between Shiite civil authorities and the Sunni sheiks who controlled the area. Institute-trained negotiators convened warring Iraqis to consolidate security, restore services, develop the local economy, enhance local governance and improve the rule of law. Gen. David H. Petraeus called it a turning point in the war.
In the six months before the institute's intervention, there had been 93 attacks on American forces in the area with homemade bombs; in the six months after, just one. Mahmudiya became a cornerstone of peace in the district, allowing the Army to reduce its strength from a brigade combat team of 3,500 soldiers to a battalion of 650, with corresponding savings and reductions in casualties.
In Afghanistan, the institute conducts mediations on issues from refugees to property and water disputes. In the last year, these operations have resolved 18 tribal disputes throughout the country, mostly involving the abuse of women, and included 30 training programs for government officials, lawyers, mullahs, tribal councils and community leaders. The network is even supporting dialogue along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, the earth's most dangerous frontier -- home to Taliban and Qaeda attacks and a wellspring of religious and political extremism.
Congress would be hard-pressed to find an agency that does more with less. The institute's entire budget would not pay for the Afghan war for three hours, is less than the cost of a fighter plane, and wouldn't sustain even 40 American troops in Afghanistan for a year. Within the budget, peace-building is financed as part of national security programs, and is recognized as an important adjunct to conventional defense spending and diplomacy. The institute's share of the proposed international affairs budget, $43 million, is minuscule: less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the State Department's budget, and one-hundredth of 1 percent of the Pentagon's.
The idea that eliminating the United States Institute of Peace would benefit taxpayers is extremely shortsighted and ill informed. America deserves better from Congress than eliminating something that saves American lives and taxpayer dollars.

PERSON: Walter Zacharius 

HEADLINE: Walter Zacharius, 87, Romance Publisher

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Walter Zacharius, who rode the passion-swollen wave of romance fiction in the early 1980s to build the Kensington Publishing Corporation into a leading purveyor of bodice-rippers and other romance genres, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, his son, Steven, said. 
Mr. Zacharius emerged from the world of true-confession magazines and paperback genre fiction to found Kensington in 1974 with Roberta Grossman. Beating the bushes for overlooked writers and eager first-timers willing to start out cheap, the partners developed the careers of prolific and profit-generating authors like Janelle Taylor and Katherine Stone.
As it expanded the romance genre to embrace paranormal romance, adult Western romance and romance titles aimed at Hispanic, black and gay readers, Kensington branched out into new forms of distribution. Mr. Zacharius signed deals with Wal-Mart, sold his books on the shopping network QVC and saw the potential of e-books early on.
Through its Zebra, Dafina, Brava, Encanto and other imprints, Kensington publishes about 450 fiction and nonfiction books a year in a wide variety of genres. Although about 60 percent of its list is devoted to titles like ''A Little Bit Sinful'' and ''A Storm of Pleasure,'' it has also published ''I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell'' by Tucker Max. With sales of $70 million, the company is the largest independent publisher of mass-market titles in the United States. Zebra Books, the company's sole imprint until the late 1980s, became known for its embossed covers, with a lurid ''sunset'' palette of purples, pinks and oranges and a bold use of foil. Mr. Zacharius pushed the taste boundary even further in 1989, when he began putting holograms on his covers.
Although the company occasionally published name writers, including Joyce Carol Oates, Isaac Asimov and Jerzy Kosinski, its economic well-being and its reputation lay with many writers largely unknown to The New York Review of Books -- best-sellers like Fern Michaels, Lisa Jackson and Beverly Barton.
''We're not impressed with what's selling on Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive,'' Mr. Zacharius told The New York Times in 1982. ''Our readers patronize suburban shopping malls.''
Walter Zacharius was born on Oct. 16, 1923, in Brooklyn, and attended public schools. He enlisted in the Army soon after leaving high school and took part in the Normandy invasion and the liberation of Paris.
After returning to the United States, he found a job with Macfadden Publications, working on magazines like True Confessions and True Story before teaming up with Aaron A. Wyn at Ace, where he helped create Ace Double Novels, a paperback line that offered two books in one volume.
With Irwin Stein, he founded Lancer Books in 1961 to publish genre fiction, primarily science fiction and fantasy, notably the ''Conan the Barbarian'' stories of Robert E. Howard. The company also turned out erotic crime and spy novels (''The Man From O.R.G.Y.'') and Gothic fiction, as well as the paperback edition of Mario Puzo's first novel, ''The Fortunate Pilgrim.''
In 1965, Mr. Zacharius jumped at a golden opportunity presented by ''Candy,'' a sex satire by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg, which had been published in Paris by Maurice Girodias and was unprotected by copyright in the United States. In a bit of literary swashbuckling, he undercut by 20 cents the 95-cent edition Dell planned to publish, emblazoning the cover with a big red lipstick print and the screaming come-on: ''Not one word changed! This is the ORIGINAL, UNCUT and UNEXPURGATED EDITION as first published and banned in Paris.''
In similar fashion, Zebra Books later capitalized on the runaway success of ''Iacocca,'' the autobiography of the Chrysler executive Lee A. Iacocca, by publishing the paperback edition of a little-read biography of Mr. Iacocca with the same title. The book ended up at No. 3 on the list of top-selling paperbacks for 1985.
In 1988, Kensington began publishing hardcover books, placing two memoirs on the best-seller list that year: ''On the Outside Looking In,'' by Michael Reagan, the adopted son of Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman, and ''The Duke of Flatbush,'' by the Brooklyn Dodger star Duke Snider, who died on Feb. 27.
In addition to his son, Steven, of Melville, N.Y., the current president and chief executive of Kensington, Mr. Zacharius is survived by his wife, Suzanne; a daughter, Judith, of Fairbanks, Alaska; two grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter. His first wife, Alice, died in 2004.
''Songbird,'' a novel by Mr. Zacharius based on the harrowing wartime experiences of a Polish Jewish woman he met in Paris, was published in 2004 and later retitled ''The Memories We Keep.''

HEADLINE: A Rare Bipartisan Call To Share Budget Pain

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
RICHMOND, Va. -- While the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans fight in Washington over cutting a small slice of the federal budget, deficit hawks from both parties have taken to the road to persuade the public that the only way to really fix the nation's finances is to shrink the growth of popular entitlement programs and to raise revenues.
Two senators -- Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia -- held an unusual bipartisan forum here on Monday before an overflow crowd of more than 200 Virginia business leaders. They will hold a similar event next month in Atlanta. 
While the senators made their pitch for a far-reaching debt-reduction plan requiring some sacrifice from all Americans, including businesses, the co-chairmen of President Obama's bipartisan fiscal commission -- Alan K. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader from Wyoming, and Erskine B. Bowles, a chief of staff to President Bill Clinton -- were speaking in New York, stepping up their campaign to keep alive the recommendations of the commission's majority in December to cut the debt by $4 trillion through 2020.
To that end, on Tuesday Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson will be on Capitol Hill to announce a nonprofit organization, the Moment of Truth Project, which will seek to educate the public as well as lawmakers about the scale of tax and spending changes needed. While the White House is aware of their efforts, officials say the administration has neither discouraged nor encouraged them.
Separately, Mr. Warner and Mr. Chambliss will continue working privately with four other senators -- two from each party, all of them former members of the Bowles-Simpson commission -- to write legislation based on the panel's recommendations.
Such efforts face a hard slog not only on Capitol Hill, but also among the public. Polls consistently show that Americans want the White House and Congress to rein in the mounting long-term federal debt. Yet by large majorities they oppose many specific proposals to reduce the future costs of Medicare and Medicaid and to ensure Social Security's long-term solvency.
In their remarks here, Mr. Warner and Mr. Chambliss acknowledged the hurdles but insisted that Americans were ahead of their elected officials in being ready to take the necessary steps. And they separately criticized the positions of many in their own parties.
While Republicans are adamantly antitax, Mr. Chambliss said, ''We've got to close the revenue gap.''
And Mr. Warner said Democrats in Congress would have to be willing to further restrain Medicare and Medicaid and to reduce projected Social Security benefits for future generations, perhaps by raising the retirement age over a period of decades, to protect the program's long-term viability.
''For a Republican to put revenues on the table is significant,'' Mr. Chambliss said. ''For a Democrat to put entitlements on the table is significant.''
Both men criticized the current negotiations between the Obama administration and Congress for cutting only from the so-called discretionary domestic spending that makes up 12 percent of the federal budget. Republicans have proposed $61 billion in cuts for the balance of the current fiscal year, slashing education, law enforcement, energy programs and more, while the White House and Democrats have countered with a plan for cuts of $10.5 billion.
''If we cut all of that'' part of the budget, ''we still couldn't solve the problem,'' Mr. Chambliss said.
Reducing entitlement programs, which make up more than 40 percent of the budget, would also not be enough for long-term solvency, he added, ''and you can't raise taxes enough to get us out of this problem. So obviously you have to have all three of those issues up for dialogue.''
A questioner pointed out the importance of military spending in Virginia, home to the Pentagon, bases and shipbuilding, but Mr. Warner and Mr. Chambliss agreed that it must be cut, too.
Mr. Warner echoed Mr. Obama in arguing that much of discretionary domestic spending amounted to government investments. He cited the National Institutes of Health, education and research programs.
He and Mr. Chambliss urged the business leaders to support the deficit-reduction effort. Like the fiscal commission's majority, they propose to overhaul the tax code to eliminate some of the more than $1 trillion in annual tax breaks for individuals and businesses, and to use the revenues both to lower tax rates and to reduce deficits.
''That simpler tax code means a lot of the current exemptions are going to have to go bye-bye,'' Mr. Warner said.
Yet underscoring the political difficulty, the senators declined to say when or if their group might agree to compromise legislation.
''We won't be able to'' agree on everything, Mr. Chambliss said. The goal, he added, is to agree on concepts for tax and spending changes that leave the details to the Congressional committees with jurisdiction. Beyond the six members, he said, 25 other senators are potential allies.
Even if the senators do reach agreement, the chances remain slim that Congress will act, especially in the House. The Republican leaders there have scores of new members, many of them Tea Party adherents little inclined to compromise with Democrats.
Separately, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, is conducting his own classes for freshman lawmakers to educate them about the need to tackle entitlement programs as well as discretionary spending. Mr. Ryan was a member of the fiscal commission but voted against its recommendations because they did not cut health spending enough, in his view, and raised revenues.
But the Senate bipartisan group believes its efforts could gain strength should the White House and Republican leaders reach an impasse this year that threatens an economic crisis.
Mr. Chambliss conceded that any plan would go nowhere without buy-in from the White House and House Republicans leaders. He said that he spoke regularly with Speaker John A. Boehner, a close friend, and that White House officials were also monitoring the group's talks.
''There are at least conversations going on between all three of us,'' Mr. Chambliss said.

HEADLINE: Restaurateur Is Said to Win Pier A Lease

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
A prince of the restaurant scene in Manhattan's financial district could soon expand his realm to a 125-year-old Victorian pier that juts out from Lower Manhattan toward the Statue of Liberty.
Peter Poulakakos, whose family operates Harry's Cafe and Steak and several other restaurants near Wall Street, was selected as the best candidate for a lease on Pier A at the edge of Battery Park, he and other people with knowledge of the decision said Monday. The directors of the Battery Park City Authority are scheduled to vote on his bid on Tuesday night, a spokeswoman for the authority said.
''I would do several good things for Lower Manhattan,'' Mr. Poulakakos said on Monday. But the usually extroverted Mr. Poulakakos said he would not discuss his plans for the pier until after the board had voted. 
The choice of the Poulakakos family could breathe commercial life into the city-owned pier, which sat empty and decaying for decades before the city ceded control of it in 2008 to the Battery Park City Authority. The authority is a state agency that built and runs Battery Park City, across West Street from the site of the destroyed World Trade Center.
But how the decision will be received in Lower Manhattan is a mystery because the authority has been so secretive about the selection process. Several community leaders said they had inquired about the plans for Pier A but had been rebuffed by officials of the authority.
''The whole process should have gone through the community at large,'' said Julie Menin, the chairwoman of Community Board 1. ''It shouldn't be that we read about a new tenant of Pier A in the newspaper, when taxpayer dollars are being expended.''
Ms. Menin said the process was reminiscent of the decision by George E. Pataki, the former governor, to reserve a site in Battery Park City for a women's museum that was a pet project of his wife, Libby. ''There was no public review process,'' Ms. Menin recalled. That museum was never built, and a public school was eventually built on the site.
Ms. Menin said she would prefer that the pier include a cultural institution of some sort to attract the millions of tourists who are expected to flood the area after the World Trade Center memorial opens. One of the other bidders for Pier A, Joseph J. Grano Jr., had proposed installing a museum of Italian-American heritage in the two-story pier shed. But Mr. Grano has not heard a response from authority officials in several weeks, a person close to him said.
Leticia Remauro, a vice president of the authority, disputed Ms. Menin's characterization, saying the community board's opinions had been solicited.
''Whatever requests were ever made of us were fulfilled,'' Ms. Remauro said. She added, ''The overwhelming request by the community was that they wanted to keep it a public place.''
Warrie Price, the president of the Battery Conservancy, said she did not know how the decision might affect the users of Battery Park, which lies just below the pier, because she had not been told anything about it. ''We're the next-door neighbors.'' Ms. Price said. ''We're very interested to know who it is and what are their economic goals.''
The Poulakakoses are no strangers in the downtown community or at City Hall. The family was a partner with an architectural firm that received a city contract three years ago to restore the Battery Maritime Building at the tip of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: AARP Sues U.S. Over Effects of Reverse Mortgages

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Reverse mortgages, which pay older homeowners a regular sum against the equity in their house, are supposed to shield borrowers from economic upheaval. But the popular loans have become tangled up in the real estate collapse.
AARP, the seniors' organization, filed suit Tuesday against the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which regulates reverse mortgages. The suit asserts that policy changes by HUD are pushing older homeowners into foreclosure.
The case was filed in Federal District Court for the District of Columbia by the AARP Foundation, the organization's charitable arm, and the law firm of Mehri & Skalet on behalf of the surviving spouses of three homeowners who had bought reverse mortgages. All three are facing eviction, the suit says. 
''HUD has illegally and without notice changed the rules in the middle of the game at the expense of vulnerable older people,'' said Jean Constantine-Davis, a senior lawyer at the AARP Foundation.
The lawsuit focuses on reverse mortgages where only one spouse signed the loan document. It argues that HUD shifted course in late 2008, making changes in its procedures so that surviving spouses who are not named on the mortgage must pay the full loan balance to keep the home, even if the property is worth less.
Owners of traditional mortgages often are liable for the difference between the value of their house after foreclosure and their original loan. Reverse mortgages were intended to be nonrecourse, which means that even if the value of the property shrinks, the most the borrower can lose is the house itself.
It is unclear how many elderly homeowners are facing foreclosure for reasons related to the lawsuit, but Ms. Constantine-Davis said that hundreds and perhaps thousands of elderly people were in positions similar to those of the three plaintiffs.
Nearly a quarter of all homes with mortgages in the United States are worth less the loan. These so-called underwater properties are difficult to sell and impossible to refinance.
The suit accuses HUD of making policy changes that allow underwater homes with reverse mortgages to be sold to strangers in arm's-length transactions for less than the full mortgage balance, but that require spouses or heirs in some cases to pay the full amount. Finally, the suit says HUD is ignoring its own provisions against displacing a surviving spouse.
A HUD spokeswoman said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.
One plaintiff, Delores Jeanne Moore of Covington, Ind., was not on the reverse mortgage because her husband had owned the house before they married. He died in 2008. Under the new HUD rules, the suit says, if Mrs. Moore wants to keep the house, she must pay the balance of the loan, $91,000. But a third-party buyer could get the house for 95 percent of its appraised value, or about $81,000.
Mrs. Moore's lender has been seeking to foreclose since August 2009. ''When the housing market was constantly ticking upwards, these new provisions would not have mattered so much,'' Ms. Constantine-Davis said. ''Now it's a much bigger problem.''
More than half a million people have received reverse mortgages since Congress authorized the program a quarter-century ago. Those who get the cash must be at least 62 and have substantial equity in their houses. Participants receive either a lump sum or monthly payments from lenders. After their death, the house is sold and the mortgage is paid off.
Robert Bennett, a 69-year-old retired cook at the United States Naval Academy, is also a plaintiff. Three years ago, he and his wife, Ophelia, replaced the traditional mortgage on their house in Annapolis, Md., with a reverse mortgage so they could make ends meet.
Lenders sometimes encourage only the elder member of a couple to put his or her name on the mortgage because then the payout is greater. Mr. Bennett said he did not realize that his new mortgage had taken his name off the title of the home, which the couple had owned together since 1981.
Mrs. Bennett, who was a decade senior to her husband, died shortly after the new mortgage went into effect. The payments immediately stopped and the mortgage became due and payable.
The lender began foreclosure proceedings and scheduled a sale of the property last month.
The new mortgage, intended to secure this couple's future, instead helped destroy it. They paid $20,000 in fees but received only $1,800 in cash. Meanwhile, fees and interest continue to accumulate. The balance of the loan is now about $300,000, while the value of the property has fallen to about $200,000.
If HUD had not changed the rules, the suit says, Mr. Bennett would have been allowed to live in the house until his death.
''It's a miserable thing to be thinking you're going to get kicked out after you're living all this time and you're retired,'' Mr. Bennett said in an interview. ''If I thought a reverse mortgage was going to set me up in a situation like this, I never would have participated.''

HEADLINE: Pittsburgh Pursues Plan To Demolish 'the Igloo'

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE H. O'TOOLE

 BODY:
PITTSBURGH -- The fate of Civic Arena, a gleaming symbol of this city's postwar renaissance when it opened in 1961, has been debated ever since the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team decamped last August to the nearby $321 million Consol Energy Center.
But last week, plans to demolish the arena, nicknamed ''the igloo'' for its exterior appearance and the ice rink inside, to make way for a huge mixed-use project advanced when the city's Historic Review Commission rejected its designation as a historical structure. The Penguins, three-time Stanley Cup winners, gained the development rights to the Civic Arena site in 2007, when the team struck a deal with the state, city and Allegheny County to remain in Pittsburgh. 
Under the team's proposal, the 28-acre property on the hilly eastern edge of downtown, designated as a specially planned district, would include 1,200 residential units; 208,000 square feet of commercial space; and 600,000 square feet of office space, along with a hotel, parking structures and green space. The city's Planning Commission is expected to consider it on March 22.
Preservationists argue that the arena, designed for the city's Civic Light Opera by Mitchell & Richey, is an architectural superstar; the arena's retractable steel dome, 415 feet in diameter, was the architectural capstone of the city's post-World War II cleanup, revealing a view of the new downtown. The dome sits on a ring girder when closed. When it is fully open, which has not happened since 1993, a space-frame truss supports it.
Reuse the Igloo, a local advocacy group, suggests that the community could adapt the space for other functions, like an indoor town square. A local architect, Rob Pfaffmann, who leads the ad hoc group, said it would continue to fight dismantling the center before the Planning Commission and the City Council. ''Preservation is always hard, and it's always at the last minute,'' he said. Preservation Pittsburgh, a nonprofit advocacy group, has sponsored a design competition for reuse ideas.
The board of the city and county Sports and Exhibition Authority, which is now paying $50,000 a month to maintain the empty arena, voted Sept. 16 to demolish the structure.
The chief executive of the Penguins, David Morehouse, supported the decision. ''There's a small but vocal group that likes the way the arena looks,'' Mr. Morehouse said. ''There hasn't been a viable reuse option presented. There is a finite lifetime of use for those big structures. That's true for Yankee Stadium, Boston Garden and Three Rivers Stadium,'' referring to the multipurpose stadium, home to the Pirates and Steelers, on the city's North Shore that was demolished 2001.
Redeveloping the site will be a lengthy process; the Penguins are obligated to develop 2.8 acres of the parcel each year for a decade. If preservationists get their way, the arena would remain, with the challenge of finding some innovative adaptation. But such a decision would come at the cost of development plans that proponents say would knit together the former street grid of the neighborhood, known as the Hill District.
The Hill District was a vibrant African-American neighborhood immortalized by the playwright August Wilson and battered by the urban renewal effort that produced the Civic Arena. Some 8,000 residents lost their homes, and the Civic Arena's huge dome and surrounding parking severed the connection between the lower Hill District and downtown.
Whatever happens to the site, the arena ''will be torn down. The community doesn't want it,'' said Carl Redwood, the chairman of the One Hill Community Benefits Agreement Coalition, now the Hill District Consensus Group. The coalition negotiated a community benefits agreement in 2008 that gave qualified local residents the first shot at jobs in the Consol Center and the adjacent Cambria Suites Hotel, and established a nearby jobs center. That agreement, the first of its kind in Pennsylvania, resulted in nearly 40 percent of the new jobs at the center and the hotel, some 203 of 522 positions, going to local residents. Mr. Redwood said the Penguins ''worked hard to make sure they could hire Hill residents.''
As part of the agreement, the Penguins and the city's Urban Redevelopment Authority also committed $1 million each toward a 30,000-square-foot supermarket on Centre Avenue, three blocks east of the Consol Center, which is scheduled to open this fall. The economic development arm of Hill House, a local social services agency, developed and leased the space.
Mr. Morehouse said that the community benefits agreement came after nearly a decade of negotiations with the community.
''We want to make sure that what we put there is not infringing on what the neighborhood wants,'' he said. ''What the community was asking for was jobs, a grocery store and restoring the street grid,'' reconnecting the neighborhood to downtown.
Mr. Morehouse said the most recent price tag for the specially planned district was ''roughly $500 million'' in 2006. While the team has not yet chosen a developer for the site, it has estimated that the project will provide 4,000 construction jobs and 3,000 permanent jobs.
While the Hill District Consensus Group is completing its own master plan for the larger neighborhood, it will continue to lobby the Penguins on two fronts, Mr. Redwood said. The group wants local residents to claim well-paying trade union jobs during construction and has proposed that the Penguins contribute $1 for cars parked in their lots and garages to a community development fund for Hill residents.
Mr. Redwood said the role of the Civic Arena in the decline of the neighborhood would not be forgotten. ''For the Hill District, it's a negative symbol,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For California, a Slower-Growing Population and Shifts in Ethnic Makeup

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Perhaps the legendary beaches here are losing their pull. California, once the very symbol of sun-drenched American growth, had a population increase of only 10 percent in the last decade, the slowest rise in the state's history. And for the first time since California was became a state in 1850, it will not gain a Congressional seat.
The population of the most-populous state continued to shift eastward, with inland Southern California counties showing the most explosive growth, according to Census Bureau figures released Tuesday. 
In Riverside County, the population grew by 42 percent, and in San Bernardino, a sprawling county just to the north, it is up 19 percent. The counties make up what is known as the Inland Empire, an area that has gone from orange groves to exurbia with a population in excess of four million -- more than the city of Los Angeles.
The recent growth in the state has been largely fueled by Hispanics, who continued to increase in numbers, though at a slower rate than in the 1990s. The number of whites continued to decline. They now make up just 40 percent of the state, compared with 47 percent in 2000.
In Riverside County, for instance, Hispanics accounted for two-thirds of the population's increase, and in San Bernardino nearly 50 percent of the county is now Hispanic. Throughout the central inland part of the state, Hispanics now make up more than 40 percent of the population. Many were most likely attracted by the promise of more affordable housing -- the area is among the hardest hit in the foreclosure crisis.
California officials had overestimated the state's population by roughly 1.2 million, primarily because they expected more people to move in and fewer to move out, said John Malson, the state's acting chief demographer. But Mr. Malson saw little reason for gloom.
''For a state of our size to be increasing by 10 percent is a good thing,'' he said.
The shift to the Inland Empire has happened steadily over decades, as farmland and open fields have been replaced with expansive malls and housing tracts. Despite the housing collapse of recent years, there was no sign of a declining population.
''The trends have been in motion for some time,'' said Eric Avila, a professor of Chicano studies and urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''San Francisco and Los Angeles are not the only places that are urban centers anymore. Among the Latino population there are many more places that have become a destination for immigrants and migrants from other parts of the state.''
The ethnic and racial shifts were even more significant among children. The number of white children in California dropped by 21 percent in the last decade, with a similar decline in the number of black children. Over all, the state's population increase for children was half a percent, a factor in the more modest growth statewide.
Kenneth M. Johnson, a demographer at the University of New Hampshire, said this was the biggest drop in census data so far for a white-child population in any state.
''It underscores how dramatic the change in the racial and ethnic makeup will be,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''It's not well appreciated how fast this change is coming in young people. ''
Over all, California is becoming more stable, and the slower but steady growth will make it easier for state officials to plan and grapple with potentially crippling budgets, said Dowell Myers, a professor of urban planning and demography at the University of Southern California.
''I think immigrants may have gotten diverted to other states because of our housing prices,'' Mr. Myers said. ''And Texas has a better economy, so where would you move? The fact that there are no runaway massive changes here isn't a bad thing.''

HEADLINE: Hard Stance Seems Softer In E-Mail Of Governor

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- For weeks, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin has publicly held firm to his plan to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for most public workers, despite the protests of union supporters. But e-mail messages released Tuesday between representatives of Mr. Walker and some Senate Democrats who oppose the measure suggest that Mr. Walker has privately considered tempering at least some limited elements of those bargaining changes. 
Mr. Walker's initial proposal, which set off a firestorm of debate in Wisconsin and beyond, would allow collective bargaining on matters of wages only, limit raises to the Consumer Price Index, keep contracts to one year and require unions to vote annually to determine whether most workers still wish to be members.
The e-mails show that as recently as Sunday evening Mr. Walker's representatives appeared willing to agree to some changes.
Among them: removing the Consumer Price Index bargaining limit for wages, allowing bargaining over some economic issues like overtime (but only if both sides agreed to do so), permitting bargaining over workplace safety, and requiring votes on unions every three years. The e-mailswere released by Mr. Walker's office in response to public records requests after negotiations broke off between the Senate Democrats and Republicans who control Wisconsin's Legislature.
Some among the state's 14 Senate Democrats, who have been living in Illinois since last month when they fled to prevent a quorum, said Mr. Walker's proposed concessions were a start, but didn't go far enough.
''They were sort of bringing collective bargaining back from the grave,'' said Senator Bob Jauch, a Democrat who had been involved in some of the talks.
By Tuesday, though, any possible deal appeared far from reality, and talks appeared to have ended.
Mr. Walker and other Republican leaders, who want the Senate Democrats to return so a vote can occur and other state work can proceed in Madison, accused the Democrats of giving mixed messages about who was leading their talks and of suggesting publicly that no substantive negotiations had been under way in the first place.
The Democrats, meanwhile, complained that the Republicans had publicly discussed what they saw as private negotiations, and said they were not returning to Wisconsin, at least for now.

HEADLINE: High-Paying European Union Jobs Attract Eastern Officials

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- As prime minister of Latvia, Valdis Dombrovskis has one of the worst jobs in politics: cutting jobs and slashing salaries in an effort to strengthen his nation's depleted finances.
For his trouble he receives a pretax salary of about $45,000 a year, buys his own health insurance and lives in a three-room, Soviet-built apartment.
But while Mr. Dombrovskis earns less than many police officers walking beats in Western Europe, other Latvian officials do not do so badly. 
Take Andris Piebalgs, Latvia's member of the European Commission. He earns $345,000 a year, almost eight times as much as Mr. Dombrovskis. Egil Levits, Latvia's judge at the European Court of Justice, gets the same amount, which means he earns about $100,000 more than the chief justice of the United States Supreme Court. The benefits are not bad, either: a housing and living allowance, a stipend of about $6,000 annually per dependent child, around $10,000 a year for entertainment and a generous pension with no employee contribution.
Professional interests and talents aside, it's easy to see why there has been a white-collar gold rush from struggling Eastern European countries to employment with the European Union.
Since mid-2004, when the first of two sets of new, mainly ex-Communist, countries joined the bloc, more than 4,700 Eastern Europeans have come to work for the European Commission, the union's executive branch. From countries like Poland, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Estonia, they now represent around one-sixth of the commission's work force, easily exceeding a quota the commission set itself to integrate the new nations.
For example, nearly 150 Latvians work for the commission as administrators, earning at least 50 percent more than Mr. Dombrovskis. And 288 Romanians are on the entry-level rung of administrators -- more than the number of Germans, French and Britons combined.
While governments across the 27-nation bloc are mired in austerity measures, with several slashing civil service pay, Brussels salaries have remained immune. That has led to a familiar criticism that the union's officials are detached from the economic struggles that have befallen the Continent since the economic crisis began in 2008.
High salaries and the fact that officials got a small raise for this fiscal year are particular problems when Brussels is telling countries like Greece to cut spending and public sector jobs, said Jorge Nunez Ferrer, an associate research fellow at the Center for European Policy Studies, a research institute in Brussels.
''It is symbolic of their remoteness,'' he said. ''When they are monitoring other countries, telling them what to do about their budget deficits, that they should rein in spending, cut their public sectors and reduce salaries, my reaction is, what about your salaries?''
The European Union has always struggled with how much to pay members of Parliament, bureaucrats, judges and other employees. Peg the salaries to the economies or pay structure in a person's home country, and it means employees do the same work for extravagantly different compensation. Peg them to a Western European standard and you get what might be called the Dombrovskis effect.
According to Maros Sefcovic, the European Commission vice president responsible for administration and salaries, the pay is appropriate for international jobs, where top officials have to run households in two countries.
''The commission is definitely not higher-paying than the International Monetary Fund or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,'' he said, adding that the salaries are necessary to attract quality candidates.
The pay discrepancy is more noticeable in nations like Latvia, which thought joining the union would mean wages at home would rise to Western European levels. Now the financial crisis has pushed many countries in the opposite direction, forcing them to cut even the prime minister's pay. Latvia cut the post's compensation by 20 percent in 2009 and it has been frozen since then.
Mr. Dombrovskis, 39, who in 2009 gave up his seat in the European Parliament, where he would have been earning three times as much as he is now, seems philosophical. ''Everything is relative,'' he said of his salary. ''It's less than in the European Parliament or to compare with other prime ministers, but, to put this in a Latvian context, it's not so small.''
But he added, ''In nominal terms, I earn less now than in 2003 when I was finance minister.''
Normunds Popens, Latvia's representative to the European Union, takes a similar view. ''The financial crisis has brought pay cuts to many countries around the table, and not only new countries like Estonia, which cut first, and the Romanians,'' he said. ''Ireland cut salaries, as did Greece.''
Mr. Popens recently joined the commission as deputy director general for regional policy, a job whose pay is more than five times that of Mr. Dombrovskis. He says that while money is a factor in the move, the challenge of taking on a new job in a European institution is more important.
For his part, Mr. Dombrovskis says he has no prospect of a pay raise before next year at the earliest, but seems embarrassed when asked if he is paid enough.
''I'm not complaining, thank you,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Master Of a New Tijuana

BYLINE: By JOSH KUN

 BODY:
TIJUANA, Mexico
NO matter where you sit in Mision 19, it's impossible to forget where you are. The restaurant, perched on the second floor of a sleek office building, is a handsome study in concrete, wood and glass, wrapped in floor-to-ceiling windows. Tijuana confronts you from all sides.
''I am proud of being from Tijuana,'' said Javier Plascencia, the restaurant's chef and one of its owners, sitting behind a wall of wine bottles at his private chef's table. Nearby, waiters in dark coats and ties gracefully maneuvered among tables of women in suits and men with sweaters tied over their shoulders. Hints of cologne mixed with musky wafts of mesquite and charcoal.
''I want there to be no mistake,'' he continued. ''This is a Tijuana restaurant. This is what Tijuana can be.'' 
Mr. Plascencia is determined to use Mision 19, which he opened in the heart of this city's Zona Rio business district in January, to help revitalize not only Tijuana's food scene, but also the city itself. Scarred in recent years from waves of drug violence, Tijuana, just south of the United States border, has gone from being one of Mexico's most visited cities to one of its most feared, a significant blow to an economy that depends on tourism.
The kidnappings and killings that scared away visitors also encouraged many well-heeled Tijuana locals to flee north. For a time, Mr. Plascencia, 43, was one of them. In 2006, his family opened Romesco in Bonita, Calif., in part to give the community of Tijuana exiles living there a taste of home.
''In the '90s, we all knew who the drug dealers were,'' he said. ''They came to our restaurants, we cooked at their baptism parties, but they didn't mess with anyone. They respected who we were. But then that started to change, and you didn't know who people were and how they would react. Suddenly there were no rules anymore.''
There was even a period when he took a bodyguard with him to work after his brother was threatened by kidnappers, he said.
Rafa Saavedra, a local writer and cultural critic, said that while ''the general perception of Tijuana is that it's a violent and dangerous city,'' he believes that the city is undergoing a ''new creative boom'' led by young entrepreneurs like Mr. Plascencia.
''They are not just looking to make money,'' Mr. Saavedra said. ''They are looking to invest in the future of the city and its people.''
As a culinary destination, Tijuana is perhaps best known for its street food, especially mariscos, birria and tacos of all stripes. But it also has a long tradition of fine dining, and Mr. Plascencia's family has been at the center of it for nearly three decades. Their Grupo Plascencia consortium, headed by his father, Juan Jose Plascencia, is now responsible for 10 restaurants scattered across Tijuana, including Casa Plascencia, a Spanish-themed meat emporium, and Villa Saverios, the Roman-columned marble flagship. Situated in the heart of Tijuana's Zona Gastronomica, or restaurant row, Villa Saverios is the go-to venue for birthdays and wedding showers among Tijuana's middle and upper classes.
''Their restaurants have been so important for the region for so long,'' said Tru Miller, an owner of the Adobe Guadalupe winery in the nearby Guadalupe Valley. ''Javier has the ability to bring Baja cuisine to an international audience in ways that nobody has really done before.''
Mr. Plascencia, who was born and raised in Tijuana but attended high school and culinary school in San Diego, refers to his cooking as Baja Mediterranean: traditional Mexican cuisine combined with ingredients and flavors that flourish in Baja California's coastal Mediterranean-like climate, including olive oil, abalone and arugula. It's a style espoused by other Tijuana chefs, like Miguel Angel Guerrero, of La Querencia; Jair Tellez, at Laja; and Martin San Roman, of Rincon San Roman. But Mr. Plascencia brings a flair for dramatic presentation, an appreciation for Tijuana street food's deep flavors and a binational approach to farm-to-table cooking.
At Mision 19, everything he cooks and all the wine he serves come from within a 120-mile radius, which means not only Tijuana markets and local Baja farms and vineyards in the Guadalupe Valley, but also farmer's markets in San Diego.
''When you say local in Tijuana, you are talking about Tecate, Ensenada, Rosarito and parts of San Diego,'' he said. ''It's a very big local.''
The menu is loaded with showstoppers. There's the duck skewered with licorice and sprinkled with guava dust. There's the risotto topped with salt-cured nopalitos (prickly pear cactus) and charred octopus. Or there's the dish that's already something of a signature: slow-cooked short ribs bathed in a mission fig syrup on top of a black mole sauce. After he cooked it at the Test Kitchen, a Los Angeles restaurant with a rotating cast of guest chefs, Jonathan Gold, a food critic for LA Weekly, named it one of his top 10 dishes of 2010.
Bill Esparza, who runs the Los Angeles food blog Street Gourmet LA and frequently invites local foodies down to Tijuana for tastings with Mr. Plascencia, praised the chef. ''There is nobody like him in Mexican cooking right now,'' he said. ''He travels throughout Mexico, to L.A., to San Francisco, looking to learn and be inspired. He watches everything that's going on in the food world, and he's like this incredible sponge. He's creating a whole new vocabulary of Baja cooking.''
The Plascencia food empire had a humble start. In 1969, Mr. Plascencia's father quit his job in a Tijuana factory to open Giuseppi's, a small pizzeria. He stored the pizza boxes, cheese and cans of tomato sauce based on his mother's recipe in the family garage. There were soon 13 pizzerias across the city. The Giuseppi's name lives on in a handful of full-scale Italian restaurants, Tijuana institutions since the 1980s.
''I compare my father to Sirio Maccioni of Le Cirque,'' said Mr. Plascencia, who grew up washing dishes at Giuseppi's on weekends and learning the details of customer service from his father. ''He is always at the door. He knows all of his clients by name.''
Three years ago, the family bought Caesar's, the classic tourist mecca and watering hole for visiting Hollywood stars that opened its doors in the 1920s. Best remembered for its claim to being the birthplace of the Caesar salad, the restaurant holds particular significance for Mr. Plascencia because his grandfather worked there as a bartender.
After a painstaking renovation, Caesar's -- with its elaborate tableside preparations of the famous salad, its walls covered with vintage photographs and menus and its original bar meticulously restored -- is now an elegant trip back to Tijuana's past.
''Tijuana is not very good at preserving its history,'' Mr. Plascencia said. ''Ceasar's is so important to the story of this city. When we heard it was for sale, there was no way we were going to let that legacy be lost.''
Caesar's, Mision 19 and other high-end restaurants here rely on the city's wealthy elite and a small cadre of middle-class bohemians who can afford $25 main courses. They have also come to depend on two classes of tourist far removed from the party-seeking Marines and college students from north of the border who were once a key source of the city's income.
The first group could be called medical tourists, Americans who go to Tijuana for cancer treatments, dental work or plastic surgery. Then there are the maquiladora tourists, executives from the thousands of internationally owned factories, or maquiladoras. ''They might be from Japan or Korea and are here to work on a project or open a new plant,'' Mr. Plascencia said. ''They are not coming to get drunk at a bar. They are looking for a nice meal.''
He insists that things in Tijuana are getting better. According to recent news reports, officials in the state of Baja California estimate that, over the last two years, crime in the region has dropped nearly 40 percent. Most agree that the city is safer and calmer now than in 2008, when the death toll reached an all-time high. Many locals who once fled the city are now moving back. In the downtown tourist zone, there are new trendy bars, diners and fashion boutiques, along with a bilingual tourist police unit designed to make visiting Americans feel more comfortable.
Last week, Tijuana's mayor joined the mayors of four other Baja cities in announcing a new pro-tourism initiative. A large mural on busy Calle Sexta reads, ''In spite of everything, Tijuana is moving forward.''
To reassure customers from the States, Mr. Plascencia often calls with personal invitations. For big food events or tastings, he's driven people across the border himself, all part of his mission to use his restaurants to both sustain and reimagine the city that he loves.
Last fall, hundreds of people, including Al Gore and Jimmy Wales, a founder of Wikipedia, arrived for Tijuana Innovadora, a $5 million two-week conference designed to showcase Tijuana as a center of finance, arts, ideas and innovation. Mr. Plascencia cooked for many of the conference's events, including a dinner for Mexico's president, Felipe Calderon, who began the event with a speech praising Tijuana's improved security.
The attempted makeover came with a brutal reality check. In the middle of the conference, two decapitated bodies were found hanging from a local bridge.
''It was a reminder of the challenges we face here,'' Mr. Plascencia said. ''But I am not worried. Things will get better, and I will be right here cooking.''

HEADLINE: Making Every Oil Calorie Count

BYLINE: By AMANDA LITTLE. 
Amanda Little is the author of ''Power Trip: The Story of America's Love Affair With Energy.''

 BODY:
Nashville
AS turmoil in Libya pushes up the price of oil, American consumers are once again feeling the sting of $3.50-a-gallon gasoline. But the impact of costly crude on our lives and economy extends far beyond the pump. Virtually everything we consume -- from hamburgers, running shoes and chemotherapy to Facebook, Lady Gaga MP3s and ''60 Minutes'' -- is produced from or powered by fossil fuels and their byproducts, all of which could grow more costly as the price of petroleum rises.
The problem is that there is no easy way to quantify how much total energy we consume. Fortunately, there's a great model already in widespread use: the nutritional information that appears on the back of every food product. Why not create the same sort of system for energy? 
Americans use more oil than people in any other developed country, about twice as much per capita, on average, as Britons. Indeed, our appetite for petroleum, like our fondness of fast foods, has spawned a kind of obesity epidemic, but one without conspicuous symptoms like high blood pressure and diabetes. And because we don't see how much energy goes into the products and services we purchase, we're shielded from knowing the full extent of our personal energy demands -- and unprepared when rising fuel prices increase the cost of everything else.
This illusion stems, in part, from a measurement problem: while we expect and understand labels on our food products that quantify caloric, fat and nutrient content, we have no clear way of measuring the amount of energy it takes to make our products and propel our daily activities.
There's no reason we can't have energy labels, too. For example, in Europe, Tesco, a supermarket chain, has begun a ''carbon labeling'' program for some 500 products, which displays the amount of energy consumed and greenhouse gases generated from their production, transportation and use.
We could do the same thing here, with labels providing a product or service's ''daily energy calories.'' Along with physical labels, imagine a smartphone app -- we'll call it ''Decal'' for short -- that would scan a product's bar code and report how much energy it took to produce that item.
Like the nutritional data on the backs of food products, Decal would give consumers a user-friendly, universal measure that they could use to compare products or count their daily energy intake. For example, the app would enable an energy dieter to scan two otherwise identical loaves of bread and see which one required less energy to produce.
Decal would have applications beyond the grocery-store shelf. By synchronizing with onboard computers in cars, buses and trains, it could tell you how much energy you use during daily errands and commutes. It would sync to a smart energy meter in your home to evaluate how much power you're using and which appliances are the biggest guzzlers.
And at the end of the day, the app would generate your total energy diet: a Decal ''score'' that would quantify how many total energy calories you've consumed.
Once Decal took hold, the Department of Energy could recommend daily energy allowances, in the same way the Department of Agriculture recommends daily intakes of different nutrients. Experts could offer ''diet'' plans for energy-efficient lifestyles, and the Internal Revenue Service could offer tax rebates to families that achieve certain energy-calorie reductions.
True, not all Americans would adjust their energy intake. But many would, and we could expect producers to take up the program rapidly in response. After all, researchers have found that after food manufacturers were required in 2007 to state on their labels the amount of trans fat and saturated fat in their products, 95 percent of supermarket foods were reformulated with healthier fats. The effect would go beyond foods, too: by creating demand out of public awareness, Decal could help propel investment in energy-efficient innovations and industries.
Millions of Americans say they want the country to become more energy-efficient, but they're wary of government-enforced rationing. Decal would avoid such overreach by giving consumers the information to change things themselves.
What America needs isn't more cheap oil to feed a gluttonous economy, but rather better ways to use less. Any other path is the equivalent of ignoring our high cholesterol numbers and attributing our corpulence to a broken bathroom scale.

HEADLINE: New York Office Renovations in Downturn Pay Off

BYLINE: By JOTHAM SEDERSTROM

 BODY:
It was the looming threat of a lease expiration that would open up 200,000 square feet of space occupied by UBS and other tenants that persuaded the owners of 535 Madison Avenue to invest in the building's first major upgrades in more than two decades. That the wager, at a cost of more than $5 million, was made in 2009 at the depths of the market only made it riskier.
But with lobby, elevator and electrical renovations now complete at the 37-story office tower, the building's owners say the bet is already paying off. Since last year, more than half of the 200,000 square feet UBS vacated has been leased, with much of the common space spruced up just as the Manhattan office leasing market begins to show signs of improvement. 
''We're absolutely ecstatic with the way tenants have responded to it,'' said Alfred Bradshaw, the executive vice president of the Park Tower Group, which owns and manages the building at Madison and 54th Street. ''The response, both from the tenants and the prospective tenants and all the people in the real estate industry, has really been universally positive.'' The Park Tower Group and the few other landlords who sank substantial sums into renovations during the economic downturn are now beginning to see results in the form of higher rents and a renewed interest from tenants, the owners said. (Park Tower is asking $75 to $125 per square foot.)
As rents fell across the city in the downturn, some owners who were unwilling or unable to invest in new construction focused instead on refurbishing their properties. Among the buildings renovated from 2007 through 2009 were 535 Madison Avenue, 545 Madison Avenue, the boutique office building 681 Fifth Avenue and the Empire State Building.
''Think about the foresight it took for some of these guys to say, 'Now is the time to go in and fix this because when we come out of this we want to be the best positioned as the go-to product,' '' said Jonathan Serko, a vice chairman of Cushman & Wakefield who advised the owners of 1385 Broadway on renovations that began in late 2008. ''And obviously, for the ones who stuck with the strategy, it's all worked out according to plan.''
With 1385 Broadway, an office tower near Times Square at West 38th Street, the plans to renovate began very soon after B Brothers Broadway Realty, an affiliate of Bloomingdale Properties, acquired the building.
With an investment of $55 million, the group revamped the lobby and entrances, replaced the windows and upgraded the elevators. Since 2009, the structure, which had been home to tenants tied to the wedding industry, has attracted more diverse businesses, including the apparel company Paris Accessories and the New York State Health Foundation. About 40 tenants have signed leases totaling 300,000 square feet of the 500,000-square-feet building.
''It was a good plan to go in and be aggressive,'' Mr. Serko said, adding that new tenants included law firms, nonprofit organizations and financial services companies. ''The better product is going to get the tenants,'' he said. ''It's because the owners were responsive that we landed as many tenants as we did compared to our competition.'' He said rents had been increased by as much as 40 percent.
When Metropole Realty Advisors bought 681 Fifth Avenue in 2005, the company's chief executive, Robert Siegel, intended to redo the infrastructure of the 99-year-old building. But by the time Metropole bought out all 10 tenants and prepared to renovate, the economy was on the brink of collapse, Mr. Siegel said.
''Having lived a number of cycles, we were already feeling nervous about where the market was heading,'' he said. ''We started working on refinancing in January of 2008, and our new lender came in August of 2008, and we know what happened to Lehman Brothers that September.''
The building has been retrofitted with Sheetrock ceilings, a pair of cooling towers for customized air-conditioning and other modern amenities, and average rents have increased by 15 percent, ranging from $70 a square foot to more than $100 a square foot for the penthouse floors, he said.
''Naturally, it was scary in the sense that I didn't perceive us really getting any immediate return on our money,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''But my confidence came from my philosophy that it's all about the long term.'' He said space at the building, which has been a favorite of the fashion industry, was leased in January to an asset manager and another financial services tenant.
Among the collection of prewar trophy assets in Malkin Holdings' W&H Properties portfolio, five were renovated during the downturn, including the Empire State Building.
The timing of those projects had less to do with the recession and more to do with lengthy litigation against an investment partner, Helmsley-Spear, from which the company eventually wrestled full control of management, leasing and operational duties at 10 jointly owned properties in New York, said Anthony E. Malkin, the president of Malkin Holdings.
By the time many of those buildings were handed over to Malkin Holdings and ready for overhauls it was 2007, Mr. Malkin said. Despite the downturn, the company proceeded with a strategy to reposition those assets much as it had done years earlier with buildings it owned in Long Island.
At the Empire State Building, the task of renovating a 2.85 million-square-foot structure rooted in the Art Deco age was not easy, Mr. Malkin said.
The cost of the work exceeded $550 million, and among the most crucial projects were replacing elevators, adding new bathrooms and windows, and restoring the lobby, where the painted celestial ceiling had long been obscured by unappealing lighting gels and other modern adjustments. The tourist-pleasing observatory underwent renovations so that visitors now enter through separate doors and pass through a streamlined ticketing process.
A result of that $30 million repositioning, said Mr. Malkin, was a banner 2010 in which more than four million visitors passed through the doors.
The company also invested, on average, $180 per square foot to renovate 1333 Broadway, replacing and adding passenger elevators and bathrooms and refurbishing what Mr. Malkin called a ''historically relevant'' lobby. The building also goes by 3 Herald Square.
As a result, rents are twice what they were when the firm took control of the building and the building is 97 percent leased, up from just 60 percent in 2007, he said.
''We weren't going to be successful if we didn't do this work, and we knew that it would yield results,'' Mr. Malkin said. ''And we knew that if we couldn't be successful in New York City'' with this kind of investment, then, ''honestly, we weren't going to be successful anywhere.''

HEADLINE: British Television Opens a Door for Product Placement in Shows

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- As Phil Vickery, a British television chef, prepared cottage pie last week, viewers got a taste of the future of television in Britain -- a future that arrived long ago in the United States and many other countries.
It was not easy to spot, but there on a shelf behind Mr. Vickery was a coffee maker, the kind that spits out espresso or cappuccino from individual portions of grounds. In this case, the machine was not actually doing anything other than earning a reported $:100,000, or about $163,000, for ITV, the British network that aired ''This Morning,'' the show on which Mr. Vickery demonstrated his recipe. But it was still a groundbreaking moment: the first paid product placement on British television. 
This form of marketing, in which brand owners pay television producers to place their products on the set or, sometimes, to insert them into the script of a program, is widespread in the United States, where judges on television talent contests, for example, slurp from oversize cups with the logos of soft drinks prominently displayed.
Until recently, however, product placement was banned in Britain, where the advertising-free, publicly financed British Broadcasting Corp. is held out as a standard for editorial purity in television. While the BBC shares the television dial with ad-financed broadcasters like ITV, these channels also labor under regulations limiting the spread of commercialism.
''Television is taken with a fair degree of seriousness in Britain,'' said Toby Syfret, who follows the TV business at Enders Analysis in London. ''Anything that could affect editorial integrity is considered very carefully.''
Commercial television companies like ITV lobbied long and hard to overturn the ban, arguing that it was outdated at a time when viewers can use digital video recorders to fast-forward through traditional ad breaks.
New European Union rules that went into effect in 2007 for the first time specifically authorized product placement, which had already been practiced in E.U. countries, like Spain, Italy and Austria, under liberal interpretations of previous laws. As the global economic and financial crisis took its toll on traditional advertising, most other E.U. members quickly legalized product placement. Britain was more reluctant but finally followed suit, permitting product placement as of last week.
''The view from broadcasters was not necessarily that it was going to provide an immediate injection of cash,'' said Ross Biggam, director general of the Association of Commercial Television in Europe, a lobbying group based in Brussels. ''It was more about having the flexibility to respond to changes in the marketplace.''
Indeed, estimates of spending on product placement in Britain, and across Europe, are modest compared with figures from the United States. PQ Media, a research firm, said the United States accounted for $3.6 billion of a global total of $6.3 billion in spending on product placement in television, films and other media in 2009.
On British television, the firm forecasts that such outlays will reach little more than $50 million by 2014. ITV said the product placement on ''This Morning'' was the only one scheduled for last week.
One reason for the low expectations is the strictness of regulations governing the practice in Britain. Some big advertisers, including alcohol and junk-food brands, are not permitted to engage in the practice. News shows, children's programming and some other kinds of broadcasts are not allowed to accept any product placements. The BBC, which operates the most-watched channel in Britain, remains off limits, too.
''Some of the brands are going, 'Yeah, so?' because the BBC is where they'd really like to be,'' said Leo Kivijarv, vice president for research at PQ Media.
To be sure, even BBC shows contain some product placements -- the unpaid kind that occur when program producers include branded items on sets to make shows more realistic. Agencies specialize in inserting products into shows in this way. Even if no money changes hands between the marketer and the producer, popular props in British dramas, like Apple laptops or iPhones, are not necessarily there by accident.
Some product placements have also found their way into British living rooms via a back door, as British channels import programming from the United States and other countries.
Even under the new rules, British producers are not allowed to give ''undue prominence'' to products that help pay the rent, nor are they allowed to weave them into plot lines in an obvious way. In other words, it seems unlikely that Mr. Vickery, during future cooking segments of ''This Morning,'' will suddenly decide he is a barista and fire up the Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee maker that Nestle paid to place on the set.
''The editorial integrity of our programming remains ITV's priority, and any introduction of product placement will strictly adhere to Ofcom rules,'' the broadcaster said, referring to the British media regulator.
One of those rules is that product placements must be disclosed to viewers, something that is not required in the United States. In Britain, channels must display a small ''P'' in the corner of the screen at the start and end of shows containing product placements, as well as after the advertising breaks.
Some British media monitoring groups say this is not enough. The ''P'' is easy to overlook and does not make it clear which products are there because of commercial arrangements, said Vivienne Pattison, director of Mediawatch-UK, an organization that campaigned against the legalization of product placement.
''If you watch an '18' film, you know the kinds of things you're going to see,'' she said, referring to the British designation for adults-only movies. ''It should be the same if they are trying to sell to you. What we saw on 'This Morning' probably isn't going to hurt anyone, but we're concerned about where it could go.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Wealthy Suburb Cuts Corners To Keep a Lid on School Taxes

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
BRONXVILLE, N.Y. -- This wealthy New York suburb prides itself on its public schools. Class sizes are small. Students can choose from an array of subjects not offered everywhere. Teacher pay ranks among the nation's highest. And voters long approved high real estate taxes to pay for it all.
But even here -- as in other affluent enclaves -- corners are being cut, bringing home the wrenching debate that has caused turmoil in so many other communities. What some really fear is that the cuts will continue. ''You hear people say they want Mandarin taught in the sixth grade or they want smaller class size or some other enhancement,'' said Julie Meade, president of the Parent Teacher Association and mother of two school-age children. ''But they don't talk about raising taxes to pay for what they advocate. I haven't heard anyone say raise taxes to pay for quality.'' 
Ms. Meade and others in her P.T.A. are beginning to suggest that austerity may be going too far, particularly in the matter of class size, which has crept up in kindergarten through fifth grade to an average of 22 from 19.9 in 2006-7, the last full school year before the recession. While 22 is hardly overcrowding by the standards of most American school districts, it does push the envelope in the wealthiest suburbs.
The traditional solution -- add a class, hire another teacher, increase the tax levy to cover the cost -- is frowned on these days. Keeping a lid on property taxes has become an overriding goal, even in plush suburbs like this one.
Responding to that pressure and also to the desire of the P.T.A. to hold down class size, Bronxville's school superintendent, David Quattrone, is proposing to add two teachers in the fall, enough to reduce class size to 20, and to raise property taxes, a little, to pay for it.
Listening to the superintendent present his proposal at a public hearing, Ms. Meade wondered whether raising taxes, even slightly, would fly with voters, particularly with both political parties embracing deficit reduction for the country as a whole, and Republican majorities in Wisconsin and some other states demanding givebacks from public employees.
Across the country, elected officials in privileged communities are caught between a fervor to hold down taxes and a fervor to maintain good schools, well-paved streets, an ample police force, generous library hours and other premium public services that set a community like Bronxville apart. These officials have by and large decided to cut costs as unobtrusively as possible.
The main cuts have been in personnel -- school staff, police officers, public works employees, city hall workers, librarians -- a total of 35 in Bronxville. The cuts are mostly through attrition, although sometimes there are layoffs. And rarely, in affluent towns, are so many employees cut that the reduction shows up in fewer garbage collections (twice a week is the standard), or in slower response time to 911 calls or a delay in snow clearing.
Most family incomes in Bronxville, about 15 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, are in the six and seven figures, ranking the village among the wealthiest enclaves in America. But even an additional $100 to $200 tacked on, in a village where the typical homeowner already pays $43,000 in annual property taxes, has met enough resistance to make town officials think twice.
Some residents argue that the town should be more businesslike, cutting other costs to offset the outlay for smaller classes. Peter P. Pulkkinen is one. A 40-year-old investment banker, he and his wife, Sarah, moved here in 2004 from the Upper East Side and their two oldest children are now in the first and third grades. He wants small classes for them. But rather than raise taxes, he would restrict teacher compensation-- particularly their benefits.
Displaying a sheaf of charts and projections that he and a friend prepared for a school board meeting, Mr. Pulkkinen said in an interview that if property taxes continued to rise in Bronxville at roughly the trajectory of the last decade, they would double by 2020 -- and by 46 percent in the unlikely event the ''austerity budgets'' of the last two years continued through the decade. ''I think it is a false paradigm to have to choose between radically diminished services or exponentially higher taxes,'' he said, ''without first addressing the structural issue of teacher compensation.''
So far, he argued, Dr. Quattrone and the school board have not done so. Instead, they have chosen ''soft targets.'' One hour a week of Spanish instruction to grade-school students, for example, was eliminated last year. Mr. Pulkkinen instead would attack ''structural'' expenses like tenure, the accumulation of unused sick days and the rising amount the school board pays for pensions and health insurance.
The cost of health insurance and pensions for teachers and other school employees is $6 million, or nearly 14 percent of the $43 million budget, up from $2.1 million in 2000-1, or 9 percent of that budget. The pension portion alone -- a mandatory payment to the New York State pension fund -- is projected to be $3 million in the coming school year, or 7 percent of the proposed school budget. Teachers and other village employees, nearly all of them unionized, pay only a small amount of this cost. Property tax revenue covers almost the entire outlay, and this at a moment when the pension will have risen by nearly 25 percent in the three years through June, according to the superintendent's office.
That increase -- and the prospect of bigger ones to come -- played a role in the school board's decision to lay off all 17 custodians last year. Janitorial services were outsourced, eliminating the future pension cost burden.
''We would be abdicating our responsibility,'' Mr. Pulkkinen said, approving of the decision to outsource janitorial services, ''if we failed to leave behind a stable, solvent and sustainable framework for the future.''
Rising Taxes
The $43,000 property tax levied by the village on a typical Bronxville home is up 34 percent in the last five years, although the increase was negligible in the last two years as the mayor, the village trustees and school board members responded to their constituents' concerns.
''I don't think we have seen an antitax uprising, but holding down property taxes is certainly spoken about a lot,'' said Dr. James D. Hudson, the 54-year-old school board president, a dentist with two children in the high school. He is often buttonholed on the subject, he said, at cocktail and dinner parties or while shopping.
''Their concern is that their taxes will continue to spiral up if we continue to do business as usual,'' said Dr. Hudson. ''If you will, we are looking to develop a lean, mean education machine.''
Lean and mean were rarely invoked in the past as a goal for the wealthiest suburbs. Now that talk is commonplace. In Bronxville, 86 percent of the typical $43,000 property tax levied by the village goes to the school system, particularly to educate the growing grade school population. For the parents of these children -- moving here in many cases from New York City -- $43,000 is less than they would spend to put two or three children in a private school.
Adding to the pressure, younger couples, including the Pulkkinens, are buying their homes from empty-nesters, who often sell to escape the rising tax burden. Mary C. Marvin, the mayor, says this exodus is accelerating.
In a village covering one square mile, with a static population of 6,400 people, the elderly once constituted nearly 20 percent, but that proportion is steadily dropping. Most important, these empty-nesters paid substantial property taxes without swelling the school population.
''You want the taxes to be something these older people can pay,'' the mayor said, ''because when they sell, they sell to families with children, and the children cost more to educate than the taxes their parents pay.''
Rising Resistance
That reasoning resonates with David A. McBride, 75, who for 40 years has lived in a white colonial mansion with an imposing front entrance. He and his wife, Cheryne, a chorale singer, were high school sweethearts in western Oklahoma. As his career advanced -- he earned a Harvard M.B.A., rose to executive vice president at Dun & Bradstreet and is still involved in technology start-ups -- the McBrides gravitated to New York and Bronxville, where they raised their only child, David Alan McBride 2d. He is now an executive working in China, married and raising David Alan McBride 3d, who is 4.
The eldest McBride is a former village trustee, a former governor of the local hospital and an elder in the Reformed Church. All this holds the couple in Bronxville. But their property taxes of $50,000 a year just to the village, and $10,000 more to the broader township, concern them.
''The tax burden is significant enough,'' Mr. McBride said, ''that if it took a jump in the next couple of years, I would probably feel forced to move.''
He doesn't fault Mayor Marvin or Dr. Quattrone who, in his view, have managed costs well. Instead, like Mr. Pulkkinen, Mr. McBride directs his ire at teacher compensation and at the teachers' union, the Bronxville Teachers' Association.
Until the teachers agreed to a partial wage freeze for the current school year, their pay had been rising at 3 to 3.5 percent a year. A typical teacher with a master's degree and 30 years of service makes nearly $118,000 today. That teacher is entitled to retire with an $80,000 state pension, or 67.5 percent of his or her final salary.
''My income in retirement is pretty fixed,'' Mr. McBride said, ''and there comes a time when you have to say, 'Whoa, whoa.' '' Mr. McBride, who describes himself as ''antispend, not antitax,'' is reluctant to support the superintendent's proposal to add two elementary school teachers without offsetting the cost.
''We outsourced the custodians last year and the teachers initially rebelled; that to me was inexcusable,'' he said. ''In private industry it could not have happened. When the boss says, 'I have to have X amount of savings out of your division,' you don't say no.''
Rising Wages
Ms. Meade and her P.T.A. were reluctant at first to support the decision to jettison the custodians. ''Our concern as parents was the well-being of our children,'' she said. ''But if the board didn't outsource the custodians, where would they have found comparable savings in the budget? It would have meant a lot of program reductions. My own concern was that lab time would have been cut. My daughter is taking physics, and lab time is important to me.''
Her husband earns a salary in the low- to mid-six figures, and she was earning that much as a senior vice president at GE Capital until she was let go in 2008. By then, they had moved from a seven-bedroom home to a smaller house, also in Bronxville, partly to simplify their lives, and Ms. Meade, now 48, soon landed a job as administrator of a nonprofit organization, the Cancer Support Team, at a lower five-figure salary.
''You are looking at a community of people who saw their property taxes go up for years, and now their incomes aren't going up,'' she said. ''The board is trying to budget with this in mind while still fielding a 'sustainable model of excellence.' I believe that is the phrase they use.''
Listening to Dr. Quattrone make his budget proposal, she was inclined to go along with his plan to add the two grade-school teachers and preserve or bring back other enhancements, but the tax levy for the 2011-12 school year would then rise 3.29 percent. The superintendent offered three lower-cost alternatives, with the least expensive requiring a nearly 1 percent property tax increase.
''The key is teacher wages,'' Dr. Quattrone said. ''We can sustain our school programs if raises for the teachers come in at 2 percent a year. If the average settlement is higher, that will force cutbacks.''
The 150 teachers are working without a contract. Negotiations to replace the old contract, which expired last June, are at an impasse. The board offered annual wage increases of less than 2 percent. Rather than lock in such a small increase, the teachers agreed to work through the current school year at the existing wage structure.
''The resistance to tax increases is showing up in our labor negotiations,'' said David Katz, a social studies teacher and the president of the Bronxville Teachers' Association. ''Everyone is caught in this squeeze.''

HEADLINE: Flirting With A Repeat

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com; twitter.com/DLeonhardt

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
It's a strange moment for the economy. Just when it is picking up speed, the risks of another slowdown are also increasing.
On the positive side, exports and consumer spending are up, and the job market finally seems to be improving. If anything, last week's jobs report probably undercounted recent gains. That often happens early in an economic recovery because the Labor Department has a hard time keeping track of newly started businesses.
On the negative side, oil prices have risen more than 40 percent since September, and every level of government is considering spending cuts and layoffs. 
All in all, the situation is uncomfortably reminiscent of last spring. Back then, companies were just starting to hire again, before a combination of events -- including Europe's debt crisis and the fading of the stimulus program here -- spooked them and cut short the recovery. It's easy to imagine how energy costs and government cuts could do the same this year.
But no branch of the federal government seems to be taking these risks seriously enough. At the Federal Reserve, some top officials still argue that the economy is at risk of overheating, even though they have been wrong on this point for months and still don't have much data on their side. These officials remain in the minority, but they can make it harder for Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, to take action if the economy does weaken again.
The Obama administration, for its part, seems confident a true recovery is under way -- much as it was confident a year ago, to its detriment. And Congressional Republicans are eager to cut federal spending as quickly as possible even if the cuts mean the layoff of government workers. ''So be it,'' as John Boehner, the House speaker, said last month.
I understand that Republican leaders honestly believe that spending cuts will help the private sector recover. Over the long term, they're right that much of government needs to become more efficient. I'd just implore them to look at the evidence about the short-term effect of cuts.
Interest rates on corporate borrowing remain historically low, so there is no reason to think today's government borrowing is making it harder for companies to borrow. The countries that have tried austerity (England and Germany) are struggling, while the leaders of the country that enacted the most aggressive postcrisis stimulus (China) talk proudly of its success.
Perhapsmostpersuasively, the people who get paid to make economic predictions say that federal cutbacks would harm the economy this year and next. The research firm Macroeconomic Advisers estimates that the House Republicans' budget would raise the unemployment rate by 0.3 percentage points -- which means about 500,000 lost jobs -- by the end of next year. Economists on Wall Street, which isn't exactly thrilled with the Obama administration, have made similar forecasts.
Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, puts it this way: ''I wouldn't be cutting spending over the rest of the fiscal year, because the economy still needs support.''
If policy makers wanted to reduce the current risks, they could consider at least four steps.
First, the Fed could respond to any major new sign of weakness by suggesting that it was ready to extend its current bond-buying program beyond June. That program -- a second round of quantitative easing, known as QE2 -- has been at least moderately successful. It has brought down some interest rates and made investors more willing to lend to riskier corporate borrowers.
Critics of QE2 correctly say that it, along with rising oil and food prices, could set off a self-reinforcing cycle of rising wages and prices. But so far, there is nosign of those risks coming to pass.
The bigger potential problem, by far, is another short-circuited recovery. ''Certainly, Friday's jobs report was encouraging,'' Dennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed, said on Monday. ''But, in my opinion, it is premature to declare a jobs recovery firmly established.'' The events in the Mideast and North Africa, he added, have increased the economic risks.
The second step would be for the White House: developing a plan to open the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if oil prices don't fall soon.
It's too soon to open the reserve now, because energy analysts expect the conflict in Libya to have a fleeting effect on prices. If they're wrong, though, the reserve would be able to help bring down the cost of oil for several weeks or months, which could be crucial to consumer spending. The whole point of the reserve is to help cope with temporary supply problems.
Third, the Obama administration could do more to reduce home foreclosures. Previous attempts have had their problems, but officials do seem willing to learn from experience. On Monday, the Justice Department held a conference on how federal and state regulators could nudge lenders and homeowners into mediation, which has the potential to reduce foreclosures. Programs in Florida and Philadelphia have already had some success doing so, notes Sarah Rosen Wartell of the Center for American Progress.
Finally, the administration could make clear that it is willing to play hardball on cuts to this year's budget. Thus far, Republicans have had most of the passion, with new members of Congress saying they're willing to risk a government shutdown to stay true to Tea Party principles.
But the White House has just as much reason to hang tough. If the economy weakens again this year, it will dominate the 2012 campaign -- and not in ways that will help President Obama or Congressional Democrats.
Think back to late last year, when Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders agreed to a tax cut package that caused economists to upgrade their recovery forecasts. Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics raised his forecast for 2011 economic growth by 0.9 percent, which translated into roughly 900,000 additional jobs. Unfortunately, he has since cut that projected increase almost in half, thanks to oil prices and specter of bigger-than-expected government cutbacks.
The long history of financial crises shows that they do enormous damage. An economy typically does not even begin to recover for several years. Our economy has made enough progress that recovery still looks like the most likely outcome this year. But until the recovery is all but undeniable, we should assume that it is in doubt.

HEADLINE: Vicious Assault Shakes Texas Town

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.; Mauricio Guerrero contributed reporting from Houston.

 BODY:
CLEVELAND, Tex. -- The police investigation began shortly after Thanksgiving, when an elementary school student alerted a teacher to a lurid cellphone video that included one of her classmates.
The video led the police to an abandoned trailer, more evidence and, eventually, to a roundup over the last month of 18 young men and teenage boys on charges of participating in the gang rape of an 11-year-old girl in the abandoned trailer home, the authorities said.
Five suspects are students at Cleveland High School, including two members of the basketball team. Another is the 21-year-old son of a school board member. A few of the others have criminal records, from selling drugs to robbery and, in one case, manslaughter. The suspects range in age from middle schoolers to a 27-year-old. 
The case has rocked this East Texas community to its core and left many residents in the working-class neighborhood where the attack took place with unanswered questions. Among them is, if the allegations are proved, how could their young men have been drawn into such an act?
''It's just destroyed our community,'' said Sheila Harrison, 48, a hospital worker who says she knows several of the defendants. ''These boys have to live with this the rest of their lives.''
The attack's details remained unclear. The police have declined to discuss their inquiry because it is continuing. The whereabouts of the victim and her mother were not made public.
The allegations first came to light just after Thanksgiving, when a child who knows the victim told a teacher she had seen a videotape of the attack on a cellphone, said Stacey Gatlin, a spokeswoman for the Cleveland Independent School District.
The school district's security department interviewed the girl, 11, who is a student at Cleveland Middle School, and her mother. The security department determined that a rape had taken place, but not on school property, and then handed the matter over to the police, Ms. Gatlin said.
On Dec. 9, the police obtained a search warrant to go through a house on Travis Street and a nearby trailer that had been abandoned for at least two years. An affidavit filed to support the search warrant said the girl had been forced to have sex with several men in both places on Nov. 28 and cited pictures and videos as proof, according to The Houston Chronicle.
The affidavit said the assault started after a 19-year-old boy invited the victim to ride around in his car. He took her to a house on Travis Street where one of the other men charged, also 19, lived. There the girl was ordered to disrobe and was sexually assaulted by several boys in the bedroom and bathroom. She was told she would be beaten if she did not comply, the affidavit said.
A relative of one of the suspects arrived, and the group fled through a back window. They then went to the abandoned mobile home, where the assaults continued. Some of those present recorded the sexual acts on their telephones, and these later were shown among students.
Residents in the neighborhood where the abandoned trailer stands -- known as the Quarters -- said the victim had been visiting various friends there for months. They said she dressed older than her age, wearing makeup and fashions more appropriate to a woman in her 20s. She would hang out with teenage boys at a playground, some said.
''Where was her mother? What was her mother thinking?'' said Ms. Harrison, one of a handful of neighbors who would speak on the record. ''How can you have an 11-year-old child missing down in the Quarters?''
Cleveland, a town of 9,000, lies about 50 miles northeast of Houston in the pine country, near the picturesque Sam Houston National Forest. The town's economy has always rested on timber, cattle, farming and oil. But there are pockets of poverty, and in the neighborhood where the assault occurred, well-kept homes sit beside boarded-up houses and others with deteriorating facades.
The abandoned trailer where the assault took place is full of trash and has a blue tarp hanging from the front. Inside there is a filthy sofa, a disconnected stove in the middle of the living room, a broken stereo and some forlorn Christmas decorations. A copy of the search warrant was on a counter in the kitchen next to some abandoned family pictures.
The arrests have left many wondering who will be taken into custody next. Churches have held prayer services for the victim. The students who were arrested have not returned to school, and it is unclear if they ever will. Ms. Gatlin said the girl had been transferred to another district. ''It's devastating, and it's really tearing our community apart,'' she said. ''I really wish that this could end in a better light.''

HEADLINE: Rising Gas Cost Finds the Nation Better Prepared

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and NICK BUNKLEY; Reporting was contributed by Clifford Krauss, Christine Hauser, Catherine Rampell, Joe Callahan and Ann Farmer.

 BODY:
The increase in energy prices is beginning to resemble the rise in 2008. But this time, the American economy may be better prepared for higher fuel costs.
Gasoline prices have risen by nearly a third in the last year, and oil costs more than $100 a barrel for the first time in more than two years, driven by fears of extended Middle East supply disruptions and increased demand from an improving global economy.
While the latest surge in energy prices is likely to cause some pain and slow the recovery from the recession, economists say the spike is unlikely to derail the rebound unless prices rise a lot further.
One big reason is that consumers and businesses have learned lessons from the last oil shock. Many drivers, for example, have given up their gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. Automakers, which are selling more fuel-efficient cars than five years ago, reported higher sales in February even as gas prices rose. 
Industries like airlines and trucking, which are most severely affected by fuel prices, have passed on their higher costs almost immediately instead of waiting for the price increases to hammer profits.
And much of the rest of the United States economy is far less dependent on oil than it used to be. Oil consumption has dropped more than 5 percent since 2005, while natural gas use has risen 10 percent. A glut of domestic natural gas has kept prices low, providing a lift to industries like chemicals and pharmaceuticals and tempering the price of electricity, much of which is generated from natural gas.
Still, higher oil and gas prices matter. Daniel Yergin, the oil historian, said the recent increase ''forces people into really difficult choices.'' He said, ''It becomes a thermometer, a register of fear and anxiety.''
Nouriel Roubini, the New York University economist who became known for his pessimistic forecasts before the financial crisis, told reporters in Dubai on Tuesday that an increase in oil prices to $140 a barrel could even cause some advanced economies to dip back into recession.
The rising price of gas -- which averaged $3.57 a gallon nationwide on Monday, according to the government -- is already prompting some people to change their habits.
Ronnie Undeberg, 50, of Summerfield, Fla., started driving less in December, when gas hit $3 a gallon. ''I started planning my errands,'' he said. If gas reaches $4, Mr. Undeberg, a discipline clerk at Lake Weir Middle School, said he would scale back his cable television package and cut his cellphone use.
Higher fuel costs reduce consumers' discretionary income, which is often spent on such niceties as dining out or the latest electronic devices. Low- and middle-income families are typically hurt most by a higher price for energy because they spend a higher portion of their household budget on gas and heating bills.
It is unclear how long energy prices will stay high. Most oil exports from Libya have stopped amid the fighting there. But Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Ahmad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, said that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was discussing whether to hold an emergency meeting soon to increase oil production. Saudi Arabia has also said it would pump more oil to make up for the shortfall in Libyan exports. On Tuesday, oil prices fell slightly to settle at $105.02 a barrel in New York.
Some economists say that the increase in oil prices over the last year, well before the wave of protests in the Middle East and mostly caused by higher demand, may already have cost the United States economy hundreds of thousands of jobs. One rule of thumb is that each $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil knocks 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points off the growth rate of the economy.
''High oil prices always hurt our economy,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation. ''Sometimes they get masked from consumers, but you cannot hide their impact on the economy. What it is going to do is leave us with anemic and sporadic growth that to most Americans will still feel like a recession.''
But so far, consumers and businesses seem to have adapted to the higher prices much more quickly than in 2008, when gasoline reached an average of $4.11 a gallon and oil topped $145 a barrel. In part, that is because the last oil shock helped prompt a new focus on energy efficiency.
Take automobiles, for example. Congress got hundreds of thousands of the worst gas guzzlers off the road with the cash-for-clunkers program. And automakers changed their product mix to emphasize more small cars and fewer sport utility vehicles, reflecting consumer demand and tougher fuel-efficiency mandates from the government.
As a result, the industry is better prepared for high gas prices. Mike Jackson, the chief executive of AutoNation, the country's largest chain of dealerships, said half of the vehicles on his lots are now cars, up from 40 percent in 2008, and just 8 percent are sport utility vehicles, down from 15 percent three years ago.
Drivers like Tival Williams, 39, a self-employed fashion designer from the Ditmas Park area of Brooklyn, also learned from the last price spike. Mr. Williams dumped his large S.U.V. and now drives a thriftier Mazda CX-9 crossover. ''Then I was paying $100 a week'' for gas, he said. ''Now I'm paying $70 a week.''
Industry executives said higher gas prices are more likely to cause a shift toward smaller cars than to reduce sales overall. If the automakers are wrong, the financial pain will be less severe; after going through its bankruptcy, General Motors has been careful about ramping up production and now has just about two months of inventory at dealerships, down from more than four months in 2008.
Other sectors of the economy so far have weathered the storm. Michael P. Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers, said anecdotal information from shopping malls across the country ''is surprisingly strong.''
''It appears that the consumer is still spending,'' he said. But if oil prices stay above $100, ''it will erode confidence and discretionary purchasing power,'' he said.
The trucking industry may also be better prepared for an oil shock than it was in 2008. Not only have more companies adopted fuel surcharges, they have also tried to find ways to make their fleets more efficient. Some have begun giving drivers bonuses if they reach particular fuel efficiency targets, for example by driving slower.
Still, such measures can do only so much. ''At $3 a gallon, you start to get a little bit of heartburn,'' said Bob Costello, chief economist for the American Trucking Associations, an industry group. ''Anything over $4, and panic sets in, with companies wondering if they can survive.''

HEADLINE: Taking a Risk for Rare Earths

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
KUANTAN, Malaysia -- A colossal construction project here could help determine whether the world can break China's chokehold on the strategic metals crucial to products as diverse as Apple's iPhone, Toyota's Prius and Boeing's smart bombs.
As many as 2,500 construction workers will soon be racing to finish the world's largest refinery for so-called rare earth metals -- the first rare earth ore processing plant to be built outside China in nearly three decades.
For Malaysia and the world's most advanced technology companies, the plant is a gamble that the processing can be done safely enough to make the local environmental risks worth the promised global rewards.
Once little known outside chemistry circles, rare earth metals have become increasingly vital to high-tech manufacturing. But as Malaysia learned the hard way a few decades ago, refining rare earth ore usually leaves thousands of tons of low-level radioactive waste behind. 
So the world has largely left the dirty work to Chinese refineries -- processing factories that are barely regulated and in some cases illegally operated, and have created vast toxic waste sites.
But other countries' wariness has meant that China now mines and refines at least 95 percent of the global supply of rare earths. And Beijing has aroused international alarm by wielding that virtual monopoly as a global trade weapon.
Last September, for example, China imposed a two-month embargo on rare earth shipments to Japan during a territorial dispute, and for a short time even blocked some shipments to the United States and Europe. Beijing's behavior, which has also included lowering the export limit on its rare earths, has helped propel world prices of the material to record highs -- and sent industrial countries scrambling for alternatives.
Even now, though, countries with their own rare earth ore deposits are not always eager to play host to the refineries that process them. An American company, Molycorp, plans to reopen an abandoned mine near Death Valley in California; but Molycorp must completely rebuild the adjacent refinery to address environmental concerns.
All of this helps explain why a giant Australian mining company, Lynas, is hurrying to finish a $230 million rare earth refinery here, on the northern outskirts of Malaysia's industrial port of Kuantan. The plant will refine slightly radioactive ore from the Mount Weld mine deep in the Australian desert, 2,500 miles away. The ore will be trucked to the Australian port of Fremantle and transported by container ship from there.
Within two years, Lynas says, the refinery will be able to meet nearly a third of the world's demand for rare earth materials -- not counting China, which has its own abundant supplies.
Nicholas Curtis, Lynas's executive chairman, said it would cost four times as much to build and operate such a refinery in Australia, which has much higher labor and construction costs. Australia is also home to an environmentally minded and politically powerful Green party.
Despite the potential hazards, the Malaysian government was eager for investment by Lynas, even offering a 12-year tax holiday. If rare earth prices stay at current lofty levels, the refinery will generate $1.7 billion a year in exports starting late next year, equal to nearly 1 percent of the entire Malaysian economy.
Raja Dato Abdul Aziz bin Raja Adnan, the director general of the Malaysian Atomic Energy Licensing Board, said his country approved the Lynas project only after an interagency review indicated the imported ore and subsequent waste would have low enough levels of radioactivity to be manageable and safe.
Malaysia had reason to be cautious: Its last rare earth refinery, operated by the Japanese company Mitsubishi Chemical, is now one of Asia's largest radioactive waste cleanup sites.
''We have learned we shouldn't give anybody a free hand,'' Raja Adnan said.
Despite such assurances, critics are not convinced that the low-level radioactive materials at the Lynas project will be safe.
''The word 'low' here is just a matter of perception -- it's a carcinogen,'' said Dr. Jayabalan A. Thambyappa, a general practitioner physician and toxicologist. He has treated leukemia victims whose illnesses he and others have attributed to the old Mitsubishi Chemical refinery.
That plant, on the other side of the Malay peninsula, closed in 1992 after years of sometimes violent demonstrations by citizens protesting its polluting effects. Now, in an engineering effort that has largely escaped the outside world's notice, Mitsubishi is engaged in a $100 million cleanup.
Rare earths, a group of 17 elements, are not radioactive themselves. But virtually every rare earth ore deposit around the world contains, in varying concentrations, a slightly radioactive element called thorium.
Radiation concerns -- along with low-cost Chinese competition -- eventually forced the closing of all rare earth refineries in Japan. It was during this phase-out that Mitsubishi moved its refining operation to Malaysia, where old tin mines had left behind thousands of tons of semiprocessed slag that was rich in rare earth ore. It also had extremely high levels of radioactive thorium.
The new Lynas refinery, with nearly two dozen interconnected buildings and 50 acres of floor space, will house the latest in pollution control equipment and radiation sensors. A signature feature will be 12 acres of interim storage pools that will be lined with dense plastic and sit atop nearly impermeable clay, to hold the slightly radioactive byproducts until they can be carted away.
But carted to where? That is still an open question.
Building the lined storage pools was one of the promises Lynas had made to win permission to put the refinery here, in an area already environmentally damaged by the chemical plants that line the narrow, muddy Balok River.
Mr. Curtis, the Lynas chairman, insists that the new factory will be much cleaner and far safer than the old Mitsubishi plant, which ''never should have been built,'' he said recently, as he led a tour of the sprawling Lynas refinery construction site here.
One big difference, he said, is that the ore being imported from Australia is much less radioactive. It will have only 3 to 5 percent of the thorium per ton found in the tin mine tailings that Mitsubishi had processed. And he said the Lynas factory would also process 10 times as much ore with only twice as many employees -- about 450 in all -- thanks to automation that will keep workers away from potentially harmful materials.
But the long-term storage of the Lynas plant's radioactive thorium waste is still unresolved.
After using sulfuric acid to dissolve the rare earths out of the concentrated ore, Lynas plans to mix the radioactive part of the waste with lime. The aim is to dilute it to a thorium concentration of less than 0.05 percent -- the maximum permitted under international standards to allow the material to be disposed with few restrictions.
Lynas wants to turn this mixture into large concrete shapes known as tetrapods that are used to build artificial reefs for fish and as sea walls to prevent beach erosion.
Local residents seem to be of two minds about the sprawling plant being built near the river. The river empties into the ocean several miles away, next to an impoverished fishing village, where on a recent evening a small group of fisherman sat at the end of a wooden dock.
Muhamad Ishmail, age 56, said pollution from the chemical factories that started opening upstream in the 1990s had forced local fishing -- a river industry for generations -- to move primarily out to sea. Although one of his five children works in the nearby industrial district, Mr. Ishmail said he did not want Lynas or anyone else to open any more factories.
''This river used to be clean, and you could catch fish right here,'' he said.
But Muhamad Anuar, 30, said his community needed the reliable paychecks that Lynas might offer. ''I have two kids, and I don't want them to be fishermen,'' he said. ''It's a hard job.''

HEADLINE: Paris Financial Center Wins Respite From Creditors

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
PARIS -- France's highest court ruled Tuesday that the owners of Coeur Defense, the largest office complex in Europe, could remain under court-appointed creditor protection while they restructure their debts.
The ruling, which overturned a lower court decision from February 2010, clarified corporate debt restructuring procedures, which until now have rarely been tested in France.
The case is important for businesses in France because of the potential precedent for the use of judicial tools by companies facing financial difficulties. 
The legal wrangle has its roots in the financial crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. It has resulted in a protracted struggle among several law firms, French banks and other players in the complex world of securitized financial products.
In its opinion Tuesday, the court, the Cour de Cassation, nullified a decision by the Paris Appeals Court that the owner of the building -- Heart of La Defense, or HOLD -- could not avail itself of so-called safeguard procedures, similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. The lower court ruled that the building owner and a related group had not demonstrated sufficient financial difficulty to warrant protection.
The top court's ruling, however, did validate the principle that creditors can contest safeguard procedures. The court sent the issue of the ownership of the building's rental revenue and the terms of the safeguard plan back to a lower court for a ruling.
''It's good news, of course,'' said Benoit Fleury, a lawyer with the firm Gibson Dunn, which represents the owner. He added that the owner should now be free to re-enter protection and restructure its debts.
Nicolas Noblanc, head of the legal department at EuroTitrisation, which represents the main creditors, said his group would ''proceed with a thorough analysis of these decisions and of their consequences'' and would assert its interests before the lower court.
Coeur Defense is in La Defense, a business district west of Paris. The biggest complex of its kind in Europe, Coeur Defense consists of two 40-story towers and three low-rise buildings and was completed in 2001.
Current tenants include HSBC, which renewed its contract in 2010, and AXA Investment Managers.
In 2007, Lehman Brothers and a French partner, Atemi, bought the property from the French real estate investment trust Unibail-Rodamco and Goldman Sachs's Whitehall Funds for 2.1 billion euros ($2.9 billion). At the time, the deal was heralded as the largest single asset transaction in Europe. Lehman bought the property through HOLD, with the shares in turn owned by two Lehman entities and G.E.'s pension fund, through a holding called Dame Luxembourg.
The deal was helped by a loan for 1.6 billion euros from Lehman's German unit, which was subsequently acquired by Windermere XII, a structured finance vehicle of a type known in France as a fonds commun de titrisation, or F.C.T. That vehicle is in turn managed by EuroTitrisation, a structure owned by French lenders.
EuroTitrisation financed its exposure by issuing notes, which were listed in Dublin. HOLD put up the rent owed by tenants as security on the loan and hedged for fluctuations in interest rates on the loan via contracts with Lehman Brothers units in the United States and Britain.
When Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, the two Lehman units lost their eligibility to act as counterparties to the hedging transaction after their credit ratings plummeted.
Windermere subsequently requested that HOLD provide new guarantees on the 1.6 billion-euro loan within 20 days or face accelerated reimbursement.
HOLD went to court seeking a safeguard under a 2004 French law that grants creditor protection similar to that provided by Chapter 11 of the United States bankruptcy law. One of the few occasions when the law was tested was in 2006, when Eurotunnel, which operates the tunnel linking Britain and France, was given court protection to restructure its debts. France subsequently updated its bankruptcy provisions seeking to strengthen protections for vulnerable companies.
In November 2008, the Paris Commercial Tribunal granted the safeguard proceedings to HOLD and Dame Luxembourg on the grounds that they had financial difficulties which they were unable to overcome alone and which could lead to a default.
Windermere challenged this decision to the Court of Appeals, which ruled in February 2010 that neither HOLD nor Dame Luxembourg had demonstrated difficulties that would affect their operating business. As a result, the appeals court ruled that Windermere had grounds to challenge the opening of safeguard proceedings. That process was overturned by the higher court on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: At House E.P.A. Hearing, Both Sides Claim Science

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Science and politics rarely play nicely together, and a House hearing Tuesday on a bill to strip the Environmental Protection Agency of its power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions proved no exception.
Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on energy and power demanded the hearing in the hope of slowing the inexorable progress of the bill, known as the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011, which enjoys the near-unanimous support of the Republican House majority.
They appear to have failed. Despite some fireworks, the handful of members from both parties who attended the hearing left with the views they arrived with. The subcommittee is expected to approve the bill later this week. 
The measure would overturn the E.P.A.'s finding that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases pose a threat to public health and the environment and would bar the agency from writing any regulations to control them. The bill's sponsors say that the climate science behind the finding is dubious and that the proposed rules would have a devastating impact on the economy.
In an effort to support the E.P.A.'s regulatory power, committee Democrats rounded up five eminent academic climatologists who defended the scientific consensus that the planet is warming and that human activities like the burning of fossil fuels are largely responsible. The professors called for swift and concerted action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, although they did not endorse any particular policy means for achieving them.
The Republicans countered with two scientific witnesses who said that while there was strong evidence of a rise in global surface temperatures, the reasons were murky and any response could have adverse unintended effects. Another scientist said that the E.P.A.'s decision to ban the pesticide DDT 40 years ago had led to a huge increase in death and disease in the developing world.
Representative Jay Inslee, Democrat of Washington, is one of Congress's most ardent advocates of strong action to combat global warming. Mr. Inslee brought to the hearing a two-foot-high stack of books and scientific reports, which he placed on his desk as a sort of totem of the robust science behind climate-change theory.
He used his question time largely to criticize Republicans as suffering from what he called an ''allergy to science and scientists.'' He said he was embarrassed that a country that sent a man to the moon and mapped the human genome could be on the verge of enacting a law that overturns a scientific finding based on the testimony of a few scientists who question the extent of human responsibility for altering the climate.
''If Copernicus, Galileo, Newton and Einstein were testifying today,'' Mr. Inslee said, ''the Republicans would not accept their views until all the Arctic ice has melted and hell has frozen over, whichever comes first.''
He said that much of the skepticism about global warming in Congress and among the public has been fed by a campaign of disinformation from energy interests. He likened it to the tobacco industry's efforts to discredit the finding that smoking causes cancer. ''People with enormous financial stakes attacked that science,'' Mr. Inslee said.
Representative Cory Gardner, a freshman Republican from Colorado and a skeptic of human-caused global warming, ribbed Mr. Inslee by offering to buy him an e-reader to make his stack of studies more manageable.
''Oh,'' Mr. Inslee responded, ''would you like to read some? It might be helpful.''
''Maybe you'd like to read some of mine,'' Mr. Gardner said.
''Be happy to,'' Mr. Inslee said. ''It's a much shorter list.''
The scientists themselves, when given the rare opportunity to speak, tried to steer clear of policy matters and stick to their scientific expertise. One witness, Christopher B. Field, director of global ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science, piqued the interest of members on both sides of the aisle by detailing new research on the adverse effects of rising temperatures on agriculture. Dr. Field said crops had certain temperature thresholds above which yields dropped sharply. For corn, he said, that temperature is 84 degrees, and a single day of 104 degrees causes a 7 percent drop in yield.
Dr. Field said that extreme warming could reduce crop yields by more than 60 percent. ''This new information is quite striking,'' he said. ''Major food crops and cotton show little sensitivity to rising temperatures until you reach a threshold. That's why people are generally not aware of these sensitivities.''
Representative Morgan Griffith of Virginia, a freshman Republican and an avowed skeptic on climate change, noted that ancient temperature records indicate periods of warming during the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations and again during the rise of the Vikings, and wanted the scientists to explain just how warm it got during those eras.
Mr. Griffith also wanted to know why the ice caps on Mars were melting and why he had been taught 40 years ago in middle school that Earth was entering a cooling period.
''What is the optimum temperature for man?'' he asked. ''Have we looked at that? These are questions that, believe it or not, I lay awake at night trying to figure out.''
The scientists promised to provide written answers.

HEADLINE: Bank Chief Rejects Idea Of Reducing Home Loans

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Showing resistance for the first time against government pressure to write off tens of billions worth of mortgage debt, Bank of America executives said on Tuesday that the idea was unworkable and warned that it would be unfair to borrowers who had managed to stay current on their loans.
''There's a core problem that if you start to help certain people and don't help other people, it's going to be very hard to explain the difference,'' said Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America. ''Our duty is to have a fair modification process.'' 
All 50 state attorneys general, as well as a host of federal agencies, are pushing for a settlement over investigations into foreclosure abuses by major mortgage servicers that could cost the industry $20 billion or more. Much of that money would be earmarked to reduce principal owed by homeowners facing foreclosure.
But picking just who to help is among the thorniest questions facing government regulators, as well as the banks themselves. Even the most outspoken attorney general on the issue, Tom Miller of Iowa, acknowledged on Monday that too generous a program might encourage homeowners to walk away from properties where the value of the loan exceeded how much the underlying property was worth.
Indeed, industry experts estimate that nearly a trillion dollars worth of mortgage debt is ''underwater,'' a result of house prices having fallen since the original loans were made. Federal officials hope a settlement with the servicers will help individual borrowers and provide a cushion for the weak housing market.
Officials of Bank of America, the nation's biggest mortgage servicer, argue that any effort to help troubled borrowers should not penalize borrowers who are underwater but have managed to make their monthly payments.
''There may be as much as $1 trillion worth of mortgages that are underwater,'' said Terry Laughlin, the Bank of America executive whose unit, Legacy Asset Servicing, handles mortgages that are delinquent or in default. ''What do you do for those borrowers that have a job but have negative equity and have paid on time and honored their obligations?''
''This is an unsolvable question,'' he said. ''It's a very slippery slope.''
The comments by Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Laughlin came at a daylong meeting with investors and analysts in New York, the first of its kind for Bank of America since 2007.
Despite fierce criticism by regulators and political leaders that its efforts to help troubled borrowers have fallen short, Bank of America executives insist that the number of successful modifications the bank has completed is on the rise. The bank says more than 800,000 mortgages have been modified in the last three years.
Writing down billions of principal now could actually retard the recovery by encouraging borrowers to default, they argue. ''It's not that we don't want to help troubled borrowers,'' Mr. Laughlin said. ''It's a moral hazard issue.''
Late last week, the attorneys general presented the five biggest mortgage servicers, including Bank of America, with a 27-page proposal that would drastically reshape how they deal with homeowners facing foreclosure. It did not include a specific dollar figure, but government officials say they want to combine any overhaul of the foreclosure process with a monetary settlement that could finance more modifications for troubled borrowers.
The existing modification program created by the Obama administration, known as HAMP, has helped far fewer borrowers than originally promised. It also faces fierce opposition from Republicans in the House of Representatives, who voted last week to kill the program.
Mr. Moynihan believes investors who hold trillions in mortgage securities have to be involved in any settlement. It is not exactly clear what role they would play as part of the settlement with the federal government.
Officials at Bank of America, as well as other large servicers, declined to comment on the specifics of the 27-page proposal, and the industry has been cautious about fighting back too aggressively, mindful of the tales of robo-signing and other abuses that prompted the investigation by the attorneys general and federal regulators last fall.
What's more, consumers and politicians are keenly aware that Bank of America and other financial giants have staged a remarkable turnaround since the government bailed out the industry after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
''I think reasonable minds will prevail on this,'' Mr. Moynihan said. ''We do push back and we get to reasonableness.''
Still, the comments at Tuesday's investor meeting are a preview of the arguments the industry is poised to make more forcefully in the weeks ahead as it negotiates with the attorneys general and other regulators behind closed doors. On Monday, Mr. Miller said he hoped a settlement could be reached within two months.
As the huge volume of loan losses recedes and the economy improves, Mr. Moynihan said his company had the power to earn $35 billion to $40 billion a year. Bank of America lost $2.2 billion in 2010, weighed down by special charges and the lingering effects of the housing bust and the recession on consumers.
He also reiterated his position that the long wave of acquisitions undertaken by his predecessors was over. ''I can't stress enough to you how much of a peace dividend we'll get without mergers,'' Mr. Moynihan said. ''That peace dividend is effectively a permanent dividend.'' The bank intends to resume payouts to shareholders in the second half of 2011.

HEADLINE: Expounding On a Theme, Obama Visits Boston School

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
BOSTON -- President Obama visited a high-tech public school here on Tuesday to pound away at his themes of innovation and education, sticking to a schedule that has taken him out of Washington nearly every week, despite budget battles and upheaval in the Arab world.
Declaring that ''there is no better economic policy than one that produces more graduates with the skills necessary to succeed,'' Mr. Obama said that revitalizing education was one of his administration's top priorities and a ''responsibility of every American -- every parent, every teacher, every business leader, every public official, and yes, every student.'' 
The president has been elaborating on a theme of American competitiveness since he first articulated it in his State of the Union address in January. The school Mr. Obama visited here, known as the TechBoston Academy, was ideally suited to illustrate his points, its gritty classrooms stuffed with laptops and students mixing fluids to analyze their density and purity.
''You guys are a pretty impressive bunch,'' Mr. Obama said to a science class of juniors and seniors, quizzing them on where they were applying to college and what they wanted to do after that.
''We have such a shortage of engineers now,'' he said to a young man who said he wanted to study engineering. Gesturing to the boy's friends, he said, ''We need architects and pharmacists, too.''
Mr. Obama was accompanied by Melinda Gates, who runs the Gates Foundation with her husband, Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft. The school was started in 2002 with financing from the foundation and integrates technology into every aspect of the curriculum. The school, which offers classes from sixth to 12th grade, is a pilot school in the Boston public school system.
Mr. Obama had some fun at Mr. Gates's expense, noting that both of them had attended school in Boston -- he at Harvard Law School, Mr. Gates at Harvard College. But Mr. Gates, he said, ''couldn't hack it in school here, so he dropped out. Then he started a modestly successful computer company.''
When nobody laughed, Mr. Obama said, ''That was a joke, guys,'' adding that he had actually started a big computer company.
To revitalize the nation's education system, Mr. Obama said the United States needed to treat teaching as an honored profession, noting that in South Korea, teachers are referred to as ''nation-builders.''
Mr. Obama took note of the budget battle with Capitol Hill, saying that his proposed budget calls for a freeze in domestic spending for five years. But he said he would fight Republican proposals that would cut back spending on education to reduce the deficit.
''A budget that sacrifices our commitment to education is a budget that sacrifices our country's future,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It is a budget that sacrifices our children's future, and I will not let it happen.''
After his visit, Mr. Obama met with several players from the Boston Celtics before attending a Democratic fund-raiser at the Museum of Fine Arts here, where he raised $1 million.
In his speech to a partisan crowd, Mr. Obama struck an almost conciliatory note, saying that Democrats would have to compromise with the Republicans in Congress to find ways to cut the deficit. ''Not everything has to be a fight, not everything is a battle to the death,'' Mr. Obama said. ''There's no weakness in trying to reach out and find common ground.''
During his schools tour, Mr. Obama has also visited a school in Miami with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, as well as one in Northern Virginia with Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia. He made a more personal school stop Monday, when he attended a parent-teacher conference for his daughter Sasha at Sidwell Friends School in Washington.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Bill to Change Patent System And Pricing

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate easily passed a bill on Tuesday that would overhaul the nation's patent system, giving the Patent and Trademark Office more flexibility to control its own financing and changing the system to one that rewards the first inventor to file a valid application.
But the House is unlikely to take up a patent bill anytime soon, and people with an interest in the patent system say they expect its bill to be significantly different. 
That means that for the foreseeable future, patents will continue be awarded to the first to invent a new product, even if the inventor was not the first to file an application.
The Senate voted 95 to 5 to approve the America Invents Act, which was sponsored by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat of Vermont, and two Republican senators, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah.
President Obama praised the Senate action, saying, ''This long-overdue reform is vital to our ongoing efforts to modernize America's patent laws and reduce the backlog of 700,000 patent applications -- which won't just increase transparency and certainty for inventors, entrepreneurs and businesses, but help grow our economy and create good jobs.''
The change in the application system was favored by the large technology and pharmaceutical companies, which argued that it would put the United States in sync with other national patent offices around the world and make it easier to settle disputes about who has the right to a certain innovation.
Many smaller companies and inventors opposed the change, however, arguing that it favored companies that could hire legions of lawyers to quickly file applications for new permutations in manufacturing or product design.
The bill also gives the director of the patent office the ability to set its fees and says Congress cannot siphon off that money for other purposes. The patent office pays for itself through assessments of applicants, with the average approved patent generating roughly $4,000 in fees.
Under the bill, the patent office could set up an expedited review program under which, for a higher fee, it would guarantee a final decision on an application within a year. It now takes about three years, on average, for a patent application to be approved, and the office has such a backlog that it takes two years for examiners to begin work on a new application. Small businesses would be eligible for a reduction in the fee.
During debate on the bill, Senator Leahy repeatedly referred to the bill as being the first reform of the patent system in 60 years. He said, ''A patent system developed for a 1952 economy -- before the Internet, before cellphones, before computers, before photocopiers, even before the I.B.M. Selectric typewriter -- needs to be reconsidered in light of 21st-century realities, while staying true to the consistent constitutional imperative of encouraging innovation and invention.''
Some lobbyists who followed the bill disputed Mr. Leahy's timeline, pointing out that in 1999, Congress expanded the ways in which granted patents could be challenged.
The Senate bill would expand that ability even more, adding a postgrant review system that supporters say would help to keep more patent challenges out of court.
Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is expected to introduce a patent bill that supports the Senate's change to a first-to-file system.
But it is uncertain whether the House bill will contain many of the Senate bill's changes in litigation procedures, like the postgrant review. Some supporters of overhauling the patent laws said those issues already had been ironed out by court rulings in recent years and were unnecessary.
People close to Mr. Smith said he was working with Representative Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, and Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan.
A consortium of technology and computer companies are already lobbying House members to resist addressing procedures to re-examine patents in their bill. The Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include Dell, Google, I.B.M. and Microsoft, said in a letter to Mr. Leahy earlier this month that it opposed the bill's provisions to alter how patents could be re-examined, asserting that this would increase litigation rather than reduce it.

HEADLINE: Slashing Civil Legal Aid

 BODY:
PRESIDENT'S F.Y. 2010-11 REQUEST: $407 MILLION
HOUSE VOTED: $324 million
House Republicans voted to cut $83 million from President Obama's request for the Legal Services Corporation, the federally financed nonprofit program that provides civil legal help to low-income Americans. 
The corporation supports 136 programs that operate 918 legal services offices around the nation. Their clients include victims of domestic violence seeking shelter and protection orders, families fending off evictions and foreclosures, veterans and the disabled trying to obtain benefits and elderly Americans who have fallen prey to consumer fraud.
The Legal Services Corporation says the House cut would force layoffs of at least 370 staff lawyers -- almost 10 percent of the program's total. These offices, which already have to turn away many hard-pressed Americans needing legal help, would be forced to turn away many more. Some offices serving rural areas would have to close down.
Deficit-ridden states have cut their support for these civil legal services programs. Another source of financing -- interest earned on lawyers' escrow accounts -- has evaporated because of historically low interest rates. That makes federal dollars even more crucial. Given the economic crisis, and the long line of desperate clients, this is the worst time to be cutting federal support for civil legal services.

HEADLINE: More Foreign-Born Scholars Lead U.S. Universities

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
When Molly Easo Smith delivered her inaugural address as president of Manhattanville College last spring, she opened with an unusual line: ''Welcome, namaste, vannakkam, namaskaaram, bienvenidos and welcome.''
Three of the greetings were in languages from her native India: Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam. They reflected the striking journey Dr. Smith had made from her birthplace in Chennai -- where she had never dated or been outdoors past 6 p.m. when she left at age 23 -- to the pinnacle of American higher education: a college presidency.
As colleges in the United States race to expand study-abroad programs and even to create campuses overseas, they are also putting an international stamp on the president's office. Dr. Smith, 52, has joined an expanding roster of foreign-born college and university leaders.
The Association of American Universities, which represents large research campuses in the United States and Canada, said that 11 of its 61 American member institutions have foreign-born chiefs, up from 6 five years ago. In the past two months, three colleges in the New York region have appointed presidents born abroad: Cooper Union tapped a scholar originally from India; Seton Hall University, a candidate from the Philippines; and Stevens Institute of Technology, a native of Iran. 
The globalization of the college presidency, higher-education experts say, is a natural outgrowth of the steady increase of international students and professors on American campuses over the past four decades. And it will most likely lead to more relationships and exchanges abroad, they say, while giving students a stronger sense that they are world citizens -- a widely advertised goal in academia.
''There's a logic to seeing individuals born in other nations, who have excelled in their scholarly work, now move into college presidencies,'' said Molly C. Broad, president of the American Council on Education, which represents two- and four-year colleges. ''I think the trend will continue and maybe even accelerate as more people move up in the faculty ranks, becoming deans and provosts.''
That trend extends to Washington, where a year ago President Obama named a native of Argentina, Eduardo M. Ochoa, to be his top adviser on higher education, as an assistant secretary in the Department of Education.
The number of international scholars working at colleges and universities in the United States -- as researchers, instructors and professors -- rose to 115,000 last year, an all-time high, from 86,000 in 2001. That growth, documented by the Institute of International Education, a nonprofit group in New York, came despite the problems in obtaining visas after 9/11.
Allan E. Goodman, the institute's president, said he had an ''epiphany'' two years ago about the changing landscape at a banquet in Washington. The gathering honored about 40 scholarship recipients -- undergraduates at the nation's strongest institutions in math and science.
''The first thing I noticed was that nobody looked like me,'' said Dr. Goodman, who is white. ''At least half, if not two-thirds, were international students. They were from India, Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and yet they were Harvard students, Stanford students, Rice students. It just reminded me that American higher education is not American. It's for the whole world.''
Still, academic leaders from foreign countries where English is an official language, or is at least widely spoken, may have an edge. Of the foreign-born presidents of institutions that belong to the Association of American Universities, three are from Canada (including Shirley M. Tilghman, at Princeton), one is from South Africa and one is from Australia. The other six hail from China, Greece, France and Cyprus.
While many presidents first arrived in the United States as unproven graduate students, Michael A. McRobbie, president of Indiana University, was recruited 14 years ago from Australia National University to be Indiana's vice president of information technology, as well as a professor of computer science. He became provost in 2006 and president the following year.
Dr. McRobbie found the Midwestern university to be remarkably diverse, with several thousand international students representing some 100 countries. There are now about 50 students from Australia alone.
He also encountered a warm welcome, feeling every bit a Hoosier. Last fall, on his 60th birthday, Dr. McRobbie took the oath of allegiance as an American citizen, along with his three grown children. ''I have been here a long time and have become well accepted in this state,'' he said. ''They treat me like a local with a funny accent.''
Other journeys to American academia have been more turbulent. Nariman Farvardin, who in January was named president of Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., recalls struggling to finish college in Iran in the late 1970s, just as the Islamic Revolution broke out.
''The government decided to shut down the university completely,'' he said. ''I remember there was a tank parked in front of the main entrance of the university. There were daily strikes and demonstrations, and buildings were on fire.''
Then 22 and only a semester shy of graduation, he contacted the American colleges that had accepted him to graduate school. He asked if they would take him instead as a transfer student -- immediately. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute said yes, and within weeks, he was en route to Troy, N.Y., from Tehran.
''I was in a state of shock,'' Dr. Farvardin, 54, recalled. ''I had very little money and no knowledge of the English language.''
He went on to earn a bachelor's, a master's and a doctorate from Rensselaer. He then spent the next 27 years at the University of Maryland, where he rose from assistant professor to provost, becoming an American citizen along the way.
''I give an enormous amount of credit to this country,'' he said. ''There would have been no other place in the world that would have judged me by the value of my contributions and the content of my character. Quite frankly, right now I look at myself as an American, and I think others do as well.''
Although many colleges have tentacles firmly planted abroad, the influx of foreign-born presidents could extend that reach. Dr. Smith, president of Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., where 16 percent of the student body is from outside the United States, said she was interested in exploring an exchange with her alma mater, Madras Christian College, one of India's leading schools.
''I would love to make that connection,'' said Dr. Smith, who became an American citizen in 1989.
Dr. Farvardin, too, wants to ensure that Stevens Institute of Technology is making the most of international study. ''We live in an increasingly interconnected world,'' he said. ''If you haven't given students the exposure and appropriate experience in how to deal with the global economy, you've done them a disservice.''
