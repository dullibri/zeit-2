HEADLINE: LEAP IN U.S. DEFICIT IS SEEN NEXT YEAR DESPITE 1990 LAW

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office said today that even though the recession has ended, the Federal budget deficit will leap to a record $362 billion in the coming year, from $279 billion this year, because of increased spending to rescue troubled financial institutions and their depositors, and an "explosion of Medicaid costs."
The nonpartisan agency said it "now projects much bigger deficits" than it did last winter, despite the budget package devised last fall by Congress and President Bush in an effort to reduce the deficit. 
 The director of the Congressional Budget Office, Robert D. Reischauer, praised last year's legislation, saying that without it the deficit would be even bigger. But in a report to Congress today he said, "The budget outlook now appears worse than it did in January."
 
White House Estimate Is Lower
 The budget office's deficit estimate is larger than that of the Bush Administration. In July, the White House Office of Management and Budget estimated that the deficit would reach $348 billion in 1992. The main reason for the difference is that the Administration assumed enactment of several tax and spending proposals that Mr. Bush has made.
If the Congressional estimate is accurate, it implies that there would be less saving, less investment and lower economic growth in the next five years, with a result of slightly lower living standards than might have otherwise occurred.
Comparing today's estimates with those made by his agency in January, Mr. Reischauer attributed the "gloomier outlook" to many factors: lower economic growth; lower personal incomes; lower tax collections; higher outlays for Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance; bigger deficits; higher interest rates and therefore higher costs for interest payments on the Federal debt.
"The deterioration in the budget outlook doesn't signify that deficit reduction measures enacted last fall are ineffective or not living up to expectations," Mr. Reischauer said in a telephone interview from Colorado, where he was attending a conference. "But very substantial additional measures will be required to put us on the path to the promised land."
Neither Congress nor Mr. Bush has displayed any desire to undertake such measures as increasing taxes or making further cuts in domestic spending before the November elections.
 
This Was Balanced Budget Year
 This was the year when the Government was to have a balanced budget, under the law passed in 1985. But today's report says that the vision of a balanced budget in that Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law "has faded even further into the future."
The budget law still sets annual goals for the deficit, but they are not very meaningful because they are adjusted for changes in the economy and for increases in the cost of Government programs under existing laws.
The Congressional Budget Office said in today's report that it believed the recession began in the third quarter of 1990 and ended in the second quarter of 1991, but the agency said the Federal budget deficit would rise next year nevertheless
Mr. Reischauer's report also notes that the amount of Federal debt held by the public next year will, for the first time, exceed $3 trillion, or 51 percent of the gross national product, a percentage not seen since the mid-1950's, when the Government still owed the huge sums that had helped finance World War II.
In a departure from its normal understated tone, the budget office said Federal spending to clean up the wreckage of the savings and loan industry and to protect bank depositors "will reach a whopping $115 billion" next year. This represents a huge increase from spending for such deposit insurance in previous years: $22 billion in 1989, $58 billion in 1990 and $77 billion projected for this year.
 
Government's Obligation
 "Deposit insurance is a mandatory obligation of the Government," the report says. "Having promised to protect depositors, the Government must honor its pledge."
The deficit would have been slightly larger this year if the budget office had counted borrowing by Government-sponsored corporations created solely to raise money for the bailout of the savings and loan industry.
Mr. Reischauer's report warns Congress that delaying the purchase of insolvent savings and loan associations may substantially increase the eventual cost to the Federal Treasury, by allowing the institutions to stay in business for several additional years.
The budget office estimates that Federal spending for Medicaid will increase to $61.7 billion next year and to $105 billion in 1996, from $52 billion this year and $41 billion in 1990. The surge reflects Congressional actions to expand the Federal-state medical program for poor people, a rise in medical costs, court decisions requiring the Government to increase payments for some services and state efforts to maximize Federal contributions to the program.
Today's report said that Congress and the Administration were adhering to the fiscal discipline embodied in last year's budget agreement.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the United States will receive $48 billion in cash contributions from other countries this year to help pay for the war in the Persian Gulf. In addition, the United States is getting $6 billion worth of food, fuel and other goods and services from abroad. Taken together, these contributions will cover most of the costs of the war, estimated at $61 billion, the budget office said.
For both this year and next year, the budget office is projecting lower revenues than it projected just five months ago. The estimate for 1991 has dropped $35 billion, to $1,058 billion. The estimate for 1992 fell $28 billion, to $1,141 billion.
The budget office has slightly lowered its expectations of economic growth and it notes that "tax collections to date in 1991, especially personal income tax receipts, have been weaker" than expected. The recession "dampened the growth in personal income more than expected, and this, in turn, dampened growth in income and payroll taxes," the report says.
Despite these revenue weaknesses, the budget office said that tax increases passed last year would eventually generate additional revenue to help reduce the deficit as lawmakers intended.

 BODY:
American Express is setting out to help increase tourism in Eastern Europe with a $500,000 allocation to train students going into the tourism business. "Tourism will be a major source of jobs and hard currency for countries in Central and Eastern Europe, which are reshaping their economies," said TOMMASO ZANZOTTO, the president of American Express Travel Related Services International in New York.
He announced this week that the money would go for tourism training in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. 
 American Express has had offices in those countries since the mid-1970's in conjunction with Government tourism offices but is now establishing independent operations. The company opened its own offices in June in Warsaw and in January in Budapest, where the initial staff of 6 was expanded to 24 within six months. A new office is to open in Prague later this year.

HEADLINE: Two Good Guardians at the F.D.I.C.

 BODY:
President Bush's nomination of William Taylor to head the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation removes some of the bad odor from last year's attempt to dump the incumbent, William Seidman. Mr. Seidman has been too independent for the Administration's taste, but a worthy public servant. Mr. Taylor, with a strong background in regulating banks for the Federal Reserve, should prove an able successor.
The F.D.I.C. was created in the Depression to insure bank deposits and regulate state-chartered banks that aren't Fed members. It has grown in role and stature of late, in response to crises in the savings and loan industry and now in banking. 
 Congress put Mr. Seidman in charge of the multibillion-dollar sale of real estate and other assets held by failed S.& L.'s. It also gave the F.D.I.C. the insurance fund for S.& L. deposits. Meanwhile, the surge in bank failures has stretched the agency's regular operations and drained the insurance fund for bank deposits.
Mr. Seidman has juggled these jobs well, no small feat considering the potential for manipulation, bungling and even panic. But when he challenged official understatements of the bailout cost and the banking crisis, the White House chief of staff, John Sununu, wanted him out. He hung on, and will stay out his term until October. Assuming Congress votes the needed funds, he will leave his agency in good shape for the work ahead.
Mr. Taylor is in for a grilling at his confirmation hearings on why the Fed failed to uncover the scandalous global rampage by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. His defense, which seems credible on the evidence so far, is that the bank masked its skulduggery so completely that no regulator anywhere in the world could get a handle on it. And amazingly, the Central Intelligence Agency's early discovery that B.C.C.I. owned a large Washington bank was not relayed to the Fed until two weeks ago.
B.C.C.I. notwithstanding, Mr. Taylor has an admirable record as a tough regulator. He looks like a good choice to fill Mr. Seidman's big shoes.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Glad, Not Grateful

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The diplomats from the West, Israel and the United Nations who are trying to get the hostages freed are keeping their mouths zipped about some of the basic realities underlying the negotiations process.
That is fair enough. It is not the job of those diplomats to serve as educators of the public about the whole vicious story of hostage-taking, how it works, or the dangers of it happening again. Their job is to get the hostages out as soon as possible. 
 But it is important for the rest of us to understand what is going on -- mostly for the sake of the hostages. In case not all of them are freed, it will help to get them out eventually if the world knows who is keeping them chained.
And if all are freed soon the speaking of the truth might just conceivably dissuade decent nations of the world from following policies that encourage kidnappers to take more hostages, for leverage and reward.
The first reality is that if a deal is worked out and all hostages are freed it will not be because of the negotiations themselves. It will be because the sponsors and masters of the kidnappers, Iran and Syria, have in their own sweet time decided that it is in their best economic, military and political interests to free their victims, at least some.
Iran desperately wants help from the West to patch up an economy shattered by years of fear and fanaticism. So it is calling in the investment it has made in the kidnap gangs, the years of investment of financial and political capital. These gangs, which use the name of God to carry out the work of the Devil, were organized and sent into Lebanon by Teheran and have paid off by giving Iran years of political leverage.
With fine candor, Prof. R. K. Ramazani of the University of Virginia summed it all up in a New York Times Op-Ed article urging the United States now to fulfill Iran's desire for a major role in the Persian Gulf.
"The prospect of the October peace talks reduces the usefulness of Western hostages as a lever to pressure the U.S. and Israel on issues important to Iran," he explains.
Plain enough?
Iran could not have protected the gangs without Syria. The gangs seized their victims in Syrian-dominated Lebanon and kept them mostly in the Bekaa Valley. That bears about the same relationship to Syria as Parris Island does to the United States Marine Corps. Now Syria finds itself without Soviet aid, and eager to be removed from Washington's short, select pariah list of terrorist nations.
Could Iran and Syria have freed the hostages years ago? Of course. The Syrians say they did not want to risk the lives of the hostages. But Syria never used the obvious weapon: a threat to execute all kidnappers if one hostage was injured. The Iranians don't say anything very much; at least they have that much respect for our intelligence.
So this is the end game -- Syria and Iran trying to make a profitable exit from an enterprise no longer paying off. But even now the diplomats do not know whether all the hostages will be released or some kept for future body-bargaining.
Another reality: The terrorists and their sponsors have carried off a fine piece of moral and political fakery. They have linked and equated the prisoners taken by Israel with the hostages. A hostage is a person who has no relationship to a fight between two parties but is kidnapped by one to exert pressure on the other, or on a third party, like the always-available U.S. That definition precisely fits the Western victims taken in Lebanon but not most of the prisoners of war, terrorists or gang leaders captured by the Israelis.
Maybe that fraud will help free the hostages; let's pray. But if we fail to see and state the difference we will be setting ourselves up for another round of hostage-taking -- a point that I have heard only Henry Kissinger make clearly and bravely, on ABC's "Nightline."
Hostages have been released because after years of hideous captivity the value has been sucked out of them. Soviet political prisoners gave exactly the right reaction when they were released from their own long captivity: glad, not grateful.
If the kidnappers and their masters are rewarded with trade, arms and absolution, hostages will be taken again. Why not -- low risk, good payoff. Then the West can find at least one responsible party, by looking in its own mirror.

HEADLINE: U.S. Judge Blocks Plan for All-Male Public Schools in Detroit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Saying that girls must be offered an equal education, a Federal judge ruled today that the Detroit public school system's plan for three all-male academies was unconstitutional.
On Aug. 5, the American Civil Liberties Union and the NOW Legal Defense Fund filed a suit to allow girls to attend the schools. The groups argued that while focusing attention on the plight of black males was admirable, it denied girls the right to an equal education. 
 United States District Judge George Woods ruled that excluding girls from the schools violated Federal and State laws. The judge said that no matter how important it was to improve the education of black males in Detroit, any plan that excluded girls was not permissible.
"There is no evidence the school system is failing males because girls attend schools with them," Judge Woods said. "Girls fail too."
The proposed schools would have been the first of their kind in the nation. All-male curriculums have been developed in Milwaukee, San Diego and Baltimore. But single-sex schools similar to those planned in Detroit stalled in Miami and Milwaukee after officials sought legal opinions from the United States Department of Education.
The 170,000-student Detroit school district intended to have the experimental schools, officially named the Male Academy, open to boys of all races but aimed at blacks. The curriculum stresses discipline, civic responsibility, high academic standards and a curriculum with special emphasis on African and African-American history.
The groups filed the lawsuit on behalf of a Detroit mother with three daughters attending public schools.
The woman, who requested anonymity and was referred to as Nancy Doe in the complaint, said the application process for the schools and the name, Male Academy, made it clear that girls need not apply.
Community support for the all-male schools is strong. When the school district's attorney, Michele Edwards, closed her arguments in court with a reminder about the Detroits soaring high-school dropout rate among boys, spectators broke into applause.
"This is a situation that cannot be delayed one second longer," Ms. Edwards said.
Arthur Carter, the school district's acting deputy superintendent, said in an affidavit disclosed Thursday that girls could apply to the academies and would be considered on an equal basis with boys. One girl and 599 boys were admitted, he said.
 
All-Male Focus
 But in promoting the plan, the district had stressed the school's all-male focus.
A.C.L.U. lawyer Dick Soble said he was surprised to learn that the district had claimed admission was open to girls. Mr. Carter refused to comment outside court.
The judge ordered the Detroit Board of Education, the A.C.L.U. and the NOW Legal Defense Fund, which is not affiliated with the National Organization for Women, to work out a schedule under which girls could be admitted to the academies. A meeting was tentatively scheduled for Friday.
The schools had been scheduled to open Aug. 27. If a compromise cannot be worked out, the opening will be delayed indefinitely.
The controversy surrounding the schools is not racial. About 90 percent of the city's schoolchildren are black.
Another mother, 24-year-old Shawn Garrett, dropped out of the lawsuit about 30 minutes before today's hearing because she had been harassed and threatened by people in the community, said Howard Simon, the Michigan A.C.L.U.'s executive director.
The school board created the male academies to combat social and economic problems it said disproportionately affect black males.
On Tuesday, the Detroit school board voted to set up an all-girls academy in 1992.
But Mr. Simon, said: "Single, separate schools is not the issue. . . . Special programs were going to be opening in three weeks, and they were going to be opening with the special exclusion of girls."

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Search for Yields Requires Caution

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
With short-term interest rates pushed down to the area of 5 percent, many people are scrambling to get a better return than they can now earn on money market funds, certificates of deposit, bank savings and Treasury bills.
The trouble, financial experts say, is that often in their quest for a better yield people are making inappropriate choices, unwittingly exposing their principal to risks. 
 "This summer an inordinate amount of C.D. money came due," said Joel S. Isaacson, a partner in Weber Lipshie & Company in New York, "and people went into real shock and started buying bond funds without considering what's in the fund, as far as quality and maturity."
Tim Kochis, a partner in Kochis & Fitz, personal financial consultants in San Francisco, recalled reviewing a new client's portfolio. "Well, I see you have some money in junk bonds," he told the client. The man was aghast. He was unaware that "high yield" was a synonym for "junk" in the bond world and assumed that since the holding had been sold by a reputable firm, it was O.K.
It is O.K. for people who want to speculate, who are willing to risk principal in a volatile market in the hope that the bonds' prices will climb, as they have recently. But consultants caution that junk bonds are no place for a conservative investor. Prices can also plunge, or issuers can default.
Richard Ganz, president of the Fixed Income Management Group of Melville, L.I., who advises brokers and financial planners on bonds, said: "Today I think it is very important for people to move to quality. You can't concentrate on yield alone." Rather, he advised, people should look at total return, the combined result of income and any price change in their holdings.
He recommends Treasury securities or highly rated municipal securities as appropriate for conservative investors -- and he is bullish on the outlook for the municipal market. He sees demand outstripping supply, but stresses the quality of the bond, warning people away from bonds that are rated triple-A only because they are insured.
In another area, Mr. Ganz said, "A hot product today is C.M.O.'s," referring to collateralized mortgage obligations. "Everyone is selling them," he added, "but these are a hybrid-type product and must be understood."
Similarly, Mr. Isaacson noted that some investors seeking better yields have turned to funds that invest in securities backed by the Government National Mortgage Association, unaware that if rates decline the value of their holdings would go down because homeowners would rush to refinance the underlying mortgages.
Mr. Kochis said, "The first question is: 'Do bonds have a place in your portolio at all?' " His answer is yes, for people who need to lock in a predictable income stream within a one-to-five-year period, like retirees, or people who must pay college tuition bills.
In such cases, he favors "maturity matching," buying a bond that comes due as the money is needed. That way, even if the bond's market value goes down in the meantime, holders will get the face amount back at maturity. People who buy bond mutual funds, in contrast, do not have the protection of a maturity date, he noted.
When money is being invested for longer-term needs, like retirement in 15 or 20 years, Mr. Kochis favors stocks, possibly through a no-load index fund, like the Vanguard Index Trust or the Dreyfus Index 500, because historically the long-term total return on equities has been greater than on debt. Because of volatility, stocks are not appropriate when the money will be needed in less than five years, he added.
"I advise my clients to take the long view," he said. "History says invest in ownership. Owners get compensated. Creditors barely get paid back, and after taxes and inflation, they are negative."
Taxes are an important consideration for the bond portion of a portfolio. Jack Tierney, vice president of Van Kampen Merritt in Lisle, Ill., and product manager for its unit investment trusts, said his firm last week had sold out a triple-tax-exempt New York issue that yields 6.5 percent. For a New York City investor in the 31 percent Federal bracket, that return is equivalent to 11 percent on a taxable investment -- a rate available today only on corporate issues with some risk.
Investors should consider market risk, as well as credit risk. Longer-term bonds tend to fluctuate in price more than shorter-term issues because when interest rates rise, prices of outstanding bonds decline. Those who are uncomfortable with that risk may simply have to forgo some yield at present.
Steven E. Norwitz, a vice president of T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund and investment advisory group, gave these figures: If interest rates rise 1 percent, the price of a five-year issue with an 8 percent coupon will fall 3.96 percent; a 30-year bond's price will fall 10.32 percent. If rates drop 1 percent, the 5-year note will rise 4.16 percent in price and the 30-year bond 12.47 percent.
For a 10-year bond with an 8 percent coupon the total return for a year would be cut to 1.5 percent if rates go up 1 percent and it would be a negative 4.5 percent if they go up 2 percent. But, Mr. Norwitz noted, "those glamorous yields" of a decade ago "were a reaction to double-digit inflation." Today's low yields are still ahead of inflation.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Platinum Rises by Over $5 After Three Days of Losses

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Platinum futures prices rose more than $5 an ounce yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, ending a three-day string of losses, on news of a work slowdown at the world's second-largest platinum mining company.
Platinum for delivery in October rose $5.10, to $346.10, an ounce after falling a total of $15.60 in the three previous sessions. 
 The rebound was largely a reaction to news that 75 percent of the workers of South Africa's Impala Platinum Holdings began working half-days Thursday in a wage dispute. But analysts said platinum demand was so weak and prices had fallen so low that the Impala slowdown was unlikely to have a lasting effect.
"Only if this were to go on for an extended period of time, and I'm talking about months, is this likely to have a material impact on the market," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York.
Impala typically forces an end to strikes and slowdowns quickly by hiring replacement workers, said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc.
"They're pretty rigid in their treatment of strikers," she said.
The likeliest result, Mr. O'Neill said, is a quick resumption of platinum's recent tailspin. Prices reached their lowest level in more than five years this week.
Silver futures rose sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange, partly in sympathy with platinum, partly on stronger technical signals and partly in reaction to signs the economy is improving.
Silver for September delivery settled at $3.995 a troy ounce, up 6.5 cents; August gold rose $1, to $358 a troy ounce.
Crude oil slipped yesterday in quiet trading on the New York Merc as the market appeared to ignore the United Nations' approval of a plan to allow Iraq to sell $1.6 billion worth of oil to pay for food and medicine.
Crude oil for delivery in September settled at $21.30 a barrel, down 14 cents; September unleaded gasoline settled at 66.98 cents a gallon, up 0.14 cent; September home heating oil rose 0.26 cent, to 60.67 cents a gallon; September natural gas prices settled at $1.278 per 1,000 cubic feet, down 0.01 cent.
Cattle futures rose slightly on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, extending their recent advance from three-year lows on continued strength in the cash market. Near-term hog futures soared the permitted daily limit of 1.5 cents, also in reaction to higher-than-expected prices in the cash livestock market.
Live cattle for August delivery finished 0.32 cent higher at 68.72 cents a pound; August feeder cattle were 0.13 cent higher at 85.70 cents a pound; August hogs rose 1.5 cents, to 50.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies for August delivery fell 1.05 cents, to 39.87 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Broad Advance; Mark Fails to Draw Buyers

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar staged another broad advance yesterday in foreign exchange trading that dealers traced largely to internal market conditions.
Dealers said the dollar's movement reflected relief that Thursday's widely expected interest rate rises by Germany's central bank failed to attract much buying of the mark. 
 "Everybody was waiting for the Germans to raise rates," said Hugh Walsh, an assistant vice president for foreign exchange at the Algemene Bank Nederland in New York. "Germany has rolled the dice and their market didn't strengthen."
Daniel Scherman, senior foreign exchange dealer at the Bank of Boston, said there was "an extensive amount of corporate interest" in buying dollars in the wake of the weak response to the German rate rise.
In trading in Europe, the dollar jumped to 1.7605 German marks, from 1.7320 late Thursday, and in New York it rose to 1.7645 marks, from 1.7490.
Mr. Scherman said that yesterday's reports showing a contraction in the United States trade deficit to its lowest level in eight years, $4 billion, and a rise of five-tenths of a percent in industrial production failed to inspire much activity.
Dealers in Europe said earlier, however, that the reports showed the United States economy was recovering from the recession, a development that would help the dollar.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 136.90 Japanese yen, from 136.59 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 137.25 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 137.30 yen, from 137.05 yen late Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.6870, from $1.6610 late Thursday. The pound fell to $1.65745 in New York, from $1.6720 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.5440 Swiss francs, up from 1.5355; 5.9975 French francs, up from 5.9485; 1.320.25 Italian lire, up from 1,310.75, and 1.14495 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14355.

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Climbed 0.5% Last Month

BYLINE: By Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Production at United States factories, mines and utilities rose for a fourth straight month in July, the Federal Reserve Board said today, buoyed by higher output of autos and construction goods.
The gain of five-tenths of 1 percent in industrial output last month followed revised increases of six-tenths of 1 percent in June and eight-tenths in May. Production increased in April by five-tenths of 1 percent. 
 The steady gains in industrial production support the contention by the White House and many private economists that the recession has ended.
 
A Lackluster Recovery
 But the recovery is not regarded as a strong one, and there have been calls from some in the Bush Administration for further cuts in interest rates to stimulate activity.
The Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, controls interest rates. Its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet Tuesday.
In today's report, the Federal Reserve said that the output of consumer goods during July was up four-tenths of 1 percent after a gain of six-tenths of 1 percent in June but that the rise was entirely attributable to a surge in auto production.
"Apart from motor vehicles, output of durable consumer goods declined, as production of appliances, which had surged in June, fell back last month," the Fed said. Durable goods, like major appliances, are long-lasting and relatively expensive. They are closely monitored as a bellwether of consumer willingness to make large financial commitments.
One concern about the current recovery is that a tight job market might restrict consumer incomes and so choke off any spending increases. During July, 51,000 jobs disappeared, according to the latest Labor Department report on employment.
 
Other Categories Up
 Among other major categories in the report on industrial output, production by manufacturing industries was up in July by six-tenths of 1 percent, after an increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent in June. Utilities increased their output by seven-tenths of 1 percent, after falling back 1.4 percent in June.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of auto assemblies picked up in July to 6 million units, from 5.4 million in June.
Over all, industries like manufacturing, mining and utilities were running at 79.7 percent of capacity in July, up from 79.5 percent in June. It was the strongest pace since January, when they were at 80 percent.
Despite the improvement, capacity use was still significantly below the rate of 83.8 percent set in July 1990, the month that has been designated as the start of the recession.

HEADLINE: U.S. Issues Steady in Light Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in light trading yesterday, as dealers kept one eye on new economic data and the other on the unfolding scandal at Salomon Brothers.
Reports on merchandise trade and industrial production were viewed as mildly negative by credit market participants, and bond prices eased after the figures were released. 
 The increase of five-tenths of a percent in industrial production for July, the fourth straight monthly rise, was a particularly nasty surprise to traders, who prefer evidence of weakness in the economy to curb inflation and hold down interest rates. Before the figures were released, most analysts had been projecting that factory output rose by two-tenths or perhaps three-tenths of a percent last month.
"I was surprised the market held in as well as it did" after the production numbers were released, said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets.
 
Salomon Troubles Cited
 Traders cited the troubles at Salomon as the main reason why Treasury prices recovered later in the day.
Reports that Moody's Investors Services and the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the nation's two major ratings agencies, were considering downgrading Salomon's outstanding debt obligations followed rumors that the firm was repurchasing its commercial paper.
Those rumors were subsequently denied, but worries about the firm's finances spilled over into the stock market. And nervous investors departing equities poured their money into high-quality Treasury issues, especially short-term bills.
 
'A Flight to Quality'
 "The rumors about Solly produced a flight to quality, and that helped to push the whole market up," Mr. McCarthy said.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 100 15/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 8.08 percent, the same as late Thursday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 3/8 in late trading, up 2/32, to yield 7.82 percent. And the 6 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 3/32, up 1/32, to yield 6.26 percent.
In the secondary market for short-term Treasury bills, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.22 percent late yesterday, down five basis points, or five one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates dipped by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.27 percent.
The announcement that Salomon's two top executives, John H. Gutfreund and Thomas W. Strauss, intend to submit their resignations at a special meeting of the firm's board tomorrow helped to lift the prices of Salomon's outstanding bonds.
 
Issues Rebound Strongly
 Salomon issues, which fell sharply on Thursday, rebounded strongly. For example, an 8 percent note issue maturing in 1996 was offered late yesterday at a price of 97 5/8, up nearly four points from late Thursday.
In the new-issue market for investment-grade corporate securities, the First Union Corporation offered $150 million worth of 10-year subordinated notes through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 9.45 percent notes, which mature Aug. 15, 2001, were priced at $99.80 to yield 9.481 percent, 1.64 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated Baa-2 by Moody's and BBB-plus by Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: U.S. TRADE DEFICIT LOWEST IN 8 YEARS

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
A resurgence of exports of manufactured goods, low oil prices and shrinking demand for imports narrowed the trade deficit in June to $4.02 billion, the lowest monthly level in eight years, the Commerce Department said today.
Together with an announcement today by the Federal Reserve that output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities grew in July for the fourth straight month, the reduced trade deficit provided another indication of renewed strength in the manufacturing sector. The growing competitiveness of American manufacturers in world markets, combined with oil prices below $25 a barrel, has now produced four straight monthly deficits of less than $5 billion. 
 The deficit was $4.79 billion in May, $4.51 billion in April and $4.07 billion in March, when a surge in exports to the European Community produced a sharp drop in the deficit.
 
Annual Rate Is Shrinking
 As a result, the seasonally adjusted trade deficit during the first half of the year was accumulating at an annual rate of just $60 billion, compared with $102 billion last year.
"This year we're going to get the full benefit of the improvement in manufactures," said Stephen L. Cooney, the director of international investment and finance at the National Association of Manufacturers, a Washington-based trade group. "You're getting a double whammy on the good side this year."
Exports of manufactured goods expanded strongly last year, but this was masked by a large increase in the cost of the nation's oil imports after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990. The deficit in manufactured products has narrowed from $93 billion in 1989 to $73 billion last year and may be as little as $40 billion this year, Mr. Cooney said.
But experts disagree on the extent to which the improvement in trade may also reflect slumping demand for imports in a recession. "These numbers are automatically improved, of course, because of the recession," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research center.
Exports dropped by $400 million in June from May. But exports of manufactured goods in June were slightly above May's level and significantly above the average for the first five months of this year. As for overall imports, they decreased by $1.2 billion.
"The increasing competitiveness of manufactured exports bodes well for additional gains in export sales in the months ahead," Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said today.
 
Effects of an Economic Slump
 Each percentage point drop in the nation's annual economic growth below the long-run trend of 2 percent to 2.5 percent produces roughly a $15 billion improvement in the trade balance, Mr. Bergsten said. So if the economy shows no growth this year, the trade deficit might be comparable to a $100 billion deficit in a year of normal growth.
The deficit last year was $101.72 billion, down from a peak of $152.13 billion in 1987.
The last time the monthly trade deficit fell below $4 billion was in June 1983, when it was $3.96 billion. The last trade surplus was $291 million in April 1982, in the middle of a deep recession.
Mr. Cooney, however, said two-thirds of the improvement in the trade deficit in the first half of this year from the first half of 1990 reflected an increase in exports. Exports grew by $13 billion, while imports fell by only $7.5 billion, he said.
A trade deficit affects Americans in three ways, Mr. Bergsten said.
When the economy is not running at full employment, it represents forgone jobs and output. Persistent trade deficits tend to reduce the value of the dollar on currency markets, driving up the price of foreign travel, imports and those domestic products that compete mainly with imports. And trade deficits also increase the proportion of American assets, from dollar bills to factories and real estate, transferred to foreign control to pay for the extra imports.
Not all industries have fared equally well in trade. Exports of high-technology products, for example, have thrived, rising to $8.9 billion in June from $8.1 billion in May, while imports only crept up to $5.3 billion from $5.1 billion.
 
China Trade Is Issue
 But the trade deficit in textiles and apparel rose to $1.91 billion in June from $1.63 billion in May. Neil H. Hightower, president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, a Washington-based trade group, said in a statement, "Our concern over the recent import growth is heightened by the fact that textile imports continued to climb during the most recent recessionary period while U.S. textile mill shipments were down."
The trade surpluses with Western Europe and Mexico increased in June, but the controversial deficits with Japan and China increased. Imports from Japan exceeded exports by $3.23 billion in June, compared with $2.43 billion the month before.
The United States trade deficit with China rose in June to $1.02 billion from $743.4 million in May. There are efforts in Congress to limit China's access to the United States market but the Bush Administration has indicated it will veto the measures proposed so far.
A decline in imports from Germany increased the trade surplus with Western Europe. The German central bank raised interest rates on Thursday, a move that increases the incentives for international investment there and tends to support the mark's value against the dollar.
The dollar has strengthened somewhat this summer, but not by enough to have a significant effect on trade, Mr. Cooney said.

HEADLINE: Magazine Sale In California

BYLINE: By AP

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 16

 BODY:
A Santa Monica, Calif., trade-magazine publisher has purchased S.F. and Angeles, glossy home-design and fashion monthlies that appeared doomed when their parent company went under last month.
Steve Goldstein said in a telephone interview that he had purchased all of the assets "and none of the liabilities" of the two publications. A sister magazine, California, was not included in the deal. 
 "S.F. and Angeles were pretty much where they were supposed to be, and climbing," he said. "Their problem was high overhead since they shared staff with California, which had offices in New York, and San Diego, L.A., San Francisco."
The three magazines were owned by the Australian Consolidated Press. The publications were closed last month because of declining ad revenue and the recession.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS SUMMARY

 BODY:

Upheaval at Salomon
John H. Gutfreund said he would resign from Salomon Brothers in the wake of the widening scandal involving illegal bidding in the Treasury securities market. The powerful chairman molded the firm into the premier bond-trading house on Wall Street. The firm's president, Thomas W. Strauss, also said he would step down, and Warren E. Buffett, who has a big stake in the firm, said he would step in as chairman temporarily. [Page 1.]
For Gutfreund, the move was a shocking and abrupt end to an otherwise impressive 38-year career. He has led the firm for 13 years and was once dubbed the "King of Wall Street." [33.]
Buffett has a reputation for high integrity, brilliant investing and a caustic attitude regarding the foibles of Wall Street. And with a $700 million investment, he has a big interest in getting Salomon straightened out. [33.]
Salomon still faces many legal and regulatory problems. It is too early to say how they will eventually affect the firm. [44.]
John W. Meriwether did not offer to resign. It is unclear whether the fiercely competitive vice chairman will stay. [44.]
 
 The Economy
The trade deficit narrowed in June to $4.02 billion, the lowest monthly level in eight years, on a resurgence of exports of manufactured goods, low oil prices and shrinking demand for imports, the Commerce Department said. [1.]
Bush said he would sign a bill providing extended unemployment benefits but would block spending of the $5.8 billion. [1.]
Production rose at U.S. factories, mines and utilities for a fourth straight month in July, the Fed said. [34.]
 
 Companies
Mazda is expected to announce details of a new luxury-car division next week that will begin operating in the U.S. in 1994. Mazda hopes to challenge the Infiniti Q-45 and Lexus LS 400. [33.]
Chevron, Mobil, Shell and Texaco agreed to settle a long-running price-fixing case for more than $180 million, California officials said. Each company agreed to pay $45 million. [33.]
Pioneer Hi-Bred's bumpy ride through the 1980's illustrates that the pursuit of wonder products does not necessarily yield wonder profits. [33.]
Orion Pictures has struck a deal with bondholders that will keep it out of bankruptcy court, and the company's shares plunged. John W. Kluge, Orion's majority stockholder, will put in $50 million in exchange for the bondholders forgiving $267 million in debt. [35.]
Electronic Data Systems said it had won its hostile bid for control of SD-Scicon, a British computer services company. [35.]
 
 Markets
The stock market dropped sharply, shaken by the turmoil at Salomon Brothers and some spotty bad news on earnings. The Dow ended at 2,968.02, off 30.41 for the day and 28.18 for the week. [33.]
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed, as dealers kept one eye on new economic data and the other on Salomon. [36.]
The dollar staged another broad advance, with dealers saying the rise reflected relief that rate increases by Germany's central bank failed to attract much buying of the mark. [41.]
Platinum futures prices rose more than $5, ending a three-day string of losses. [41.]
 
 Today's Columns
Many people are scrambling to get a better return with short-term interest rates down to about 5 percent, but in doing so they often expose their principal to risk. Your Money. [34.]
A "magic wheel," which expands and contracts and looks something like a circular accordion, has been patented by a professor of mechanical engineering. Among the strange device's many applications: truck wheels that change diameter to meet the demands of different terrain. Patents. [34.]

HEADLINE: Pretoria Said to Advise Zairian Army

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, Aug. 15

 BODY:
In a sign of the political realignment taking place in Africa, South African military advisers have begun training units of the Zairian Army, Western diplomats said today.
It is believed to be the first time that South Africa has been asked to provide military aid to a black-ruled nation. 
 Zaire has publicly supported trade sanctions and other measures against South Africa until remaining racial barriers are dismantled. But like many sub-Saharan countries, Zaire maintains low-level diplomatic links with Pretoria and even in the 1970's and early 80's, when all African nations said they were shunning South Africa, this country had secret ties to Pretoria and South African produce filled the shelves of Kinshasa's supermarkets.
 
No South African Response
 But an overt military presence is a different matter. The current deployment of about 15 South African Army instructors to train Zairian troops, which has been reported by Western diplomats, marks an important step in South Africa's intensifying efforts to find friends and partners on the continent.
The diplomats said the South Africans had been posted to a military base near Kitona, a town in the southwestern corner of this sprawling Central African country. South African engineers were also sent to build living quarters for the advisers. Officials in the South African trade mission here, who maintain a very low profile, did not return calls over three days and no Zairian officials could be found who said they knew about the South Africans.
It was unclear when the training started, Western diplomats said, but reports of the exercises began to circulate in May and June of this year. Zaire's Army, with about 26,000 troops, is one of the largest on the continent.
Meanwhile, local newspapers here have reported that South African advisers have been involved in the establishment of special units of the Zairian Army -- men known locally as the "hiboux," or owls -- whom they say have been accused of harassing political opponents of Zaire's President, Mobutu Sese Seko.
Zairian Government officials denied that such groups exist.
The growing military ties between South Africa and Zaire come at a time of rising civil unrest here as opponents of Mr. Mobutu have mounted a sustained campaign to force him to allow greater political and social freedom.
During his 26 years as this country's leader, President Mobutu has been adept at enlisting the support of foreign forces to put down armed challenges to his rule. In the mid-1970's, when a rebel force twice sought to take control of Shaba province, a copper-mining region, it was repulsed largely by troops from France, Belgium and Morocco while the United States flew in military supplies.
In an effort to quell the current protests and disturbances, groups of soldiers bearing automatic rifles have been positioned along nearly every thoroughfare. Meanwhile, the Zairian capital is rife with almost daily rumors of attacks by soldiers on unarmed civilians.
These reports could not be independently confirmed.
 
Government and Opposition Feud
 At the moment, a national political conference called to chart Zaire's future has been suspended by feuding between Government and opposition leaders over the selection of delegates. A coalition of 165 opposition groups has accused the Government of vote-rigging and intimidation, a charge that the Prime Minister, Mulumba Lukoji, has strongly denied.
Also unresolved is the question of whether the conference is to be legally binding, as opposition leaders insist, or merely advisory, as President Mobutu wants.
While Zaire's military ties with South Africa are apparently recent, its has long been a steady business partner. South African Airways now schedules direct flights to Lubumbashi, the capital of Zaire's southern region. Since November 1989, South Africans and Zairians no longer need visas to visit each other's countries for two weeks or less. And the two countries are soon expected to establish full diplomatic links.
President Mobutu can use new sources of trade and investment right now. Zaire, once a cold-war flash point, as the United States and the Soviet Union vied for influence in Africa, is no longer so vital an interest to Washington.
As such, Western donors have been increasingly unwilling to overlook shortcomings of the Mobutu Government, accusing the 60-year-old leader of corruption and human rights violations.
Last year, amid allegations of a massacre of several dozen students at the Univerisity of Lubumbashi, the United States Congress voted to cut all military and economic aid to Zaire. Belgium and Canada, two of Zaire's biggest trading partners, have also stopped sending aid money in the wake of the Lubumbashi killings.

HEADLINE: For Fall Travelers, Bargains Aplenty

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
If you are planning a vacation this fall, there will be plenty of bargains. The travel business is still reeling from the recession and the Persian Gulf war, when travel declined sharply. Autumn is a traditionally slow season for travel, anyway, so there may be even more bargains than usual.
But there is an if, and sometimes it's a big if. Bargains usually exist if the consumer can buy tickets in advance and travel in a certain time period. 
 "You'll probably see a barrage of air-fare promotions because demand is so soft," said James. V. Camissa Jr., publisher of Travel Industry Indicators, a newsletter published in Miami. Labor Day to the week before Thanksgiving is traditionally when fares drop 15 to 20 percent below summer rates.
Morton Ehrlich, president of Lifeco Services, a travel management company in New York, said there will be bargains into the fall "for the traveler who can plan a little bit ahead; there will be a lot of deeply discounted fares."
 
Excursion Tickets
 Some of the discounting has already begun. This week British Airways introduced round-trip flights between New York and London for $428 on weekdays and $478 on weekends; departure must be between Oct. 15 and Dec. 13. American Airlines, Continental Airlines and United Airlines, competitors on the trans-Atlantic route, quickly followed.
Tickets must be bought by Sept. 11 and trips must be for 7 to 21 days. The regular fare for tickets bought 30 days in advance is $499 on weekdays and $549 on weekends.
Also, Virgin Atlantic Airways cut economy fares on New York-London flights by about 12 percent. Pan Am reduced fares by 25 percent to most of its destinations this fall as long as tickets are bought by Aug. 31.
Through Sept. 14, USAir is selling weekend excursion tickets to a number of American cities; the tickets are good for a year.
The discount fare between New York and Kansas City, Mo., is $198, compared with the regular fare of $258; a ticket between Washington and Buffalo is $118, compared with the regular fare of $178. To qualify, passengers must fly before noon on Friday and return on Sunday morning or after noon on Monday.
"It's a great time for the consumer," said David S. Paresky, chairman of Thomas Cook Travel in Cambridge, Mass. "You could see some more aggressive air promotions very soon." He cited a discount rate that will be available on round-trip flights between New York and San Francisco on many airlines this fall -- $428 with only two requirements: a 14-day advance purchase and a Saturday night stay.
Cruise lines are also slashing prices for the fall. Carnival Cruise Lines is cutting the fare for a seven-day Caribbean cruise by $300 a person; the new prices will range from $849 to $1,389.
Hotels are trying to increase their occupancy rates by offering special packages, too. For example, most Sheraton hotels in North America are participating in an "endless weekend" promotion that features 50 percent off rates from Thursday through Sunday; with the discount, prices range between $49 and $149 per room per day.
 
Three Nights for $1
 American Airlines Fly Away Vacations has a program through Nov. 15 that combines air fares and hotel rooms in Australia and New Zealand. Travelers flying round trip to Sydney for $1,601 or to Auckland for $1,505, with tickets bought 21 days in advance, get three nights at a hotel and a harbor cruise, all for only $1.
James Pazienza, president of Uni globe Travel in Washington, said, "Most of the travel agencies get faxes from suppliers regularly showing what specials are being run, so the more flexible you are, the greater the opportunity to get savings."
With so many discounts in the offing, experts advise potential travelers to be wary of scams.
"Many a consumer who has gotten a bargain ticket could not fly because the airline is not around," said Alexander Anolik, a lawyer in San Francisco. "So check the bargains with a reliable agent."
 
Don't Pay Cash
 Consumers should also charge their tickets on a credit card, rather than pay by cash or check. If problems arise, the Federal Fair Credit Billing Act gives holders of credit cards the right to refuse to pay for services that are not rendered, as long as they notify the credit-card company within 60 days after receiving the charge.
Also, the types of flights, cruises and accommodations available at discounted prices might not be acceptable to some travelers.
"Be realistic in terms of your own expectations," said Hal Norvell, director of travel-industry relations of the American Association of Retired Persons. "A bargain can often be very expensive if you don't get the value you are seeking."
 
 
FOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION, CALL A TRAVEL AGENT
 If you are looking for travel bargains this fall, it's a good idea to work with a travel agent. Agents have the latest facts about discounts, and they can tell you when a travel company adds or withdraws a discounted rate.
If you want to do preliminary research before you talk to an agent, here are the addresses and phone numbers of some airlines, cruise lines and hotel chains offering discount programs.
British Airways -- 75-20 Astoria Boulevard, Jackson Heights, N.Y. 11370; (800) AIRWAYS.
USAir -- 2345 Crystal Drive, Arlington, Va. 22227; (800) 428-4322.
Carnival Cruise Lines -- 3655 NW 87th Avenue, Miami, Fla. 33178; (305) 599-2600.

American Airlines Fly Away Vacations -- P.O. Box 619616, Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, Tex. 75261; (800) 832-8383.
Thomas Cook Travel, a travel agency that operates nationwide, provides information about discount programs to anyone who calls or writes. The address is 39 John F. Kennedy Street, Cambridge, Mass. 02138; (800) 457-3988.

HEADLINE: Bush Chides Protesters on 'Excesses'

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 16

 BODY:
In a rebuke of disruptive protests, including anti-abortion demonstrations, President Bush today counseled against "excesses" and said that demonstrators sometimes actually harmed their own cause.
Although the President has said he supports the Justice Department's recent decision to intervene on behalf of anti-abortion demonstrators in Wichita, Kan., his remarks today seemed to indicate that he was displeased at the way these and other protestors had behaved. 
 The protests in Kansas, organized by the militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue with the intention of shutting down Wichita abortion clinics, have resulted in nearly 2,000 arrests since late July. The protesters are defying a court order to refrain from blocking the entrances to the clinics, asserting that Federal courts lack jurisdiction to enforce abortion rights.
 
'Within the Law'
 "We've got to understand that some of these things go with the territory, go with my job," Mr. Bush said. "And yet my appeal would be, to those who demonstrate, please do it so it doesn't inconvenience the other person's life, and please do it so it is within the law. Whether it's at an abortion clinic, or whether it's at a protest for AIDS activists, or whatever it may be. Because I'm convinced that the excesses of this work against the cause, whatever it is."
In an interview with Maine reporters this morning at his family's estate here, Mr. Bush apologized to residents of Kennebunkport for any disruption caused by a demonstration today protesting the President's refusal to make available $5.8 billion in unemployment benefits for those who have exhausted the 26 weeks of eligibility.
A few dozen demonstrators from several labor unions in the Northeast held a news conference and then marched to Walker's Point, Mr. Bush's home. Some protesters held signs reading: "Robbing George steals from the jobless to give to savings and loans."
Mr. Bush said he was also worried about a demonstration planned for Labor Day weekend by members of the advocacy group Act-Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.
"Well, Act-Up has a reputation as being less than moderate," he said. "They have every right to exercise their First Amendment rights. But does it trouble me that they might descend on this town, this small little town here, and have some adverse effect on the people here? Yes, it troubles me."
Mr. Bush also said that he was trying not to get overconfident about the 1992 election, despite the narrow field of Democratic opponents so far.
"They'll get their act together," he said. "I think they've come upon a theme: Go after the President on no domestic policy. And I will be retaliating at the proper time."
Later, on the golf course, Mr. Bush mocked the idea that the Democrats were in disarray, pointing out that they were organized enough to attack him.
"It's just terrible," he said, feigning a wounded tone in referring to two of Washington's most powerful Democrats. "They've gotten together under the leadership of Ron Brown and Pamela Harriman. What the heck, what can a guy do?"
 
DOLE CRITICIZES PROTESTS
 WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 (AP) -- The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, today criticized the monthlong anti-abortion protests in his state, saying they had done a "lot of harm" to the anti-abortion cause.
Senator Dole, who opposes abortion, said the Operation Rescue blockades of the three abortion clinics in Wichita should stop because the protesters were "in violation of the law, and I don't think they win many friends with some of their conduct."

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he would sign a bill providing extended benefits for three million people who have been out of work more than half a year but said he would block actual spending of the bill's $5.8 billion in benefits.
He said at a news conference in Kennebunkport, Me., that while he sympathized with the unemployed, he would not carry out the bill because "I won't bust the budget." 
 Mr. Bush said Congress could do more for the unemployed if it cut taxes on capital gains, which "would create jobs almost instantly." He said a strong recovery from the recession depended on having sound fiscal policies and not letting "the Federal Government keep doing what often in the past it's done, recklessly spend money."
 
No Budget Emergency
 Because of the budget act provisions, the legislation gave Mr. Bush the opportunity to take one symbolic step, signing the bill, that was friendly to the unemployed even without the other that would have sent money. He took advantage of that opportunity on a midsummer Friday, when the audience for news is at one of its lowest points all year.
The President said that to show his concern for the unemployed, he would sign the benefits bill Democrats pushed through Congress two weeks ago. "It at least demonstrates I am concerned," he said. He has until midnight Saturday night to sign or veto the bill or let it become law without his signature.
But he said he would not sign the declaration of a budget emergency, which the bill also required before the money could be spent for up to 20 weeks of extended benefits for people who exhausted the basic 26 weeks. Under last year's budget act, both Congress and the President must agree that there is an emergency before the Federal deficit can be increased.
In another effort to cool what the Democrats have seized on as a hot political issue, Mr. Bush insisted he would have carried out a more modest, $3.2 billion proposal from Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader. That bill would have been financed by a Government auction of radio frequencies.
 
Democrats to Try Again
 Congressional Democrats immediately vowed to try again in September after they return from vacation. Today they concentrated on attacking Mr. Bush's decision as unfeeling.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said it was "the height of cynicism" for Mr. Bush to say signing the bill showed his concern for the jobless when he kept them from getting the money.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, sounded a growing Democratic theme when he said the President's decision -- coming after declaring emergencies to aid Kurds, Turks and Israelis -- showed that Mr. Bush was "more concerned about emergencies abroad than emergencies here at home."
Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Long Island Democrat who was the chief House sponsor of the bill, predicted that Congress would pass the measure again when it returns from its August recess. He said this time it would be done in a form that would waive the budget act and require Mr. Bush to veto the bill and face the risk of being overridden if he wanted to block the benefits again.
 
'Possibility' of Override
 In today's news conference, Mr. Bush acknowledged that there was "a possibility" that Congress could muster the two-thirds majorities required to override a veto. The Senate passed the bill on Aug. 1 by a voice vote, with no opposition heard. The House adopted it the next day by a vote of 375 to 45, with even Republicans backing it 118 to 44.
The bill cleared Congress a few hours after the Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate dropped slightly last month, to 6.8 percent from 7 percent. But the report showed that the reason for the improvement was that more people had dropped out of the labor market, not that more workers had jobs. Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House, said that next month Congress would send Mr. Bush "legislation that's going to require a choice" so that the President could not "give with one hand and take back with another, as he's done today."
Mr. Foley told reporters at the Capitol that he hoped Mr. Bush would then join with Congress to "provide the same concern and compassion at home as we provide abroad."
Mr. Bush said the recession was ending, but acknowledged "It's pretty hard to say to someone that's out of work, 'Hey, things are getting better,' not necessarily getting better for their families."
He said some of the statistics were "very good," including unemployment figures for July.
 
Recovery Predicted
 Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, predicted a slow recovery and said, "The economy may or may not be turning the corner, but it will be some time before these workers have any reasonable prospect for going back to work."
Unemployment insurance, which covers about half of all workers, provides compensation for up to 26 weeks in most states. Benefits are about half of past salaries, up to ceilings that vary greatly from state to state. The benefits nationally now average $160 per week. The highest state average last year was $217 a week in Massachusetts, and the lowest was $79 a week in Louisiana.
Current law does provide extended benefits of up to 13 weeks, paid for equally from state and Federal funds. That program can take effect when joblessness among a state's workers who are covered by unemployment insurance reaches 6 percent, or when the rate reaches 5 percent if the level of the uninsured jobless exceeds by one-fifth the average level in that state over the last two years.
Unemployment among insured workers is much lower than the total unemployment rate, and as a result only in Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico were extended benefits being paid when the bill was passed. Since then, Maine has been dropped from that list.
 
Different Standard for States
 Under the bill sent to Mr. Bush, the measuring standard used would be total unemployment, not insured unemployment. In states with 8 percent unemployment, averaged over the last six months, an additional 20 weeks of benefits could be paid. If the law were in effect today, Maine would go back on the list, and Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi and West Virginia would also be added to the states now eligible.
In states with 7 percent unemployment, an extra 13 weeks of benefits could be paid. Workers in the nation's two most populous states, California and New York, would qualify. In states with 6 percent unemployment, 7 additional weeks could be paid, and in all others, an additional 4 weeks of benefits could bne paid.
These changes would be temporary and would expire next July. There are some retroactive payments, so the total number of workers who would be paid is about 3 million. The money would be paid entirely from a Federal trust fund for extended benefits that now has about $8 billion in it.
One other major change in the bill would be permanent. It would make people who leave the armed services eligible for 26 weeks of benefits, instead of the current 13 weeks. They would also be able to start collecting after one week, instead of the current four. Under both changes, they would be treated like civilian workers who leave a job.
Besides Mr. Bush, Senator Dole was the only prominent Republican heard from on the subject today. He accused the Democrats of leaving "America's unemployed in the lurch." He said it was obvious they wanted "A political issue, not a bipartisan solution" when they rejected his bill.
The Democrats' only announced presidential candidate, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, alluded to Mr. Bush's majority in 1988, when he said that of the 3 million whom the bill would have helped, "There are approximately 1.6 million people who voted for George Bush who just found out what he is all about. He is not their President."

An Interest in Interest

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:

The sharp decline in interest rates for money-market deposits and certificates of deposit has sent investors in search of higher rates. Some analysts recommend fixed-income securities like Treasury instruments, which are exempt from state and local income taxes, with maturities of not more than five years. They recommend a "laddering technique" so the securities come due in consecutive years or at other regular intervals. Buying directly from the Treasury saves commission fees. Auction dates are announced in many newspapers and in phone messages at Federal Reserve Banks and branches. Here are the securities available at auction and the most recent average yield.
 
Bills: Maturities are 3 months (5.3%), 6 months (5.39%) and 1 year (5.88%). Minimum purchase $10,000.
 
Notes: Maturities are 2 years (6.94%) to 10 years (7.94%); 2- and 3-year notes can be purchased for $5,000 or for multiples of $5,000; 4- to 10-year notes, for $1,000 or multiples of $1,000.
 
Bonds: The 30-year bond (8.17%) can be purchased for $1,000 or multiples of $1,000.

Run, Mario, Run

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
The hot topic is how the Democrats can win in '92, and Lord, how poor is the outlook. No matter who prognosticates about the future, about the Clintons and the Wilders and the Gores, the consensus seems to be that unseating George Bush will require something akin to multiplying the loaves and fishes.
I'm not worried about figuring out which Democrat can win, because worrying about winning is part of the problem. I want the Democrat who doesn't mind losing for the good of the nation. 
 That's why Mario Cuomo should run.
I've been thinking about this ever since I spent an hour with Paul Tsongas. The former Senator from Massachusetts has a certain droll humor about the fact that he is the only announced Democrat and no one's noticed. "Just because people don't think you can win doesn't mean they're not going to vote for you," he said, sounding like a smart fortune cookie.
I love this idea: Forget about winning and give the people something to vote for. The Democrats don't need a candidate they think can win. They need a candidate who will engage, who will speak with candor and with heat of the overwhelming economic and social problems of this country, who won't approach the podium like a prom date hoping his corsage will match your dress.
George Bush isn't going to be reelected because he's a great leader. He's not. The gulf war glow has faded; the economy is a mess and Americans are desperate for decent jobs, health care, schools and housing.
But Mr. Bush, like Ronald Reagan, is a Teflon President. Even the recession has not dented his popularity, yet if you ask people what he stands for, few can tell you. I still don't know what a thousand points of light are, and I don't care.
"More than metaphors," should be the Democratic slogan in 1992. And Mario Cuomo should be the candidate.
There are problems with a Cuomo candidacy. Mr. Cuomo will carry the millstone of New York State; he will be held accountable for everything from Eastern liberalism to the A train. He has no foreign policy experience, unless you count once running for mayor of New York City.
But Mr. Cuomo is this country's most eloquent elected official, and he will engage. He is the kind of man who will argue, not only about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but about whether they're doing the mambo, and whether they are doing it right. He could run a substantive campaign, a campaign that takes on George Bush's empty platitudes and policies and sets a clear agenda for a party that has lost its way in a welter of polling and positioning. If Mr. Cuomo was the candidate, the Presidential debates could be more than talking podiums.
The Republicans might still prevail. But there would have been a race, a contest, a real national debate over who we are and what we want, instead of a consumer survey on dueling slogans. And the Democrats would have left footprints -- maybe not to the White House, but footprints nonetheless.
Mr. Cuomo's dark and complex personality is ill suited to a popularity contest. He has a self-righteous streak that detractors say will do him in on the national stage; he is the kind of man who, when described as self-righteous, will call to tell you you're wrong about that. He rarely admits mistakes; what that means is that he sticks with some positions he should modify, and sticks with others, like his often unpopular opposition to the death penalty, that are worth sticking with. To say he is principled is an understatement. He can also be unlikable.
His virtues are not cuddly: a great mind, a keen sense of right and wrong, an ability to get to the heart of an argument. He communicates the agita of the immigrant child who simultaneously sees the dream gone wrong and believes it can come true. His patience with handlers would be short, his patience with pap and obfuscation shorter still. He is not politic, an odd thing for a politician and maybe a refreshing thing, too.
The Democrats need to stop worrying about winning and start concentrating on speaking up, on fighting hard, on setting their own agenda, on giving people something to vote for for a change. By stature, intellect and disposition, Mr. Cuomo is best qualified to do that. And so he should.

HEADLINE: George Washington Acted on His Anti-Slavery Convictions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 29 article about a long-forgotten member of the Virginia planter aristocracy, Robert Carter 3d, who arranged for the manumission of his slaves, erroneously suggests that George Washington did not feel similarly "compelled to extend freedom to the dark-skinned people" under his ownership. 
 All of Washington's slaves were set free in December 1800, pursuant to a provision in the general's will. In the words of James Thomas Flexner, Washington's biographer, the country's first President "proved to be the only Virginia founding father to free all his slaves."
Mr. Flexner's voluminous writings on Washington trace a growing anxiety, leading to obsession, with the moral and practical dilemmas posed by slavery. At some point in Washington's early adulthood, he made a decision not to buy and sell slaves, choosing rather to encourage his slaves to marry and lead some sort of settled family life.
The practical effects of this decision led to Washington's eventually having to support a large, unproductive slave population, consisting of the very young and the very old, several times larger than what would have been needed to perform the labor at Mount Vernon and his other properties. But his convictions forbade any attempts at breaking up families, and he never wavered from his early decision against participating in the slave trade.
Like virtually all of his contemporaries, Washington was baffled by the question of how slaves could be set free and, in effect, set adrift in a society that was ill prepared to absorb them. On a public level, according to Mr. Flexner, Washington supported Alexander Hamilton's financial proposals because the kind of mercantile economy Hamilton envisioned "had no need for slavery."
Privately, Washington entertained thoughts about renting his properties to English farmers, who would then have been expected to hire as field workers the slaves who were freed when his properties were put up for lease. He also experimented with a kind of vocational training that would have given his slaves at least a minimal training in the skills and trades that might make them employable in a fully free society.
In the end, Washington had to settle for a blanket manumission. Under the terms of his will (Washington died on Dec. 14, 1799), all of his slaves were to be set free when his wife died. He further required his heirs to feed and clothe all aged and ailing former slaves as long as they remained living. Mrs. Washington freed all of the slaves more than a year before her own death, and the Washington family continued making payments of various kinds to former slaves until 1833.

HEADLINE: On Language;
Chinese Relations

BYLINE: BY NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; Nicholas D. Kristof is chief of The New York Times bureau in Beijing. William Safire is on vacation.

 BODY:
ARABIC IS A RICH language. There are words for losing one's children, for a carriage taking a virgin into battle, for a disease striking camels in the head. But when I was sweltering in Cairo in the early 1980's, while studying Arabic, what struck me most was that there was only one word, talg, that refers, if somewhat hazily, to either ice or snow.
At the time I was yearning for a good talg-fall in Cairo, I learned that the Eskimo language has several dozen words for "snow." Which makes perfect sense: the diversity in a language reflects the interests and obsessions of the society speaking it. As a continuing student of the Chinese language, I find that Chinese is especially rich in the specific areas one would expect, given the culture. 
 There are at least 19 words for silk, for example, and 8 for rice. Why? Well, gao refers to a tough, white silk; qi is a patterned silk; qian is a blue-red silk fabric; kuang is uncombed silk thread; si is regular silk thread; chou is another term for silk fabrics, and so on. As for rice, fan refers to the cooked product; dao to the rice when it is still in the paddy; xian to long-grained rice; mi to the husked kernels, and, in some dialects, gu means unhusked kernels.
Since the Chinese care even more for their families than they do for their rice or silk, there is a profusion of words for relations. For instance, Chinese has five words for "uncle." It depends on whether he is your father's older or younger brother, or your mother's brother, or your father's sister's husband, or your mother's sister's husband. In English, the word "cousin" is applied to males as well as females, older people as well as younger people, maternal as well as paternal relations. Not so in Chinese; the rules that apply to "uncle" also apply to "cousin."
When Americans hurl abuse at each other, they sometimes question each other's paternity or bring in each other's mothers. But the Chinese denounce uncles and grandfathers as well as parents, and one common insult calumniates the preceding 18 generations of the accursed one's family.
Chinese has about two dozen expressions for "wife," but in this case the richness of the language doesn't indicate any special esteem. On the contrary, most of the terms are unflattering: "the inside person," "the old woman," "the one on the bed," "the children's mother," "the cook." One reason for the many expressions may be that until early this century it wasn't unusual for peasant women not to have given names. As they grew up, they were identified by numbers: second sister, fourth sister and so on.
"My mother didn't have a name, as far as I know," says an octogenarian friend who grew up in the countryside. I asked him what his father called his mother, and his brow furrowed. Then his face lighted up. " 'Hey,' " he said triumphantly. "He called her 'Hey.' "
Where English is particularly rich, and Chinese poor, is in the areas of science and democracy -- the two slogans that since 1919 have been a rallying cry for change. Indeed, "science" and "democracy" are sometimes known as S  Xiansheng (Mr. S) and D Xiansheng (Mr. D), to signify that they are foreign guests who still have not taken up Chinese residency.
Although law, fa, is an ancient concept in China, it historically wasn't a champion of individual rights but a means of punishment. Indeed, the only area of the law in which the Chinese language distinguishes itself is in the designation of punishments. Gua refers to execution by slicing (a convict literally cut into pieces); yi refers to the cutting off of a felon's nose. (Both are mercifully no longer judicial sentences.)
Most of China's political vocabulary is relatively recent. Chinese expressions for "freedom," "politics," "democracy" and "economy" are all only about a century old. And words like "individualism" or "privacy" still have a negative connotation in Chinese, reflecting the traditional lack of concern for individual rights.
"This is a factional language, based on groups rather than individuals, and an inclusive language," says Geremie Barme, an Australian scholar whose mastery of the Chinese language gives other foreigners the "red eye disease" (one of the many expressions for "jealousy").
What's an inclusive language? In English, we tend to hold each other verbally at arm's length; it's the opposite in Chinese. Friends address each other as "Big Brother" or "Big Sister," as a sign of respect, and children are required to address adults who are friends or acquaintances of the family as "Auntie" or "Uncle." This has to be done carefully, however. I once disconcerted a Chinese friend by calling her "Little Sister" -- often a prelude to a pickup.
The two ways of saying "we" in Chinese help explain the usefulness of an inclusive expression. The first kind, women (pronounced waugh-mun), refers to the speaker and one or more other people but doesn't include the person being addressed. The second kind, zamen, includes the person being addressed. Thus, a young woman going out with her boyfriend might tell her parents that "women are leaving," but a group of boys flirting with some girls will suggest that "zamen go to a movie." By comparison, English looks rather aloof and threadbare for lacking an inclusive "we." But never mind. Za men have another area, besides science and democracy, where English triumphs: sex.
English seems to have far more words that are sex-related than contemporary Chinese. (Ancient Chinese pornography is another matter, but that rich vocabulary has been largely forgotten.) No one knows if this is because Americans are obsessed with sex or because the Chinese take lots of cold showers -- hot-water heaters still being a rarity in China. A researcher of sexuality in Shanghai is stumped by the linguistic challenge of polling Chinese about their sexual practices. There are no common expressions for "foreplay" or "orgasm," and so surveys must resort to vaguer terms that people will at least understand. Instead of inquiring about the frequency of "a sexual high tide" -- the technical term for "climax" -- the surveys simply ask women how often they enjoy "a pleasant feeling."
It would be rash to draw conclusions on what this says about the Chinese, especially when there are more than 1.1 billion of them. Still, it's nice to know that English has the edge in a few areas. Science. Democracy. Sex. A language could do worse.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
It's a Tough Job, but Somebody's Got to Want It

BYLINE: By HILARY DE VRIES; Hilary de Vries writes about theater and film for The Los Angeles Times and other publications.

 BODY:
When Andre Bishop, artistic director of Playwrights Horizons, was named the new head of Lincoln Center Theater in March, he seemed the logical choice: the leader of one of Off Broadway's most successful theaters was simply moving to a larger complex Off Broadway.
Mr. Bishop's appointment, after a two-month search, is the most visible in a number of job shifts now occurring in the nation's regional theaters. In Lincoln Center's case, they got their man. But within the last year 14 not-for-profit theaters have put up "help wanted" signs for their top artistic jobs -- and in some cases, the postman has rung only once, if at all. 
 At a time of tight money and increasing deficits, when an artistic director has to wear a number of hats, the vacancies -- at such theaters as the Cincinnati Playhouse, the Dallas Theater Center, the New Mexico Repertory Theater and the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco -- prompt questions about the future of not-for-profit theater in this country.
"There is a real tenuousness to the industry now," says one managing director who requested anonymity. "All this shifting around of artistic directors is deadly to a sense of personal artistic vision. When a director leaves, the continuity of the theater becomes the responsibility of the trustees and not the artists. More and more it is a question of 'Here's our theater. Can you run it?' "
That scenario, some say -- especially when it involves retirement by a theater's artistic founder -- may slowly but surely be transforming the nature of American regional theater from a place of idiosyncratic art to a committee-run institution in which directors will be looked upon more as employees than as leaders.
But for the short term, filling the vacancies is a priority. "There are not enough artistic directors to go around," says Zelda Fichandler, co-founder of the Arena Stage in Washington and artistic director of the Acting Company in New York. "The question is, Can we find enough new people willing and able to take on the demands of the job?"
At first glance, a job description that may include courting some of the country's top playwrights and actors, and attending gala openings while mingling with a community's financial elite can sound like a dream. But this cluster of vacancies comes at a particularly critical juncture -- when a recession economy and cuts in Federal, state and private arts support are forcing theaters to shorten seasons, reduce operations and mount more conservative repertories, which hamper artistic innovation. Though theaters, like other arts organizations, have weathered adverse economies before, the recession, magnified by the cutbacks in arts support, has had the effect of a one-two punch that many directors have never experienced. While the 300-plus regional theaters provide more work for artists than the commercial theater, almost half the regionals now operate in the red, with budget deficits ranging from a few thousand dollars to more than half a million dollars annually. Last year seven theaters, unable to bridge the gap, closed.
For a number of stage directors, running a not-for-profit theater -- even at a salary that can range from $25,000 to above $100,000 -- is less and less about artistry and more and more about managing a business venture in which the needs of actors, playwrights and directors may at times be secondary. Regional theaters are no longer tiny pioneering stages. Most are multimillion-dollar institutions with hefty subscriber lists, extensive boards of directors, large administrative staffs, impressive budgets -- and, too often, impressive deficits. As one regional board member put it: "We are looking for an artist who can also be a C.E.O."
The recent rash of vacancies -- from resignations, retirements, deaths and, in some cases, terminations -- is occurring at large prestigious theaters like Lincoln Center, where annual budgets can reach $14 million, as well as at smaller companies, like the Seattle Group Theater, that operate on several hundred thousand dollars a year.
Almost all theater boards have created managing director positions to reduce the growing administrative tasks. But the artistic director of a regional theater -- unlike the director of a major orchestra or ballet company, who is often free of such duties -- is required to select and stage a season, direct several productions, oversee extensive fund-raising and marketing campaigns, negotiate medical and other union benefits, and at the same time manage a large staff.
"You are expected to be both a Balanchine and a Lincoln Kirstein," says David Chambers, an associate professor at the Yale University School of Drama and former chairman of the theater panel of the National Endowment for the Arts. "But one of the questions I think we have to ask is whether anyone's work has gotten better because they've served as an artistic director. In most instances, it has not."
According to Peter Zeisler, executive director of the Theater Communications Group, the service organization for not-for-profit theater, "These are just less attractive jobs now. There isn't one theater that has more money this year than it had last year, and we are beginning to see artistic directors stepping down simply because of these limited and declining resources." According to his organization's figures, endowment grants to theaters have fallen below the rate of inflation for the last five years. Last year, collectively, they fell by 5 percent. In addition, many states, including New York and New Jersey, have cut their arts budgets from as much as 30 to 80 percent -- "draconian" amounts, Mr. Zeisler says.
In a number of recent interviews with directors leaving theaters this year, one of the most frequently cited reasons was financial pressure.
David Frank, the artistic director of the Studio Theater in Buffalo (budget: $3 million; deficit: $500,000), resigned this year after 11 seasons. "There have been radical shifts in our theater's financial dynamics," he says (this year's budget is $600,000 less than last year's). "We've all had to contract, do smaller, more conservative shows. I realized this was not the theater where I was going to get to do my 'Hamlet.' "
Charles Towers, who left the Virginia Stage Company (budget: $1.2 million; deficit: $500,000) in June when his contract lapsed, says: "We all grew up thinking that regional theaters were a continuously expanding operation. But every city in the country may not be able to afford a regional theater today." (The Stage Company's current budget is $800,000 less than last year's.)
Several second-generation artistic directors -- namely Garland Wright at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Des McAnuff at the La Jolla Playhouse in California and Robert Falls at the Goodman Theater in Chicago -- have made long-term commitments to their institutions while continuing to create innovative work. But the overall challenge remains -- how to maintain a theater's vigor and purpose at a time when fiscal and artistic challenges are redefining the role of the theaters and their artistic directors.
To date, four of the 14 theaters seeking artistic directors this year have found replacements. Ten are still searching for new artistic leaders to replace directors who have retired (such as Edward Hastings from the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco) or moved on to larger theaters or other arts organizations (such as Stan Wojewodski Jr., who left the Center Stage in Baltimore to take over the Yale Repertory Theater, and Ruben Sierra, founder of the Seattle Group Theater, who now works for the California Institute of Arts). In some instances, there have been unforeseen, and occasionally acrimonious, departures (such as Worth Gardner's resignation from the Cincinnati Playhouse in June). In the case of two theaters -- the Dallas Theater Center (including the Arts District Theater) and the Indiana Repertory Theater -- the deaths of the directors have prompted the search.
Although the causes of these departures are different -- and indeed the theater sizes range from 2,000 subscribers at the Seattle Group Theater to 16,000 at the American Conservatory Theater -- there are several common factors in seeking replacements.
In most cases theaters conduct a campaign for a new director by setting up a search committee. Frequently boards hire independent arts consultants to aid the search, which can begin with a list of dozens of names -- many of them directors whose work the boards will not have seen. Although the lists are frequently made up of freelance and existing artistic directors, because so many theaters are seeking new leadership, the boards are increasingly considering actors, dramaturgs, designers and even playwrights as candidates. "A lot of people want these jobs because there's no freelance work out there," says Ms. Fichandler. "But I don't think scene designers and dramaturgs are that qualified. An artistic director should, ideally, be a director." While no one would speak for attribution, it is not uncommon for theaters to settle for their second or third choices when the more in-demand directors decline these jobs for better prospects.
And then there is the allure of Hollywood: Andrew Shea, the founder of the New Mexico Repertory Theater, resigned this spring after eight years at the helm to pursue a career in film and television. Last year, he says, "I looked carefully at the resources in this community available to support this theater and what I found in New Mexico was very, very slow -- if any -- growth."
Under Mr. Shea's direction the theater has grown from a $500,000-a-year fledgling operation ("where I personally typed the letters to all potential donors") to a $1.4 million company serving two communities -- Santa Fe and Albuquerque. The theater has no operating deficit, but Mr. Shea trimmed this year's budget by more than $300,000. "The recession is terrible here," he says, "and there are no major corporate donors in the state. I got to the point where I wondered if all the time I was spending on cultivating donors and grant makers wasn't better spent on developing my own work."
Several departing artistic directors say that financial difficulties are only part of a larger problem -- how to preserve a theater's original artistic intent.
"We've become no different from summer stock or the commercial theater -- we're simply playing for zip codes," says Gary Gisselman, who resigned as artistic director of the Arizona Theater Company this year to take over the Children's Theater Company in Minneapolis. "The big problem in regional theater today is how do we define success, and the most common answers are percentage of capacity and bottom line. I finally had to ask myself why I was here."
The focus should always be on artistic vision, insists Mr. McAnuff of the La Jolla Playhouse. "It is possible to get access to the expertise you need to run a multimillion-dollar theater. You should be able to have a partner in your managing director."
At the Goodman Theater in Chicago the idea of teamwork was expanded to include two associate artistic directors in addition to Mr. Falls, the artistic director. That troika was seen by some arts consultants as a model for other large regional theaters. But for smaller, poorer companies, multiple directorships remain prohibitively expensive.
For many artistic directors, the rewards of running a regional theater, be it large or small, continue to outweigh the challenges.
"It's still a great job," says Richard Hamburger, artistic director of the Portland Stage Company in Maine (budget: $1 million; deficit in 1990: $20,000). "It's definitely a harder job. But the feeling we have is that this financial adversity will pass. And running a theater is the only way you can create a body of work within a community that can share your vision."

By Any Name, Roseanne Is Roseanne Is Roseanne

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Ladies and gentlemen, meet the first, er, lady of Prime-Time Television, Roseanne Barr. Wait a minute. Make that Roseanne Arnold.
Whether as Barr or Arnold, Roseanne clearly loves to keep friends, fans and enemies off balance. She is not easy. She has cast aside many of the people who were crucial to her initial success, including her manager and agent. A prototypical outsider -- she grew up in Utah as a Jew who attended Mormon services -- she thumbs her nose at the Hollywood establishment and, indeed, all establishments. But even in that, she is not predictable; Roseanne promised her second husband, Tom Arnold, that she would take his name if he converted to Judaism, and has now asked to be referred to as Mrs. Arnold. 
 The comedienne has gone down a bumpy and often dangerous road in the five years since her career began taking off nationally. It has been a journey that, in all likelihood, would have destroyed any other entertainer. She has certainly paid a public-relations price.
This year, once again, the good citizens who confer the Emmy Awards have failed even to nominate Roseanne Arnold or her hit television show "Roseanne." But their uppity insult serves only to make the Emmys (which will be given out next Sunday, in a ceremony to be broadcast live on the Fox network at 8 P.M.) all the more irrelevant.
In an era of skinny worship, she unapologetically vacillates between being fat and very fat, bragging with Rabelaisian gusto of her active sex life. After screeching her way through the National Anthem at a baseball game last summer, she even had George Bush denouncing her as "disgraceful."
Professing to be a militant feminist, she makes many prominent feminists uneasy, in some instances, apparently, because she's not terribly, well, feminine. An outspoken supporter of rights for gay men and lesbians, she can make wisecracks that leave both of those groups wincing. She refuses to take men seriously ("They are so funny to me, I just find them hysterical"). And her raucous antics, public and private, are calculated affronts to middle-class propriety.
One fact, no doubt unsettling to the Emmy-conferring Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, just won't go away. Despite the fervent ill wishes of many bruised egos on the sidelines, "Roseanne," on Tuesday nights at 9 on ABC, continues to be one of commercial television's biggest hits, this past season remaining in the top 10, more often in the top 5 (detractors are often reduced to sputtering that it could have been a bigger hit).
For three years now, some experts, taking note of backstage chaos, have been predicting the demise of the show. In a recent magazine poll, posing the question: "Which of the following people, if any, would you least like to take a very long ride with?" Mrs. Arnold was first, ahead of Andrew Dice Clay.
But, obviously, a good many people out there like her. The ratings, as advertisers attest, can't be ignored. Who connects with this fiercely independent, caustic and difficult woman? The demographics indicate that her most loyal fans are women between the ages of 18 and 34. But that doesn't tell you much. The comic Alan King, on his Comedy Central interview series called "Inside the Comedy Mind," came closer when, opening a recent session with Mrs. Arnold, he rattled off a list of viewers she supposedly represents:
"The hopeless underclass of the female sex. Polyester-clad, overweight occupants of the slow track. Fast-food waitresses, factory workers, housewives -- members of the invisible pink-collar army. The despised, the jilted, the underpaid."
Mrs. Arnold, her face lighting up with delight, said, "In other words, the coolest people." At the end of the half hour, Mr. King reminded Roseanne that she had once described herself as "one happy fat" woman. Would she stick with that? Laughing, Roseanne said she would only add two words: "One happy, smart, fat, rich" woman. Don't underestimate the "smart" element. Tackle Roseanne Arnold at your own risk.
Arsenio Hall got a taste of her wrath in January in a Home Box Office special called "Roseanne: Live From Trump Castle." Near the end of the embarrassingly messy show -- she said it was meant to be a takeoff of aging stars doing glitzy Las Vegas turns, but nobody got the joke -- the comedienne announced that she was fed up with Mr. Hall constantly using her as the butt of insulting fat jokes. She proceeded to issue a warning in the form of a capsule autobiography:
"I'm 37 years old. I've got four kids. I'm Jewish and I was raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. I was raised a Mormon and my dad sold crucifixes door-to-door to Mexicans. When I was 7, I fell down and bit off my whole lip and had to have that sewn back on. When I was 16, I got hit by a car and got my head impaled on the hood ornament. I got pregnant the first time I ever had sex. My parents made me give her up for adoption. I found her 18 years later after her face was splashed across the front page of The National Enquirer. Spent eight months in a state mental institution. Hitchhiked across country three times all by myself -- with hepatitis. Lived in a car, a cabin and a cave. Married a guy just because he had a [bleep] bathtub. Had three more kids. He treated me like [bleep] for 16 years and when I finally had the guts to dump that s.o.b., I have to pay him half the money I make for the rest of my goddamn life."
The message to Mr. Hall: You want to mess with me? Don't even think about it. I've been through it all, and I'm as tough as they come.
All of which seems belligerently clear enough, but then there are the inevitable Roseanne contradictions. During the same act, she sarcastically offered to say one nice thing about Mr. Hall: "It's not that often that we get to see a black nerd on television." Hoots from the audience. Then the Roseanne kicker: "I mean most nerds are white people, like you." More laughter, this time with a nervous edge. Then, inevitably, a month or so ago, Mrs. Arnold appeared on "The Arsenio Hall Show," and host and guest positively cooed over each other, promising to get together more often. The not to be overlooked upshot: Mr. Hall is no longer telling Roseanne fat jokes.
Autobiography is an integral part of the Roseanne routine. The dividing line between the performer and woman is just about invisible. Her early "domestic goddess" act was all the more hilarious for its quite evident authenticity. And even stuffed into the formula of a sitcom, the comedienne transcends the working-class housewife character of Roseanne Conner with her own unmistakable personality.
The series had its gestation in a 1987 HBO special that, tongue in cheek, constructed a sitcom framework around her stand-up performance. The current ABC series carries the credit "created by Matt Williams" but "developed by" would be more apt.
Mrs. Arnold herself is clearly the creator in this territory. Much of the off-camera tumult has stemmed from her dissatisfaction with producers and writers she considered too bound to the traditional rules, or cliches, of weekly sitcom. Saying that she was being reduced to little more than zingy one-liners, she has insisted that more of her own concerns be allowed to emerge in the scripts.
She has not been, to put it mildly, diplomatic. One executive producer, Jeff Harris, announced his 1990 departure with a large ad inVariety: "I have chosen not to return to the show next season. Instead, my wife and I have decided to share a vacation in the relative peace and quiet of Beirut." The star's subsequent comment: "Yeah, they're not going to think you're very funny in Beirut, either."
This past season, Mrs. Arnold said that the series was trying to recruit writers among comics who have never written for television, people who "are off the beaten track and are real angry." In fact, much to the consternation of her detractors, the show is generally better (although some of the scripts attributed to Tom Arnold have been noticeably ragged). Beneath the sitcom surface, beyond the family crises that can be tidily solved in 22 minutes, "Roseanne" can be slyly subversive.
This sitcom simply refuses to act like most of the others. Here is a show on which, not infrequently, people don't have enough money to buy things -- right in the heart of Consumerland. This particular family is strong enough to admit that they don't always like one another very much. Dan (John Goodman) is a construction worker who can't always find work. Roseanne has led a factory strike, been unemployed and now struggles along as a minimum-wage waitress in a coffee shop. She and the show don't bat an eye when her boss (Martin Mull) casually reveals that he is gay.
This is not "Leave It to Beaver," obviously. It's also not "All in the Family." Far from being a dingbat like Edith Bunker, Roseanne Conner is in charge, and her big teddy-bear of a husband, still clearly lusting for her, couldn't be happier. Mrs. Arnold has acknowledged some debt to Jackie Gleason, another top banana who never got even an honorary award from the Emmy people, but his Ralph Kramden was a considerably safer character than the militant Roseanne Conner.
Writing in The New Republic magazine, Barbara Ehrenreich describes Mrs. Arnold's stance as "proletarian feminism," something that is not "a professional, careerist woman's thing." In The National Review, on the other hand, Jim Atkinson, referring to the comedienne as "the Hulk Hogan of feminism," perceives her as "a cunning marketeer who has figured out how to parlay a form of vulgar reverse sexism into stardom." Tom Arnold, grinning affably during a television interview, put still another spin on the Roseanne phenomenon: "We're America's worst nightmare -- white trash with money."
There are those among her former and present colleagues who insist that Mrs. Arnold thrives on discord, working best in conditions of turmoil. There is always the possibility that, at any given moment, she may stumble across the threshold of career disintegration. One thing is certain: she will not sit still long enough to be pigeonholed.
 
 
RARELY A DULL MOMENT
 Some of the more memorable events in Roseanne Barr's life as a star:
October 1988: "Roseanne" has its debut on ABC and becomes one of the top three series on TV.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Motel Guests And Security

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
THE issue of personal safety in budget-rate motels has been thrust to the forefront. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported on a $10 million settlement made by Motel 6 on a woman who was attacked, robbed and raped in 1988 by two ex-convicts at one of the chain's motels in Fort Worth.
A week later, the victim, using the pseudonym "Mary," appeared on the Larry King Live show on CNN along with a former Fort Worth police chief and a security consultant from New York. 
 Motel 6 declined to talk to The Times about the case, except to say that the safety and security of guests was the essence of the hospitality industry. The chain has the largest share of business in the "budget" category, according to Ida Simmons of D. K. Shifflet, a travel research company in McLean, Va.
A number of security experts interviewed for this article pointed out that the safety of a motel guest depends not only on the security offered by the individual motel but also on its location: If the motel is in a high-crime area, it will hold the same risks as neighboring businesses and public areas. "A sign is not a guarantee of safety," said Anthony G. Marshall, dean of the School of Hospitality Management of Florida International University.
In motels, it is impossible to assess the likelihood of crime either by chain name or by price level, according to Charles G. Slepian, a New York lawyer and security consultant who says he has advised every major chain. Hotels and motels consider their crime statistics proprietary information, he said. "But my gut feeling is that the rate is a lot smaller for the hotel and motel industry overall than for apartment houses, shopping malls, theaters and parking lots," Mr. Slepian said.
"It may be the safest part of the commercial world because of the landlord's obligation to care for the guest, a duty under law that goes back to the Middle Ages."
Like others who deal with hoteliers' legal liabilities, Mr. Marshall emphasized that a motel had to exercise "reasonable care" for the safety of its guests. This is based on what the motel has experienced in the past, so that a luxury hotel with a clientele that is likely to carry valuable jewelry might be expected to have room safes. Or a budget motel with a history of burglaries might be expected to have window grilles.
It was the breach of this responsibility to provide for the guest's safety, of course, that led to the Fort Worth negligence suit after the two ex-convicts, who had been loitering around the motel, barged into the room when the guest opened the door to leave for supper, raped her repeatedly, stole her professional camera equipment and drove off in her auto.
 
Assessing Risk
There are questions that prospective guests can ask to help them assess their risk, and there are practical measures to safeguard against attacks in the parking lot and break-ins and thefts in the hallway.
If a motel is very inexpensive and is in a high-crime area, it is probably wise to pass by; no action by the motel that does not violate basic liberties is likely to be adequate to keep drug dealers from renting rooms, or to prevent criminals from preying on guests in a place where drugs or prostitution are prevalent. And one hotelier said that people loitering in the parking lot should "send up your antenna." Mr. Slepian said, "If there are steel bars and plates of glass between you and the room clerk, it puts you on notice."
If you do not like what you see, and you have guaranteed your reservation with a credit-card number, call from down the road and cancel it. Even after 6 P.M., some motels will not penalize you.
Asking a motel on the phone if it has security guards is bootless, the experts agree. If there are guards they're unlikely to be on duty around the clock all week.
The Fort Worth case raises the question of whether women traveling alone, who are more vulnerable to sex crimes, would be smarter to stay in higher-priced places with enclosed parking areas, avoiding economy lodgings altogether. Because 38 percent of business travelers today are women, this question affects many people on the road.
Most of the experts responded that higher price was no automatic guarantee. The question of the surroundings was considered a better way to judge.
Women who travel on business say they prefer a brightly lighted fenced outdoor parking lot to an underground park-it-yourself garage, where you may end up parking a long way from the elevator entrance.
As for room locale, if it is next to the motel office, it may not be so quiet as elsewhere, but it may enhance your ability to get help if you need it.
 
Suspiciously Cheap
 A room rate that is too low should be a warning: at the range of $12 to $20, no matter where you are, one hotelier said, the motel is probably not hiring staff of a caliber that will be alert to dangers, to broken locks and doorknobs, to missing bars for sliding doors. The margin has been cut too thin.
Small rural motels where the proprietors do the cleaning, mow the lawn and run the front office are a different matter, but larger motels under $20 a night may clear a profit in ways that do not augur well for safety: advertising rooms for rent by the hour, for example.
If the place appears clean, safe and well-lighted, there are other things to check. Rooms that open off a corridor entered with a key give better privacy.
Many new inside-corridor motels are built with only one entrance -- past the front desk, which also enhances safety.
Door chains are of use only if they will not rip out under great pressure. Separate deadbolts into the door frame, in addition to doorknob locks, are much better. Mr. Marshall said that 95 percent of all hotels have them now.
The standard metal key with an engraved room number is a virtual invitation to thieves. If all a motel provides is the doorknob and a key, and there is a break-in, insurers and judges in Florida, Texas and Wisconsin have decided in guests' favor. Ray Ellis, head of risk management for the American Hotel and Motel Association, advised his members that if they provided only a doorknob and a key, and were involved in break-ins, "you settle out of court."
If the keys have been cross-coded so that the number is not the same as the room number, you are better off. Doors that open with electronic punch cards are recoded after each occupancy and the previous guest cannot get into your room.
At Sleep Inns, the budget category in the Choice Hotels chain, you enter both the corridor and your room by inserting your own credit card into an electronic slot. The 10 Sleep Inns are all new and these lock systems cost $500 a room, according to Bob Hazard, chief executive officer of Choice Hotels. He used a customary industry estimate that each $1,000 of expense to build a room results in a $1 increase in the room rate. Others in the hotel business say it has now probably reached $2.
To go back and redo an older lock system this way would cost $650 a room, Mr. Hazard estimated, which might mean a nightly rate increase of $2 to $ 4: You are not likely to find such gadgets at an old $18 motel.
Every guest room door should have a peephole; it is a trivial expense. Whatever the key, it is no help if you open your door to a stranger.

HEADLINE: LINCOLN CENTER;
New York: City of Commerce

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Paul Goldberger's essay "A Shot of Cultural Adrenaline at Lincoln Center" [July 28] very reluctantly accepts "Faustian pacts with the world of private real-estate development": "We like to pretend that our cultural institutions are clean and pure, not sullied by their connections to commerce." The "pact" was the financing of new facilities for Lincoln Center through a new condominium development on its property. 
 Mr. Goldberger's essay is replete with diatribes about "watching real-estate developers get rich for two decades" and a cultural "institution whose real estate has made profits for so many others."
Such specious attacks on "commerce" in a city that is by its nature, predominantly, a commercial center and whose cultural activities are greatly dependent upon the prosperity of its commercial base is indicative of the economic illiteracy that pervades much of the city. The availability of an adequate return on investment, pejoratively known as "profit," is as essential to a healthy future for New York as any environmental concern. Certainly this should now be crystal clear considering the current high level of investment without return. The consequent damaging effect on city revenues and fiscal conditions has already resulted in substantial (and could lead to more severe) cutbacks in social services, education and, yes, cultural activities.
The essay continuously rails against the 60-story condominium tower, which enabled Lincoln Center facilities to be improved. But the residences in this one building represent a meaningful proportion of the meager 6,000 apartments for which construction permits were filed during all of last year, despite the city's extremely deficient and overaged housing supply.
I, and all the developers I know, could not care less about these constant vituperations against us, in particular, and development, in general. But 7.5 million people live in this city and 8 million work here, and they are dependent on its commerce and its housing supply.
Mr. Goldberger concludes by calling for a strengthening of "the city's cultural presence at a moment when the need could not be more urgent." Even more urgent is the need for understanding that this can be accomplished only through stimulating -- rather than haranguing -- the city's development and economy.
 
SEYMOUR B. DURST
New York
 
The writer is the chief executive officer and president of the Durst Organization, a real-estate development company.
 
 Paul Goldberger replies: Mr. Durst has read my piece with such a bias that he missed the point altogether. He is so defensive about the role of real estate in New York that he accuses me of "haranguing" real-estate developers and attacking the profit motive when all I did was question the intimate connections between commercial developers and supposedly independent cultural institutions.

HEADLINE: Battling Barriers To Affordable Homes

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
THE Interfaith Housing Development Corporation of Bucks County, Pa., wanted to build five subsidized one-family houses on land donated by a local church so that a few low-income families could afford to own homes in one of the East Coast's most affluent areas.
Neighbors, however, had other ideas. 
 "The town board demanded that we make a lot of expensive and irrelevant improvements to the road before we could get the permits," said the Rev. Alfred Krass, director of the nonprofit housing group. "Then they said we would have to pave the parking lot at my church and install lights and curbs and drains, even though the housing would have off-street parking. They just harassed us and made the project so expensive that it would no longer be affordable."
What Mr. Krass and his nonprofit housing group encountered seems almost a hallowed tradition in most American suburbs -- measures that make housing ever-more expensive to build, thereby making the community less affordable to the less affluent. Whether done by banning apartments, requiring large building lots or imposing environmental or strict planning rules, the results are often the same: Affordably priced housing is hard to produce.
The matter got an airing at the White House in June with with the delivery to President Bush of a special report on regulatory barriers to affordable housing from a special panel assembled by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The report, titled, "Not In My Backyard -- Removing Barriers to Affordable Housing," made a Federal case out of a local issue when it declared:
"Millions of Americans are being priced out of buying or renting the kind of housing they otherwise could afford were it not for a web of government regulations. For them, America -- the land of opportunity -- has become the land of a frustrating and often unrewarded search for an affordable home."
Just how many millions of Americans are being priced out of a home in the suburbs was spelled out in a separate report, issued by the Census Bureau in May. It found that 57 percent of American families -- 56 million of them -- could not afford a median-priced home in the area where they live. Among these, it found, were three-quarters of black and Hispanic families, amounting to 9.9 million families, and 94 percent of couples under 25, or 3.4 million families.
Even with a 10 percent down payment, instead of the usual 20 percent, only 20 percent of white people who are now renting and 4 percent of current black renters can afford to buy a house, according to the 1990 State of the Nation's Housing report from the Joint Center on Housing Studies at Harvard University.
In some areas, including New Jersey, according to the H.U.D. report, restrictive zoning rules, gold-plated construction standards, strict environmental rules, requirements for expensive off-site improvements and multi-layered approval procedures push housing costs up by 25 to 35 percent in some areas, putting homes beyond the means of even middle-class buyers.
But by focusing on zoning rules and payments imposed on builders to the exclusion of other reasons that many people cannot afford decent housing, the H.U.D. report becomes a political as well as an analytical document. The panel advances an essentially conservative way, deregulation, to reach a progressive goal -- affordable housing.
The report gives only scant attention to what many housing advocates consider the key problem of housing affordability in the country, the low incomes of many citizens. One of the advocates' key solutions has been higher Federal subsidies for housing production so prices or rents can be lowered to where low-income people can afford them.
In past decades, the Federal Government had expensive housing construction and rental subsidy programs to compensate for poverty. But those outlays started to drop during President Jimmy Carter's Administration and fell steeply under President Ronald Reagan as rent subsidies for new construction under the so-called Section 8 program wound down. H.U.D. used $27.8 billion to build low-income housing in 1977, for example, while in 1987 the figure was $5.1 billion.
The H.U.D. report is silent on Federal aid to housing, however.
"We were told that we could not make recommendations for money," said Gale Cincotta, a Chicago housing advocate who was a member of the Advisory Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing, which drew up the report. The commission was headed by Thomas H. Kean, former Governor of New Jersey.
"Affordable" housing is generally taken by housing advocates to mean housing within the reach of low-income people. At one time that meant incomes no higher than 80 percent of the local median income, once the upper limit of qualification for Section 8 subsidies. Nowadays "low income" is more often taken to mean households with incomes below 60 percent of the median, which draws in a higher proportion of the poor, the unemployed and people on welfare.
To others in the housing field, "affordable" refers less to buyers' income level than to the drive to pare construction costs by whittling away at regulations and excessive locally imposed costs. But without subsidies, a house in an area of high land values would still be beyond the means of low-income people, however defined.
Despite the limited focus of the Federal report, housing advocates gave the Bush Administration high marks for raising the issue of barriers to affordable housing.
"This is hardly new ground that they are breaking, but it is always important to get a report at this level," said Barry Zigas, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group for housing the poor and the homeless.
APART from the income issue, to Mr. Zigas and others the root cause of the affordability problem is the effort of middle-class suburbanites to keep their communities exclusive by raising barriers to low-cost production. The object is to keep property values from being compromised by new houses worth less than those that already exist. The H.U.D. report hints at this, and a dozen experts said it outright.
"That's what drives it," Mr. Zigas said. "It's 'I moved here to be in a community like this and I don't want those people moving in and ruining it.' "
Larry Raffle, a former New York advertising executive who led the opposition to Mr. Krass's modest Bucks County housing project, agreed that property values have a lot to do with it.
"I don't think there is such an animal as affordable housing for people who won't go out and work," he said in an interview. "The people he would get into those homes were either going to be on unemployment or on welfare, and he would put them into the single best section of the township without any regard to the difference between the property he had and the rest of the community."
And because the church housing group intended to retain ownership of the land under the five new houses, thus keeping them affordable for future owners, Mr. Raffle argued that the new owners would never get a chance to fit in to the community.
"They will be more like renters than owners," he said. "They would never be able to assimilate into the community."
And besides, he added, Bristol Township already has done its share with a large number of low-cost housing units for the elderly.
As a general rule, the greater the number of housing units to the acre, the lower the price will be. Many local governments, including New York City's, have "inclusionary zoning" rules that grant density bonuses to builders willing to reserve a portion of a new project, typically 20 percent, for people on small incomes.
The courts have generally allowed builders to unravel restrictive zoning rules on grounds that include the civil right to decent housing. New Jersey's Mount Laurel statutes, which assign an affordable housing obligation to all municipalities in the state, and developer suits in Mount Kisco and in North Salem in New York's Westchester County were based on such claims.
But when the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People sued the Town of Brookhaven, on Long Island, recently, the suit was thrown out partly on tha ground that the group was not actually trying to build affordable houses.
The H.U.D. report's recommendations focused on the states' obligations to help overcome local barriers to affordable housing. It singled out two state programs, the Mount Laurel housing program and antisnob zoning rules in Massachusetts, as examples worth copying elsewhere. Results from these two programs have been mixed.
In New Jersey, the Mount Laurel laws are based on state court rulings that exclusionary zoning is unconstitutional. But although the state identified a need for 145,700 affordable housing units throughout the state, only about 8,000 have been built so far.
The law allows builders higher densities in exchange for designating 20 percent of a housing project as affordable. And some builders believe that Mount Laurel housing has come at the cost of greater local resistance.
"Prior to Mount Laurel, people wouldn't sit around and define what kind of community they wanted to be," said Patrick O'Keefe, director of the New Jersey Builders Association. "But after Mount Laurel many communities looked at themselves and asked, 'If we want to maintain our community character, how do we discourage this kind of undesirable development?' So in the 1970's and 80's there was a lot of downzoning to large-lot, single-family zoning, and a shift of zoning toward commercial development, to limit the amount of available land."
The Massachussetts law presumes illegal exclusionary zoning in communities with lot minimums of one acre or more per dwelling and allows developers to get state-issued building permits, including density bonuses for affordable units, when local governments refuse to increase densities enough to make affordable housing economically feasible.
Permits for about 20,000 units of new housing have been issued, including about 4,000 subsidized to affordable levels, under the antisnob rules since the program was created in 1969.
But state programs depend on the construction of normal market-rate housing along with the affordable component, and with the current slump in new construction, particularly in the northeast, development of affordable housing by commercial builders has all but stopped.
"There's not much being built these days, affordable or otherwise," said Peter Reinhart, vice president and legal counsel at K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, N.J., one of the East Coast's largest home builders and a pioneer of Mount Laurel housing. "It's a combination of the due process that municipalities have to keep out development, the slowdown in the real estate sector and the regulatory barriers at the state level that apply to all real estate, with no exemption for low-income housing."
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection staff members recently drew up an internal proposal to relax some environmental rules, such as buffer areas around wetlands, to facilitate low-income housing construction, but the department's enforcement division sidetracked the initiative.
Mr. Reinhart's company recently won a battle of more than three years with Lawrence Township, in central New Jersey, over the company's attempts to build a 700-unit housing project in adjoining Hopewell Township, at a site on the Lawrence line. But neither Hopewell nor Lawrence will have to accept any low-income or affordable units as part of the deal.
Like Civil War draftees who paid others to take their place in the ranks, Hopewell Township was able to shift part of its affordable housing share to Trenton, by forcing Hovnanian to pay $2 million in housing rehabilitation funds to the nearby city of Trenton.
Just a year ago, the Continental Building Company of Bronxville, N.Y., won a landmark case against the Town of North Salem in Westchester County by arguing that the town's zoning for large-lot, one-family homes violated the civil rights of the majority of Westchester residents who could not, as a consequence of the zoning, afford to live there.
"THEY decided that they were going to stop multi-family housing, period," said Stuart R. Shamberg, with the firm of Shamberg Marwell Cherneff, a prominent Westchester land-use law firm. "Why? You've got to know North Salem. These are wealthy people who ride horses and like six-acre estates and want North Salem to stay exactly the way it is."
But Marshall Belkin, North Salem's Town Supervisor, said that Mr. Shamberg's argument "in this case is a bogus argument, even though he did it very well."
"Continental never came to the town to build affordable housing," he said. "They never presented an affordable housing plan. So if you want to talk about affordable housing, I'll be glad to do it, but this case had nothing to do with the subject."
North Salem was simply trying to protect its environment by holding to low-density zoning, Mr. Belkin said. And another builder, Banker North Salem Associates, has plans to build affordable housing in the town.
George M. Raymond, a Manhattan planning consultant who has served several times as court-appointed special master in court-ordered open zoning cases, testified on behalf of Mr. Shamberg's client because he believes that the answer to breaking down barriers to affordable housing lie in the courts applying civil rights and equal access laws that legislatures have already passed.
"As long as the courts are firm," he said in an interview, "antisocial, snobbery objections that are raised to affordable housing are not going to get anywhere."

HEADLINE: In the Slump, a Push to Save Open Space

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
FOLLOWING the example of county governments elsewhere, Dutchess County has announced plans for a land-acquisition program to take advantage of favorable prices in the soft real-estate market.
The Department of Planning has proposed a fund that would provide $3.4 million a year for seven years to acquire more public land for recreation and open space and to buy farmers' development rights in the county, which is 70 miles north of New York City. 
 In recent years, county governments throughout the Northeast have been finding ways of getting as much of their open space as possible under protection before the economy rebounds and developers return. They have bought land outright, contributed to purchases by nonprofit groups and acquired conservation easements, which essentially means buying an owner's development rights to insure that the land remains open.
Counties in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland have in these ways already placed hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland, open space and environmentally sensitive land under long-term protection.
"During the boom growth years in the mid-1980's, land went so fast we didn't have time to do anything about it," said Holly L. Thomas, senior planner with Dutchess County's Department of Planning. "Now we have some breathing room, but we have to act fast."
According to its Planning Department, the county's current land usage makes it ripe for future overdevelopment. It has one of the lowest percentages of publicly owned land in its region, 3.4 percent compared to the regional average of 10.7.
Primarily agricultural a generation ago, Dutchess now has 124,000 acres of farmland left, covering about one-fourth of the county. Since 1982 it has been losing it at a rate of 2,700 acres a year.
The program's long-term goals would include preserving 60,000 acres of farmland and 40,000 acres of environmentally sensitive land and acquiring an additional 2,970 acres of recreational space. The County Legislature is now reviewing the proposal and exploring financing options through a special land stewardship committee.
"Everyone in the county thinks it's a great idea," Ms. Thomas said. "But they don't know where the money will come from."
In its report on the plan, the Planning Department recommended earmarking a portion of the county's sales tax for land preservation or imposing a real estate transfer tax.
"Once we have a program in place," Ms. Thomas said, "we'd also be eligible for Federal, state and municipal matching funds."
Under a largely state-financed program, 15 New Jersey counties will have completed buying development rights to 17,000 acres of farmland by the end of this year.
"They probably won't get much more, since the state may run out of money by the end of the year," said Eleanor S. Campbell, special projects coordinator for the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, a nonprofit group that advises county governments on how to conserve land. "We've been encouraging counties to come up with the own funding."
Several New Jersey counties have done so, including Mercer, Mommouth, Cape May and Atlantic. Last fall, voters in Atlantic County approved a special tax for land preservation.
In Chester County, Pa., 82 percent of voters approved $50 million for preserving agricultural land and acquiring land for two county parks.
"It's amazing to me how much support these programs have," said Daniel P. O'Connell, an investment banker with Sturdivant & Company of Camden, N.J., who is a consultant to counties on land acquisition. "Even in these tough economic times, people realize how important it is to acquire land. The next building push could be the one that changes the landscape forever."
In recent years, however, state-financed programs have not met with such enthusiasm. Last fall, several state environmental bond acts were defeated, including one in New York that would have provided $800 million to preserve and protect open land.
"WHEN we realized we weren't going to get that money, we knew we had to do something ourselves to protect our land," said Arlene Miller, associate planner with Rockland County's Department of Planning.
In its 1990 budget, Rockland allocated $1.5 million a year for six years to acquire "greenways," land along streams and ridge lines. Of particular concern to the county is the future of the Long Path, a 225-mile hiking trail operated by the New York/New Jersey Trail Conference. It runs from the George Washington Bridge to the Catskill Mountains, with 33 miles passing through Rockland.
"We're always worried about developers building too close to the trail and compromising its integrity and obscuring the views from it," Ms. Miller said. "It would be great to have some control over some of that land."
The county would also like to use the money to buy land with access to the Hudson River. "There are several towns that now have no clear way to get to the water," Ms. Miller said.
In formulating their land programs, many counties look to the success of Howard County, Md., which has had an agricultural acquisition program since 1974.
By the end of this year, Howard will have placed 17,000 acres of farmland under easement, said John W. Musselman, coordinator for the program. "Our goal is 30,000 acres, which would be one-third of the western part of the county."
HOWARD'S method of obtaining land rights has become a national model. Using an innovative formula, the county buys a farmer's development rights through a long-term installment purchase agreement offering tax-exempt income, with the bulk of the principal due at the end of the term, usually 30 years.
"It works out well for all parties," said Daniel O'Connell, Howard's financial adviser. "The county pays 50 to 60 percent of the appraised value of the land, which is an extremely cost-effective way for municipalities to get land."
In addition, he said, the farmer gets to stay on his land, "and he doesn't have to pay taxes on the money he gets until he receives the full purchase price."
The purchases are financed through zero-coupon Federal Treasury Bonds. In February 1991, Fitch Investor Service gave the county an AAA bond rating, citing in its report the "county's clearly defined goal of maintaining a high quality of life by carefully planning for and controlling development."
Another innovative aspect of the program is the "tourism package," Mr. Musselman, the program coordinator, said. "We subsidize sideline businesses that will help enable a farmer to stay in business," like bed and breakfast operations and farm tours.
Following Howard's example, Dutchess County may also offer farmers financial incentives to stay on the land. Under a proposed tax-abatement program, farmers would be relieved of their property taxes for one year in exchange for a two-year commitment to continue farming.
ALSO frequently cited as a model in land acquisition is Suffolk County on Long Island, which has already committed $180 million to three land conservation programs, including buying the development rights to farmland, open-space acquisition and watershed preservation.
The county expects to spend $300 million on the programs by the year 2000. Two of the programs are financed by county allocations from general funds and the watershed program is financed by a .25-cent sales tax.
By the end of this year, Suffolk will have under protection 30,000 acres of open space, 28,000 acres of recreational land and 6,500 acres of watershed. Its farm program was instituted in 1974, the same year as Howard's. Since then, 7,000 acres of farmland has been placed under easement, said Arthur H. Kunz, Suffolk's planning director.
"With this program, we've been able to hold onto our vintners and young farmers," he said, which is vital for the county's tourism business.
"One of the main attractions for people who come out here are the fresh vegetables and flowers sold from roadside stands," Mr. Kunz said. "Without careful planning, that could very easily disappear."

Late Maintenance Charge
 
Question: I understand co-op maintenance fees received by the 15th of the month are legally considered paid on time. Lately my building's management company has begun tacking on $100-a-month "late" fees, even though my payments are always received by the 15th, which I can prove with certified mail receipts. Do I have any recourse? . . . Barbara Henryson, Manhattan 

Answer: Probably not. Marc Luxemburg, a lawyer and president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said there is no law that covers this subject.
"According to the proprietary leases of the majority of co-ops," he said, "maintenance is due on the first of each month. If there is a grace period it has been set by the co-op, not by the management company."
The policy is either a result of a board resolution or proprietary lease rule. You can ask the managing agent for a copy of any resolution authorizing the late fee or the pertinent section of the proprietary lease. Mr. Luxemburg said that if the late fee is part of the proprietary lease, your refusal to pay it could be interpreted as being a breach of the lease.
 
Mechanic's Lien
 
Question: A contractor who did work for me didn't finish the job. After many unsuccessful reminders I finished it myself and withheld the last payment. Can the contractor place a mechanic's lien on the property without my knowledge? . . . Elizabeth Weiss, Manhattan
 
Answer: No. Michael Finder, a lawyer specializing in real estate matters, said that the contractor must notify you of the lien within 30 days and that the lien can remain in place for one year unless there is a notice of action to foreclose on it or an extension is filed. Another requirement is that liens must be filed within eight months of the end of the job or the last work performed. Liens against one-family homes must be filed within four months of the end of the job or the last work done.
 
Vacancy Surcharge
 
Question: I have lived in a two-bedroom rent-stabilized apartment for two and a half years. I moved in with my cousin who had been living in the apartment for about three years. We notified the owner that I would be moving and he agreed. Since the lease was coming up for renewal I was allowed to sign it, but we were charged a vacancy surcharge of 20 percent.
My cousin moved out six months ago. Was the vacancy renewal legal? . . . Diana Feit, Manhattan
 
Answer: Yes. But the surcharge may not have been correctly calculated. Joseph De Gosta, an assistant commissioner with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said that because you were not a tenant since the start of the lease, the landlord could treat the lease you and your cousin signed as a new one. This could apply only if the owner had not received a vacancy increase for the previous lease period.
The vacancy increase allowed in accordance with rent guidelines for leases signed between Oct. 1, 1987, and Sept. 30, 1988, was 10 percent plus a 3.5 increase for a one-year lease and a 5 increase for a two-year lease. Leases signed between Oct. 1, 1988, and Sept. 30, 1989, could carry 12 percent vacancy increases in addition to a 9 percent increase for a two-year agreement. The current allowable increase on a vacancy lease is 5 percent plus the 4.5 percent increase for one-year and 7 percent for two-year leases.
If you believe you were overcharged, ask the landlord how the calculation was done. If you are not satisfied you can file an overcharge complaint with the state's housing agency. Forms are available by calling the Rent Hotline at (718) 739-6400.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: The Bank of the United States in the Bronx;
The First Domino In the Depression

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
EACH succeeding story of a bank failure conjures up the same image: first a sudden stock-market collapse, then a nationwide bank crisis -- perhaps the start of another Great Depression.
The first big bank collapse after the Crash of 1929 began at a little limestone branch built in 1921 at the southeast corner of Freeman Street and Southern Boulevard in the Morrisania section of the Bronx. Now little more than a shell, it is a ruined monument in the history of American finance. 
 The modest structure was the first Bronx branch of the grandly titled Bank of the United States, begun in 1913 by Joseph S. Marcus, a Lower East Side garment manufacturer and financier. It served both established and newly arrived immigrants and its ambitious name was apparently chosen to impress (or confuse). It had no Government connection and in 1926 such an appellation was outlawed, but the legislation was not retroactive.
The Bronx branch was built in 1921. A tiny little neo-classical limestone structure with a chamfered corner and great bronze torchieres outside, it was designed by Louis Allen Abramson.
Marcus died in 1927 and his son Bernard took over during the bank's expansion through mergers from five branches in 1925 to 62 throughout New York City in 1930.
The bank's stock was publicly traded and there were rumors in the financial community in mid-1929 that the institution was shaky, but it weathered the October 1929 stock market disaster. However, either continuing reports of its shaky finances or just depositors' needs for cash as the Depression began dropped its reserves from over $200 million in October 1930 to $160 million in December. And on Dec. 8 a previously announced merger with three other banks was called off.
On Dec. 10, a Wednesday, $2 million was withdrawn from the Bronx branch by 2,500 depositors, one of whom stood in line for two hours to empty a $2 savings account. The commotion attracted a crowd of over 20,000.
The next day, The New York Times attributed the rush to a "false rumor" by a disgruntled investor. Nevertheless, nervous depositors formed long lines at other branches. An unidentified bank officer contended that the trouble was started by brokers seeking commissions from panic selling of the bank's stock. But on Dec. 11, Joseph A. Broderick, New York State Superintendent of Banks, closed the institution. It never reopened.
The bank had 400,000 depositors -- more than any other in the country -- and immediately hurt were garment businesses that needed money for their payrolls. Claims began to be processed in an orderly manner, but on Dec. 21 a crowd of 3,000 shouting "We want our money!" tried to storm the padlocked Bronx branch. Six people were arrested, all Bronx residents. Charges were dropped the next day.
"A Monetary History of the United States" by Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz, calls its failure the largest ever in American banking up to that time. The bank ultimately paid out over 80 percent on its deposits. But the obvious public panic set the stage for a series of bank failures that continued until 1933.
IN public hearings, it was disclosed that two months prior to its closure bank officers had burned ledgers and other records in the incinerator of the Beresford Apartments on Central Park West, which it had helped finance. According to "Skyscraper Dreams," by Tom Schactman, the Beresford, the San Remo and the Century were ultimately sold at distress prices to satisfy loans from the Bank of the United States.
Photographs from the 1940's show the building in operation as The National Bronx Bank but now it is only a boarded-up shell. The floor is littered with fallen plaster and skylight framing hangs crazily down from the ceiling -- anyone can enter through the roof. The marble facing of the tellers' cages is falling away.
The city's Department of General Services has owned the building since 1984. A sale at auction to a private owner in 1985 fell through and in another auction in 1989 the building went for $65,000 to two investors, Jose Medina and Raoul Santiago. Mr. Medina says that he planned to renovate for store occupancy, but that city regulations regarding reconstruction were too restrictive. The Department of General Services has declared them in default and the investors lost their $13,000 deposit.
Lisa Ryan, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the city will auction the building again. No date has been set.

HEADLINE: Paramus Journal;
Dinosaurs Are Fun, But the Zoo Fee Is Not

BYLINE: By ALBERT J. PARISI

DATELINE: PARAMUS

 BODY:
AMONG the bleating goats and crowing roosters there is another sound at the Van Saun Park County Zoo this summer: the chilling roar of thunder lizards and their varied kin. While these animated dinosaurs have delighted thousands of children clutching barrier ropes with ice-pop-stained fingers, many parents have voiced shock and dismay.
The exhibition is stunning, they say, and its price of admission was expected. But not an entrance fee to the zoo, which for decades has been free to all who enter. 
 "I can't believe this," said Angela Lomagno of Saddle Brook, who with a friend brought a group of children on a recent Sunday to visit the exhibition and the zoo.
"I've been coming here since I can remember, and there's never been a fee to get into the zoo," she said. "I guess my tax money doesn't go as far as it used to, but I still don't think this is right."
 
Charged Only on Weekends
 Zoo and county park officials say that the admission fee of $2 for adults and $1 for children over 12 years of age is charged only on weekends and that the revenue is badly needed to offset budget cuts in the county park system.
The fee is permanent, said Wolfgang Albrecht Jr., director of the Bergen County Department of Parks, and will help finance "educational challenges that lie ahead of us and allow for its growth." Weekday fees are unlikely, he added.
To gain entry to the dinosaur exhibition, visitors must pay fees of $4 for adults and $2 for children, as well as the zoo admission.
For Tim Gunther, the county zoo's director, the zoo fee is a sign of tough economic times and a mixed blessing as well.
 
'We've All Been Spoiled'
 "Our budget has not changed at all over the last two years," he said. "I've lost three staff members to attrition who I do not expect to be replaced. Many people are upset about the zoo fee, especially county residents, but you know, when you have such a thing available free of charge for all these years, you fall into the trap of taking it for granted."
In a way, Mr. Gunther said, "we've all been spoiled." He said he hoped that the modest fee would be rechanneled in part to improve the zoo. .
The zoo fee has been designated for the county park system general fund and not specifically earmarked for zoo improvements, even though administrators at Van Saun have been promised that the zoo will share in the benefits.
The fee order was put into effect by the Bergen County Executive's office after the Van Saun Zoological Society arranged last year to be host to the dinosaur exhibition. Some say privately that the fee was imposed to take advantage of large crowds expected for the summerlong display, which began on June 1 and will run through Sept. 2, but that it may have backfired since weekend attendance has dropped from anticipated numbers.
Though average weekend attendance at the popular zoo and park is nearly 15,000 in the summer, it has dwindled to nearly half that number. Van Saun includes a children's pony ride concession and a scale-model steam engine railroad that meanders through the zoo's perimeter.
"Before school let out, we were mobbed on weekends, but then the attendance started falling off, and I think some of that has to do with families going away for the summer down to the Shore," Mr. Gunther said.
County park officials say the attendance will eventually pick up once visitors accept the fee and see zoo improvements.
Not all visitors are opposed to the admission price.
"I have no problem with it as long as the money is used for making improvements at the zoo," said Joseph Drigon of Kearney on a recent visit with his wife, Sue, and their three children. "If they need it, why not?"
Mrs. Drigon said that the double admission policy did not seem fair and that allowances should be made for those who wanted to visit either the park or the exhibition.
John McCarthy of Glen Rock said, "I think that they're taking advantage here a little bit with these fees, but I really don't mind too much because the kids love this so." Mr. McCarthy, his wife, Bonnie, and their two young daughters were making a day at the park.
 
'The Money Goes to a Good Cause'
 "The money goes to a good cause, and that's all that really matters," Mrs. McCarthy said as her daughters pulled at her arm to venture to an adjacent playground.
But for park employees, the new fee has been a nightmare of explanations and dealing with enraged visitors.
"Hey, they don't pay me enough to take this kind of lip from people," said one employee, who refused to be identified as he tore tickets by the zoo's main entrance. "I tell people, 'If you go out of the zoo and want to come back, you've got to pay again,' " he said with a degree of frustration. "I tell them that I don't make the rules and if they've got a complaint, call the County Executive's office in Hackensack."
"I was in the service for four years," he added, "and I never heard cussing like what I've heard here, mostly from people who aren't from the area."
Some visitors voiced surprise at other changes as well. The steam engine ride this year has also increased in price. Tickets for adults and children above 3 years of age have gone from 35 cents to 50 cents.
"They've kind of got you coming and going, and what I don't appreciate is that all these fees were passed and sprung on everybody," said Connie Lomagno, also of Saddle Brook. "This should be a place where one can have a good time without having to stare at their wallets, because with a whole family, you're going to wind up spending lots of money."
Regardless of resentment about admission fees, the dinosaur exhibition's popularity can be a moving experience for children, parents and exhibition volunteers alike.
In a tent-enclosed display, primeval shadows fall among towering predators and prey, whose lifelike movements are operated on compressed air. The sound of horrific roars mixes with the excited squeals of young children, many finding themselves thrust into their parents' arms.
 
'Look at the Wonder in Their Eyes'
 "Look at the wonder in their eyes -- just look at it," said Kathy Lopes of Fair Lawn, a docent volunteer for the Zoological Society's Education Center. As a mechanical apatosaurus cranes its neck and seems to gaze at a handful of children, they unconsciously take a half step back.
"In this setting, you can see how they relate to the dinosaurs," Mrs. Lopes said. "For them, they are no longer drawings in a storybook or a collection of bones in a museum."
A 4-year-old boy, arm wrapped around his mother's leg, watched in fascination as a young triceratops grazed near its protective mechanical mother.
"That's its baby, Momma," the little boy said as his mother smiled and stroked his flaxen hair.
"The magic, as you can see," Mrs. Lopes said, "is not just limited to children."

HEADLINE: 90's Denim: Relaxed And Blue and More

BYLINE: By DEBORAH HOFMANN

 BODY:
Denim takes on the attitude of each generation: torn, scruffy blue jeans in the 1960's, a second skin in the 70's, a designer look in the 80's. That decade ended with deliberate shredding on thighs and knees and a sack shape -- a reaction against leggings.
"The trends this fall include color, trims of leather and plastic, prints, a relaxed fit and a continuation of the baggy look," said Jean Driscoll, a spokeswoman for Jeanswear Communications, a newsletter for the denim industry. 
 For those who prefer a snug fit, she said, "Stretch Lycra and denim hybrids are giving denim a fresh appeal."
 
Strong Sales in Weak Economy
 Blue jeans peaked in 1981, when 502 million pairs were sold. Now, sales are up again, spurred by an economy in which denim's durability means value. In the first quarter of 1991, sales of denim jeans were about 68 million pairs, up about 7 percent from the same period of 1990, Ms. Driscoll said. Denim mills are booked months ahead, she said.
Designers are looking at denim again -- among them Donna Karan (for her DKNY line), Anne Klein's A Line, Moschino and others, including new companies. And traditional manufacturers, like Lee, Wrangler and Levi, are becoming more aggressive at marketing their jeans.
Express makes a five-pocket stirrup jean of pre-washed stretch blue denim with a touch of Lycra ($46) and a denim legging with elasticized waist and higher Lycra content ($39), which comes in black, off-white and faded blue. It's sold at 575 Express stores nationwide, including nine in Manhattan.
 
Patent Leather and Color Blocks
 A new manufacturer, the Manhattan-based Fly Jeans, makes a stretch denim jean with stirrups, in red or black ($65). An oversized stone-washed jean comes with the fly and front details in back and the seat pockets in front ($72).
Fly Jeans also makes denims trimmed with quilted black patent leather or plastic wedges. Mondrian-inspired color-blocked jeans are made with denim squares in several colors. These two styles are $60 to $70. Fly Jeans are sold at Bloomingdale's.
Another new manufacturer, the Los Angeles-based L.E.I., makes Chap Jeans: denim jeans with leather panels sewn down the front and sometimes also down the back. The look is inspired by riding wear, which the company also makes.
L.E.I.'s indigo denim jeans come with chaps in a choice of eight colors -- black, blue, tan, hunter green, burgundy, red, navy or eggplant -- or in styles with denim dyed to match, $38 to $48 at Bloomingdale's and Macy's.
 
Relaxed and Baggy Revisited
 Marithe and Francois Girbaud's jeans come in 12 colors. Girbaud dyes T-shirts and jackets to match. A "skinny cowboy" style has extra room in the thigh and seat ($62). It does look skinny compared to the "baggy cowboy" style ($72), which has about two inches more fabric through the thighs and most of the rest of the garment.
"Baggy cowboy shorts," which go over the knees, are worn over leggings and cat suits ($56). A sailor-inspired gray-green "vintage denim" is supple and pajamalike, $62. It's worn cinched at the waist, with the cuffs rolled up. The jeans are sold at Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Urban Outfitters.
Ruff Hewn's Westwood jeans of stone-washed indigo denim are a hybrid style for those who want a roomier classic jean without the baggy silhouette. They are faded along seams and tension points. The style is $72 at Lord & Taylor.
Lee's Relaxed Rider five-pocket jean ($35) is roomy in the thighs and seat. The waist is cut in a bit, curving to a rounded hip. The Elastic Rider ($35) has a pocketless seat and elastic waistline, geared to a fuller figure. Both come in 14 shades of indigo. Lee plans to introduce a red-purple indigo in December.

The Price of Breaking the Street's Code of Ethics 

When Salomon Brothers Inc. admitted last week that it had broken Wall Street's rules by buying more than 35 percent of the offerings at certain Treasury auctions, it did more than sully its name. It went against Wall Street's code of ethics, which, combined with the work of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is the way the Street is policed. The breach may cost the firm its future. Last week it cost John H. Gutfreund, Salomon's chairman, and Thomas W. Strauss, its president, their jobs. The problem is not just that Salomon Brothers bought way more than the 35 percent maximum and that the purchases may have skewed bond prices in its favor. It's that Mr. Gutfreund and two others failed to inform the Government when they first learned of at least one of the violations. So much for the honor system. Until a new chairman is found, Warren Buffett, the Omaha investor with a stake in Salomon, will act as chairman.
 
No. 2 -- for the Moment
 
Everyone knows fame is fleeting, but so is being the nation's No. 2 bank. For barely a month the Chemical Bank Corporation was going to be No. 2, after announcing it would merge with the Manufactures Hanover Corporation. Last week, BankAmerica Corporation took that title away when it said it would acquire the Security Pacific Corporation for about $4.12 billion in stock. The combined bank will have $190 billion in assets. "Security Pacific is very good with its technology and processing services; BankAmerica has tremendous distribution," said Les Dinkin, managing principal of NBW Consulting in New York. Richard M. Rosenberg, chairman of BankAmerica, will become chairman of the new bank. "The new bank will have capital for more acquisitions," said Mr. Dinkin. Watch out No. 1.
 
And Pan Am Is the Prize
 
Delta Air Lines won a prize of dubious value last week -- 45 percent of ailing Pan American World Airways. A Federal bankruptcy judge approved Delta's $1.7 billion bid for nearly half of the carrier's assets. But in addition to winning a stake in Pan Am -- it will share it with a handful of creditors -- Delta also gets something of real value: Pan Am's profitable shuttle operations, its European routes and a huge assortment of spare parts. The deal calls for Delta to kick in $621 million in cash and assume $720 million in Pan Am's liabilities. Though Pan Am is a shadow of its former globe-girdling self, it will continue to fly. The deal, according to Kevin C. Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, will put Delta "in the same league as American and United." That is to say, the big leagues.
 
Clark Clifford's Exit
 
In a statement to the press, Clark M. Clifford tried to put his resignation as chairman of First American Corporation in the best light. He and his law partner, Robert A. Altman, First American's president, were stepping down voluntarily to save the bank from adverse publicity, he said. But eyebrows were raised all around. Mr. Clifford, a former Presidential adviser and Defense Secretary, was in fact given the boot, said Federal banking regulators and First American's own board. Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, a former Attorney General, was brought in to clean up the mess. First American was owned by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International -- the bank accused of misdeeds like laundering money for drug lords around the world. But Mr. Clifford, who was also B.C.C.I.'s highly paid counsel, claimed he did not know that. To make that claim stick, Mr. Clifford -- known for his savvy and wise advice -- must convince a lot of people that he turned gullible.
 
Sears Needs More Time to Pay
 
With consumer spending still depressed, retailers are hurting. Sears Roebuck & Company, the nation's third-biggest retailer, said last week it will extend its payment period for vendors from 30 days to 60 days. A Sears spokesman said the action does not imply the company is in a cash bind. Perhaps not, but how about the suppliers?
 
Just the Latest Scandal . . .
 
Fingers are wagging everywhere as details of new scandals are released. The latest involves the General Electric Company. G.E. was accused in a lawsuit filed by Chester Walsh, a G.E. employee, of defrauding the Pentagon out of more than $30 million in the sale of jet engines and services to the Israeli Air Force. Last week the Justice Department joined the suit. G.E. said it is conducting an internal investigation -- but then again so are Salomon Brothers, B.C.C.I. and the Japanese securities industry.
 
A Paul Simon Industry
 
The title of last week's Central Park concert by Paul Simon could have been "synergy" -- a word companies use to justify often high prices they pay for a company in a related business. But this time the synergy was real. Units of Time Warner Inc. put up about $1.2 million to cover the cost of the free concert. In return, they got the right to broadcast it live, show reruns and sell videos. There is even talk about a record. All that's missing is a book on how the deal was made and an article in Fortune.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
A New Regime at F.D.I.C.
 
L. William Seidman, who is retiring as head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation in October, must have pretty big shoes. The White House has nominated William Taylor to fill just one of them. The Administration wants Mr. Taylor, the top banking regulator at the Federal Reserve, to head only the F.D.I.C. It will appoint someone else to the newly created post of chief executive of the trust corporation to oversee the savings and loan bailout. When asked about his nomination, Mr. Taylor, who still must be confirmed by the Senate, said "no comment," something Mr. Seidman rarely says.
 
Sleepy Retail Sales
 
The July gain in retail sales was about as exciting as a late-afternoon yawn. According to the Commerce Department, sales increased by barely 0.5 percent last month. Since consumers account for the lion's share of all economic activity in the United States, slow growth in retail sales means a slow recovery. "The bottom line," said David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York, "is that there is a bit of a pickup, but some real question about whether it is sustainable." A number of other economists have their doubts.
 
Affordable Vegetables
 
Vegetables have been giving the economy a lot of trouble lately. Their prices rose enough last spring to bring on an inflation scare. But now, some good news. According to the Labor Department, vegetable prices fell enough to keep consumer prices almost steady in June. The Consumer Price Index, the Government's primary tool for gauging inflation, rose by 0.2 percent. So far this year, inflation has been running at 2.7 percent. That scanty an increase would make even the Germans and Japanese proud these days. With inflation lying low, the Federal Reserve can contemplate a further easing of interest rates.
 
A Rule Goes Topsy-Turvy
 
Back when economics in the real world resembled economics in the textbook, the rule of thumb was that when the nation's factories hummed along at more than 77 percent of capacity, inflation would soon perk up. The old rule does not seem to prevail anymore. Capacity was running at 79.7 percent in July, up from 79.5 for June, said the Federal Reserve Board, yet inflation is almost nil. The question economists must answer is why growth has barely made it into the single digits when all those factories are running almost flat out.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
The Love of Japanese Goods
 
Japan's exports are still climbing. According to the Finance Ministry, Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world surged by 25.2 percent to $6.68 billion in July. An astounding increase from an already high base. And while nearly every country in the world has been moaning about all those Japanese cars and stereos, they still love to buy them. Americans love buying those goodies most. Nearly half of Japan's surplus last month -- $3.01 billion -- was with the United States.
 
No Monopoly on Scheming
 
Who says "entrepreneurialism" is exclusively American? Toyo Shinkin Bank in Osaka, a cross between a credit union and a savings and loan, said last week that one of its branch managers, Asami Maekawa, had been involved in issuing false certificates of deposit worth about $2.48 billion. The bank only has about $2.58 billion in deposits. The certificates found their way into the hands of a nearby restaurant owner, Nui Onoue, and she used them to borrow money from other banks. According to the Ministry of Finance, that money was used to speculate on stocks. The size of the scheme, officials said, may mean that Ms. Onoue was working in cahoots with the yakuza, Japan's very well organized mob. No indictments have been issued yet, but the ministry is looking into the case. The Bank of Japan, fearing a run on Toyo Shinkin, moved quickly to protect all depositors.
 
Germany's Inflation-Fighter
 
Helmut Schlesinger, the new president of Germany's central bank, is known as a hawk on inflation. Last week he strutted his stuff in public for the first time. The Bundesbank announced it was raising Germany's discount rate from 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The discount rate is what the Buba -- as the Bundesbank is affectionately known -- charges Germany's banks to borrow. The Bundesbank raised the Lombard funding rate to 9.25 percent from 9 percent. The reason for the rise in rates was the alarming "surge" in Germany's inflation rate -- from 3.5 percent in June to 4.4 percent in July. With budget deficits in the Federal Republic climbing, as eastern Germany is integrated into the west, many observers say Mr. Schlesinger will raise rates even further.
 
A Country Without a Lender
 
Pity the poor Soviet Union. It needs to borrow money to buy grain -- a mere $600 million. But no American bank is willing to lend the money even though the United States Government will guarantee repayment of most of the principal and half of the interest. Even with the guarantees, the banks are still skeptical that they will be paid. That makes some observers wonder which nation the bankers have ceased to trust.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
An Appetite for Mergers

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation's planned acquisition of the Security Pacific Corporation, announced last week, could become the biggest banking merger in history. Frank N. Newman, BankAmerica's chief financial officer and vice chairman, has been preparing for it for a long time.
Mr. Newman, 49, has been a key player in BankAmerica's expansion binge. The San Francisco-based bank bought more than a dozen smaller banks and thrift institutions in Western states in the last year and a half, and also made an unsuccessful bid for the Bank of New England. More purchases are expected. 
 The corporate development department, which carries out the acquisitions, reports to Mr. Newman, and he has often served as the spokesman for the bank on its expansion strategy. "We have a really tremendous opportunity to do it right," he told financial analysts last Monday, explaining the "financial engineering" that will be used on the Security Pacific purchase to allow the combined bank to start life in "terrific shape" while still increasing reserves for bad loans.
A native of Quincy, Mass., with an economics degree from Harvard, Mr. Newman was the chief financial officer at Wells Fargo & Company in 1986 when it acquired Crocker Bank.
That acquisition, huge for its time, demonstrated that merging two banks in the same region could produce large savings and improve earnings by eliminating overlapping employees and branches. Some analysts are referring to the Security Pacific deal as "Crocker II."
Mr. Newman has seen takeovers from the other side as well. He joined BankAmerica in October 1986, when it was struggling with loan losses. On his first day on the job, BankAmerica announced it had received a takeover offer from First Interstate Bancorp. By week's end, Samuel H. Armacost, the BankAmerica chief executive who had hired him, was ousted.
But Mr. Newman stayed. He coordinated the successful defense against First Interstate and helped nurse BankAmerica back to financial health.

HEADLINE: All About/In-Store Promotions;
Influencing Shoppers During the Moment of Decision

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
Everybody is trying to cash in on the fast-growing trend toward in-store promotions. Supermarkets are charging fees to place these sales displays in their aisles. Display companies, many of them bought by advertising agencies in recent years, are charging food manufacturers to design and produce campaigns. And venture capitalists are investing in new technologies to get in on the burst of interest in the activity. Known as supermarket point-of-purchase advertising and promotion, the technique uses high and low technology, from video terminals to hand-out coupons, to communicate sales messages and influence buying habits.
Food manufacturers see these promotions, which often play on people's impulses, as a quick fix for sagging sales. And with thousands of new products introduced each year -- 1,837 in July alone, according to Gorman's New Product News, an supermarket industry magazine -- marketers are fighting for ways to keep their products from getting lost. 
 For the nation's supermarket chains, which charge for the displays placed on their floors, this form of advertising and promotion has been a boon. A growing share of the money that food manufacturers would have spent on other advertising media, like television, radio and newspapers, is now being spent to put displays inside stores. For example, of the millions of dollars to be spent next month by the M.& M. Mars Company on its annual Halloween campaign, slightly more than half will be spent inside the stores on displays and renting space.
Practitioners of the in-store arts predict solid growth for their medium. To back up their argument, they refer to the research findings of the Point of Purchase Advertising Institute, an industry association in Englewood, N.J., that says 66 percent of all buying decisions are made after the consumer enters the supermarket.
 
The Medium Grows
A Bigger Share of the Ad Pie
 It is difficult to calculate exactly how much is spent on in-store promotions, analysts say, since promotional expenditures are often lumped in with other costs in a company's marketing budget. Most analysts, however, agree that the in-store promotion and advertising business is growing much faster than traditional advertising.
According to the Point of Purchase Advertising Institute, the use of in-store promotions and advertising has been growing by 10 to 15 percent annually over the last five years, compared with growth of just 4 to 6 percent for traditional advertising.
But despite its growth, in-store promotions and advertising remain a small part of the nation's total advertising outlays. In-store promotional and advertising expenditures totaled $14.8 billion in 1989, according to the institute, which estimates that about one-third of that money was spent in supermarkets and smaller food stores, as opposed to other retail outlets like drug and convenience stores. Traditional advertising expenditures were about $128.6 billion that year.
Traditional advertising and promotions companies are often rivals for the same dollars. They are often in conflict on the design of their campaigns. Each camp argues that its method of reaching the customer is superior. But there are signs of reconciliation. A growing number of advertising agencies, like Foote, Cone & Belding and more recently Earle Palmer Brown, have established or acquired their own promotional units. For these companies, in-store displays are seen as one more media tool.
"Point of purchase can't be an orphan," said David Essertier, a senior vice president at Promotional Innovations Inc. and a former advertising executive at Saatchi & Saatchi. "It is at its best when used with the other forms of advertising."
 
Enriching Stores
Manufacturers Must Pay a Commission

The growth of in-store programs is largely due to the peculiarities of supermarket economics. Most supermarket chains operate on wafer-thin margins of 1 percent. As a result, in-store promotions and advertising are an important source of revenue since manufacturers pay stores a commission for the chance to display their messages.
Industry experts say that about 35 percent of the money spent on a typical promotions campaign goes to the store. The stores, in return, must provide data on sales to the manufacturers, increase their stocks of the featured products and mention the product in the supermarket's regular advertising circulars and flyers. Some of the larger chains can take in as much as $430,000 from a typical two-week campaign for a single product.
Paul Bernish, a spokesman for the Kroger Company, one of the country's largest supermarket chains, declined to provide the amount that chain earned from in-store advertising, though he described it as a "moderate source of revenue." But he added that in-store displays were more a matter of increasing the store's sales than providing direct revenue. "We want to increase foot traffic in the store," he said.

 
 
The Money Flows
Venture Capitalists
Take to the Idea
 The largest company in the in-store market is Actmedia, which was established 18 years ago in Norwalk, Conn., and had revenues of $156.3 million in 1990 with earnings of $23.3 million. Acquired two years ago by the Dallas-based Heritage Media Corporation, which owns television and radio stations, Actmedia's operations cover 25,800 supermarkets, drugstores and mass merchandisers.
Actmedia's products range from basic signs clipped onto shelves and hung over aisles to coupon machines placed next to the discounted products. It sends teams of employees to thousands of stores to promote products and has a radio network that plays music and pitches over the stores' sound systems. With Turner Broadcasting, Actmedia is planning to test TV programming for supermarkets.
Five years ago, Actmedia had no significant competition, but analysts say there is a new influx of venture capital into the field. The industry still consists largely of thousands of entrepreneurs -- many of whom work from their homes and consider themselves inventors -- as well as dozens of promotional companies hired by manufacturers to design specific campaigns. But recently, a few other companies, like Media One in New York and the Catalina Marketing Corporation in Anaheim, Calif., -- both privately owned -- have established in-store promotional networks that cover thousands of supermarkets, though they offer a more limited array of services than Actmedia.
Another company, Videocart Inc., in Chicago, has generated much attention with its plans to supply stores with carts equipped with video displays. By pushing a button on the cart, a customer can automatically receive an electronic coupon that will be recorded at the cashier in front. The Videocart company is still in a fledgling state, having just completed its testing stage in supermarkets around the country [page 13].
There is some concern among marketers, manufacturers and retailers that the supermarket could become so overwhelmed with promotional gadgets that shoppers could be turned off.
But others dismiss the possibility that the industry could stop growing soon. "There's still so much unused space in the supermarket," said John M. Kawula, the institute's president.
 
 
 
THE DIFFICULTY IN DEEP FREEZES
 The challenge for promotional companies is to get their products noticed. But some sections of the supermarket are better than others at doing that.
"The two deadliest displays are the upright freezer section of the supermarket and the open fresh-dairy case display," said Lee Weinblatt, chief executive of Pretesting Company Inc., in Englewood, N.J., which provides advertising research using hidden video cameras in stores. "Shoppers are not willing to keep opening and closing the freezer doors to compare products in different sections of the upright freezers."
Attempts to put promotions in the freezer space have sometimes met with disaster. But one solution being examined by several companies is to create small, separate cold displays.
James Richardson, an industrial designer and consultant in Weston, Conn., said he first began working on concepts for "secondary freezer display space" five years ago. This week, Mr. Richardson's latest project -- a small portable freezer -- will be tested at supermarkets in Montreal, its second round of tests in the last two years.
The portable freezer stands about three feet tall and four feet wide, with posters on all four sides to promote the product inside. It can be assembled and taken apart for moving in less than an hour. The cooling unit is separate from the storage space.
In tests last year in about 40 A.& P. stores in Toronto and at Overmaitea supermarkets in Vancouver, British Columbia, the freezers produced a sales increase of as much as 100 percent for McCains Super Fries and Campbell's Le Menu frozen dinners.
"Any time you feature a product in-store with a separate display, it will increase sales -- that's a given," said Mr. Richardson. "The problem is how you stock it and get it into the store."
The first version of Mr. Richardson's mini-freezer was dubbed the Cold Thief because it stole cold air from nearby freezers. It was inexpensive to manufacture but met with disapproval from store managers because it had to be located near an existing freezer unit. Another version of the freezer, which could be located anywhere, proved too expensive to make and did not keep the product cold enough.
The latest version of the freezer, if next week's tests prove successful, could soon appear in stores throughout North America.
Then again, it could be like thousands of other products that are developed for supermarkets and fall by the wayside. "Until the tests are completed," Mr. Richardson said, "you never can tell what can be a problem and how it will affect the store."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Tax-Free Funds: Mirage of Security?

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The collapse of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company in late July has set off ripples of uneasiness among sponsors of tax-exempt mutual funds.
The insurer had backed $41 million of bonds held by John Nuveen & Company in its $2.4 billion Nuveen Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund. Mutual Benefit's role had been to guarantee that bondholders could redeem their holdings. After the collapse Nuveen quickly bought insurance from other concerns, guaranteeing that its shareholders remained protected. 
 Nuveen was not alone among mutual funds in owning bonds backed by Mutual Benefit, although other funds have not publicly admitted their holdings.
The incident should be a warning to investors in tax-free money funds. Tax-free funds may well be more risky than taxable funds, according to A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J.
This is so even though only taxable money funds have experienced defaults among the securities in their portfolios. After issuers defaulted on commercial paper held by the funds in 1989 and 1990, the Securities and Exchange Commission set tough standards for taxable money funds that took effect on June 1. The agency forced funds to upgrade their investments and cut the funds' average maturity to 90 from 120 days.
Tax-free money funds were largely excluded from the new rules, but the S.E.C. has since begun reviewing the rules governing tax-free funds. While S.E.C. officials will not disclose the agenda, two issues probably top the list: the quality of the funds' investments and their average maturity.
The chief appeal of tax-free money funds, of course, is that the interest is not subject to Federal income tax; in some cases, it is also free from state and local taxes.
The funds are enormously popular. Of the 88 new money funds in 1990, 49 were tax-free funds, says Martha Wittbrodt, editor of IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report in Holliston, Mass. Total tax-free fund assets are nearly $90 billion, some 16 percent of the $550 billion money market industry.
There have been no reported defaults involving the paper held by the tax-free funds in their 10 year-plus history, but it is harder to evaluate credit quality for tax-free funds than for taxable funds, says Russell E. Long, assistant vice president for Standard & Poor's mutual fund group in New York.
For one, municipal issues come in many types, with varying elements of risk. The tax-free funds' holdings include arcane investments like "demand notes," which entitle the holder to principal at any time; revenue and general obligation notes; tax-free commercial paper, and "put bonds," which entitle a holder to receive the principal amount of the underlying security at specified intervals.
Furthermore, many municipal issues are unrated because small regional issuers do not want to pay the fees charged by independent rating organizations.
And, even where ratings exist, many municipal issues are being downgraded because of the economic downturn. Compounding the problem is the eroding quality of banks and insurers, like Mutual Benefit, that write letters of credit or insurance to back securities.
Lately, managers of tax-free money funds have been caught between rising demand for their funds and a shrinking supply of high-quality short-term paper. In fact, last year several fund groups that sponsor "single-state" tax-exempt funds, which invest in issues of a single state and its municipalities, temporarily invested in out-of-state debt because the funds could not find enough municipal issues to fill their portfolios.
To meet the growing demand, banks and brokerage firms have recently manufactured a new kind of "derivative" security called "synthetic floaters." Essentially, these are bonds repackaged as floating-rate tax-exempt securities. Issuers use the interest from a long-term, fixed-rate municipal bond to provide the variable-rate short-term interest paid on the floaters. Investors in the floaters can hold them to maturity or "put" them back to the issuer for cash or a share of the underlying bonds.
The new product has caught on with some funds. A survey by IBC/Donoghue's found 41 percent of tax-free funds invest in synthetic floaters. But tax-free funds that do not own floaters say they are too risky, Donoghue reports. The problem with floaters is that investors sometimes cannot put the bond back to issuers. This happens if the bond defaults or is downgraded to BBB or below.
Still, tax-free money fund investors can take steps to protect themselves. First, in evaluating tax-free funds, look to buy funds with below-average maturities, Mr. Lipper said. In general, the shorter the maturity, the safer the issue. The average maturity for the 259 funds tracked by Lipper is 52 days.
As for diversity, investors in "national" tax-free funds -- which invest in issues of many states -- should make sure that one state does not dominate the fund's holdings.
Finally, look for portfolios heavily invested in government-issued paper, Mr. Lipper said. The quality of these holdings is higher than on industrial revenue issues, which are supported by streams of revenue from a specific project like a toll bridge, not by a government's taxing powers.

What Makes a Given Industry Tick?

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
American universities do a pretty thorough job of grounding students in marketing, financial and engineering skills. But do they add much to the understanding of what makes different industries tick?
Ralph E. Gomory, president of the New York-based Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a nonprofit institution founded in 1934 to promote research into science, industrial competitiveness and other national issues, doesn't think so. What's more, he believes that lumping industries together intellectually fosters the idea that a cure-all can be found for all their problems -- a scenario Mr. Gomory finds as likely as the emergence of a pill that cures both cancer and heart disease. 
 Thus, at Mr. Gomory's urging, the foundation is backing the Massachussetts Institute of Technology's existing center to study the global auto industry. And it has dispensed $15 million -- with more in the pipeline -- to Harvard, Carnegie Mellon and several other universities to set up similar centers of learning about other industries.
Mr. Gomory, one of President Bush's science and technical advisers and a former head of the International Business Machines Corporation's global research operations, hopes that the industry-specific centers will not only generate new products and processes, but also provide forums where academia and industry can capitalize on each other's strengths.
Question: Why do our industries have such chronic problems retaining their competitive edge?
Answer: Americans excel at founding industries based on scientific ideas. We are the ones who translated the fundamentals of solid-state physics into semiconductors, the ones who are turning molecular biology into biotechnology. But our difficulties start when our industries move from the ladder stage, when engineers keep refining scientific advancements until they yield a new product, to the cycle stage, when those products have to go through continuous rounds of incremental improvements.
Semiconductors were an American-dominated industry in the ladder stage. But as soon as competitiveness meant making constant incremental improvements in, say, the amount of memory you can put on a chip, the Japanese became a significant factor. They are the real innovators in manufacturing, the ones who have developed better techniques.
Q. Why is manufacturing innovation beyond our grasp?
A. Americans have just never found manufacturing to be interesting, and you don't excel at something that doesn't interest you. Our pay scales also make our priorities clear, in that we tend to pay people in research better than those in manufacturing.
Most people graduate from college without understanding where products come from. They meet scientists, marketers, financiers at universities. But they don't meet product developers or manufacturing experts.
Q. It seems, then, that adding a few manufacturing courses would solve the problem.
A. Nonsense. You can't apply the same manufacturing fixes to pharmaceuticals and textiles, to automobiles and semiconductors. The Japanese got their costs of cars down by shaving the number of hours it took to make a car. That's entirely different from semiconductors, where they continuously manufacture incrementally improved products.
Our universities have been too busy teaching functional specialties to really develop a detailed, reality-based understanding of such industrial differences.
Q. But university professors consult to industry all the time. Doesn't that give them a dose of industrial reality?
A. They still don't get a total, coherent picture. A materials professor may consult about materials to use in building an airplane without understanding what makes the airplane industry competitive. Same thing in textiles -- a marketing professor would not be much help in spotting problems with buying tools; a textiles engineer would not understand who the foreign competition is.
The universities and businesses have to send people back and forth to each other's worlds. That's where the industry-specific centers come in. They will be a source of knowledge about what is happening in any given industry. They will interact with companies from around the world to give them insights into what matters. They can be like laboratories, where people study industry much as an anthropologist studies villages.
Q. Do you envision these centers as interacting only with business schools?
A. Quite the contrary. The whole world around us is being created by these industries, and that means they have a tremendous impact on our cultures and lives. If we can get people to think that modern industry matters as a subject, as French history does, then historians will teach about modern industrial history.
The centers will serve as resources for every school and will draw on the business school and the economics faculty and the engineering school. You'll have Ph.D. students writing theses about new techniques or new ways of relating to vendors in their industry. You'll even have faculty members testifying to Congress, influencing laws and policies that affect industries.
Q. Don't we have enough corporate lobbyists pleading their cases in Washington?
A. Individuals lobbying for their companies are not the same as faculty members, who would give a more dispassionate view. There is a vacuum in people's thinking when it comes to industry, and that is reflected in government policy. The universities can fill that vacuum.
This is not just a narrow issue of money or even competitiveness. It is a broad societal issue. Doing industry right, correctly, effectively, is the key to whether our children live as well or better than we do. That's why it is worth studying.

HEADLINE: Getting Through Recession On Real Estate's Pricey Side

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

DATELINE: HUNTINGDON VALLEY, Pa.

 BODY:
One thing is clear: Bob and Bruce Toll are business conservatives. In most industries, that penchant might brand them as plodding conformists. But among people who develop residential communities, it has made them consummate contrarians.
Other developers willingly buy overpriced land, figuring that it will rise even higher; in the 24 years since Robert I. Toll and Bruce E. Toll started Toll Brothers Inc. here, they have not bought anything they did not think they could flip immediately at a minimum 10 percent profit. And while other developers ride a boom to its exhilarating peak in hopes of making enough money to last them through the inevitable and wrenching market plunge, Toll opts for incremental growth, foregoing the highs to avoid the lows. 
 Toll may have missed some deals because of its approach, but it has also made it through three recessions without a stain of red ink. Countless developers have gone under in the last year. But Toll, which builds as many as 800 homes a year, will probably manage to hold its revenues steady this year, at about $200 million, making it among the nation's largest residential real estate developers. And analysts and Toll executives alike say there's a good chance that the flurry of development the company is currently indulging in -- as it picks over the carcasses of the dead and dying -- could ratchet those revenues to $250 million next year.
"There are builders out here who, 20 years ago, were bigger than we dared hope we could ever be," said Bruce Toll, the 48-year-old president. "Now we're buying their properties at fire-sale prices -- and we don't even have to worry about smoke damage."
While most of the industry drowns in debt, Toll has slashed its debt in half, to $50 million. And it has tons of cash at its fingertips. With more than $200 million in revolving lines of credit, it need not apply for construction loans, which the badly burned banks are refusing to make even to the healthiest developers. And that's on top of the $16 million Toll raised despite the building downturn in a secondary stock offering last May.
"Toll Brothers simply does a better job of creating an image than anyone they compete against," said James M. Meyer, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., who recently put Toll stock, which was has been trading at close to $8 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, on his "buy" list.
Still, Toll will need every one of these advantages in the coming years. The much-touted post-Persian Gulf War consumer spending spree lasted all of two months as far as new housing went. The National Association of Home Builders anticipates 1.05 million housing starts for 1991, the lowest level in 45 years. Even during the depths of the 1980-82 recession, housing starts did not drop below 1.06 million per year. "The credit crunch has literally stopped builders in their tracks," said Kent W. Colton, the association's executive vice president.
And the Northeast corridor, Toll's mainstay area, is recovering even more slowly than the West and Midwest. Home values are continuing to decline in New Hampshire, Maine and New Jersey, where Toll concentrates its building, according to Runzheimer International in Rochester, Wisc., which tracks selling prices of existing homes. And Mr. Colton says that values of new and old homes "absolutely track each other."
Moreover, Toll is about to enter one of the most hotly competitive eras in its history. Until now, Toll, whose homes generally sell in the $300,000 to $700,000 range, has competed primarily with local and regional builders -- exactly the folks who are having financial troubles. Toll peacefully coexisted with the few other well-capitalized, publicly traded development companies around because most of them emphasized starter homes, which rarely approach even $200,000.
But now, the bulk of the American population is moving into the 35-to-50 age range, when people trade up to larger, more expensive houses -- the kind that Toll builds. And the heavy hitters of real estate are following those aging baby boomers into that market.
K. Hovnanian & Company, for example, has introduced three new home models to appeal to this older, more affluent buyer. The huge New Jersey company, which stresses volume sales over high per-house profits, is unlikely to go much above $230,000 as a top price. But that number still butts up against the lower end of Toll's market.
"We may still be a Honda to their Mercedes, but we are definitely moving upscale," said Ara Hovnanian, the firm's president. "In this business demographics is destiny."
It is the sort of concept that also plays well with the Toll Brothers. Based as they are on immutable birth patterns from the past, demographics are easy to plan against. And plan the brothers did, though certainly not with the speculative, risk-taking gusto of mose other real estate dealers.
Throughout the last two decades, when other companies flocked to the fast-expanding Sun Belt, Toll stuck to the Northeast areas whose climates and tastes they knew well. And they stuck to the similarly familiar ground of single-family homes for upper-income people, lying in wait for the boomers who made starter homes the high-volume sellers in the mid-to-late 1980's.
Throughout the early to mid-1980's, real estate developers gobbled up land, improved it and built houses on it, all on the assumption that land values and housing prices would continually appreciate. But not Toll. "We analyze every deal on the basis of what it could bring us now, not what it might bring later," said Bob Toll, 50, the chief executive. "Sure, we missed some good deals, but I refuse to bet on a roll of the dice."
Despite its caution, Toll has made costly mistakes. It had to write down a total of $8 million in property in Boston in 1989 and 1990, when real estate values plummeted faster than Toll had anticipated. And the lingering recession has kept prices depressed at several of its developments.
To make matters worse, Toll is now competing with builders whose Crazy-Eddie styles of marketing attract not only attention, but buyers. Hovnanian, particularly, is known for its flamboyance: it once filled the Brendan Berne arena at the Meadowlands with some 10,000 people vying to buy homes at below-market prices. As Hovnanian starts building on Toll's turf, the marketing hoopla that it generates could prove a formidable distraction from Toll's more elegant, low-key sales methods.
Not coincidentally, Toll is rolling out heavy marketing artillery of its own. It has a reputation as a master of effective gimmicks like baking bread and boiling cinammon sticks in model houses to give them a homey atmosphere, or placing a fountain near the model house to mask the noise of traffic on a nearby highway. It was among the first real estate companies to put out four-color brochures for each development, and to run videotape presentations in the family rooms of its model homes.
But Toll is not relying purely on atmospherics. It has garnered a lot of customer good will by offering two pre-move-in inspections, one at which the buyer delineates the mop-up fixes that are needed, and the other to make sure they have been done.
Recently, Toll deliberately changed some features on its newer home models so that it could charge less for them and still retain the option of selling older, same-quality houses at prerecession prices.
Its salespeople also have in their desk drawers a list of extra-cost options -- fancy kinds of lighting or staircases, say -- that are not listed in the regular options manual, so customers think they have access to design features that most other buyers don't get.
And it is stirring its people into a selling frenzy. It just started a companywide contest in which salespeople compete for a trip to the Bahamas or Aruba. It recently held an in-house phone-a-thon in which sales managers called every prospect they had to induce them to make appointments.
"We've established goals for our salespeople, and we will do whatever it takes to help them attain them," said Zvi Barzilay, executive vice president of operations.
In many ways, Toll operates more like a basic manufacturing plant than a real estate company. It is one of the only real estate developers large enough to warrant a central buying and distribution office for key building materials like lumber and windows, and to manufacture its own roof trusses and wall panels. It has weekly sales meetings, project manager meetings and vice president meetings, all of which double as training sessions. Project managers can review each other's reports and numbers or listen to vendor presentations in search of optimum materials, sales approaches and cost reduction methods.
"There isn't a problem that someone else hasn't experienced somewhere," said Kira Hann, marketing director.
The project managers file weekly sales reports, and regularly compare their homes and prices with those of competing developments. They are expected to continually measure how their projects perform against cost and revenue projections.
"You've got to constantly factor in weather, or other things that affect the budgets but can't be controlled," said Joel H. Rassman, chief financial officer.
The most telling of those factors, of course, is how soon the still-elusive recovery will fully blossom. Until it does, though, Toll seems well positioned to capitalize on its competitors' woes. As Bruce Toll crows, "Our cash flow is tremendous."
 
 
BOB AND BRUCE, STUDY IN CONTRASTS
 Toll Brothers Inc. has professional managers and an outside board. But Bruce and Bob Toll, who together own 55 percent of the stock, run the show. And they have the division of duties down pat.
"Bob deals with the banks, with the press, with the outside world," said president Bruce. "I read the managers' reports and ask, 'How come streets cost you 18 percent of costs and the other guy's cost 13 percent?' "
Their staff also describes them as complementary, not similar. "They are not interchangeable," said Kira Hann, the marketing director. "They have different strengths, different loves, different interests."
Indeed they do. Bruce is an accountant, Bob is a lawyer. Both men have apartments in the tony part of New York's Upper East Side. But Bruce visits his only occasionally, spending most of his time at his home near the office. Bob has a home near New Hope, Pa., but does most of his socializing in New York. Bruce collects French Impressionistic paintings; Bob is an avid sailor.
Bruce describes himself as a "middle of the road Republican," and his brother Bob as a "very liberal Democrat." Bruce's philanthropy of choice is a Philadelphia hospital, where he sits on the board of trustees. Bob has "adopted" a third-grade class of 58 disadvantaged youngsters in West Philadelphia and is paying for counselors to work with these students and their families to "give them the types of advantages that point middle-class kids toward college."
The Tolls come from a solid middle class background themselves. Their father, Albert, now 85, was also a homebuilder, albeit on a smaller scale than his sons. Today he is a licensed real estate broker with an office at his sons' headquarters. Toll Brothers' staffers say he's in often, although mainly to manage his investments and kibbitz with his sons.
Both brothers have invested their own money in apartment houses and other real estate activities not linked to the company. Bruce also owns several car dealerships and a good chunk of Berwick Inc., a Warminster, Pa., biotechnology business that makes products that can isolate DNA in blood, that he hopes to take public soon.
Although they had no other siblings, both men opted to have large families -- Bruce has four children, Bob has five. Neither is forcing his kids into the business. A couple of the daughters have indicated possible interest, but for now at least, Zvi Barzilay, the 45-year-old executive vice president of operations, is generally considered next in line to run Toll.

HEADLINE: GARDENING;
Taking a Bug's-Eye View of the World

BYLINE: By JOAN LEE FAUST

 BODY:
THERE is nothing like getting an insect's view of flowers and plants. Although many backyard gardeners may not even think about such a scheme, it is a rewarding exercise outdoors and well within the realm of possibility. How? Very simply with a hand lens, or pocket magnifier as it is sometimes called.
The lens concentrates the focus on the details of a flower in an amazing way and opens up a new view of the world around us. The lens can be held close to a flower or leaf without picking it, or for a closer look, the flower or leaf can be picked and brought indoors, where it can be handled closely and held to the light. The lens's magnification makes it possible to see the intricate designs of what have heretofore been thought of as rather ordinary plants, flowers and leaves. 
 One thing is certain: the use of such a lens even for a day's adventure will open one's eyes and help one to look upon the world of plants differently. Such awareness will at least allow for a brighter appreciation of the beauty of the flora around us. And there will be more to see than just color, which is usually the first feature that helps identify plants.
The hand lens is an essential tool used by serious botanists who want to get the identification of a plant species right. No true taxonomist would ever want to be in the field without one. Illustrators and painters who draw plants are particularly keen on learning the details of their makeup.
Although this sort of hand lens is sometimes hard to find, the better ones, that magnify to 10 power at least, are often found in nature centers or stores where cameras and optical equipment are sold. They range in price, but a good 10-power hand lens can be obtained for about $10. Better ones, and cheaper ones with less magnification, are also available. In the field the lens is usually carried on a string or cord hung around the neck.
This type of lens is essential for anyone who is working with a botanical key to identify a plant. Students particularly need to own such a vital tool. But the average gardener would probably not dissect a plant as carefully as those who are learning to know its special identity.
How else can someone determine if a plant has minute natural scales on the backs of its leaves (true of many small-leaved rhododendrons) or tiny hairs along the leaf veins? These sorts of detail are best left to the taxonomists.
This type of plant magnification is especially appealing to children who are eager to have a closer look at how flowers and leaves are put together.
One of the most fascinating things that a magnifying hand lens can reveal is the route that an insect takes when it pollinates a flower. Route is the right word, too, for the flower's beauty, though pleasing to the gardener's eye, is essentially part of nature's plan for pollination.
In her delightful book "Botany for All Ages" Jori Hunken offers this clue: "Each flower face is a set of instructions as to how to enter the blossom and procure the promised nectar or pollen. In general, a bright and showy surface or alluring scent catches insects' attention from a distance."
Then she goes on to describe how flowers are constructed, with guides to the pollinators to entice them into the flower. All of these minute mechanisms are visible with the magnification of the hand lens.
Yellow, blue and lavender flowers tend to attract bees while flies go for the white flowers. Hummingbirds, it is well known, are attracted to the color red. A butterfly inserts its proboscis deep into each flower for a moment, then it is off just as quickly and beautifully to the next flower.
If the butterfly's brief visit is followed by an examination of the flowers with a hand lens, the goal of the butterfly's visit will be revealed, and it will be possible to see the route it followed into the flower to sip the nectar.
Though it has taken eight years, the book "Common-Sense Pest Control" (Taunton Press, Newtown, Conn., $39.95) has arrived. The authors -- William Olkowski, Sheila Daar and Helga Olkowski -- founded the Bio-Integral Resource Center headquartered in Berkeley, Calif., and since 1978 their organization has helped municipal and Federal agencies to get rid of economically damaging pests.
Always on the sidelines, however, were the pests faced by home gardeners. The researchers found that a modern approach to pest control with environmentally sound methods provides worthy dividends, and they have described it in this excellent reference, worthy of space in any library.

HEADLINE: Japan Deports Chinese but Others Are Hopeful

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Japan has deported another group of Chinese seeking to stay here, including a Chinese woman who sought political asylum. But lawyers for Chinese dissidents here say they are still hopeful that students who may face political persecution in China will be allowed to stay in Japan.
But the lawyers said they were somewhat shaken by Japan's abrupt decision on Wednesday to deport the 62 Chinese, sending them from the southern city of Nagasaki to Shanghai on a chartered Chinese plane. They called on the Government to provide a fuller explanation of its actions. 
 Nearly 2,900 refugees from China and Vietnam have arrived in boats in Japan since 1989, and the Government has insisted that they be sent back, saying they are seeking jobs, not political freedom. Of these, 2,425 have been sent back, including the 62 on Wednesday.
The latest deportations drew particular attention because they came after Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu had spent several days in China, toasting Japanese-Chinese friendship as the first leader of a major industrial democracy to visit China since the crackdown on the democracy movement at Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Under Mr. Kaifu, Japan has resumed its aid to China and sought to plead Beijing's case that it not be "isolated" because of its human rights violations. Japanese business executives are also eager to see ties resume to protect and increase trade and investments.
Japan has been severely criticized by human rights groups for its handling of Chinese students. Asia Watch, based in the United States, said last year that Japan had "forcibly repatriated" dissidents, impeded their access to lawyers and shown hostility to their political concerns.
Among those deported on Wednesday was Lin Guizhen, 24 years old, who had fought deportation because she said she had taken part in the pro-democracy protests in 1989 at Tiananmen Square in Beijing before the Chinese Government's crackdown.
But Japanese officials, explaining her expulsion, said today that she fell into a different category from the Chinese students in Japan who engaged in anti-Government protests at the time of the Tiananmen crackdown, in that she arrived by boat with so-called "economic refugees" in December 1989.
"This lady is not a political refugee," a Japanese official said. "She was not a student in Japan. She arrived with 230 other people on the same boat."
According to Asia Watch, 15,000 Chinese students were in Japan last year, and 48,000 more were in language schools, the largest number in any country outside of China. But in recent months, news reports have focused on about 70 or 80 students who are seeking political asylum.
 
Status Is Precarious
 Supporters of this group say that although Japan has promised to deal with them case by case and has not forced them back, their status is very precarious and they cannot find employment. Some supporters of the students said recently that progress had been made on their status.
A Government official, asking not to be identified, said today that a first group of 23 students would probably be given formal political asylum soon. And a lawyer for the students said asylum might be granted to more than this first group.
 "We are convinced that we are making progress with other students," said Katsutoshi Fujimori, a Tokyo lawyer supporting the Chinese students. "If we don't make progress, we will have to raise our voices again." He said the case of Ms. Lin did not discourage him, although he opposed her deporation.
Supporters of Ms. Lin said today that she was in danger of being persecuted when she returned home to China, and that she and other refugees also had political motives because they were seeking freedom. They said Japan was belittling their cause unfairly.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS ENCOURAGED BY HANOI CABINET

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
A major Cabinet reorganization in Vietnam has improved the prospects for settling the Cambodian civil war and accelerating the thaw in relations with Washington, senior Administration officials say.
American officials expressed hope that the changes in the Cabinet would reduce tensions between Vietnam and China, particularly since the departing officials include the Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, who has long been hostile to Beijing. 
 They say a rapprochement between China and Vietnam should help the two rivals reach a settlement in their proxy war in Cambodia, which in turn would meet the most important condition set by the United States for opening full diplomatic relations with Vietnam.
"The road to a comprehensive settlement in Cambodia and a normalization of relations with Vietnam is open," said a senior Administration official who monitors Asia. "This is the beginning of the coming to power of a new generation in Hanoi. The question is, are we at the Andropov stage, the Chernenko stage or the Gorbachev stage?"
 
4 Ministers From the South
 Administration officials note that four of Vietnam's seven new ministers are from the south and have been associated with efforts toward economic reform. The officials say they believe the new Cabinet reflects a decision by the Communist Party Politburo to emulate the Chinese model, in which steps to expand private enterprise are accompanied by tight, centralized control over the nation's politics.
Vo Van Kiet, the new Prime Minister, declared soon after his election by the National Assembly that Hanoi and Washington must put the Vietnam War behind them by quickly opening relations. As a token of his commitment, he promised to press the search for American servicemen who are still unaccounted for.
The State Department publicly shrugged off Mr. Kiet's plea and demanded that Vietnam withdraw its 5,000 remaining advisers from Cambodia as part of a peace settlement there.
But senior Administration officials have privately praised Mr. Kiet as a practical reformer who would work with the new Ministers of Trade and State Planning to encourage private enterprise and open the way for loans from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
 
New M.I.A. Office
 Washington has blocked any agreements between Vietnam and the lending institutions. But a change in that policy is now being weighed as a gesture of appreciation for Hanoi's decision to let the Pentagon open an office in the Vietnamese capital last month to search for American servicemen missing since the Vietnam War.
John R. Bolton, Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, said he doubted that a removal of that embargo and full relations were imminent. But he said the Cabinet changes "would seem to give more promise for us to go forward."
Administration officials view the replacement of Mr. Thach, who is known in diplomatic circles for his abrasiveness, as particularly significant. The hostility that often characterized the Foreign Minister's exchanges with Beijing officials was apparently rooted in China's invasion of Vietnam in 1979.
Mr. Thach has also bitterly criticized Beijing for supplying the Khmer Rouge rebels fighting the Cambodian Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, which was installed by Vietnam.
 
Effect of Soviet Aid Cutoff
 "A common theory in Hanoi is that the departure of Thach is a sop to the Chinese," said Douglas Pike, director of Indochina studies at the University of California at Berkeley, who recently visited Vietnam.
But an impression among senior Vietnamese officers that Mr. Thach was ineffectual in securing military aid from Moscow contributed equally if not more to his ouster, he said.
The new Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, a former Ambassador to Moscow, is thought to be convinced that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will continue to cut aid to Vietnam, and that Hanoi must therefore broaden its ties with other countries.
There are signs that Vietnam's foreign policy is already shifting. Officials of Thailand said Friday that Vietnam had agreed to send a delegate to Cambodian peace talks on Aug. 26 at the Thai resort of Pattaya.
American officials hope that Vietnam will advise the Cambodian Government in Phomn Penh to accept the installation by the end of this year of the Supreme National Council, a reconciliation body led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk that includes representatives of the Government, the Khmer Rouge and two other rebel groups.
 
Obstacles to Peace Plan
 Under a peace plan promoted by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the Supreme National Council would help the United Nations supervise a demobilization of the warring forces and prepare the country for elections.
Vietnam has traditionally opposed the idea of letting Khmer Rouge representatives re-enter Phnom Penh, a position that China contends precludes a peaceful settlement. American officials said they hoped that China would in turn stop sending military aid to the Khmer Rouge once it is assured that Vietnam no longer intends to station troops in Cambodia.
American officials said they hoped Vietnam and China could agree to support the peace plan without seeking unfair advantage for their clients.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK IS SEEING HINTS OF RECOVERY

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Economists who are paid to watch every twitch and hiccup of the New York City economy are starting to see signs of life. Not dramatic signs -- certainly not enough to justify buying a magnum of Dom Perignon -- but stirrings across a broad-enough spectrum to indicate that the economy's four-year free fall may be ending.
The rate of job losses in the metropolitan area is finally slowing. Wall Street is having its first good run of business in three years. The market for midtown Manhattan office space is showing the first signs of firming up. And stores and hotels are reporting a slight increase in business. 
 These are just a few of the straws in the wind that are giving economists reason for what they like to call cautious optimism. "We're not vaulting out of recession -- or even jumping out -- but we are taking small steps," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Of course, not everything is rosy. More than 1,000 companies in New York City failed in the first half of 1991, nearly double last year's rate. And there are no clear signs yet that claims for unemployment insurance in the tri-state area are abating. That may be a reason why there is no obvious improvement yet in the public mood.
There are also more job losses coming -- with big layoffs expected at Pan Am, Manufacturers Hanover, the Chemical Bank and the city government -- that will act as a drag on the economy. And it is hard to ignore the risk of the national economy tumbling back into recession, which could dampen New York's prospects for recovery, although the linkage between the two economies is not exact.
In the 1981-82 recession, for instance, the New York area did not suffer nearly as badly as the nation. And this time around, the region entered its recession 17 months before the national economy sagged, so it may be further through the wringing-out process and readier for rebound.
Despite all of these caveats, many New York area economists are willing to put their necks out and say there is a change in the air. "There are a few positive signs out there, and we haven't had any at all for four years," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
 
Clues in the Job Market
 One of the best clues to future economic prospects is the job market. According to Mr. Ehrenhalt, the 23 counties in the metropolitan region that span New York and New Jersey lost 90,400 jobs in the first half of the year. While that is nothing to cheer about, it is a considerable improvement over the 115,500 jobs that were lost in the last six months of last year. And Mr. Ehrenhalt notes that the unemployment rate for New York State and New Jersey has been holding fairly steady for the last two months, after rising sharply earlier this year.
Within the job market, the brightest single spot is Wall Street. The securities industry seems to be near the tail end of a large-scale restructuring, during which it has reduced jobs and overhead back. The results of that reconfiguring are becoming apparent: Profits were stronger in the first half of the year than they have been since 1987. Merrill Lynch & Company and Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company reported record earnings in the second quarter, and Bear, Stearns & Company recently increased its bonuses by an average of 15 percent over last year.
 
'A Very Important Floor'
 With the return of profits, the number of people on the industry's payroll has started to grow again. Since salaries on Wall Street are the highest in the region, averaging around $78,000 a year, that can quickly translate into more restaurant bills, clothing purchases and co-op sales.
"This puts a very important floor under the recession for the city," Ms. Scanlon said.
Already, there are some signs that New Yorkers are renewing their interest in shopping. Retail sales in the region are still far from robust. But in every month since January, the pace of decline has been slower than in the comparable period a year earlier. In June, sales were actually higher than a year earlier.
In what seemed like a confirmation of this trend, R. H. Macy & Company reported last week that its sales had increased for the first time in four quarters, a development that it termed "a significant reversal."
Macy's would not divulge what portion of that improvement was a result of business in the New York area. But Julian Taub, a senior vice president at Bloomingdale's, said his New York stores were reporting healthy back-to-school sales and double-digit increases in sales of fashion accessories, handbags and men's wear. He attributed the improvement to promotions and the arrival of new merchandise.
"I see slightly improved sales for Bloomingdale's in the metropolitan area," he said, explaining that "slightly" meant less than 5 percent.
 
An Increase in Tourism
 Mr. Taub said he could not tell whether the improvement in sales was a result of increased buying by tourists or New York residents. But there are signs that more visitors are coming to the New York area. Since February, airport arrivals have been higher than they were the previous month. And the average occupancy rate in city hotels for June was 74.6 percent, compared with 73.8 percent a year earlier.
Although this is a modest improvement, and only for one month, "it is significant because it's the first year-over-year increase we've had for 18 months," said John A. Fox, a principal at the New York accounting firm of Pannell Kerr Forster, which monitors the hotel industry.
There are other, more general signs that economic life in New York is improving. A spokesman for the Consolidated Edison Company said the number of customers who were late in paying their bills was beginning to decline, albeit modestly. And city officials were pleasantly surprised in May and June to see a $100 million surge in the revenues they collected from the general corporation tax, the unincorporated business tax and the bank tax.
The sense that business is finally beginning to pick up seems to have spurred some companies to make one of the hardest decisions of all -- to commit to leasing office space. James Vanderslice, a managing director at the realty concern Cushman & Wakefield, said many companies had been sitting on the sidelines for months, watching as rents tumbled and landlords offered such incentives as several months of free rent to attract tenants.
 
A Dip in the Vacancy Rate
 Now, he said, he detects a change in outlook, in which people are beginning to think that if this is not the bottom of the market, it is exceedingly close. "Companies are starting to make decisions now to go forward on real estate," he said, a change that is reflected in the office vacancy rate.
After several months of stabilizing, the primary vacancy rate for midtown office space actually dipped in June, to 16.2 percent from 17.4 percent, for the first time since October. The downtown rate declined in April and May, and remained at 17 percent in June.
More office space will be coming on the market in the next few years as a result of the merger of the Chemical Bank and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. Still, Mr. Vanderslice said, he believes that most of the large blocks of office space that are likely to become vacant have already been identified.
The sharp decline in new construction is also likely to shore up the market in the near term, he said.
 
Signs of Stabilization
 What all of these indicators suggest is that the New York economy is stabilizing, which as every business owner and employee knows, is far different from growing. Just as many economists have concluded that the national recovery will be tepid, so those who study the local tea leaves are expecting a generally sluggish period until at least early next year.
Although the Federal Reserve Board has recently pushed down interest rates again to help insure that the recovery does not fizzle, that may not be enough. The latest Federal Reserve survey of banks in the New York area found that over the last three months, a majority of them had tightened their credit standards even more.
"There's definitely something there," Mr. Ehrenhalt said, taking note of the many slivers of light. "But the situation is still fragile."

HEADLINE: Economy Kills Contested Plan for Flushing Project

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
New York City is dropping a bitterly contested plan to build a large apartment and commercial complex, Flushing Center, on a city-owned parking lot in Queens.
But city officials say it is not the opposition of many residents and civic groups in the surrounding Flushing area that has killed the five-year-old plan but the current recession, which they say has made the project no longer financially viable. 
 If this is the case, the $180 million Flushing Center development is the latest casualty of an economic climate that has killed or paralyzed a number of big development schemes, publicly or privately promoted, across New York City.
Carl Weisbrod, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the decision to give up on Flushing Center was a "mutual decision" between his agency and the private developer that the agency had chosen for the site, a group whose managing partner is the builder William Zeckendorf Jr. The decision, Mr. Weisbrod said, was "based on the developer's assessment that the project was not economically viable." Mr. Zeckendorf could not be reached for comment.
 
Other Abandoned Projects
 "There is much more reluctance to lend for real-estate projects and particularly, as in this instance, on a somewhat speculative basis," Mr. Weisbrodsaid on Friday. "So projects that would have been easily financable and doable in the mid-80's are becoming much more difficult even in areas like Flushing, a vibrant area."
Mr. Weisbrod said in an interview that other major projects that the recession had forced his agency to drop were those involving a planned retail and restaurant complex in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, and the South Ferry project, involving a planned office tower at the foot of lower Manhattan.
Pointing out that there were also many Flushing residents and civic groups that favored the Flushing Center proposal, Mr. Weisbrod said that "if the project had been viable and we thought it was a good project we would have gone forward with it." The latest work on it involved re-designing it to scale it down in an effort to meet the objections of local opponents, who denounced the original plan as too large.
They called it an example of unplanned development that they said was turning the downtown Flushing commercial section into a congested district.
By contrast, local supporters of the project said it would help carry forward what they saw as a welcome revival of downtown Flushing, which declined in the 1970's but was rejuvenated in the 80's into one of the city's most dynamic retail districts, in which new office buildings also rose and a new hotel is nearing completion.
The project would have risen on a sprawling parking lot of nearly six acres at Union Street and 39th Avenue. The original proposal called for two 16-story towers and a row of town houses with a total of almost 400 condominium apartments; a six-story office building, and a mall with more than 70 stores and a multi-screen movie complex. The apartments would not have been publicly subsidized and would have sold at "market rates" under the plan. The cost of building the complex was put at $180 million in early 1990.
But after criticism by local opponents, Queens Community Board 7, whose purview includes downtown Flushing, recommended changes to reduce the project's scope, including elimination of one of the apartment towers, and city officials and the developer said they would try to incorporate the suggestions in a re-design.
 
Mixed Reaction
 But in recent months, as the recession deepened, work on the re-design appeared to have slowed, if not stopped altogether, some Flushing civic leaders said. Mr. Weisbrod said that in view of the proposal's unlikely prospects "for the foreseeable future" it "didn't make sense to keep it alive."
The reaction to the project's demise mirrored the sentiment toward it when it was alive.
"I think there's general hallelujah around," Pam Keating, until recently president of the Off-Broadway Homeowners Association, one of the Flushing groups that opposed the project, said yesterday.
"A lot of people are sorry that we are losing a quality development," said Myra Baird Herce, a consultant to the Flushing Business Association, which supported a scaled-down version of the proposal.
But both women said they were worried because of the uncertain future of the site, where, they agreed, the current parking lot was deteriorating, the city having avoided spending money on it while the redevelopment possibility was alive.
Mr. Weisbrod said, "We will go back to the drawing boards and look at what sort of project we should have here in light of these times and the community's views."

HEADLINE: IRAN TAKING LEAD IN THE BARGAINING TO FREE HOSTAGES

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Iran's Government, using secret intermediaries and shuttle diplomacy, has taken the lead in negotiating the terms and conditions for the release of the 10 remaining Western hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian militants, high-level Western officials say.
The full mobilization of Iran's diplomatic corps in the negotiations now under way with the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, suggests that Iran's President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, may have overcome powerful opposition in the Teheran leadership to force a resolution of the hostage crisis, these officials say. 
 The presence of senior Iranian officials in the three-way talks with Mr. Perez de Cuellar and Israeli negotiators also indicates that Syria is playing a secondary role, though Damascus is supporting Teheran's initiative and providing security in Lebanon.
 
Obstacles in Lebanon
 But Iran faces daunting obstacles of diplomacy and local politics in Lebanon before it can claim success, say United States officials, who note the unresolved demands of the Lebanese kidnappers and of Israeli officials who are bargaining for the return of seven missing servicemen.
Calls by Shiite Muslim clerics and Iranian officials on Friday for Israel to make an early gesture of good will to match the recent releases of the hostages John McCarthy and Edward Austin Tracy reflect the intense pressures on the negotiating process.
Western officials, seeking to understand why Iran's long-stalemated leadership has finally decided to move forcefully on the hostage front, have concluded from their discussions with senior Iranians that Teheran was compelled to break out of its isolation paradoxically because the Persian Gulf war thoroughly undermined its longtime rival, Iraq, as a regional power.
 
A Fundamental Choice
 If Iran's moribund economy and desperate need for Western investment and technology were not incentive enough, the allied defeat of the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, and the prospect of a Middle East conference this fall featuring the first face-to-face peace talks between Israel and its Arab enemies have presented Iran's leaders with a fundamental choice, these officials said.
Teheran could remain isolated, threatened by growing domestic unrest, or its leaders could seize an opportunity to supplant Iraq as the region's dominant power by re-engaging the West, said Western officials interviewed in the United States and Europe.
A reconstruction of events shows that senior Iranian envoys, particularly Iran's delegate to the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, have assumed pivotal roles in the United Nations effort to bridge differences between the kidnappers and Israel.
From the interviews, it is possible to discern some of the most important channels of communication used by the kidnappers and their patrons. The messages that moved through these channels have been cited by President Bush and his advisers as the cause of their qualified optimism on the hostages.
The earliest word that two hostages would be released this month came from a series of diplomatic messages by Teheran. One of the first occurred in a face-to-face meeting in Bonn during the first days of August between Iran's Ambassador to Germany, Hussein Musavian, and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's Foreign Minister.
Mr. Musavian's message that a hostage breakthrough was imminent prompted Mr. Genscher to brief British and American officials. As he was doing so, Iranian Foreign Ministry officials in Teheran called in the British charge d'affaires, David N. Reddaway, and a Swiss diplomat to give them the same message: Two hostages, one British and one American, would be released as a gesture of good will.
The messages were just being absorbed when on Aug. 6, the kidnappers who hold Terry A. Anderson and Thomas M. Sutherland, both Americans, issued a communique asserting that they were sending an "envoy" within 48 hours to meet with Mr. Perez de Cuellar. At the same time, The Teheran Times, an English-language newspaper that is close to the Foreign Ministry and was once edited by Mr. Musavian, reported that an American and a British hostage would be released by the end of the week.
Within hours of these public developments, Mr. Kharrazi, Iran's United Nations delegate, began a series of secret visits to the United Nations Secretariat for long consultations with Mr. Perez de Cuellar, Western officials said. From this point onward, the Secretary General dealt exclusively with Iranian Government officials on matters dealing with the Lebanese kidnappers' demands, Western officials said.
 
Journalists Kept in Dark
 United Nations officials were instructed to shield these meetings from journalists, who had staked out the Secretariat.
Mr. Kharrazi, a trusted member of President Rafsanjani's inner circle for years, returned to the Secretary General's offices several times on Aug. 7, and after a marathon meeting that began that evening, Mr. Perez de Cuellar instructed his principal aide, Giandomenico Picco, to leave the next morning for Damascus and Beirut.
A Bush Administration official said Mr. Picco's presence at Mr. McCarthy's release had come as a surprise as Washington watched the events from the sidelines.
Mr. McCarthy's emergence, with the letter from the kidnappers for Mr. Perez de Cuellar, set the stage for a meeting with the Secretary General on Aug. 11 at the Lyneham air base near London.
 
Letter Called Unspecific
 Upon reading the letter, the Secretary General returned to Geneva expressing disappointment that the text lacked the kind of diplomatic specificity needed to formulate a deal between the kidnappers and Israel.
Still, Mr. McCarthy told Mr. Perez de Cuellar of more specific terms that the kidnappers had in mind for a trade: all the Western hostages in return for Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, who was abducted in an Israeli commando raid in July 1989, and about 400 Lebanese and Palestinian detainees in Israel's detention camp at Khiam.
The next day, Mr. Kharrazi appeared in Geneva and went straight to the Secretary General's suite at La Reserve Hotel. Mr. Kharrazi indicated that Teheran believed that it could secure the release of all 10 Western hostages in exchange for the Sheik and the prisoners at Khiam.
United Nations officials were impressed by the similarity between Mr. McCarthy's and Mr. Kharazzi's messages. Nonetheless, Mr. Perez de Cuellar wanted clarifications, given the nebulous language of the kidnappers' letter.
 
Iran 'Very, Very Useful'
 After this two-hour meeting, Mr. Kharrazi departed for Teheran, and the Secretary General told reporters outside his hotel, "I explained to him what I have already done, and I asked them to continue helping me in my efforts." Then he added, "Iran has been very, very useful to me in all this process."
At the Geneva meeting, Mr. Kharrazi also reported that despite statements by groups claiming to hold Israelis or their remains in Lebanon, Iran could account for only two of the seven missing, and that both were dead. Iran, he said, could guarantee the return of the remains.
On another difficult point, Mr. Kharrazi also said Iran understood the legal problems in securing the release of accused terrorists in European jails. Though no solution has been found, United Nations officials have discussed the idea of European governments making public statements about the sentences and prospects for parole for these terrorists.
 
Meeting With Israeli
 As Iran mulled the reaction of the United States and Israel to the release of Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Tracy, the Secretary General met with Israel's chief hostage negotiator, Uri Lubrani, who made clear that Israel would agree to release Arab detainees at Khiam, including Sheik Obeid, but would not act until it received authoritative word on its seven servicemen.
After a second meeting with the Israeli team on Thursday, Mr. Perez de Cuellar made a telephone call from Geneva to Mr. Kharrazi in Teheran to relay the specifics of Israel's demand for information.
As of today, Mr. Kharrazi had not reported back, and United Nations officials say they hope that Iran has undertaken a thorough investigation through the kidnappers and other groups in Lebanon that have held prisoners.
Such an effort could probably not occur without Syrian assistance, since the Syrian Army remains dominant in Lebanon. It is assumed by United Nations officials that intense Syrian pressure was behind the release of Jerome Leyraud, a French relief worker briefly held after Mr. McCarthy was freed.
With the Iranian investigation apparently under way at the end of the week, the hostage diplomacy came to a pause. Western officials said the Secretary General left for a vacation in Portugal with hopes that by the time he returns to Geneva on Aug. 25, the "process" he started will have borne fruit.
 
Lack of Rancor Toward Iran
 Western officials who observed the process noted a remarkable lack of rancor about the decisiveness of Teheran's actions. The difference between this episode and earlier ones was that key Iranian figures all were allies of Mr. Rafsanjani.
Bush Administration officials say that for practical and political reasons, they have intentionally stayed on the sidelines as Mr. Perez de Cuellar has negotiated with a half-dozen or more countries that have influence or interests in the hostage problem.
There have been no inter-agency or other high-level Bush Administration meetings in Washington to consider hostage developments, an Administration official said, and the reports coming from diplomatic and intelligence sources have a limited distribution to Mr. Bush, Secretary of States James A. Baker 3d, the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and his deputy, Robert M. Gates, the official said.
"Things are not trickling down," the official said. "Part of it is Bush's style, and part of it is that we have to be able to say we were not involved."

HEADLINE: Shadow on a Market

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The admission by Salomon Brothers that it had violated Treasury market rules and the resignation on Friday of its top two executives have focused new attention on this huge but little understood and lightly regulated market, and generated renewed calls for tighter regulation.
The resignations of the top two executives of Salomon Brothers Inc., John H. Gutfreund, the chairman and chief executive, and Thomas W. Strauss, the president, which the board is expected to accept today, followed the furor over their failure to disclose promptly the firm's irregular activities in buying Treasury securities. 
 The abuses took place in the little-known but important corner of the market, the when-issued market in which new Treasury securities -- the bonds that are sold to finance the Government's ever-growing national debt -- are traded even before they are sold by the Government. That pre-sale trading helps insure that the bonds slide easily into the marketplace when they do arrive.
Over all, the Treasury market dwarfs most others in size, with more than $2 trillion in bonds outstanding and more than $100 billion of them traded each day. By contrast, the value of the more than 1,800 companies on the New York Stock Exchange exceeds $3 trillion, but daily trading volume is less than $10 billion. Many of those buying and selling bonds are large institutions, including pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds, in which most Americans have a stake.
Because there is no risk of default by the bond issuer -- the Federal Government is presumed to be able to print dollars, if necessary -- this market has largely escaped the extensive regulation of others.
 
Importance of Dealers
 The Treasury Department conducts a series of auctions of bills, of up to a year; notes, of up to 10 years; and bonds, generally up to 30 years. Individuals may place direct orders, too. But dealers usually account for much of the auction, buying for themselves or their customers.
Salomon has long been one of a select group of firms, the Federal Reserve's primary dealers, that are required to bid at every auction. They are the only firms the Federal Reserve deals with in the open market transactions it uses to make adjustments to interest rates and the money supply. Besides being required to participate in all auctions, primary dealers must make markets in all Treasury securities and report weekly to the Fed on their volume and their market positions.
To qualify for the Fed's inner circle, these firms -- there are now 40 -- must meet certain criteria. They must account for at least 1 percent of the trading for customers (as opposed to inter-dealer trading) in Government securities, and the Fed must be satisfied with their finances.
 
Before the Auctions
 Even before the auctions, there is a good deal of action in the when-issued segment of the market. While it may seem odd for firms to be trading securities that have not yet been issued, it is considered necessary to allow investors and dealers to estimate demand for the bonds. But the market is also subject to abuse. Although there are no public statistics on this market, it is clear that billions are traded during the intense activity that accompanies the auctions.
When-issued trading begins as soon as the Treasury announces just how large a bond sale will be. For example, on Wednesday it will announce the size of a two-year note auction, to be held Aug. 27, and a five-year note auction to be held the following day. The bonds will be issued on Aug. 30.
While some dealers and investors are buying bonds, other will be selling them, on a when-issued basis, expecting to buy them at the auctions. They are betting that interest rates will rise, and bond prices decline, by the time the actual auction is held.
Treasury rules bar bidders from buying more than 35 percent of the issue, including whatever bonds have been previously bought in the when-issued market. The 35 percent rule is one of the rules that Salomon has admitted breaking. It has also said it bought bonds for itself using customer names, without their authorization.
 
Preventing a 'Squeeze'
 The reason for the 35 percent rule is to prevent a "squeeze" from developing. In such a case, those who had sold bonds in the when-issued market would be forced to buy them from the few dealers who had possession of the actual bonds, and thereby be forced to pay higher prices than overall market levels would indicate.
The Treasury Department believes such a squeeze occurred last May, in an auction of two-year notes. Salomon has admitted buying at least 44 percent of the issue, saying the violation was inadvertent. The Government has not said how much, if at all, it thinks the squeeze did move rates. There was a spike in rates at the time of the auction.
But even as Salomon's board moves to name Warren E. Buffett, the respected chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and a Salomon director, as an interim successor to Mr. Gutfreund, there will be intense scrutiny of the workings of the Treasury markets -- and of Salomon's actions and their consequences.
Decisions for the Government
It is expected that any Government action against Salomon will include fines but could stop short of putting the firm out of the Treasury bond business. The Government needs to sell bonds, and Salomon's withdrawal from the market could make that more difficult. At the same time, a perception that an important part of the market is being abused could cost the Government money if buyers shy away.
The Treasury says that as a result of the squeeze, some dealers lost money, and it has expressed concern about future auctions. "If dealers are not reasonably comfortable that they can deliver securities that they have sold prior to the auction, they will be less likely to participate in pre-auction distribution of new issues," Assistant Secretary Mary C. Sophos wrote in a letter to Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Representative Markey, the chairman of the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, said the Salomon scandal "underscores the need for improvements in regulation."
Those changes could include requirements to make more information about pricing available to the public and to open trading practices to closer scrutiny. The Securities and Exchange Commission would like to get jurisdiction over such trading, a desire that bond dealers have resisted.

HEADLINE: As Telephones Multiply, Dialing Will Take Longer

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The nation is rapidly running out of telephone numbers.
As facsimile machines, cellular phones, pocket pagers, computer modems and business telephones proliferate, the supply of unassigned numbers is being exhausted in the area codes serving the largest American cities, like 212 for Manhattan and the Bronx and 213 for Los Angeles. 
 When that happened in the past, an area code was split into two, based on geography, but today only three unallocated area codes remain: 210, 810 and 910, and they may not be enough to satisfy the booming demand.
Yet they must last until July 1995, when a new numbering plan is scheduled to take effect, telephone industry executives say. The expansion cannot take place until then because all of the nation's telephone switches must be reprogrammed -- a complex and time-consuming task.
"You have four full years to go," said Frank J. Saletel, director of major-market access planning for New York Telephone. "It's not a New York City concern as such, but there could be some areas of the country that may have to resort to rationing their delivery of numbers."
 
Costly and Frustrating
 The change in the numbering system planned by Bellcore, the telephone industry research organization responsible for allocating phone numbers in North America, will permit the creation of area codes that do not have a "0" or a "1" as the middle digit. Computerized telephone switching equipment currently looks at the second digit of an area code to determine whether a long-distance call is being made.
Some telephone industry executives say the needed changes may be costly and frustrating and will require many callers to dial 11 digits, rather than 7, even when calling a neighbor in the same area code. They also say the change will be difficult for the telephone companies and create serious problems for businesses.
Further confusion will be created because of differences in how toll calls are dialed within area codes. Bellcore cannot enforce standards, but can only recommend changes to individual state public utility commissions. So far the Bellcore plan has been put in place in 23 area codes, and about half of those require callers to dial "1" plus their own area code before the number, while the others just have to dial the number.
A number of alternative solutions to the Bellcore plan are being proposed. Some industry people are backing an idea that would increase the local dialing sequence to eight digits, rather than seven, and several smaller telephone companies have proposed shifting to a four-digit area code. No serious consideration is being given to the idea of combining lightly used area codes to provide more numbers to congested areas.
 
'Lambs to the Slaughter'
 "Like lambs to the slaughter, American telephone users are being led into a course that will have far worse implications than what most of us see at the moment," said David C. Henny, president of the Whidbey Telephone Company in Langley, Wash.
In a recent industry technical journal, Mr. Henny proposed a system of four-digit area codes, which he says would be a simpler alternative to the Bellcore plan and provide a 10-fold increase in area codes. He says his plan would require fewer changes in telephone switching systems and would result in numbers that are easier for people to remember.
Bellcore officials say that their plan is the most efficient and inexpensive method of coping with the proliferation of telephone numbers and that their system will last well into the next century.
They also say the alternatives would likely cause more confusion or would be more expensive because every telephone customer would have a new number. Such a switch would force businesses across the country to change stationery and business cards, among other adjustments.
Bellcore's interchangeable area code plan will increase the potential number of phone numbers to approximately six billion. The plan would add 640 area codes to the current supply of 152. These area codes allow a potential of 900 million numbers, with about 250 million numbers in use now. Within each area code, there are 792 available prefixes, consisting of 10,000 numbers. Area codes and prefixes that begin with 0 or 1 are avoided, and some numbers like "800" and "900" are reserved for special uses.
The plan will also create overlapping area codes. Rather than carve Manhattan into two geographic areas with different codes, in January New York Telephone will add a second area code, 917, to overlap Manhattan's existing 212 dialing area. The 917 code will initially be used for assigning new numbers for cellular phones, pagers and New York Telephone's internal operations, but officials say they may eventually distribute numbers in the new area code to computer users and regular telephone customers.
 
Proliferating Area Codes
 This model, in which one geographic region will have a pool of two or more area codes, will ultimately require callers to dial 11 digits for both local and long-distance calls. For example, a Manhattan resident with a 212 area code might have a next-door neighbor in the 917 area, and eventually, a third neighbor might end up in yet another new area code.
The Bellcore officials prefer a standard nationwide 11-digit dialing sequence to avoid different dialing procedures in different parts of the country.
"People are going to get used to 10-digit numbers," said Ron Conners, the Bellcore district administrator in charge of the North American numbering plan (People in the telephone industry often refer to the 11-digit numbers as 1 plus 10.) "Psychological studies have shown people don't care what they have to dial, as long as it's consistent."
Although the rapid growth in phone numbers has stemmed partly from new technologies like cellular phones, facsimile machines and computer modems, advanced corporate PBX (private branch exchange) systems -- which assign a separate number to each employee of a company -- have also played a role. Some telecommunications analysts also say the existing pool of phone numbers is poorly managed.
"We have a practice where large blocks of phone numbers can be warehoused by corporations or organizations to provide for future growth," said Eli Noam, a telcommunications expert at Columbia University. "As an economist, that seems to be a wasteful practice."

HEADLINE: In an Assault on Tradition, More Schools Last All Year

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PLANO, Tex., Aug. 11

 BODY:
In a head-on attack on an American institution -- the long, lazy summer -- a small but fast-growing number of schools around the nation are slashing the summer vacation by weeks and moving their students to a year-round calendar of shorter but more frequent breaks.
And they are increasingly making the switch for purely educational reasons, maintaining that since it is easier for children to retain information over short breaks than over long ones the new schedule improves learning and frees teachers to teach more and review less. 
 Some educators also see the year-round schedule as a step toward a more radical change -- lengthening the school year -- that they say would make the American educational system more competitive with those of Europe and Japan.
The year-round schedule "breaks the tradition of the traditional calendar," said Charles Ballinger, executive director of the National Association for Year-Round Education, a San Diego-based lobbying group. "It also allows a rethinking of the curriculum on how best to deliver instruction to the students."
Here in this Dallas suburb, the Carlisle Elementary School decided that its 730 students would benefit even from a comparatively mild schedule change that shortens summer by one month and adds a two-week break in October and an extra week's vacation in winter and spring. The experiment started July 29, as a pilot project for the Plano school district, which has more than 20 schools.
"It's wonderful," said Lynne Gardner, a third-grade teacher in the Carlisle school. "The children are getting a head start on so many things. Three months is a long time for them to be on vacation."
Dr. Michael Kirst, a professor of education at Stanford University, agreed, saying, "There are a lot of merits to the year-round arguments." But he added, "What we need are some good, solid studies that support them."
Professor Kirst sees the situation like this: "To me, the deepest problem is that the summer vacation is embedded in American culture. It is one of the cultural historical traditions of America. And I think changing that is difficult politically."
Objections come from parents who say they have trouble adjusting to the new vacation pattern and from camps and other summer recreational industries.
 
Coming Change Is Predicted
 Despite such objections, Dr. Jeremiah Floyd, associate director of the National School Boards Association, said, "By the year 2001, my personal prediction is that virtually all schools are going to be on this kind of calendar."
Dr. Ballinger estimated that 1.3 million students in 1,600 schools in 23 states would attend year-round schools in the coming school year.
He said that number, which represents about 2.5 percent of American students from kindergarten through 12th grade, is more than double the 522,000 students in 629 schools who were on a year-round schedule two years ago. A decade ago, there were 278,000 students in 349 year-round schools.
Significantly, Dr. Ballinger said, up to 40 percent of these schools today are on a schedule in which all students take the same breaks at the same time. Fifteen years ago, he said, the year-round calendar was almost always used in a multitrack system in which students were divided into groups, or tracks, with one group on vacation at any given time and the school open and occupied all year. The staggered schedules allowed schools to accommodate more students.
Many of these schools dropped the year-round schedule when pressures of overcrowding eased, and before momentum had built to stay with the new calendar but in a single-track system.
The most common configurations of year-round schedules offer nine weeks of school followed by three weeks off, in addition to normal holidays, similar to a college's quarter program. Some schools alternate in larger blocks of 90 school days and 30 vacation days, effectively dividing the summer vacation into two equal parts.
In California, 20 percent of the 5 million schoolchildren are on a year-round schedule. Many of these are in Los Angeles, the country's second-largest school district, which this summer, after years of controversy, is completing the conversion of its 646 schools to a multitrack calendar to relieve overcrowding.
 
Educational Needs Cited
 Proponents of year-round schedules say there are compelling educational reasons to punctuate the school year with shorter, more frequent vacations. The traditional school calendar, they note, was created to serve an agrarian economy that needed children to work on farms during the summer. They also say year-round schedules conform to children's learning patterns, which do not take a three-month break in summer.
"Our teachers prior to year-round were spending most of the month of September in review, and that is not an educationally efficient use of teacher time and of the instructional process," said Norman Brekke, superintendent of the Oxnard School District in Oxnard, Calif., which phased in year-round schools staring in 1976. "During the school year we were taking two steps forward with these youngsters, and in the three-month summer hiatus we were taking one step back."
Proponents also say studies show that the year-round calendar is a better learning environment for students with limited English, learning difficulties or emotional problems.
"A traditional school can help a student only after he fails, in summer school," said Charles McCasland, the Carlisle school principal, referring to the possibility of offering remedial courses. "That's like allowing a swimmer to drown before rescuing him."
Year-round schedules, supporters say, make better use of school buildings, which often are unused through the long vacation, and keep urban teen-agers in high-crime areas indoors and occupied during the summer.
They say the new schedule also offers a more flexible framework for possible longer school years, allowing for the incremental shortening of the break periods and, equally important, breaking the psychological barrier of the long summer vacation.
Among industrialized nations, only Belgium, with 160 days, has a shorter school calendar than the United States, where most states offer 180 days. Japan has the longest school year, with about 240 days.
"A Nation at Risk," a 1983 report by a national commission on reforming schools, strongly recommended a school year of 200 to 220 days. Unlike the shift to a year-round schedule, a lengthening of the school year would require additional money for the staff.
And year-round schedules are already encountering strong opposition. Carlisle's plunge into a new school calendar, for example, met with resistance from some parents with older children at other schools, who are on different vacation schedules.
"I have four children, and it does create problems when you have different children at different schools on different schedules," said Sue Potter, who works as a volunteer in the Carlisle school library. "I'm waiting to see how it's going to work out."
But she said: "As a mother, I would prefer them all to be on this calendar. It's a little bit more sane to me. June, July, August: They don't need that much time off. My seventh grader is bored to tears. She's sitting at home watching TV now. I'm ready for her to go to school yesterday."
Kristin Willardson, a third grader, described the human toll of the year-round experiment this way: "I get real mad because I have to go to bed and my brothers and sisters get to stay up late and watch movies and in the mornings they get to sleep in and I'm like, 'I don't want to go to school,' and I have to go downstairs and get my hair brushed and my little sister gets to lie down on the couch and watch TV."
Strong opposition to the year-round schedule has come from groups with an economic interest in a long summer, like the American Camping Association. That group's president, John A. Miller, argued that summer camps offer children an essential learning environment that is "positive, rather than critical."
 
Teachers Are Enthusiastic
 Few teachers have objected to the new calendars. "In most cases, we have no problem with year-round schools as long as the different school systems negotiate the working conditions for the teachers," said Scott Treibitz, a spokesman for the American Federation of Teachers.
Mr. McCasland said that in the Carlisle experiment the parents of about 30 students elected to have their children bused to other schools when the schedule was shifted, but a comparable number of parents applied to have their children transfer to Carlisle.
In Mrs. Gardner's third-grade class, Andrew Byers said it was "kind of fun" being in school, but he voiced a wistful regret that he could not be out with his older brothers eating pizza.
"Well, Andrew," said Whitney Rowland, a fellow pupil, bringing some perspective to the discussion. "We are going to have pizza today anyway. It's Friday."

HEADLINE: Tax on A-Plant Riles New Hampshire's Neighbors

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEABROOK, N.H., Aug. 13

 BODY:
Among the six New England states, relations have traditionally been cordial and cooperative, except when it comes to the subject of New Hampshire and taxes.
In the early 1970's, New Hampshire, the only state that has never had a general sales or income tax, imposed an income tax on out-of-state commuters. In 1982, it proposed charging neighboring states higher rates for hydro-electric power generated on the Connecticut River within its borders. 
 Both efforts at raising local revenue by reaching into out-of-state pockets were struck down by the United States Supreme Court.
Now, facing tough fiscal times, this stubbornly anti-tax state once again appears to be looking for support in the form of taxes from its neighbors. And once again, it is not getting a warm response.
In June, the state Legislature and the Republican Governor, Judd Gregg, approved a bill that levies a property tax of 0.64 of 1 percent on the utility companies that jointly own the Seabrook nuclear power plant, which is two miles inside this state, close to the Massachusetts border. A majority interest in the plant is owned by companies outside New Hampshire.
In response to the legislation, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut plan to sue New Hampshire next month. Utility customers in those three states will owe about two-thirds of the $22.4 million annual tax. Because it is a state-against-state case, the suit will originate in the Supreme Court.
 
Break for In-State Owners
 It is not the tax itself the other states object to. Other nuclear power plants, like Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, Vt., tax out-of-state owners, and the Seabrook tax will have only a minor impact on consumers. But under New Hampshire's plan, the utilities within the state that are part owners of Seabrook will be exempt from another 1 percent tax now levied on their receipts.
In short, that means all the Seabrook owners pay, but the New Hampshire owners will get a rebate. Opponents say this violates a Federal interstate utility law.
"The thrust of what they've done is to offset the effect of the tax for New Hampshire companies by offering other relief," said the Connecticut Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, who has joined the lawsuit with Attorneys General Scott Harschbarger of Massachusetts and James E. O'Neil of Rhode Island. Since Maine has no ownership interest in Seabrook and Vermont has an interest of only 0.4 of 1 percent, neither has joined the lawsuit.
The plan "is divisive and destructive at a time when, now particularly, we should be uniting and cooperating to help New England as a region overcome the recession," Mr. Blumenthal said in a telephone interview.
The large-share owners of Seabrook include the Public Service Company of New Hampshire (35 percent); the United Illuminating Company of New Haven, Conn., (17.5 percent); the New England Electric System of Westborough, Mass., (10 percent), and the Connecticut subsidiary of Northeast Utilities of Berlin, Conn., (4 percent).
 
A 'Fiscal War' Is Predicted
 The other states' opposition to the new tax was not unexpected. In May, Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. O'Neil testified against the tax at a New Hampshire legislative committee hearing. At that time, Mr. O'Neil warned lawmakers that the levy could cause a "fiscal war between the states in a region characterized by interstate cooperation."
The Seabrook plan is part of a tax package intended to raise $110 million over the next two years, and New Hampshire officials argue it is justified.
Harold T. Judd, an assistant attorney general, said that without the exemptions for New Hampshire companies those utilities would be taxed twice, since they already pay taxes on sales within the state.
"We are removing inequities," Mr. Judd said. "This is not to take away taxes for New Hampshire companies. What we are doing is equally applying them to all those who own Seabrook."
Other New Hampshire officials note that Public Service Company of New Hampshire will pay the largest single portion of the property tax. But its share will be largely offset by the exemption, which means New Hampshire consumers should not see a change in their electric bills.
Residents in other states will see an increase of 3 cents to 30 cents a month, utility company officials say.
 
Lawmaker Tries to Retaliate
 Thomas Connell, a spokesman for Mr. O'Neil, the Rhode Island Attorney General, said the tax plan might also set a dangerous precedent.
"Once New Hampshire does this, other states would conceivably devise ways to shift their budget problems onto other states," he said.
Earlier this summer, as an act of retaliation, one Connecticut senator prepared an amendment for his state that mirrored the Seabrook tax, Mr. Blumenthal said. Though the amendment was killed before being formally proposed, other such measures could arise in other states, he said.
Charles Brereton, the author of several books on New Hampshire politics, said the tax has "elevated to an art form the ability to make sure out-of-staters help pay our bills."
"Our frugality gets a little carried away," he added, noting that the state has positioned many revenue producers like liquor stores and dog and horse tracks near its borders, where out-of-state visitors tend to stop.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Mulling the Idea of Affirmative Action for Poor Whites

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS the nation struggles to come to grips with issues of race and how to rectify past and present racial discrimination, a thought-provoking notion is beginning to be voiced: shift the emphasis of affirmative action programs from race to class.
It is an idea being espoused by conservatives such as Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court Justice, and William Julius Wilson, the liberal sociologist from the University of Chicago, and Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was Jimmy Carter's domestic policy adviser. The rationale is that class-based affirmative action would still overwhelmingly benefit blacks, who are disproportionately represented in the ranks of the poor. But at the same time it would eliminate the appearance of so-called reverse discrimination. 
 Recently, Richard Cohen, the liberal columnist for the Washington Post, added his voice to those calling for a rethinking of affirmative action.
"If economic need, not race, became the basis for what we now call affirmative action, most Americans would not object," he wrote. "Whites, too, could be helped as, indeed, they should be. After all, poor is poor, although a disproportionate number of them are black."
To some proponents of race- or gender-based preference programs, such a notion is a wacky idea that will fold under close scrutiny. Anti-poverty programs are supposed to aid the poor, they say. Affirmative action is designed to remedy past and current discrimination. Some black politicians go further, charging that those putting forward the idea are merely trying to cloak a retreat from a commitment to remedying racial discrimination.
"Don't you recognize a diversion when you see one?" asked Elenanor Holmes Norton, the Democratic delegate from the District of Columbia.
 
No Proposals
 Indeed, to date, no proponent of class-based affirmative action has come fourth with any specific proposals for applying it in employment or education. And in many cases, such as consent decrees aimed at remedying discrimination against blacks in police and fire departments, class-based affirmative action would seem to have no application. And the fact is that race- and sex-based programs exist in most cases because it is illegal to dicriminate on the basis of race or sex. It is not illegal to discriminate against people simply because they are poor.
Some of those who argue for shifting the focus of affirmative action say that race-based preference programs have been a resounding success. A recent study by the Population Reference Bureau noted that the number of black families with annual incomes of $50,000 or more in constant dollars rose to one in seven in 1989, up from one in every 17 in 1967. Affirmative action programs had much to do with that jump. Butthe question is raised whether the sons and daughters of these success stories should be accorded the same preferences as their parents.
"Affirmative action, as envisioned by President Johnson in his famous Howard University speech in 1965 where he first put forward the idea, was a transition program," said Mr. Eizenstat. "It was not a permanent program. There is always a question of how long does that last.'
With the sons and daughter of middle class blacks entering college, some say that another of affirmative action's major justifications, that it promotes diversity, is becoming more difficult to defend.
"I have almost no students whose parents are union members, and very few students who come from what you would call the blue-collar working class," Clyde Summers, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania said of his black and white students. "What that means is that no one has any idea what life is like on the other side of the tracks. That leads to a very sterile discussion when it comes to labor law."
Some advocates of a new order for affirmative action argue that race or sex-based preferences should not be tossed out altogether. Michael L. Williams the assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the Department of Education who has suggested scrapping scholarships set aside exclusively for minorities, said that in cases of egregious discrimination by a particular employer, courts should still impose plans based on racial or sexual fairness.
"Wrongdoers must remedy their wrongdoing," he said. "The question is in situations where someone adopts a voluntary program."
Democratic proponents of a class-based affirmative action say it would also help establish a national consensus on civil rights and for increased spending on domestic social programs to help the poor and working class.
Political support for such programs, these proponents say, will only occur through the building of a coalition of racial minorities and blue-collar whites who have been deserting the party, in no small part because of affirmative action.
"The reason I like the proposal, and reason liberals should embrace it is that it's a way for them to find their way out of the thicket of race and move towards economic justice," said Jim Sleeper, the author of "The Closest of Strangers: Liberalism and the Politics of Race in New York."
In fact, the benefits of most government social programs are already accorded on the basis of income rather than race. Everything from welfare payments to child care is predicated on income, and many poor whites benefit. For example, 33 per cent of the youngsters enrolled in Head Start are white, as are 31 per cent of those in the Job Corps and 35 per cent in Upward Bound, a Federal program that provides special instruction to prepare low-income high school students for college. These programs, all outgrowths of the Great Society, have one thing in common: they retain widespread political support in Congress.
"No one tinkers with them," said a House Democratic Congressional aide. "They may not be funded as much as we would like. But they are not embroiled in the type of hand-to-hand combat you see over affirmative action."
Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he is not opposed in theory to the notion of class-based affirmative action. But he, Ms. Norton, and others, including the columnist Michael Kinsley, raise a troubling question about the concept: Just how would it work? Who would get the preference and who would not?
"Does Clarence Thomas, the sharecropper's kid, get more or fewer preference points than the unemployed miner's son from Appalachia?" Mr. Kinsley wrote in a recent column. "Is a large, suburban public high school a bigger or a smaller minus than a second-rank prep school?"
Programs based on race or sex could have one big advantage -- simplicity. And when you are caught in a zero-sum game of dividing up finite resources, simplicity carries its own virtues.

HEADLINE: Safe Distance;
Bush Has Much To Gain in U.N.'s Handling Hostages

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EVERYONE knows it's the official American policy that Washington does not negotiate with hostage takers. But everyone also knows that in the end, some kind of negotiation almost always takes place and a deal is struck in which both sides proclaim that they never blinked.
That is what seems to have been happening in the past two weeks, even though it is far from clear that the 10 Western hostages in the Middle East will be freed after years of captivity. President Bush's problem has been to keep his distance from a process that he is otherwise encouraging -- a negotiation for the release of the hostages -- and to find a morally and politically acceptable formula for such a process. 
 If trading arms for hostages is wrong, as the Reagan Administration declared even while trying it with disastrous results, and trading frozen Iranian bank accounts for hostages is wrong, as Teheran once suggested, the Bush Administration may just find it acceptable to trade prisoners for hostages or hostages for hostages.
That would be especially true if Terry Anderson and the other hostages are freed without the United States being directly connected to the deal.
What is important, Administration officials say, is that appearances are maintained and principles are not overtly violated. Beyond that, domestic political damage must be avoided, a consideration that has to be central to a President who is facing a re-election campaign in which the Democratic Party is renewing scrutiny of the failed hostage tactics of the Reagan-Bush Administration.
"The President has said it's in the hands of the U.N. and that's a perfect position to be in," an Administration official said. "Whatever Perez de Cuellar can come up with, fine," the official said, referring to United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. "We're able to funnel information through him or whatever. If you can achieve a solution through a third party, great. If you don't reach a solution, then Perez de Cuellar has to take the heat for it."
Last week, the fate of the hostages did indeed seem in the hands of Mr. Perez de Cuellar after the Muslim fundamentalist groups who are holding the Western hostages, central among them the Party of God, released an American, Edward Austin Tracy. He emerged from his ordeal, frail and disoriented, about a week after the Briton James McCarthy was set free.
 
No Master Plan
 Mr. Perez de Cuellar met in Geneva with a delegation from Iran, the country believed to hold the most sway over the hostage takers. The aim was now to provide Israel an accounting of seven of its servicemen long missing in Lebanon; in exchange, the Israelis said they would be "very flexible" about releasing their 400 Arab prisoners.
Administration officials say Mr. Bush did not set out with a master plan to trigger these developments. "It just fell into our laps," one said, although officials acknowledged that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d had put pressure on President Hafez al-Assad to work for the hostages' release and that Washington had sent the message once again to Iran that there will be no normalization of relations until they are free.
It will not be clear until after the hostages are freed, if then, whether this was the genuine state of affairs, or another aspect of the Administration's effort to keep its distance from any negotiations and thus avoid long and potentially damaging Congressional investigations if things go wrong.
But Administration officials and Middle Eastern analysts outside the Government point to a confluence of events and political currents that could explain why even the cautious Mr. Bush has started to talk optimistically about an end to the hostage stalemate. White House officials often quote Mr. Bush's assertion that the victory over Iraq has raised the credibility of the United States as a force in Middle Eastern politics.
"Since the war, it has become clear that we're the ones you have to do business with in the Middle East and we've made it clear that for some players -- especially Iran -- there will be no business while there are American hostages still being held," an official said.
But Graham Fuller, who was the Central Intelligence Agency's chief officer on the Middle East in the mid-1980's, said, "The reason things seem to be changing on the hostages is that the political equation in the Middle East has been shifting consistently since the major changes in the Soviet Union. We're moving ever closer to the possibility of a peaceful settlement that no outside player has an interest in foiling. The regional players, especially the Syrians, recognize that the number of games open to them is dwindling." Administration officials said the coming peace conference puts pressure on Israel to be more flexible on prisoner exchanges.
Iran, Mr. Fuller argued, is less interested in an overall regional settlement than in getting "back to the real world so they can be accepted and get on with solving their economic problems." The problem, American officials said, is that Mr. Bush -- for whom the memory of Iran-contra is fresh -- was adamant about not getting involved in negotiations. Enter Mr. Perez de Cuellar.
A senior official said, "The U.N. simply wants to resolve this and is willing to engage, if you will, in conditional release of hostages, as, for example, are the Israelis. They have no opposition to the idea of swaps. It would be ridiculous for us to refuse to accept hostages that are released as part of a larger deal that was not our doing." Doesn't that mean the United States is at least tacitly encouraging the negotiations? "Those are your words, not mine," the official said.
All of this raises certain questions about the way governments deal with hostage takers. Richard Murphy, a former State Department official who supervised Middle East policy for most of the 1980's, said past failures prove the importance of avoiding negotiations, at least for the United States.
"We did do it -- we negotiated and we got Irangate," he said. "But it is another thing for the United Nations to negotiate or for Israel to negotiate. We have to be conscious of raising the hopes of other would-be captors around the world, but we've never objected to the Israelis bargaining like mad to get their people back. Is it inconsistent? Sure."
William B. Quandt, a former Carter aide who helped shape the Camp David accord between Israel and Egypt, said the United States had not crossed what he called "a red line" in dealing with terrorists.
"Insofar as we are putting anything in the mix, it's not necessarily restricted to freeing hostages," he said. "It is to develop relations with Syria to set up the peace process and signaling to the Iranians that if and when this is over, we might normalize relations. That goes beyond getting hostages out."
But Mr. Fuller said that the no-talks-with-terrorists policy has "an element of unreality." He added, "It sounds good and if you could deter something that way, I would be more in favor of it. Or if we really meant it and stuck to it. But we don't."

For Many Albanians, Freedom Means a Shot At Leaving Forever

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR Albanians, this could be seen in some respects as a banner year: A popular uprising brought free elections in March after more than four decades of brutal rule by a Communist regime. The fledgling democracy was hailed by the United States and the rest of the international community.
But in everyday life it is a somber time for the more than 6 million Albanians, who face either wholesale privation or wholesale repression, depending on where they reside on the Balkan peninsula. 
 Albanians have also learned painfully that promises of aid, including from the United States, remain words, not deeds.
"It is a catastrophe," said Briseida Mema, a journalist, by telephone from Tirana last week. "There is no bread in the bakeries, no milk. There is a shortage of salt. Fifty thousand are unemployed. Thousands of others are getting only 80 percent of their wages."
More than any other European people, the Albanians are divided. About 3.5 million live in the Republic of Albania. The others are in neighboring Yugoslavia and, in smaller numbers, in Greece and Turkey.
In Albania, there has been a wrenching exodus of more than 100,000 by sea and by land in the last year -- perhaps the greatest migration of Albanians since the Turkish conquest and occupation of Albanian lands more than 400 years ago.
In the last six months Italy has been the destination of 40,000 of those fleeing. Earlier this month, more than 19,000 of the Albanians reached Italian ports in a motley fleet of vessels commandeered at knife- or gunpoint. Most were repatriated by ferry or plane last week, while 1,700 hard-core holdouts were permitted to stay temporarily to have their cases reviewed. At least 20 Albanians drowned during attempts to flee a country whose frontiers have been open for months.
 
Aboard Sagging Rustbuckets
 Alarmed by the host of uninvited visitors, President Francesco Cossiga of Italy flew to Tirana on Tuesday to coordinate maritime control of the Adriatic's narrow Strait of Otranto with the Albanians. He also conveyed a promise of $115 million in emergency assistance, mostly food supplies.
What drove Albanians to overwhelm harbor guards and flee their ancient homeland across the sea to foreign shores, swarming as thickly as bees aboard sagging rustbuckets -- for the second time since February?
Ylli Bufi, chosen prime minister of a coalition government last June, said in an interview last week that he had reason to believe the exodus had been "incited by internal and external enemies" who spread a rumor at the beginning of August that ships were sailing to the ports of Vlore and Durres to pick up Albanians desiring to go to Italy.
 
Finding Blame
 In a separate interview, Dr. Sali Berisha, head of the Democratic Party, more specifically blamed remnants of the former Communist Party and of the former secret police organization called Sigurimi for spreading the rumor with the aim of disrupting the fragile process of democratization.
As in other countries in the throes of post-Communist evolution, Albania is discovering that in the wake of an era of Leninist lies, deceptions and manipulations, many citizens give more credence to rumors than to facts as presented by the government or even by foreign broadcasters.
Mr. Bufi, Dr. Berisha and others acknowledge that Albania's desolate straits, shadowed by four years of drought, have fueled the exodus. In many areas, especially the mountainous northeast, the country is as wretchedly poor as it was described 83 years ago by Edith Durham in her trailblazing account, "High Albania."
Last April, an Albanian peasant hitchhiking to his farm near Koplik gave a foreign reporter a glimpse of his people's destitution. He proudly displayed his treasure, an imported jar of preserved plums he had purchased in the capital of a country that should be rich in such fruits. Then he brandished a red-covered document, saying, "I got my passport. Now I can get out of here."
Aside from the Italian emergency aid, which is also a form of insurance against future mass migrations across the Adriatic, the Western response to Albania's plight has been minimal.
Buoyed last June by a welcoming throng of half a million Albanians in Tirana, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d vowed that $6 million in assistance would be sent through the Agency for International Development. But until now, only several thousand pounds of powdered milk has been ticketed for Albania, and A.I.D. officials were unable to say last week whether any had arrived.
"A.I.D. is the problem," said an Administration official concerned with Albania. "They've sent six fact-finding missions by last count, but no aid."
Frustrated by the delay, Mr. Baker turned to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who dispatched 280,000 pounds of foodstuffs left over from the Persian Gulf conflict to Tirana's Rinas Airport in late July.
At this point, the only other American assistance reaching Albania is that organized by Albanian-Americans like Skender Perolli, a New York businessman who heads the Albanian American Humanitarian Foundation, and Donald Leka, a young Washingtonian who arranged a shipment of badly needed syringes to cope with heptatis-B infections.
It is hardly the kind of large-scale assistance the Albanians had anticipated to help them awaken and acclimate after a half century of isolation. Instead, many Albanians are finding that the better life they dreamed of will for now remain tantalizingly out of their reach.
"All are disillusioned," said Ms. Mema. "There is no money and no hope."

Forget the Last Picture Show; in Some Towns The Bank and the High School Are Closing Too

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: VENANGO, Neb.

 BODY:
IT was Saturday night on Main Street, and nickel-a-hand gamblers played cards and sipped beers at Ethel's Cafe. Teen-agers swayed to the music inside the Venango dance hall. And at the town cinema, matinee idols flickered across the big screen.
"Those were wonderful times," mused Hazel Dodson, an 85-year-old widow, as she gazed out her living room window at a town of lifeless streets and weather-beaten houses, some of them empty. "Now what's to become of us?" 
 Like giant tombstones marking the ghosts of commerce, most of the shops along Main Street now stand shuttered, as stark and still as the flat, unbroken plains of western Nebraska. The latest blow, and perhaps the most devastating, comes later this month, when the bank closes its doors.
"It's like dying a slow death," said Dennis Ekdahl, who has taught shop class at Venango High School for 24 years.
Across the country, but especially in the Farm Belt, life is ebbing from the little towns that have long been revered as a cornerstone of American society. In the 1980's, 72 percent of towns with populations under 2,500 lost residents. Venango, once home to more than 400, declined from 230 to 180 in the last decade. Most of those left are elderly people, who usually live alone.
"In an economic sense, a lot of these little places just aren't needed anymore," said Calvin Beale, a demographer for the Department of Agriculture in Washington. "We've seen it coming. But we were really surprised by the severity of the loss. It's more radical than anything we saw even 30 or 40 years ago, when so many people were leaving the farms and small towns for urban areas."
The exodus from the country to the cities and suburbs has been going on since the turn of the century. The farm crisis of the 1980's accelerated the change, leaving many small towns in economic ruins, as machinery outlets, grain elevators, clothing stores and restaurants lost their customers. For small towns beyond a reasonable commuting distance to larger cities, the decline appears to be inexorable.
In Venango, several houses are vacant. Others have been torn down and plowed over. The highest rents run about $150 a month. A house can be purchased for $10,000, even less. But a buyer would need private financing, since banks do not lend money for houses that have no market.
The exodus from rural America has been especially acute among young people, who are frustrated by the lack of job opportunities at home and yearn for a more exciting life. Some people in small towns complain of a brain drain, as the best students, who have talents that could be put to use in rural areas, leave for college and never return.
Of last year's graduating class of seven at Venango High School, six have enrolled in college; the seventh joined the Navy. The enrollment at the high school this year is 19. There is one sophomore and no juniors. Everyone agrees that school consolidation is just around the corner, and then Venango students will be bused to Grant, 18 miles away.
As towns like Venango wither and die, the rest of the country feels barely a ripple. Today the American hometown is the suburb, where people do not have to drive 20 miles to a drug store, or 38 miles to a department store, as they do in Venango.
Those who study rural life, or were nurtured by it, warn that the country is diminished with the passing of each Venango. To be sure, small towns are not white-picket bastions of purity and innocence. There are no fences that insulate them from drugs, divorce, poverty and domestic violence. But certain values still thrive, in ways they cannot in larger places.
A person in trouble is harder to ignore when the face is familiar. When there is only one restaurant in town, the banker dines with the janitor. Without the luxury of anonymity, people are stuck with being themselves. Life in a small town can be a great motivator. Failure is more harsh, and triumph more glorious, when everyone knows about it.
Venango residents celebrated when Violet Bedell, 78, earned her high school diploma a few years ago. They clapped the shoulders of David Johnson, John Paul Arias and his brother Junior Arias, when they returned safely from duty in the Persian Gulf. And they organized suppers and dances to defray medical costs for Sheri Bazan, a 35-year-old woman stricken with cancer, who left two small children when she died last month.
 
Fighting Stereotypes
 "People in small towns, from a very early age, learn that the social unit depends upon them," said Paul Olson, an English professor at the University of Nebraska and the president of the Center for Rural Affairs, a research organization that Mr. Olson described as "an intellectual version of populism."
In Mr. Olson's view, the decline of rural life has been hastened by a government that ignores the assets of small towns and a popular culture that often denigrates rural society.
"Very few curricula include works that celebrate rural life," he said, noting that few schoolchildren, even in small towns, are familiar with authors like Willa Cather, Sophus Winther, Ole Rolvaag or Marie Sandoz, who conveyed the challenge and struggle of rural life. "Instead, they will read a whole bookshelf of works which suggest that small towns are provincial, bigoted, unimaginative. And when they watch television and movies, they generally see rural people portrayed as nincompoops."
On Saturday night in Venango, Main Street is dark and silent except for a dimly lit tavern, Swazi, where a handful of men play cards and a young woman flips through the pages of a magazine as she nurses a diet soda.
The bar owner, Marlon Prottsman, a tall, bearded, amiable man in bib overalls, named the place after the nation of Swaziland, where he served in the Peace Corps. A map of the African country hangs on a wall, near a sign that tells customers they can smoke anywhere they want.
One of the patrons, Dick Ourada, a 50-year-old wheat farmer, stared into a glass of beer and spoke of the old days, when Venango was rich with promise. His father and grandfather came to town in 1920 on a boxcar, on the so-called immigrant trains. After traveling from Czechoslovakia, they thought they had found a place to set down roots for generations to come. But Mr. Ourada's five children, like most young people here, have all left in search of a new promise.
"I guess that's progress," he said, and ordered another beer.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
Investing In America

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER; Leslie H. Gelb is on vacation.

 BODY:
When will President Bush stop telling us all's well with the economy, when anyone with bills to pay knows better? When, if ever, will he get on with the real task before him -- putting Americans back to work and restoring their prosperity?
The recession's over, the White House insists. Baloney. Jobs are disappearing, layoffs are up, consumption is down, unemployment is nearly 7 percent, retail sales are lagging, real estate is a disaster area, banks are failing, credit is tight, wages are stagnant, and among 16- to 19-year-olds only half -- the lowest level in two decades -- hold or are even looking for jobs. 
 Last year's budget agreement with Congress, it says here, got a grip on the Federal deficit. More baloney. The Congressional Budget Office has just announced that despite stringent spending limits, new taxes and the alleged end of the recession, the deficit will rise from $279 billion in fiscal 1991 to $362 billion next year.
Even the President's own budget director concedes the deficit will reach $348 billion; and in that neighborhood that's a distinction without much difference. So the prospect is that the geniuses who gave you the recession and the deficit will now raise your taxes and cut spending again, both deflationary steps, in holy pursuit of that elusive Grail, a balanced budget.
From New England to California, moreover, states and cities have been hard-hit on one side by recession-depleted revenues and smashed on the other by drastically reduced Federal aid. The result is a triple disaster -- rising state and local taxes, declining state and local services and extensive worker layoffs. Does anyone believe that this combination will not have further depressing impact on an economy already gasping for breath?
The Federal Reserve, another source of fatuous reassurance, periodically belies its own words with minor and inadequate cuts in interest rates, which may or may not make it slightly easier for Main Street to get loans; but which do little to restore the necessary economic confidence of those who are now afraid to start or expand a business, even if they could get a loan.
And where did the myth come from that conservatives handle the economy more capably than liberals? Jeff Madrick, a business correspondent for NBC News, pointed out in an Op-Ed article for The New York Times on Aug. 14 that during the 11 years since Ronald Reagan's election, real gross national product is up only about 30 percent. During the terms of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and the first three years of Richard Nixon, the 11-year gain in real G.N.P. was almost 50 percent.
So here's an unorthodox program to renew American prosperity -- one that can hardly produce worse results than the pious economic orthodoxies the nation has followed right out the window:
* Let's stop worrying so much about the deficit, a vastly overrated threat, and invest, for a change, in America and the American people.
* Let's stop fretting about the supposedly imminent return of inflation and see what the combination of sharply reduced interest rates and increased public spending can do.
* Specifically, let's invest -- or prime the pump, if you insist -- by pouring billions into infrastructure, building and repairing roads, bridges, sewers, city streets, public works of all kind; this is not only a needed program in itself, but it will put people to work as nothing has done since the construction of the interstate highway system in the 1950's (and not incidentally, it will train thousands of idle, mostly hopeless Americans in essential, marketable skills).
* Let's also start returning more Federal money to states and localities, earmarked as far as possible for putting people to work at essential services rather than throwing them on the unemployment rolls while the garbage goes uncollected.
* Before anyone shouts "deficit spending," remember that for every point the unemployment rate declines, $30 billion to $40 billion can be cut from the deficit, owing to additional revenues and reduced outlays for the jobless. Thus, unemployment reduced in, say, five years from 7 to 4 percent would cut the deficit by perhaps $90 billion to $120 billion, not counting the larger effects of a revived economy.
Old-fashioned, big-spending liberalism? Maybe so, but weren't you better off when that was the rule? And what has this trickle-down crowd in Washington done for you lately?

HEADLINE: Bush Got It Right in the Soviet Union

BYLINE: By Brent Scowcroft; Brent Scowcroft is President Bush's national security adviser.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Critics claim that President Bush's comments before the Supreme Soviet of the Ukraine placed him "with" Mikhail Gorbachev and "against" independence movements in the Soviet republics. But his Aug. 1 Kiev speech and July 30 address at the Moscow State Institute for International Relations made no such commitment.
The two speeches set forth the principles of American policy toward a Soviet Union that no longer looms as the totalitarian colossus of cold war days, but whose future shape runs the gamut of possibilities, from good to bad to very ugly. In the face of hope for peaceful and democratic change, the President conveyed encouragement and support. Faced with the staggering complexity of Soviet realities, he demonstrated flexibility and an appreciation for nuance. And confronted by the real potential for economic misery, ethnic strife, repression and bloodshed, he delivered serious and responsible words of caution. 
 The core of the Kiev speech was the assertion that the United States would "support those in the center and the republics who pursue freedom, democracy and economic liberty." In other words, we will build our policy on principles, not around personalities. Two corollaries flow from this. First, we will support leaders in the republics and the center who pursue democracy, but we won't choose sides between and among them. Second, democracy requires respect for minority rights.
The President sent a message to the central Government and to the independence movements. In the Moscow speech, he laid out a vision of a historic partnership between our two countries. We can build such a partnership only with a central Government moving, as he said in Kiev, "toward the goals of freedom, democracy and economic liberty." He did not offer a partnership with the central Government per se -- and certainly not with one moving backward in an effort to restore the Stalinist imperium.
The President delivered a similarly qualified message to the republics. The passage in the Kiev speech that has drawn the most fire declared that the U.S. will not aid "those who promote a suicidal nationalism based upon ethnic hatred."
In other words, the United States will not support independence movements per se, any more than it will support the central Government per se. As the President put it, "We will support those who want to build democracy." To draw a distinction, as he did, between freedom and independence simply acknowledges the unfortunate fact that anti-democratic hard-liners and ethnic hatemongers have in some instances crept under the independence tent. The U.S. does not oppose nationalist aspirations of true democrats, including those in the Rukh coalition in the Ukraine, who want to follow the example of Hamilton, Madison and Jefferson.
The President's plea for tolerance arises from legitimate concerns. Many Soviet citizens of virtually all nationalities find themselves outnumbered at the local level by ethnic neighbors. Nationalities have been scattered throughout the U.S.S.R. A history of hatred and mistrust divides them; they seldom have lived together in peace. If they do not develop habits of pluralism and respect for individual and minority rights, they will face a bleak Hobbesian future.
Democracy involves much more than filling out ballots. Soviet citizens voted for years without enjoying free elections. When we support democracy, we support a truly open society, not just a method for counting votes.
Hence our support for a nine-plus-one process -- not a particular treaty, but a process -- by which the republics can, through dialogue, define the terms of their relations with the Kremlin. Our support for this process does not imply preference for any "side" or any particular result.
The President also urged reformers at all levels to support lofty words with appropriate deeds. We will not support forces that repress people trying to exercise basic freedoms. We have never recognized the Baltics' incorporation into the Soviet Union, and we support the Baltic people's aspirations. We continue to call on the center to conduct good-faith negotiations with the Baltic states to that end.
The Kiev speech concluded with sound advice: Know what you can achieve. The republics cannot break free from old relationships and enjoy instant prosperity. Indeed, they have deliberately preserved existing trade ties through new republic-to-republic trade agreements. The President encouraged his audiences to establish property rights, impartial judicial systems, contract law, civil rights, free speech, sound currencies -- in short, to build the institutions necessary to survive and thrive in the marketplace beyond republic borders.
If we have learned anything in recent years, it is that freedom is difficult to win and even more difficult to preserve. Those in Kiev -- or Tbilisi, Kishinev, Baku, Tashkent, Yerevan, Dushanbe -- may want to make Moscow the scapegoat for all ills that befall them. They may want the President to repudiate the center and assure republics that independence will deliver them to a brilliant future. But freedom imposes responsibilities that free people must take seriously.
The President's aim in the Ukraine was not to make a splash. It was to make a difference. He appreciates the consequences of his words, especially in an atmosphere as highly charged as that in the Soviet Union; they may have repercussions for peace and security beyond Soviet borders, and for the prospects for a New World Order.
Our words cannot deliver the Soviet peoples from their dilemmas and decisions. But injudicious promises could raise impossible hopes that might, in turn, affect the calculations of those at either extreme.
Once upon a time, we measured our cold war victories by the temperature of our rhetoric. But we won the cold war and we face the tougher, more mundane challenge of building democracy -- of forging a New World Order. Change in the Soviet Union will come regardless of what we say or do. The status quo is not the issue at all. What is at issue is whether this change will be peaceful and democratic. President Bush will continue to urge everyone that it be so, whether they appreciate his message or not.

HEADLINE: Israel, Most of All, Needs a Just Settlement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Middle East analysis (Week in Review, July 28) helps to sustain a dangerous delusion of grandeur among some Israelis and their supporters. Israel's victory is complete, you say, with Iraq as well as the Palestinians vanquished and the Soviet Union no longer able to provide military aid to Syria. Arabs, therefore, will be responsible for any further Middle East conflict, because it is they who refuse to let Israel enjoy the fruits of victory. 
 But Israel's victory is hardly complete. Iraq has demonstrated that a small country needn't be a piece on any superpower's chessboard to get itself armed, nor does it have to be any nation's soul mate. All it needs is money to buy weapons and the wile and determination to do it. For now, the Middle East countries capable of generating enough wealth to arm themselves are in the pocket of the United States, but that cannot last.
Israel, on the other hand, needs huge United States subsidies to keep its economy afloat and maintain its military strength. Two factors in the United States, one demographic and one economic, will combine to make it impossible for the United States to continue providing this kind of aid, just as Israel's need for it increases.
Demographically, the United States is becoming more Hispanic, African-American, Asian and Islamic. The Hispanic and Asian populations are a wild card when it comes to support for Israel, but Muslims are not. There are or soon will be more Muslims than Jews in the United States. And blacks won't want their tax money propping up Israel. Given that blacks are the major losers as the nation's cities go broke, it's hard to see why they should.
You could argue that black antipathy toward Israel is class-based and that, as blacks move into the middle class, they become like everybody else: mostly pro-Israel or indifferent enough not to present an obstacle to United States support. That's doubtful, but in any case irrelevant, because of the overriding economic fact that the United States cannot absorb more than a token of low-income blacks into the middle class.
On the contrary, despite what you and virtually the entire United States news media like to render as "the triumph of capitalism over Communism," the prognosis for the United States is continued dissolution of the middle class. In the last 10 years, under cover of various crackpot economic theories, the United States has made great progress toward becoming the kind of class-riven society that we grew up associating with banana republics. Nothing on the political horizon points to any change in that trend. Is this a country that will want to spend $4 billion a year keeping Israel afloat -- and $10 billion more to resettle Soviet Jews?
Israel, in its own interest, should think less about gathering the fruits of victory and more about judiciously sharing them. Israel more than any other nation in the region needs a just settlement so that long-neglected business can be attended to. The best hope for defusing the nationalist and religious time bombs in the Middle East lies in increased aid and investment, whether from socialists, capitalists or from anybody's church plate, to achieve minimum standards of human comfort and sustained economic development throughout the region. A good place to start would be the hellhole we know as the Gaza Strip.

In a Downturn, It's Back to Home Building

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STOFFEL

DATELINE: CLEVELAND

 BODY:
After nearly three decades of rigorous activity in commercial development across the country, the Wolstein Group is responding to the industry slowdown by returning to its home base in Cleveland and putting its future in residential projects.
With more than 125 shopping centers in 36 states as well as several industrial and hotel properties under their belts, principals of the private development firm believe that it is in home building that the flagging real estate industry will rebound in the 1990's. 
 The firm's newest project, a $350 million upscale residential community, is being built around a golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus in suburban Aurora, 30 miles southeast of Cleveland. It is considered locally as an ambitious expansion of suburban growth in a sluggish market at best, especially in view of sagging demand for high-priced homes in recent months.
The developers say the decision to shift from commercial to residential business was made not out of choice, but out of necessity.
"It is not an easy transition," said Scott Wolstein, a general principal in the firm and son of the founder, Bart Wolstein. "But a lot of commercial developers are going into forced retirement in this market."
Indeed, the lending climate for all categories of commercial development remains tight because of new regulations and careful scrutiny by lenders, according to "Real Estate 1991," a study of the real estate industry released in April by Ernst & Young.
If Wolstein "is going to stay in business," said Lee E. Harkelroad, regional director of real estate advisory services with Ernst & Young in Dayton, Ohio, "his only real alternative is in residential."
"And," Mr. Harkelroad added, "we're not seeing anyone that is not well capitalized getting any money to do these kind of large-scale land-development projects."
The Wolstein Group's residential project, called Barrington, is large for the Cleveland area. It is going up on heavily treed land that was undisturbed for years as the 315-acre Breezy Point Farm and on an adjacent 300-acre site that was bought in 1989 from the Warner & Swazey Company, a local manufacturer, which abandoned plans for expansion there.
When completed in 1999, the project is expected to include 425 one-family houses built around a country club and a fitness center, as well as the $5 million, 190-acre, 18-hole golf course. While exact terms were not available, the Wolsteins were able to get financing from Ohio Savings Bank and National City Bank.
So far, $12 million has been spent on land improvements and utilities for the first phase. Land has also been cleared for the golf course.
Initial planning for the farmland section alone called for a mixed-use apartment project and a $15 million shopping center. That plan is on hold pending the resolution of a zoning dispute.
While it is common for developers to buy more land than is needed for commercial projects and to sell the excess to residential developers -- which the Wolsteins have done in the past -- the Wolsteins are taking a different approach with Barrington. They are hanging their hopes for marketing it on a resurgence of demand for large, custom-built, luxury homes and on the expansion of suburbia, as well as on the lure of the golf club and fitness center. They see their primary targets as professionals 35 to 55 years old and empty-nesters or retirees.
The suburbs in the far eastern reaches of Cleveland, like Solon and Twinsburg, have been among the fastest growing in the metropolitan area. The outward expansion has not bypassed Aurora. A new four-lane extension of Route 422 links Aurora and Cleveland and other eastern suburbs.
While the median house price in the formerly quiet city is a modest $170,000, city planners anticipate that several residential projects begun in recent years will change the character of the community.
The number of housing units is expected to increase by 52 percent by the year 2000, planning study earlier this year by the Portage County Regional Planning Commission. Aurora's population is expected to grow to 15,000 from 10,700.
The commission, which is already concerned about traffic congestion, the capacity of city water and sewage systems, the potential loss of green space and the area's rural character, is proposing a new long-range plan for the city.
"We've entered the real world of growth and development," said David Lipstreu, the city's planning director and chairman of the regional planning group. "But we don't want to become another Twinsburg or Solon."
Mr. Lipstreu said that those two suburbs have no green space, no rural character, a hodge-podge of housing developments and heavy traffic congestion.
Although the city is feeling the pressure of residential development, the scale and price range of the Barrington project put it in a category by itself. And while officials are pleased that the property will be developed into homes rather than into the industrial site that was originally anticipated, there is some doubt about the project's suitability.
"I don't see where the market for this is," Mr. Lipstreu said. "Sure, there is some money in this community, but where I see a big demand for houses is on the lower end, for the first-time buyer."
But it is the upscale amenities -- the golf course, a racquet club and a security-gate system -- that the Wolsteins believe will attract buyers. And, with waiting lists at private country clubs in the area, the golf course is expected to be a major draw. Since sales beganin March, 100 golf club memberships have been sold at $36,000 each to individuals and corporations.
The Wolsteins also point to the initial success of their Glenmoor, a $250 million, 420-acre upscale residential project begun in 1989 in Canton, Ohio. It is to have 400 homes and a Jack Nicklaus golf course.
Homes in Glenmoor are priced from $235,000 for 2,500 square feet on quarter-acre lots to $1 million for 4,000 square feet on lots larger than an acre. So far, 50 lots have been sold and more than 20 houses are under construction.
In addition to the golf course, Glenmoor includes an elaborate fitness center with enclosed tennis courts, swimming pool and health spa, and a guard-gate entrance.
"There are plenty of places to buy lots, but we've tried to come up with the amenities to attract people," Bart Wolstein said. "And we're attracting buyers who weren't interested in building a home until they saw our projects. We've tried to create a mystique."
Barrington's first phase is to include 99 lots ranging from one-quarter to one acre and selling for $100,000 to $200,000. Sixty-nine custom homes on these lots in the first phase will range from 3,200 to 4,200 square feet and will be in three distinct neighborhoods. Ten of these lots have been sold to individuals since the initial offering in March. Home prices are expected to begin at $400,000.
Thirty smaller homes, from 2,500 to 3,000 square feet, on one-quarter to one-half acre, are being built by Three M Construction Company, a local builder. To be priced from $300,000, the smaller homes will be sold with a condominium-type maintenance agreement.
The Wolsteins still plan to develop the adjacent 15-acre parcel of former farmland into apartments and a $15 million shopping center. While the city granted preliminary approval for a zoning change there from residential to commercial, a citizens referendum in Aurora in May turned down the change. In response, the developers are suing the city for arbitrary zoning restrictions.

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: CHRISTOPHER PERCY;
Building Support for Coastal Waters

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
CHRISTOPHER PERCY is president of the Sounds Conservancy, a group he helped start in 1984 that is dedicated to improving conditions in the six bodies of water in southern New England: Long Island, Fishers Island, Block Island, Rhode Island, Vineyard and Nantucket Sounds.
For the last six years Mr. Percy and his group have been among the most ardent advocates of a study of how to restore the 740-acre Quiambaug Cove in Stonington. Once the cove was productive; now it is a dead body of water with the bottom covered with two to six feet of black, acidic, rotting organic muck, a condition Mr. Percy and others say is the result of the construction of causeways to support the railroad and Route 1 along the Connecticut coast. 
 The Sounds Conservancy's support comes from private sources, he said. It has an annual budget of about $20,000 a year, from 300 family, individual and corporate members.
In an interview on the banks of the Quiambaug, Mr. Percy answered questions about coastal resources and the Sounds Conservancy. Here are excerpts from the conversation.
Q. Why should we be worried about saving these coves?
A. Quiambaug Cove, according to a state fisheries commission report from the 1880's, produced more flounder than any other cove in Connecticut, and now it produces no flounder and no shellfish. Look at what we're losing in terms of shell- and finfish. In terms of shellfish alone, Connecticut alone is losing 15 to 20 million dollars a year of shellfish product, the result of closures because of water quality, in large part because we don't get the tidal flushing to provide a better mix.
We also need to tackle the problems of failed septic systems and combined sewer systems in our urban areas. Overall, in southern New England, we're losing well over $100 million a year in shellfish product, and they use a multiplier effect for the total impact on the economy, which is sometimes six times the real dollar value, which would mean more than a half-billion dollar loss to the economy. I think it's well worth the investment to bring back into the economy not only the dollar value but the protein value of these shell- and finfish resources.
Q. What will the study accomplish?
A. It's an $85,000 study for one year of intensive study on the sedimentology and hydrology of Quiambaug Cove, leading to recommendations as to how best to open the cove up to tidal flushing and what to do with the accumulated silts. We're also pleased Senator Steve Spellman has secured bonding for Quiambaug Cove that appropriates $3 million to implement the findings of the study. We don't know whether that will be enough until the study is complete, but what it does say is this will not be another study that will languish on the shelf when it's complete.
Quiambaug Cove will be a prototype study for the other coves that are affected. The models that will be developed here will be easily usable for the other impacted coves, so we don't have to reinvent the wheel each time we move into a new area.
Q. How many coves are affected in all?
A. There are 12 coves in eastern Connecticut that are cut off by the Amtrak causeways and the Route 1 causeways, sort of a double whammy. From New Haven west, the railroad swings inland a little bit, so the impact is less in western Connecticut.
Q. Why are there so many causeways affected in Connecticut compared with other states?
A. The railroad follows the coastline up all the way from New York City, then turns inland after Stonington. There were, at one time, trestles, which allowed for tidal flow, the tidal exchange, from Long Island Sound into the coves, and that's when they were the most prolific in terms of shellfish and finfish. But the trestles were replaced, starting at the turn of the century and ending in the 1930's. There's a tremendous cost associated with putting in the wood or concrete pilings for a trestle and then maintaining them, as opposed to just solid fill for a causeway.
Q. Why was Quiambaug Cove chosen?
A. We had the most historical information available on Quiambaug Cove, going back to the fisheries commission reports in the 1880's and references in the newspapers and journals about the cove.
And the professors and scientists at the nearby University of Connecticut Avery Point campus have studied Quiambaug Cove, so we have a good baseline of data about Quiambaug Cove. The more information we have about historical productivity, the easier it is to nominate those coves for restoration.
Q. Is it possible to bring a "dead" cove back?
A. I know it can be done. There is some evidence that Alewife Cove in Waterford and New London is beginning to get some resurgence of marine life back into what was once a stagnant area. That involved the sanding in of a coastal creek. These projects are going to be much larger because they involve the Amtrak causeways and the highway causeways. In Alewife Cove there was a stone groin built, the cove was dredged, and they realigned the channel to allow for tidal exchange.
Q. Are these coves going to require trestles again?
A. Ideally we'd like to go back to trestles. That would be the ideal solution. At the least we will have to put in additional culverts. The culverts there now are roughly 35 feet wide. Quiambaug Cove, the natural opening, was about an eighth of a mile. When you narrow something down from an eighth of a mile to 35 feet, of course you're going to have problems.
Q. What other kinds of research is the Sounds Conservancy promoting?
A. We have a dedicated fund, our Marine Conservation, Education and Research Program, to support student research in southern New England, and we correspond with 60 colleges and universities in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York. We award up to $2,500 per project. We have funded now about 18 student research projects. The fund now stands at close to $300,000.
The types of project we have funded run from the impact on anti-fouling boat paints, particularly tributyl tins, TBT's, on shellfish, to the uptake of nitrate in eelgrass beds. The projects have typically been by graduate students, though we're beginning to reach into the undergraduate ranks now. We want to encourage careers in the marine science and conservation fields.
Q. Your organization has also published several booklets on marine resources, hasn't it?
A. Yes, we've done three and are working on a fourth. These come under the research and education program. We've done "Planning for Sea Level Rise in Southern New England," "The Intertidal Flats: Their Value and Legal Status," and a small monograph, "Tracking Hurricanes."
Currently we're working on a major report covering the four states, as the others have, on shellfisheries of southern New England. It will look at the dollar loss, what's caused it, and how we can bring it back. People who are interested in copies can write to the Sounds Conservancy at P.O. Box 266, Essex, Conn. 06426. There is a small charge to cover the mailing costs, so people could call first, 767-1933.
Q. Why does the Sounds Conservancy cover five sounds? Isn't that stretching itself a bit thin?
A. That makes up the marine region of southern New England, from the East River to Cape Cod. It really is a hydrologic unit in a sense, just like a river in a way. And it's a geological unit, it was all created by the glaciers, by terminal moraines.
Q. Since you've been all over the region, which sound is in the best shape, and which is in the worst?
A. If you start at the East River and go east, it gets better as you go along. And that makes sense because the urbanization is heaviest at the western end of the Sound. There's no real problem in Rhode Island Sound, and it's interesting that it's even called a sound, since it's wide open to the ocean. Long Island Sound is the most confined, and that's why the western Sound, from New Haven to the East River, is really a sink.
Q. Do you see any signs things are improving?
A. I think we're holding our own. I don't think we're losing ground in the eastern part of Long Island Sound, although we are losing ground in the western part of Long Island Sound.
Q. Can we have a technologically modern society and a clean environment?
A. Yes, but we need to develop new technologies to deal with our problems. Here's an example: we don't think there should be a tri-town sewage treatment plant at the mouth of the Connecticut River in Old Saybrook. The answer is looking at technologies such as solar aquatic wastewater treatment. It puts out better quality water than any treatment plant available today, drinkable quality water. It's being developed in Providence and up on Cape Cod.
Tied into that, for small areas where there are problems, you have to have individual homeowners upgrade their septic systems, put in low-flow devices in their homes and pump out their septic systems every two years. Once you put in a tri-town sewage treatment plant, you're going to get growth and development all along its trunk lines, and you're creating demand for the plant. The same could apply to composting sewer sludge and reusing it. Hartford has a plant, Fairfield has a plant, and it's definitely the way to go, rather than putting it in the water.

HEADLINE: A la Carte: End of an Era as Nicola Zanghi Moves

BYLINE: By RICHARD SCHOLEM

 BODY:
A LONG ISLAND restaurant dynasty will come to an end late this fall when the Zanghi family sells Nicola's of Glen Cove and moves to Connecticut. The chef and owner, Nicola Zanghi, his wife, Trisch, and sister Nina have been at the 50 Forest Avenue location in Glen Cove since 1974. For most of that period, Nicola's was called Restaurant Zanghi.
Mr. and Mrs. Zanghi will operate a restaurant double the size of the 68-seat Nicola's, in Westport, Conn. It will occupy the first floor of National Hall, an 1875 landmark building on the Saugatuck River that is the anchor of a complex being restored by Arthur Tauck, president of Tauck Tours. 
 The Italianate National Hall, in an area called the Historical Design District, is a handsome brick building that will be a huge inn with 13 suites upstairs and a restaurant downstairs.
Most of Nicola's kitchen staff will go to Westport with the Zanghis. Many of the dining-room personnel are expected to remain in Glen Cove. Some of them will work for the owners of the Romantico Restaurant at 45A Shore Road in Port Washington, who will transfer their hearty regional Italian operation to Forest Avenue. Romantico's site will be filled by another Italian restaurant, La Sirena.
Mr. Zanghi began his restaurant career in 1961 at the age of 13 in his parents' restaurant in Valley Stream. Nino's Pavilion, as it was then known, spawned Restaurant Zanghi, which became Nicola's a year ago.
Long Island's culinary landscape was quite different in the 60's and 70's. It offered far less diversity and sophistication. The Zanghis were path blazers. They introduced imaginative innovative dishes of a sort that were not available elsewhere in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
They served fresh game, and they exhibited a delicate touch with fish and seafood. Meal courses were separated by cranberry or cassis sorbet. Complementary hors d'ouevres like smoked-salmon mousse preceded meals. In an area inundated with copycat Chinese and pasta-and-pizza spots, Zanghi's made dishes with rabbit, pheasant and monkfish commonplace.
When the recession arrived on the Island, luxury restaurants like Zanghi's were hit hardest. The impact set off the change from Zanghi's to Nicola's, a more casual second-tier fine-dining restaurant. Although Nicola's is less of a special-occasion spot than Zanghi's, it has been a success.
Now Mr. Zanghi, at 43 and with three children and another on the way, wants to move on while he isyoung and enthusiastic enough to start a major venture. He says he and his wife will miss their special friends, but not the petty headaches of Long Island living.
Although the Zanghis will move to Fairfield, Conn., next month, Nicola's will stay open for a few months. As a parting gesture for its last month, diners will be able to order fine old Burgundy and Bordeaux wines for 50 percent less than their regular prices.
Georgio's, a high-profile high-priced Italian restaurant in the Garden City Hotel that has been dormant, is to reopen in the fall as a sea grill. The hotel food and beverage director, Charles Hamann, decided to move to light food and decor after a three-week foray in California during which he ate at cutting-edge restaurants.
Mr. Hamann's scouting expedition will result in a bright-light Mediterranean style at the Garden City Hotel Restaurant. It will stress the grilling of fish, especially exotic ones like pompano and mahi-mahi. The healthwise menu will also offer nine types of oysters in an appetizer sampler dish.
The executive chef at the Polo Grill in the hotel, Stephen Meade, and his wife, a cardiac nurse, have conducted research for a menu for the new restaurant. Heavy preparations and sauces will be omitted and easy-on-the-heart dishes will be emphasized on the changing daily menu.
George Labeau will be the chef. He has worked at the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va., and the Riverbay in Williston Park. The sea grill's pastry chef, Christopher Junda, comes to Long Island after working at a number of Manhattan restaurants. Although Mr. Junda's creations include low-cholesterol selections like fresh fruit and Key lime pie, other desserts might well tempt all but the most disciplined eaters.
The new sea grill will be open five nights a week Wednesdays through Sundays.
Changes: The American Bistro of King's Park will operate a courtside cafe for the Hamlet Challenge Cup tennis tournament at the Hamlet Golf and Country Club in Commack from tomorrow to Saturday. Their lunch dinner menu includes grilled chicken on focaccia with walnut pesto dressing, Caesar salad Santa Cruz, Maryland crab cake with Southern slaw, chicken and duck sausage with pine nuts and sun-dried tomatoes with a trio of mustards.
Chatham's, a new seafood restaurant at 107 Forest Avenue in Locust Valley, where Marbles had been, offers an early-bird special. The dinner at dusk, costing $11.95, is served from 5 to 6:30 and features six main courses. A complete clambake for $15.95 is also available at those hours.
CoCo's Water Cafe at 117 New York Avenue in Huntington features a two-and-a-half-pound lobster dinner for $19.95. The lobster is served with corn on the cob and a watermelon dessert in the outdoor summer garden only on Tuesday and Thursday nights.
Fabio's at 62 Stewart Avenue in Huntington is changing its name to Pomodoro and its menu from Brazilian-Italian to all Italian.
Fountaine's Beacon, formerly the Beacon, at 322 West Montauk Highway in Hampton Bays, has added New Orleans dishes to its Creole-Cajun menu. Sean Fountaine, his mother, father and sister own and operate the Louisiana-style restaurant.
Mr. Foutaine's additions include flounder Rockefeller with spinach, pernod stuffing and Hollandaise sauce and scallops Arnaud, broiled scallops with fresh tomatoes and Hollandaise sauce. They join standards like jambalaya, shrimp and chicken creole and shrimp Bordelaise.
La Vigna, a big-deal Italian restaurant at 64 Glen Cove Road in Greenvale, has reopened as a family style operation.
Pasta Pasta, a 30-seat trattoria that made a name for itself in Rocky Point, moved in the spring to 234 Main Street in Port Jefferson. It now seats 60. That move, combined with a slight drop in prices (main-course pastas cost as little as $7), has resulted in reservations-only business on weekends.
Piccolo, a deservedly popular little shopping-center storefront continental restaurant at 215 Wall Street Huntington, is now open on Mondays.
Opening: This month the Elk Hotel, which opened in 1919 in Port Jefferson, will become Harrington's Cafe Americain. The restaurant is called an urban oasis by Doug Harrington, who, along with his partner Bill Farnum, hope to recapture the aura and ambience of traditional old New York restaurants. Live jazz and the work of local artists will be featured.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
You've Got to Stop And Plant the Roses . . .

BYLINE: By Nancy Marx Better

 BODY:
Every weekend, rain or shine, Charles Borrok leaves his city apartment and races to his country house in Westchester. Straightaway, he inspects his garden to see which blossoms have popped open. "I'm highly committed to my garden," said Mr. Borrok, president of the New York real estate firm of William A. White/Grubb & Ellis. "I work on it until December, and then I'm back by March."
Mr. Borrok is among a growing group of executive gardeners who claim kneeling, weeding and digging is therapeutic for the muscles as well as the mind. At summer cocktail parties, they rattle off the Latin names for plants and swap stories about handmade English tools. In the office, they pore over mail-order garden catalogues as if they were annual reports and discuss compost piles as if they were junk bonds. 
 According to a recent survey by the National Gardener's Association in Burlington, Vt., professionals and business people bought about half of all garden-related merchandise last year. They spent $9.2 billion, up from $7.2 billion in 1986.
Experts say the surge has as much to do with changes in the social climate -- the ostentatious 80's have given way to the naturalistic 90's -- as with the stagnant economy. "During a recession, gardening usually picks up," said Bruce Butterfield, a spokesman for the association. "People spend more time at home, and they try to make it a more enjoyable and interesting place to be."
For executives, gardening has a particular allure. "If you spend all day pushing paper around or fiddling with spreadsheets, the prospect of using your hands to make things grow is quite rewarding," said Michael Pollan, author of "Second Nature," a recently -published gardening book. "It used to be thought of as a pasttime for little old ladies. If men gardened, they grew a few tomatoes or zucchini. But now men are comfortable growing flowers."
Consider Robert Hubbard, a partner in the New York law firm of Satterlee, Stephens, Burke & Burke. Mr. Hubbard says the solitary nature of tending to the dozen beds on his four-acre property outside of Albany is less stressful than country-club sports. "If you go out on a golf course or a tennis court and you don't play well, you end up frustrated," he said. "But when you battle trees and shrubs, you almost always win."
Mr. Hubbard, who is president of the New York Horticultural Society, is so devoted to his garden that he won't allow his wife to invite houseguests until July or August. "In May and June, I'm too tired from putting in new plants," he said. "I'm also covered with dirt and sheep manure."
Some executives find gardening at odds with their work schedules. "I've found that flowers bloom on Monday morning and die by Friday evening," said Edward Lee Cave, who runs his own real estate brokerage in New York. He tricks them by taking three-day weekends at his Connecticut home.
At work, "I probably spend half an hour to an hour each day looking at catalogues or books and talking on the phone to my gardening assistants," he said, adding that garden talk is a prerequisite with several of his business associates, including his banker at U. S. Trust. "Whenever I call him to talk about my money, the conversation invariably gets around to gardening," he said.
Then there are the friendly feuds between weekend gardeners. Ed Hayes, the Manhattan attorney who represented Andy Warhol's estate and has a passion for pruning shrubs, rhapsodizes about a battery-operated hedge trimmer that cuts his English boxwoods perfectly. It is the cause of a running dispute with his Bellport, L.I., neighbor, David Shaffer, a child psychologist who is married to Vogue editor Anna Wintour. "David likes to let things grow naturally," Mr. Hayes said. "So we argue about the merits of shaping."
While showmanship is generally acceptable in gardening circles, one-upmanship is not. Mr. Borrok, the real estate man, boasts that his seven-acre country garden includes 55,000 tulips, 3,800 rhododendrums and 4,500 azaleas. "People who give you numbers haven't left the office behind," sniffed Mr. Pollan. "My advice to them: don't count your bulbs. Just watch them grow." In fact,for Mr. Borrok, just supervising his staff of three to five gardeners would seem to take him away from the part of gardening he likes best.
Indeed, most executives are not your garden-variety gardeners. "People who are successful in business don't want to grow just anything," said Steve Frowine, a horticulturist at White Flower Farm, a Litchfield, Conn., nursery. "A lot of executives are getting into perennials. They like them because they're so complex. They appeal to the detail-oriented type."
Mr. Frowine reports hardy sales of fern-leaf peonies, at $70 apiece, and tuberous begonias, at $26.50. Many customers, he says, are collectors, demanding one-of-a-kind specimens with important pedigrees. "They want plants none of their friends have heard of," Mr. Frowine said. "It's like going to a tiny village in Europe nobody's ever heard of. It has terrific snob value."
Of course, such showpieces cannot be tended with just any tools. Susan Colley, who recently left a career on Wall Street selling Government bonds to open a Manhattan shop called Lexington Gardens, does a brisk business in $150 watering cans and $25 spades. "The 80's were about interior decorating," she said. "The 90's are about gardening."
Could plants really be the power symbol in these poorer, politically correct times? Mr. Butterfield of the gardening association likes to think so. "Now, it's not who's got the Mercedes-Benz or BMW in the driveway, it's who's got the biggest tomato or the most colorful perennials," he said.

THE NIGHT TRAVELLERS
By Elizabeth Spencer.
366 pp. New York: Viking. $21.95. 
 Another wave of nostalgia for the 1960's seems inevitable. As the recession of the 90's deepens, as the post-Iraq "new world order" becomes increasingly difficult to maintain, we may be tempted to escape into reveries about an era when life seemed simpler and more prosperous. The nostalgia will be marketed in psychedelic colors to blur the political issues over which we agonized 25 years ago. We'll be urged to believe that the antiwar protesters were romantic, though misguided, figures from the past whose slogans were indistinguishable from the lyrics of Beatles songs. To resist the hype, we're going to need reports from people who clearly remember the Vietnam War era, and who know that swallowing myths about our military history can lead to our having to repeat its disasters.
Many good novelists have written about the war in Vietnam itself, but Elizabeth Spencer, in "The Night Travellers," is one of the few who have dealt with the lives of the civilians who resisted the conflict. It's always hard to write about political idealists -- especially those on the left -- without sounding condescending or preachy, but Ms. Spencer succeeds in making her antiwar protesters plausible. Both their courage and their flaws make them sympathetic characters.
Jeff, a graduate student from the Louisiana backwoods, learned about the seamier aspects of capitalism when, as an oil rig worker, he was duped by his boss into blowing up his company's property for the insurance money. Years later, he uses his demolition skills to damage a California munitions factory in an attempt to cripple the war effort. In between these experiences, he marries Mary, an apolitical dance student from a "good" North Carolina family, and fathers a child. He also makes a name for himself as a guerrilla journalist and a dissident. He and Mary become "pilgrim wanderers . . . homeless, trusting, lost and innocent."
Ms. Spencer's accounts of the militants' rap sessions and correspondence capture the charged atmosphere that hangs over their lives as oppressively as the clouds of tear gas and the roar of police helicopters hovering above their protest rallies. As the war grinds on, political commitment loses its romance. Protesters go underground, sacrificing their careers and sometimes their families as well.
Becoming a fugitive, Jeff finds that he no longer has a choice about which is more important to him, his cause or his family. His ability to continue working for the movement while on the run and also to maintain his ties to his wife is a kind of triumph for him. But Mary and their daughter, Kathy, pay a high price for his idealism. Stranded in Canada when Jeff goes underground, Mary must depend on the support of a succession of well-meaning friends to survive.
Mary's mother, Kate, has never approved of her daughter's marriage and keeps trying to control Mary, to lure her back to the United States, in Jeff's absence. Kate is a scientist with no qualms about killing lab animals in her war-related research. She cannot forgive Jeff when his organization destroys her laboratory and, indirectly, her career.
Mary's only desires are to be true to her husband and to continue her career as a dancer. But neutrality in these times is impossible. She becomes the pawn of both the left and the right, her husband and her mother. Whenever Jeff, a traveler by night, always on the run, manages to get in touch with her, she drops everything to follow his instructions, but their meetings don't always come off.
Mary loves, fears and resents her mother, rarely breaking free enough to live without Kate's financial support. Her mother reaches out for her, trying to make contact; then, when Mary gets too close, she rejects her, fleeing from intimacy. Their mutual dependence does as much to destroy them as to sustain them. Kate begins to withdraw into alcoholism while Mary slowly gains some maturity, creating a life for herself and her daughter in Montreal.
A central character too often controlled by forces stronger than she is can be a liability in any novel. That the author writes beautifully about Mary and her predicament helps a great deal to keep our interest in her alive. Ms. Spencer, the author of "The Light in the Piazza" and "The Salt Line," among other books, has gained a well-deserved reputation as an accomplished stylist. Her portraits of everyone in "The Night Travellers" are moving and insightful.
Still, I couldn't help getting exasperated with her heroine. Mary is plausible enough -- we've all seen long-haired waifs like her wandering through fringe neighborhoods -- but she can't carry the novel by herself, as she's often called upon to do. I sometimes wanted to kick her, just to get her to make a decision on her own and follow it through. Eloquent writing and interesting secondary characters compensate for Mary's passivity, but the softness at the book's center weakens the narrative.
In addition, telling the story from multiple points of view -- those of the author, the main characters and several secondary characters -- sometimes causes confusion. The book is divided into very brief chapters, which heighten the sense of the characters' fragmented lives but also frustrate our efforts to follow the plot. There's too much aimless movement of people from place to place; the book could have been shorter.
When a writer as good as Elizabeth Spencer, however, tries unconventional techniques in the service of her ambitious vision, we're compelled to read on, hoping that she will succeed. "The Night Travellers" mixes political issues with several complex and interesting love stories -- no easy task, but Ms. Spencer carries it off, despite some problems. The book is finally more a novel about relationships than about historical events, and this is one of its greatest strengths.
By shedding light on the people whose lives were disrupted by the strife of the 1960's, and those who fought, in Jeff's words, "to restore some sense of . . . purpose and pride" to their country, she helps us to see the period more clearly, and to recognize in it both the political and the human conflicts still facing us today.

Newspapers See a Threat Of Spreading Sales Taxes

BYLINE: By Alex S. Jones

 BODY:
AFTER being largely exempt from sales taxes on circulation, newspapers and magazines have come under mounting pressure from state legislatures looking for new revenues to balance budgets ravaged by the recession.
In July, California repealed its long-established exemption on sales taxes for all periodicals, which means newspapers and magazines must now pay up to 8.25 percent in taxes on circulation revenues, plus bear the added administrative costs involved with such a tax. 
 California is considered a bellwether state and both the American Newspaper Publishers Association and the Magazine Publishers Association fear that the repeal of the exemption could prompt a flurry of similar tax proposals.
While a number of such tax laws were stopped in various states in the last year, California's action is going to make them much harder to derail.
"I think that it's going to be very difficult to fight the battle unless and until state treasuries are less in need of additional revenue," said W. Terry Maguire, general counsel of the newspaper association.
Newspapers can pass along the cost of the new tax by increasing prices for both single copies and subscriptions. But with advertising sales lagging, many papers had hoped to use increased circulation rates to bolster their own bottom lines.
The California Legislature goes into session for three weeks starting today and newspapers are mounting a big effort to re-establish the exemption. Thomas Newton, general counsel for the California Newspaper Publishers Association, said that as an alternative, the association would suggest an increase in cigarette taxes.
But Gov. Pete Wilson is against the newspapers' effort, and the press is generally unpopular in the Legislature, in part because of its widespread support for an initiative last year limiting the number of terms that legislators can serve.
"No one at this time believes there is any realistic chance," said George Gross, executive vice president for government affairs of the Magazine Publishers Association. He added that the association was so pessimistic that it would not join the newspaper effort in California.
Free publications have been particularly hard hit by the California law. For them, the tax is being levied on printing costs, but they have no way to pass the expense on by raising subscription and single-copy prices. There are proposals in the Legislature to re-establish the exemption for them, which are more likely to pass.
According to the magazine association, newspapers are exempt from sales taxes in 31 of the 45 states that levy sales or some similar taxes. Three of the states with a tax apply it only to single-copy sales.
Magazine subscriptions, which account for about 75 percent of magazine sales, are exempt in 22 states, but this number includes New York, Illinois and most of the other states where large magazines are published. The political clout of local newspapers in state houses is the principal reason why, in 12 states and the District of Columbia, newspapers are exempt and magazines are not.
Since before the United States was founded, governments have tried to tax the sale of newspapers and newspapers have strenuously resisted.
In 1765, Britain was searching for a way to cut the budget deficit caused by the French and Indian War and, among other solutions, levied a tax on newspapers in the Colonies. This was the notorious Stamp Act, which radicalized many papers and prompted editorial thundering for rebellion.
In the centuries since then, newspapers have paid their corporate and income taxes, but have argued that a tax on newspaper circulation did not promote the First Amendment's underlying policy of encouraging the free flow of information.
Efforts to tax advertising have also been tried. In 1987, Florida passed a tax on advertising and other services, including lawn-mowing and legal advice. Such services are rarely taxed in this country and the law prompted such a huge outcry that it was repealed six months later.
Mr. Maguire of the newspaper association said the prospect of a widespread effort to tax advertising was more remote than the expected blitzkrieg of efforts to tax the newspaper itself, which is considered a manufactured product rather than a service.
While newspapers and magazines have generally been allies in the fight to avoid sales taxes, the willingness of state legislatures to tax magazines, while exempting newspapers, sometimes puts them in opposing camps. Magazines have filed suit, arguing that they should not be singled out.
The United States Supreme Court has ruled that in certain cases, states may tax magazines and not newspapers. They may not make a distinction for tax purposes on the basis of content, which would amount to censorship. But the court also said that if the basis of the tax distinction was the form of the publication, rather than the content, then states might tax one and not the other.
Refining the distinction between form and content will probably be tested later this year because of a law passed early this month by the Pennsylvania Legislature that repeals the sales tax exemption on magazines, but leaves newspapers exempt.
Mr. Gross of the magazine association said the state's magazine publishers intended to file suit.

HEADLINE: With New Talks Near, Cypriots Wonder How the Divide Can Be Bridged

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: NICOSIA, Cyprus, Aug. 13

 BODY:
In the quiet no man's land between the feuding Greek and Turkish Cypriots, the sandbags and barbed-wire fences loom like images from the cold war, a mean place of rival flags and minefields that have partitioned this island nation for 17 years.
But in the flurry of diplomatic activity that has followed the end of the Persian Gulf war, Muslim Turks and Christian Greeks are cautiously measuring whether the time has come to heal old wounds and reunite the broken halves of Cyprus. 
 Many of the 700,000 inhabitants, above all the Greeks in the south, are eagerly following news of the latest peacemaking moves, all too aware that nothing came of many previous efforts to end the deadlock since Turkish forces seized the northern part of the island in 1974 and set up a breakaway state there recognized only by Turkey.
This time, with the influence of the United States newly at work here, refugees on both sides of the barricades are wondering whether sometime soon they will again be able to see their birthplaces. But in the confines of this island, where each side sees conspiracy in the gesture of the other, there is also great apprehension about a peace conference to be held next month in the United States.
 
Talks Announced by Bush
 The conference, with the United Nations as host, was announced by President Bush after he visited Greece and Turkey last month. It aims to bring together for the first time representatives of the two Cypriot sides as well as their protectors in Greece and Turkey. To prepare the ground, a special American envoy, Nelson Ledsky, visited the island last week, and United Nations negotiators are due later this month.
But such are the bitter memories of the near civil war of the 1950's and 60's and the Turkish invasion of 1974 that the obstacles to normalization remain enormous.
The mood is ambivalent, for example, in the living room of Caliope Christofi in Stromvoli, one of the many refugee settlements that ring Nicosia, the capital. A Greek refugee from the north, Mrs. Christofi brings out photographs of the dead and talks of the instant her life turned.
It was quarter to six in the evening, Mrs. Christofi said, when she learned that Turkish troops had landed. She grabbed her four young sons, hid in a cave and then fled south, walking from village to village. Her husband, a lighthouse guard, fell ill on the journey and died. Turkish soldiers killed her brother's 17-year-old son and 22-year-old son-in-law, she said.
 
'How Can We Forget?'
 "How can we forget this?" she asked. "Of course I would like to go back to my house. But how could I? How could my brother live again with a Turkish neighbor?"
On the other side of the barbed frontier, a 118-mile line patrolled by United Nations troops, Turkish feelings are just as intense. At the only crossing point, a startling street exhibit, titled "Years of Terror -- 1955, 1963, 1974," shows close-up photographs of slain adults and children and images of burned and bullet-ridden homes and mosques. The scenes are described as the work of Greek nationalists determined to terrorize Turkish Cypriots and drive them from the land the nationalists considered Greek.
Hamac Osman was among the Turks who became refugees in 1974. He now runs a small electronics store in Kyrenia, in the north. "I will not go back and live with Greeks," he said.
His sister Mevhibe blurted: "We don't want them back. We lost our childhood there. We were always afraid."
It is in the north where people appear least interested in a settlement. An accord is likely to involve the Turks' giving up part of the occupied territory and some prime property as well as a withdrawal of most or all Turkish soldiers. United Nations officials estimate that 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed here.
 
Turkish Demands Rejected
 Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, is said to have wide support for his demand that any solution must include the right for Turkey to intervene unilaterally to defend his people, who make up a fifth of the population. Such a demand is unacceptable to Greek Cypriots and to Athens, which keeps about 2,000 soldiers here. While Ankara argues that it sent troops to protect its ethnic compatriots and to stop a pro-Greek coup from forcing a union with Greece, Athens has never stopped arguing that the Turkish presence is an invasion that went unpunished.
The United States, which has not regarded the Cyprus problem as pressing for several decades, has become involved in the months since the gulf war, partly as a result of Greece's arguments that only Washington can persuade the Turks to leave Cyprus. But Washington is also worried that the continuing feud between Greece and Turkey could create more friction in the eastern flank of NATO at a time of delicate change in the Eastern Mediterranean and growing instability in the Balkans.
While the binoculars and blue banners of the United Nations have kept the peace here, they have been unable to stop the two peoples from growing apart in ways that may be difficult to bridge. One problematic issue is the fate of the settlers imported here from mainland Turkey, among them Kurds from the east, Muslims who fled Bulgaria and poor farmers from all over Anatolia. Many of them were given the land and homes of expelled or fleeing Greek Cypriots.
Several small Turkish partis in the north also argue that the 60,000 settlers have little in common with the 120,000 Westernized Turkish islanders. These groups also accuse Mr. Denktash of using the immigrants to bolster his position at the polls.
Mustafa Kortum, an official of the Denktash government, said: "We needed labor. These people work the land and had children. They came legally and they must stay."
 
Some Progress Reported
 In recent weeks, though, some progress has reportedly been made on the difficult question of how much land now in the Turkish zone should be returned to the Greek side. Reports have leaked that Turkey was willing to reduce the current 37 percent of the land it occupies to 25 or 30 percent.
The two sides differ widely over how many Greek refugees may return to the north and reclaim their property. In the southern city of Limassol, where many have settled, older people almost beg to go. Akinoi Mortis and her family were among the 180,000 Greeks who fled or were forced to move south after the Turkish invasion. At the same time, 80,000 Turks were forced north.
"How would the people of New York feel if they were expelled to Texas, and those from Texas were sent to Chicago?" said Akinoi Mortis. She says she cannot wait to give up her little grocery, once owned by Turks, and go back to Famagusta. "Every night I pray to go home," she said.
In a unified Cyprus, Mr. Denktash wants to have two virtually autonomous parts of a federation, with separate governments and separate rules of commerce. Northern businessmen have reportedly demanded protectionist measures because they fear competition from tougher and more up-to-date Greek entrepreneurs.
From a rooftop overlooking Nicosia, the view itself is a reflection of the astonishing range of differences that have sprung from years of de facto partition. A line of tall, competing pennants marks the line dividing the city's two sectors since 1963. Low, red-tiled roofs stretch across the north of the city, homes to craftsmen and shopkeepers, a place punctuated by minarets and calls for prayer.
 
Southern Side Prospers
 To the south, the skyline is an enormous wall of high-rises built to house offices and apartments of bankers and traders, many of whom moved here from Lebanon after the collapse of Beirut.
The southern side has disco music, flashy electronics and youths on motorcycles. Along the nearby coast, Greeks have built a rash of identical modern hotels to accommodate a flourishing tourist industry. The post-invasion boom here has left Greek Cypriots with per capita earnings of some $8,000 a year, about three times that of the north, where half the budget is made up by Turkey.
Bridging that economic gap is also a subject of the coming talks. Yet the promise of material welfare for the north appears to offer little enticement for Mr. Denktash, who has become personally wealthy.
Only last week, according to a well-placed United Nations official, Mr. Denktash apparently reassured his hard-line supporters that even a smooth peae conference would have to be followed by long follow-up talks. Final application of new rules in Cyprus, he reportedly told them, might well take years.

New York State Account Is Lost by Wells Rich

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
The New York State travel and tourism advertising account, famous for its longtime "I Love New York" slogan, is leaving its agency of 14 years, Wells Rich Greene BDDP, for McCann-Erickson New York.
"I'm disappointed, but I'm not surprised," Kenneth S. Olshan, chairman and chief executive of Wells Rich, said Friday. Billings, which ran as high as $15 million during the campaign's heyday in the 1980's, have fallen to around $2.5 million. 
 The shift of the account, following a regular review conducted every three years, is expected to be announced today by the New York State Department of Economic Development. At one point, 10 agencies, including Wells Rich and McCann, were finalists in the review.
The development of the slogan, which had a heart symbol replacing the word "love" and generated legions of imitators, is generally credited to Charlie Moss, Wells Rich's vice chairman and corporate creative director. The campaign is considered the inspiration for a wave of marketing campaigns by states seeking to promote themselves as vacation destinations the way consumer-products companies market soap and soup.
Mr. Olshan said Mr. Moss described the loss of the account, which has not been a profit-maker for the agency, as "good news, because maybe now we can go after something exciting and romantic where we'll have to travel to see the client."

Peoples' Defender Retains a Taste For New Causes

BYLINE: By E. R. SHIPP

 BODY:
The news that the head of the Transit Authority had suggested cutting services in those areas not organized enough to offer opposition was no news to low-income New Yorkers, especially those who are black or Hispanic.
For years they have seen reduced services and hazardous sites in their midst -- often when communities with more political and economic clout retained services and kept those projects out of their backyards. 
 On the environmental front, it is a pattern seen throughout the nation, as the United Church of Christ's Commission for Racial Justice documented several years ago in a study directed by Charles Lee of the commission.
"There's been a pattern in terms of racial inequity: Communities 'on the other side of the tracks,' so to speak, get the most noxious type facilities," Mr. Lee said recently.
By the time the commission released its study in 1987, L. Ann Rocker already knew that. By then, the former teacher and director of a South Bronx community-development program had joined the growing ranks of blacks, Hispanic-Americans and American Indians who have begun to fight back.
In New York, such efforts seem to have begun in earnest in the last five years and range from the Toxic Avengers, a youth group combating a radioactive-waste site in Williamsburg to several groups focusing on lead poisoning.
More often than not, they do not call themselves environmentalists, thinking perhaps that that word is reserved for people trying to save the whales or some other endangered species.
For Mrs. Rocker, a resident of West Harlem for 26 years, the most endangered species are her family and her neighbors. Her conver sion from merely being annoyed to doing some thing about it began on July 4, 1986 -- a few months after a sewage- treatment plant opened across the street from her apart ment building on Riverside Drive.
The plant, which the city had decided to build before World War II, was to have been placed farther downtown along the Hudson. But that area had clout. Harlem did not. So the plant stretches from 137th Street to 145th Street.
It was not until the stench from the plant ruined her Fourth of July barbecue that she decided to do something. "I was so angry that the next morning I got myself together and I found out about D.E.P.," she said. That is the city's Department of Environmental Protection, which operates the plant.
But she got the brushoff there and when she tried to convince local community leaders to do something, they begged off: The issue was too technical, the bureaucracy too complicated for them. Some did suggest that she start a petition drive or organize a march. But she said no.
You know, that's just going out there hollering and saying really nothing, she said the other day. "I knew that we must get deeper than that."
Since then she has gotten deeper -- learning how the plant came to be placed in Harlem, its design and how it is supposed to function, its shortcomings and, most important, who in government should be doing something about it.
Mrs. Rocker, who is married and the mother of three, led her neighbors in forming the North River Community Environmental Review Board, which monitors conditions at the plant.
But Mrs. Rocker has not stopped there. Her efforts led the city to shut an illegal garbage dump last fall. Several years ago, she helped get the meatpackers in the Manhattanville section to stop dumping their waste along the banks of the Hudson, where "the rats, rodents, snakes and everything else were enjoying themselves."
She has joined with others in complaining about air pollution from the crematorium at the Trinity Church cemetery and an incinerator at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. She recently added to her growing list of environmental concerns the Amtrak trains that speed through Harlem, polluting the air and endangering lives where there are no fences to keep the public off the tracks, especially those tracks that run through city parks.
She has also added to her list a plan that would increase traffic and remove some trees on Riverside Drive, which she said would add to the pollution problem.
She has studied the new City Charter and its promise to spread unwanted public projects around the city in a more equitable manner. But she has become convinced that black and Hispanic New Yorkers are still going to suffer unless they become more diligent. Most of all, she said, they must begin to hold their elected officials accountable.
Because of her impatience with small talk -- or any talk in lieu of action -- she often comes across as abrupt and abrasive. She does not suffer fools or politicians. But if any of them are in search of causes to champion, she says: "We've got a bowl full of issues right here. Close your eyes and pull one."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS: UPHEAVAL AT SALOMON;
Disruption Of Bonds Is Doubted

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Treasury Department's curious handling of the way Salomon Brothers operates in the government securities market will probably have little influence on the future course of interest rates, credit market analysts and Wall Street executives said yesterday.
Indeed, while the Treasury's disciplinary action is likely to be a big topic of conversation this week, traders said any movement in bond yields was more likely to be precipitated by the Federal Reserve, whose policy-making Open Market Committee is expected to meet in Washington tomorrow. 
 On the surface, any action that the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve might take against Salomon would seem to carry at least some risk of disrupting the market. As arguably the most aggressive firm in the government securities market, Salomon has long been a leading, if not dominant, force in bidding for and then distributing Federal debt obligations.
 
Part of Order Rescinded
 The Treasury seemed to acknowledge that risk when it chose to rescind part of an order it issued early yesterday that would have barred Salomon from bidding in upcoming auctions of government securities. The action follows Salomon's admission that it had violated Federal rules during Treasury auctions this year.
After Salomon's three top executives resigned yesterday afternoon, however, the Treasury amended its original order. Salomon can bid for its own account, but is prevented from placing orders for customers until the various investigations are finished.
Wall Street executives said that while the Treasury Department appeared indecisive and worried, its amended order made sense.
"I can see how people might think the Treasury backed off because of concerns about taking Salomon out of the market," the head of a rival primary dealer said. "But that just isn't the case. When you look at who owns U.S. Treasury debt around the world, Salomon has a tiny percentage. Denying them access to their clients is a real penalty to them. But those customers will still have to operate in the market, and will still be buyers of securities."
Moreover, barring Salomon from bidding for its own account at upcoming auctions would have little practical effect, the executive said, since Salomon could easily place bids for the issues through other primary dealers.
Traders and analysts said they did not expect bidding at today's regular auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills to be affected by the Treasury Department's announcements. A truer test will come next week, they added, when new two-year and five-year notes are expected to be sold. Even then the impact will probably be quite marginal, they said.
"At the margin, the Treasury's action should lessen the bid at the auctions," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "But my first impression is that it is unlikely to have any measurable impact" on the yields those bids produce at the auctions.
Mr. Fine and others said the Treasury Department's investigation, which forced the resignation of Salomon's three top executives, would almost certainly make the firm much more cautious about taking market risks than it has been in the past.
Depending on what the Government investigation turns up, Salomon could still lose its status as a primary dealer of Treasury securities. But credit market participants said a Salomon departure would not have much impact.
Primary dealers have seen their profit margins shrivel in the last few years, in large part, people in the industry argue, because there are so many primary dealers. Absorbing Salomon's share of the market would not pose much of a challenge, these people said.
"It really doesn't matter much to investors which primary dealer they work with," one trader said. "The idea that the I.B.M. pension fund or a big bank isn't going to own Treasuries because they can't buy them through Salomon Brothers is preposterous."
By contrast, the notion that the Federal Reserve may vote to lower short-term interest rates at tomorrow's meeting of the Open Market Committee is much more likely, according to credit market analysts.
 
Toublesome Signs
 The meeting will take place against a backdrop of weak money growth, an improving inflation outlook and troublesome signs that the economic recovery may be flagging.
The central bank surprised credit market participants earlier this month by lowering the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent. Given its deliberate nature, another Fed move so soon would be unusual, and could stall or reverse the recent sharp improvement in long-term interest rates.
Still, in the judgment of many private economists, another modest easing of monetary policy would not hurt. The only question, these analysts say, is when the Fed might decide to move.
"If I were over there, I would do it right after the meeting, and I think they will," said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed governor who is now chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 
Tranquil Attitude Cited
 "Given the market's fairly tranquil attitude, they can probably get away with lowering the funds rate without much risk," he said. "In my view, the risk of seeing the economy grind to a halt if they don't do anything is a lot more serious than the possibility that the recovery is a lot stronger than they think."
The week's key economic release, a Government report on new orders for durable goods in July, is not expected until Friday. Most analysts are forecasting that this highly volatile number will show that new orders rose by a full percentage point last month.
At this juncture, Mr. Gramley and other analysts said another quarter-point cut in the Federal funds rate would almost certainly be accompanied by a half-point reduction in the Fed's discount rate, currently 5.50 percent. A cut in the discount rate, in turn, would probably force commercial banks to lower their prime lending rate by half a point, to 8 percent.
A cut in the funds rate might well be justified, but other analysts said the Fed was likely to postpone any move until after it had a chance to examine economic data for August, especially the employment report expected on Sept. 6.
"Right now, the Fed has the leeway to lower the funds rate another 25 basis points, but there is every reason to be cautious," said Henry Kaufman, chief executive of Henry Kaufman & Company, a money management firm. "It would not be unusual if they waited to see the August economic numbers."
 
Flirting With 8 Percent
 The Fed almost certainly does not want to discourage the bond market rally. Long-term interest rates have fallen by nearly half a point in the last six weeks, and are again flirting with 8 percent, a floor that has been all but inpenetrable for the last five years.
Given the market's current tone, analysts and traders said bond yields could again go below 8 percent, as they did briefly in February. But there are serious doubts about whether yields can remain under that level.
David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said, "it wouldn't surprise me" if bond yields fell by as much as a full percentage point between now and the end of the year.
"The economic fundamentals justifying that sort of a move are already there," he said. "The question is, how long will it take for people to realize that. A big part of that is that there has to be a realization that the inflation news we are seeing is sustainable, even if the economy is growing."

HEADLINE: The New Pan Am Rumbas Ahead

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
One of the first things Pan Am did after it got court permission last week to sell its trans-Atlantic routes and Northeast shuttle to Delta Air Lines and to reorganize as a Latin American carrier was to slash its prices 25 percent on tickets to many popular destinations.
"I call it our 'staying in business' sale," said Thomas G. Plaskett, chairman of Pan American World Airways. 
 The goal of the sale is to entice people to keep flying Pan Am long enough for the ailing airline to complete its deal with Delta. But Pam Am executives also hope to get fliers and the nation's travel industry acquainted with a Pan Am that is not only smaller but also refocused -- largely on service to Latin America.
Compared with the old Pan Am, a leader in commercial aviation for much of its 64-year history, the portrait that emerges might seem jolting. And it has not dispelled many of the doubts among industry analysts and consultants about how long the airline can survive.
Mr. Plaskett insists the airline will remain a familiar presence on the national scene. Or as he chanted this last week over and over again, almost like a mantra, "It'll still be a major airline."
Certainly, though, not as major as it used to be. The airline that is expected to emerge from bankruptcy by Dec. 1 looks like it will have about $1 billion in revenues, roughly one-quarter of what Pan Am took in last year. That would make it comparable to midsize airlines like America West or Southwest, placing it about 10th or 11th in the domestic rankings this year, down from 8th last year.
Though it will still fly between its main hub in Miami and 10 United States cities, including New York, Boston, Chicago and Washington, the new Pan Am will primarily service South America, Central America and the Caribbean.
Using Miami as its gateway to Latin America, Pan Am will move its Park Avenue headquarters to some vacant office space it owns in Miami. Mr. Plaskett estimated that the move would eliminate about 2,200 more jobs from the New York area, on top of the 2,800 or so that were lost as part of a companywide cutback announced earlier this month.
 
No Public Shareholders
 Another big difference is that the new airline will no longer be publicly traded. Creditors will own 55 percent of the stock in the reorganized company, and the rest will go to Delta, which has promised to feed connecting passengers from all over the country into Miami and to use its marketing muscle to insure the venture's success.
Because Pan Am's Latin American division has historically operated at a profit, both Pan Am and Delta expect the new airline to make money from the start.
The creditors say that Delta's financial advisers, Goldman, Sachs & Company, have told them that the airline's after-tax profit could jump from a projected $18 million in 1992 to $83 million in 1995. Even with the chill the Persian Gulf war gave international traffic last year, Pan Am's Latin American division earned $87 million in operating profits on revenues of $810 million in 1990, versus $102 million on revenues of $724 million the year before.
 
High-Paying Passengers
 Pan Am gives two reasons for that performance, the only bright spot in its 1990 results.
One is the higher-than-usual mix of first-class and business travelers going to Latin America. These high-paying passengers help give Pan Am higher yields, or revenues per passenger-mile, on those routes. For instance, Pan Am's 747 jets on routes from New York to Paris and from New York to Los Angeles have 21 first-class seats out of 412. The 747's flying from New York to Rio de Janeiro have 39 out of 377.
The other reason the Latin American routes have always bobbed atop the company's sea of red ink is the protectionist walls that many Latin American countries have erected around their markets.
Though much of the Caribbean is fair game for United States carriers, many South American countries restrict their entry to protect their local state-owned airlines and they regulate fares to limit price competition.
 
Mainly a Three-Way Competition
 The upshot: while 30 or 40 carriers regularly fly over the Atlantic, only 3 have any meaningful market share in Latin America: Pan Am; Varig, Brazil's national airline, and American Airlines, which took over Eastern Airlines' Latin American routes last summer.
"Relative to Europe, there is less competition and higher yields on those routes," Mr. Plaskett said.
That is changing. "Pan Am can survive in the short run if the South American economies come back," said Daniel M. Kasper, a Boston consultant who used to teach at the Harvard Business School. "But I don't see what's defensible about that niche over the long pull."
He noted that many South American countries were gradually opening up their borders, most recently Colombia, which has agreed to let an additional United States carrier into its market in exchange for having a second Colombian airline authorized to serve the United States.
Mr. Plaskett acknowledged that increased competition could soon start munching on Pan Am's bread and butter. But he is confident that the same pressures that are forcing those governments to open up their airports to new carriers will also help Latin America become "the next major economic boom area in the world."
"What's happening in Mexico is the precursor to what's going to happen in other Latin American countries," he said. "It's booming, and its move to less Government control is opening up enormous business opportunities."
Donald Tatzin, a consultant with Arthur D. Little Inc., is not so sure. He said Pan Am might be too dependent on Delta's assurances of a steady stream of Latin America-bound passengers. "When Pan Am sold its London routes to United, United was going to come in and do all these wonderful things for them, and they didn't," he said.
Delta, of course, has a stronger financial incentive than United did to live up to its promises, since it has put $305 million into the new airline in exchange for some debt and it has its equity stake. But its good intentions could change if Delta gets too many complaints from its customers about the service on the Pan Am leg of their trip. And what if some juicy routes open up in Latin America that Delta covets for its very own?
For instance, Delta, which until now has had no routes to South America, has applied for Government permission to fly from Los Angeles and Atlanta to Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and it plans to pursue the applications despite last week's deal. Those routes would compete indirectly with Pan Am's New York-Brazil and Miami-Brazil routes. "There will be routes where we compete with them," said Neil A. Monroe, a Delta spokesman.
 
'A Marketing Disadvantage'
 Industry consultants also fret that a Delta-Pan Am partnership will be hard pressed to compete with American, which can take passengers from many points in the United States to Latin America without changing airlines.
"It's a marketing disadvantage," Mr. Kasper said of the Pan Am-Delta tandem.
Delta could solve that problem by buying the rest of Pan Am, analysts say, but that is unlikely to happen anytime soon.
The biggest reason why not is that the new Pan Am is expected to have about $600 million in losses that it can use to shelter taxable income for years to come. Those valuable tax breaks would be jeopardized if the creditors' stake dropped below 55 percent in the next three years, since the Internal Revenue Service would probably deem it a change in control.
 
Assurance Enough for Delta
 Delta is also said to be uninterested in tying up its borrowing capacity by adding Pan Am's debt to its own balance sheet.
For all of those reasons, some say Delta has the best of both worlds with a stake that is big enough to give it virtual control but not so big that Pan Am is no longer at least a quasi-independent entity.
"Delta's objective has already been reached," said George W. James, chairman of Airline Economics Inc. in Washington. "By picking up 45 percent of the ownership, they have some assurance it will not be sold to some competitor."

Suddenly, an Outsider Becomes 'Mr. Inside'

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Deryck C. Maughan, the newly appointed chief operating officer of Salomon Brothers, began the job of Mr. Inside yesterday in the effort to rescue the investment bank from the trading scandal that has rocked it in the last week.
As Warren E. Buffett, the interim chairman, deals with the consequences of the scandal, the investigation and the new direction of Salomon, Mr. Maughan will be running the firm's day-to-day business. He will do the hiring and firing.He will see that new rules governing trading, and efforts to steer Salomon's culture into safer waters, are followed. And perhaps most important, he will have to set a tone in the management of the firm that will reassure customers and give many talented employees the will and desire to ride out the storm. 
 "I don't think we want to remove all the elements that led to our success," Mr. Maughan said at the news conference yesterday at Salomon's Manhattan headquarters, where his appointment was announced. This means refining the aggressive, often arrogant style of Salomon Brothers that brought both large profits and, he acknowldged, the scandal that propelled him into his new job.
Then he added: "We need to assure a more open and cooperative sense -- I like the term partnership. And there must be an absolute insistence on the correct moral and legal behavior."
Mr. Maughan, who is 43 years old, is an Englishman and a professional manager, both unlikely attributes for an operating boss at a firm whose heart beats to the rhythm of the trading room. And Mr. Maughan knows it. Asked if he found his appointment surprising, he said: "I am not an American and I am not a trader. I am as astonished as my questioner."
But his immediate background as the chairman of Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., which included operations in Japan, Asia and Australia, gave him, in the words of one Salomon vice chairman, Stanley Shopkorn, the experience of "running a smaller version of the organization in Tokyo."
Samuel L. Hayes 3d, an investment banking professor at the Harvard Business School who has written a book that, in part, focuses on Mr. Maughan's job in Tokyo, said: "While Salomon was making real mistakes in its home market in the United States, its crown jewel was Tokyo. Maughan is someone who has shown how to use to the best advantage the strategic and comparative advantages of Salomon's trading muscle."
But while Mr. Hayes called Mr. Maughan a "white hat," he added that it is a "tossup" whether he could parlay this job into the chairmanship of the firm's parent, Salomon Inc., in the future. And that is because he is not part of the trading culture of the firm. "You cannot graft the head of an investment banker onto the body of a trader and not get tissue rejection," he said.
People who know him say Mr. Maughan is not cut in the Salomon mode. Ego is less central to his style, they say. In Tokyo, where his management skills made him popular, he was able to step back and let his top lieutenants run their own operations without interference.
Mr. Maughan took over his new job yesterday with what appeared to be a sense of quiet confidence, a touch of humor and a little bewilderment.
Mr. Maughan said that when he woke up in his hotel in New York, "I didn't expect this to happen." But hours later he was easing into the routine of the grilling by news organizations. As he left the press conference, he referred to himself as a "captive" as he talked to colleagues.
Before going to Stanford, he worked in the British Treasury from 1969 to 1979 as an adviser on international economic and financial affairs. He joined Salomon Brothers in 1983 and became a managing director in 1986. He was appointed a vice chairman in January 1991, when he was named the co-head of Salomon's investment banking department. He was brought into that job in an effort to revive the department.
In his new job, he has to insure that the firm can demonstrate all of this and that the investment bank can put the scandal behind it and regain the confidence of its customers, competitors and the financial markets in general.
"I think the confidence has bounced with the resignation of senior manangement and the arrival of Mr. Buffett," he said. "We are looking forward to the opening of the markets tomorrow."

HEADLINE: Faltering Mexican Opposition Back on Defensive

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Three years after their stunning gains moved President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to declare an end to the era of one-party control in Mexico, the country's opposition parties went into mid-term elections today with slim hopes.
While the rightist opposition has struggled and that on the left has splintered and lost ground, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has capitalized on the success of Mr. Salinas's market-oriented economic policies to reassert its political dominance. 
 Final election results are not expected for several days, but pre-election polls indicate that the PRI, as the governing party is known, could regain the two-thirds margin in the Chamber of Deputies that would enable it to dictate constitutional changes and a free trade agreement with the United States.
 
How Much Has Changed?
 Even critics say the PRI's campaign has been its most sophisticated ever. But the election has called into question the pace at which Mr. Salinas might usher in real democracy. Though the voting may well emerge as some of the cleanest in a long, soiled history of elections in this country, the campaign has underscored the seeming permanence of the PRI's hold on power, and its failure to convince many Mexicans that times have changed.
"Around here, it's, 'Long live the King!' when they say so, and 'Death to the King!' when they say so," said Rosalinda Perez, a 30-year-old teacher in the old mining city of San Luis Potosi. She said she would vote for the opposition, which is in coalition there.
The campaigning for legislative, state and local offices in Mexico has taken place amid some of the more dramatic changes in its modern history. Yet important issues, from the trade agreement to the possible admittance of foreign oil companies to plans for sweeping changes in agriculture and education, have been largely absent from election debate.
 
'Means as Ends' <HE
Instead, while the Government has trumpeted its new electoral system as proof of an end to traditional fraud, the opposition has pointed to the familiar, unequal nature of the contest. "The struggle is still focused on the means as ends,"said Lorenzo Meyer, a political scientist.
Opposition leaders say they haven't had much choice. To protest the conduct of the campaign, for instance, they have had to turn to an "independent" elections council filled with former Government officials.
Independent election observers, of which the country has only a handful, had expected the growing force of opposition poll-watchers and innovations like clear-plastic ballot boxes to limit blatant fraud. But they have sharply criticized the way in which new registration cards have been handed out to 36.4 million of the 43.5 million Mexicans eligible to vote.
Opposition leaders have said that far fewer cards were delivered in areas that voted strongly against the PRI in the past. Government officials have denied that claim, emphasizing that Mr. Salinas has ordered clean elections.
Contrary to the expectations of a cleaner vote, opposition party officials denounced what they called serious irregularities at polling places around the country, including missing ballots, the failure to open voting booths and the theft of at least one ballot box. They said the problems were concentrated in the hotly contested states of San Luis Potosi and Guanajuato.
The Federal Electoral Institute acknowledged that about 3 percent of the polling places had not opened but suggested that the opposition assertions were exaggerated.
 
Imbalance of Resources
 The disparity of campaign resources is not in dispute. In the only competitive governor's races -- in San Luis Potosi and Guanajuato -- opposition candidates have been especially overwhelmed by the money, manpower and control over the media of the governing party.
Even in Guanajuato, where the conservative National Action Party, or PAN, says it has spent $1 million, the party's propaganda is almost invisible amid that of the omnipresent PRI. Officials would not disclose PRI campaign spending.
As ever, the official machinery has cranked up to the task. For party rallies, Government resources are loaned, peasants who depend on Government credits are bused in by the thousands, and people who work for the Government or the unions it controls applaud and wave flags regardless of their sympathies.
"They give us certain benefits, and we give them this," said Jose Luis Hernandez, a member of the Guanajuato taxi drivers' union who spoke beneath a large PRI banner at a party rally. Mr. Hernandez said he worked for years as a driver for state officials and had been disgusted by their corruption. But that did not keep him away.
"In one way or another," he said, "everyone here depends on them."
 
Low Turnout Expected
 The Government's energy, the opposition's languor and their endless fight over the playing field all appear to have deepened voter apathy and cynicism. A poll taken last month found that more than half of Mexicans of voting age favored no political party. A Government poll predicted that voter turnout today would be about 42 percent.
According to most surveys, anti-Government candidates stand to lose at least five of the six governorships at stake. The PRI will likely fall short of the two-thirds majority in the Chamber of Deputies that would enable it to amend the Constitution at will, but some officials said that a need to negotiate some aspects of future reforms was politically expedient. And after losing its first handful of Senate races ever in 1988, polls show the PRI in position to win a strong majority of the 32 seats at stake today.
Even if the PRI recovery is more modest, it will confound memories like that of the leftist candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, claiming the presidency in 1988 and the announcement of Mr. Salinas's narrow win after a mysterious breakdown in the vote-counting computers.
But Mr. Salinas's policies have steadily gained support here as the effects of restructuring have begun to be felt. An annual inflation rate that was above 150 percent before Mr. Salinas took over is expected to drop to about 16 percent this year. While minimum wages continue to fall in real terms, fewer and fewer workers earn them. Funding for social programs has skyrocketed. And polls show that more than half of Mexicans expect their lot to improve next year.
 
Opposition Group Falters
 As the dire economic straits that pulled many voters to Mr. Cardenas's National Democratic Front in 1988 have abated, polls have shown the coalition's successor, the Democratic Revolutionary Party, falling to between a third to a half of the 31 percent that Mr. Cardenas polled.
Some of the party's problems have been congenital. Even more than the Front, it has had trouble blending its mix of leftists with PRI dissidents like Mr. Cardenas and Porfirio Munoz Ledo, one of the party's four senators and its beleaguered candidate for governor in Guanajuato.
These splits have been abetted by Mr. Salinas. The Government has used social programs to forge near-alliances with local Democratic Revolutionary Party leaders in Michoacan state, trying to lure party leaders of uncertain commitment. Just last week, the party's floor leader in congress, Ignacio Castillo Mena, defected to become Mexico's Ambassador to Ecuador.
 
Rightist Party Divided
 The PAN has had some similar problems. Long divided between old-line conservatives and younger free-market advocates anguished by the economic nationalism of successive PRI governments, the PAN now finds itself additionally split between those members who favor alliances with the PRI and those who do not.
"There are a lot of issues they've taken away from us," said Vicente Fox, the PAN leader running a strong race for governor in Guanajuato. "We've lost a lot of ground to Salinas."
The left and right have forged a coalition in San Luis Potosi, but that kind of cooperation is a singular exception. In Guanajuato, Mr. Munoz Ledo may draw enough votes from Mr. Fox to allow the PRI candidate, Ramon Aguirre, to win.
Mr. Fox, described by Government officials as the opposition candidate most likely to win a governorship, said he had been abandoned by a handful of businessmen who funded his successful run for the Chamber of Deputies in 1988. He concluded that the financiers now needed Mr. Salinas more than they needed him.
A Businessman's Price
"With a sandwich, a soft drink and a truck, you can get a peasant to a political meeting," Mr. Fox said. "With champagne, a little caviar and an airplane, you can get a businessman."
In interviews last week, Government and PRI officials said that Mr. Salinas's 1988 pronouncement notwithstanding, the party's expected return to clear political hegemony was not a matter of one election's recovery.
For instance, a public works program called Solidarity, which critics have derided as an effort at vote-buying, in fact serves a much longer-range political strategy, said the president of the PRI, Luis Donaldo Colosio. By putting poor people in charge of their own development projects, the initiative will develop new grass-roots leaders to whom the PRI would turn as it breaks the hold of old party and union bosses. "That," Mr. Colosio said, "is the new PRI."
Along with other officials, the 43-year-old economics graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School contended that the PRI's candidates today were as a group more attractive, better packaged, and more closely advised about campaign marketing than any of their predecessors.
Where Government officials spoke not long ago of a future in which the PRI would take on other parties in legitimate competition, Government officials spoke again last week of the democracy that would take place within a more inclusive governing party. "We want to legitimize our scheme," one said, "a la Mexicana."

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
Text of Statement by Acting Soviet President

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Monday, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement carried by the English-language service of the official Soviet news agency, Tass, on the replacement of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It was signed by Vice President Gennady I. Yanayev and addressed to heads of state and government and the United Nations Secretary General:
At the instruction of the Soviet leadership I hereby notify that a state of emergency is introduced in individual localities of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for a period of six months from Aug. 19, 1991, in keeping with the Constitution and laws of the U.S.S.R. 
 All power in the country is transferred for this period to the State Committee for the State of Emergency in the U.S.S.R.
The measures that are being adopted are temporary. They in no way mean renunciation of the course toward profound reforms in all spheres of life of the state and society.
These are forced measures, dictated by the vital need to save the economy from ruin and the country from hunger, to prevent the escalation of the threat of a large-scale civil conflict with unpredictable consequences for the peoples of the U.S.S.R. and the entire international community.
The most important objective of the state of emergency is to secure conditions that would guarantee each citizen personal safety and the safety of his or her property.
It is envisaged to liquidate anti-constitutional, ungovernable and essentially criminal military formations spreading moral and physical terror in several regions of the U.S.S.R. and serving as a catalyst for disintegration processes.
The entire range of measures adopted is directed at the earliest stabilization of the situation in the U.S.S.R., the normalization of socio-economic life, the implementation of necessary transformations and the creation of conditions for the country's all-round development.
Any other way would lead to enhanced confrontation and violence, to the innumerable suffering of our peoples and the creation of a dangerous focus of tension from the viewpoint of international security.
The temporary emergency measures in no mean affect international commitments assumed by the Soviet Union under existing treaties and agreements.
The U.S.S.R. is prepared to develop further its relations with all states on the basis of universally recognized principles of good-neighborliness, equality, mutual benefit and non-interference in internal affairs of each other.
We are convinced that our current difficulties are transitory in character and the Soviet Union's contribution to preserving peace and consolidating international security will remain substantial.
The leadership of the U.S.S.R. hopes that the temporary emergency measures will find proper understanding on the part of the peoples and governments, and the United Nations Organization."

HEADLINE: Katherine Dunham's Mission: Giving Children a Gift of Dance

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.

 BODY:
The summer heat bears down on a scrubby lawn in East St. Louis, a small desolated city on the banks of the Mississippi River that has become a national symbol of poverty and despair.
But the air also throbs with excitement and pride as the young dancers of the Katherine Dunham Children's Workshop here expertly move through pieces in a wide variety of styles. Well-schooled, they dance with a rare expansiveness and joy. All are black and what the world calls disadvantaged. But each is a member of an elect group. Each is a dancer, moving across the makeshift stage of the workshop with an easy, gracious consciousness of self. 
 That has been the mission of Miss Dunham, whose vibrantly theatrical productions of traditional Caribbean, African and American choreography for the dance stage, Broadway and films turned her and her company into stars throughout the United States and Europe in the 1940's and 50's. It is a mission that has faltered in recent hard economic times. But now that mission has been embraced by a group of cultural, social and business leaders in bustling St. Louis, just across the river.
 
Of Plans and Money
 Under the leadership of Elizabeth Sayad, a public relations consultant, musician and writer, the group is working as a newly constituted board of directors to raise money to meet Miss Dunham's personal and professional needs and to support and strengthen her training programs. There are also plans to extend the programs to centers to be built in urban areas throughout the country.There are plans to raise money to preserve her influential technique and dances along with her collection of art and artifacts, housed in her handsome little Dynamic Museum, a few blocks from her home in East St. Louis.
"You can stick your head in the sand," said Kenneth H. Bitting Jr., a former Anheuser-Busch executive, who is the vice president of the Dunham board and a self-described cynic, as he spoke of the problems of that city. "And why not? It's a different state. Then you meet someone like Katherine Dunham."
Miss Dunham, who worked her way out of an impoverished, tumultuous childhood in the Midwest to become not only an internationally recognized dancer and choreographer but also an anthropolgist, writer and teacher, settled in East St. Louis in 1967, dividing her time between her small, neat house, school and museum and a home in Haiti. Her mission, urged on her by officials of the University of Illinois, was to imbue the angry, forsaken youngsters of East St. Louis with a sense of a larger, better world to which they could also have access.
 
'Culturally Heroic Society'
 "I was trying to steer them into something more constructive than genocide," the 82-year-old Miss Dunham said in a recent interview in St. Louis. "Everyone needs, if not a culture hero, a culturally heroic society. There is nothing stronger in a man than the need to grow."
She and an international staff taught languages and photography, anatomy and woodcarving, music, many forms of dance and even karate, which troubled some institutional sponsors of the school. "We told them we were only teaching the theory of martial arts," Miss Dunham said with her low, earthy laugh. "A very small lie. The martial arts were it for the young men. They loved that."
Faced with an influx of violent, confused young veterans of the Vietnam War, she took some to New York City to talk about violence with the psychologist Erich Fromm, a friend of hers. She watched as some of the children she worked with grew up to be public figures, including Reginald and Warrington Hudlin, the film makers, and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the Olympic long jumper, and university graduates, doctors, teachers and performers.
But Miss Dunham's financial resources have dwindled drastically over the last decade. Most of the programs, which serve about 40 children, ages 4 to 16, have been cut and it has become hard to properly maintain the museum's holdings, which include artifacts, art and musical instruments of African, Caribbean and North American black traditional and modern society, paintings by Miss Dunham and exquisite costumes designed by John Pratt, her late husband, for the Dunham company.
 
Leading to a Board
 Admirers of Miss Dunham grew concerned. In 1989, after the success of a "Magic of Katherine Dunham" gala that opened the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater's spring season in St. Louis, the dance presenter Adam Pinsker commissioned a study, paid with a Ford Foundation grant, that led to the formation of a board incorporated in St. Louis and East St. Louis in the spring of 1990.
A few friends and colleagues, chief among them Jeanelle Stover, Miss Dunham's longtime personal assistant and now a member of the board's executive committee, had struggled to help Miss Dunham continue her work.
Ms. Sayad, who studied dance with Miss Dunham in the early 1970's, said, "Katherine is beginning to understand that in order to accomplish her mission she has got to have a larger frame of reference." The 18 members of the new board represent "resources she just wouldn't have access to in East St. Louis," Ms. Sayad added.
The eighth annual Dunham Technique Seminar, which ended on Sunday at the Center of Contemporary Arts in University City in St. Louis, was preceded by a gala dinner and performance in early August that raised close to $35,000 to meet a matching grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.
At the gala, in one corner of the poolside party Miss Dunham greeted the guests who came over to her, often a little timidly, to shake her hand. Dark eyes glowing, she was both matter of fact and regal, submitting graciously to the cosseting of early Dunham dancers who had come to St. Louis to teach in the seminar.
There was an extra gentleness in Miss Dunham's voice as she gravely spoke of her conversations with her young goddaughter, Tikati, about the future of the earth. And she watched with affection as Vanoye Aikens, who had partnered her, charmed the crowd with his extravagant repartee as the master of ceremonies. "He lifted me, heavy or light, for about 30 years," she murmured.
The next morning, Mr. Aikens, Talley Beatty, Lucille Ellis and Tommy Gomez were teaching dancers, teachers and agile dance lovers from across the nation and abroad the fine points of the sensuous Dunham technique. In one studio, Mr. Aikens coaxed a jazz step he called the chocolate shake out of his students. In another, Mr. Gomez quietly analyzed the correct body placement of a Dunham dancer and spoke of a head movement associated with Uday Shankar, the Indian dancer.
Mr. Beatty's instructions were interspersed with anecdotes about Miss Madam Dunham, as he called her, delivered with wry detachment. And Miss Ellis drove her students to dance with space-gobbling abandon. Together again, the four spoke of their days with Miss Dunham with laughter and admiration.
"Dancers came into the company like mice and walked out as straight as cornstalks," said Miss Ellis, who teaches at her own studio in Chicago. "Miss D. taught people to be proud of themselves."
The company, which disbanded in 1962 after two decades of performing, wove its way through the United States refusing to perform for segregated audiences.
"We were with her when she broke the nightclub barriers in Chicago," Miss Ellis said. "That's all we did. We broke barriers all along. We didn't know that. We just wanted to work. We loved what we were doing. We survived because of love and pride."
Those days may be long gone, and the notion of a new Dunham company merely a cherished dream, but Miss Dunham is still surrounded by loyal colleagues. At the gala, a son of the Senegalese drummer Mor Thiam performed beside his genial father, whom Miss Dunham described as the Pied Piper who helped to draw children to the school over the years. Three of the four elegant, glowing dancers had been reared in East St. Louis and trained at the Dunham school. Miss Dunham watched them intently, drumming a soft rhythmic counterpoint on the table edge as they danced.
"It can be done," she said. "Don't tell me no."

HEADLINE: At the New York Film Festival, Works on Art

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
"What delighted me and my colleagues is that we found a number of films by directors whose work has previously been seen at the festival but who are now showing a new side, giving a little more of themselves."
Richard Pena, the chairman of the selection committee of the New York Film Festival and the program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which sponsors the festival, was discussing what will be new at festival this year. 
 The 29th annual New York Film Festival will present 30 films from Sept. 20 to Oct. 6. The date of each is to be announced this month.
 
Change in Styles
 "Take the opening and closing selections," Mr. Pena continued. "We open with 'The Double Life of Veronique' by the Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski, who is best known for his gritty, visceral style in films like 'A Short Film About Killing,' which was in the festival in 1989."
"The Double Life of Veronique," he said, shows Mr. Kieslowski's poetic side. It is a tale about a Polish woman and a French woman, played by the same actress, Irene Jacob, whose lives are marked by extraordinary coincidences. The film is said to leave audiences with a mystical sense that life is controlled by forces beyond human comprehension.
The festival closes with David Mamet's "Homicide." "Mamet's work has been compared to that of Fritz Lang because it is always so meticulously plotted and almost mechanical in the way it is structured," Mr. Pena said. " 'Homicide,' however, is his most personal film. It's about a detective who in the course of an investigation must come to terms with his own identity as a Jew."
 
On Creating Art
 Another theme in this year's festival is reflected in films dealing with artists and the process of making art. Jacques Rivette's "Belle Noiseuse" deals with the life of a painter; the main character in a Finnish film called "Zombie and the Ghost Train" is an unemployed musician; a Chinese film directed by Chen Kaige called "Life on a String" concerns a musician; "The Other Eye" is a German documentary about the Viennese film maker G. W. Pabst who died in 1967, and "Prospero's Books" is a version of Shakespeare's "Tempest" with Sir John Gielgud playing Shakespeare and the artist and magician Prospero.
"It wasn't our conscious intent to have such a theme in the festival," Mr. Pena said, "but as I go down the list I see the emphasis is there. After all the revolutions and upheavals in the world, maybe a time for self-reflection is at hand, and movie makers see themselves in league with poets, painters and musicians."
Still another theme, Mr. Pena said, is internationalism. The 30 films to be shown represent 18 different nations, including Eqypt, Austria, the Netherlands and 3 from South or Central America. "World cinema has really become world cinema," he said.
A first for the festival will be the showing of a work in progress. The new Disney animated film "Beauty and the Beast" will be shown in a state described as "60 percent complete."
Reached in a Los Angeles studio, Don Hahn, who has worked for Disney for 15 years and who is the producer of the film, said his company had decided to show "Beauty and the Beast" as a work in progress "because of the resurgence of interest in animation," which he said dated back to "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," another Disney film, in 1988.
"People are beginning to realize," he said, "that animators have to solve all the same problems an actor has to solve. Whether you're Dustin Hoffman or an animator, if you're doing a scene from 'Beauty and the Beast' when two characters fall in love you have to find the exact expressions that convey that feeling. Animators are closet actors. They spend hours in from of the mirror trying to solve these problems."
The finished version of "Beauty and the Beast," Mr. Hahn said, will open commercially on Nov. 22. Most other entries in the festival do not yet have distributors.
The opening and closing showings of the festival will be at Avery Fisher Hall, with the other screenings at Alice Tully Hall.
The festival box office at Alice Tully Hall will open on Sept. 8. Tickets are $7 and $10, except for opening and closing nights, for which tickets cost $10 and $15. Beginning at noon on Sept. 1, tickets can be bought through Centercharge at (212) 721-6500 for an additional charge of $3.50 a ticket.

HEADLINE: PAN AMERICAN GAMES;
For Cubans, 17 Days of Cheering

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Anybody who has visited Cuba for the last 17 days will surely leave humming the "Himno Nacional." It was played 140 times at gold-medal ceremonies for the Pan American Games, giving this proud island bragging rights over the United States, which won 130 gold medals.
While international meets do not emphasize a national total of medals, everybody was aware of the count and could not miss the major accomplishment for an island of 10 million residents over a nation of 250 million. 
 The United States, which has traditionally dominated this event since its inception in 1951, sent secondary teams in several sports, and still won the overall medal count, with a total of 352. Cuba ended up with 265.
The games cost Cuba an estimated $156 million during hard times here, but they gave many of the people the chance to cheer for 17 days.
 
Castro, Castro Everywhere
 The ultimate victory of the games came Saturday night when the Cuban baseball team poleaxed Puerto Rico, 18-3, for the gold medal, and continued into today when 11 Cubans won gold-medal matches in boxing. Steve Johnston of the United States outpointed Edgar Ruiz Burges of Mexico for the only other boxing gold medal.
President Fidel Castro applauded as one Cuban boxer after another caused the national anthem, sometimes known as "El Bayomesa," for the city of Bayamo, to be played. The esteemed President was seen so often at so many medal ceremonies during these games that sometimes, with all due respect, it seemed he was like a department-store Santa, with six or eight of them taking turns handing out the gold.
"For us the Cuban people, Fidel is kind of like a sane drug," said boxer Juan Hernandez Sierra, after he had dispatched Gregory Johnson of Canada.
All of the Cuban medals raised the spirits on an island where people ask strangers for empty plastic bottles of imported Canadian water. Cubans do not have many containers to hold precious local water when it is available.
 
No Way Home
 Another sign of the times is that lovely Latin-American Stadium had only 35,000 spectators using the 60,000 free seats at the baseball slugfest Saturday night.
Some said it was because the United States had not qualified for the final game. Others said it was because there are not enough buses running during the gasoline shortages to take a chance on going to the ball park for a game that would end after midnight.
The gold medal for baseball put Cuba behind in the medal count, 124-123, going into today. The host nation rectified that early and often at boxing, and then announced triumphs in volleyball and rhythmic gymnastics at other sites. Each time the gold-medal count was announced, the crowd roared and a percussion band blared into the microphones.
It was nuts, and it was fun, except for the boxers who lost to the Cubans. Under the Cuban sports system, all athletes are state-supported amateurs, with the same age and experience as professionals in many other countries.
 
Uneven Matchups
 Most United States athletes here were in their late teens or early 20's. The track and field, swimming and boxing federations sent mostly second- and third-string squads because the top athletes were preparing for world championships.
A young United States soccer team won a gold medal, helped when powers like Brazil and Argentina did not send development squads. The United States sent college-age squads in basketball and baseball, which won the bronze medals.
The great majority of Cuban fans did not know or care that the United States has professional leagues in those sports. What mattered was that Cuba won more gold than the nation that has imposed economic sanctions on it since the early 1960's.
In fact, the three questions asked most frequently were these: "What are your impressions of Cuba?" and "What do you think of our sports?" and "Why does the U.S. continue the blockade?"
 
Sent Reeling
 Today the question was, "Did you get the number of that bus?"
The buses, spelled "guagua" and pronounced "wa-wa," do not run very frequently during the gasoline shortage, but a number of boxers were left sprawling and bleeding today as if hit by the proverbial bus.
The most obvious victim was Shannon Briggs, a 19-year-old heavyweight who said he started boxing only two years ago as a way of avoiding gang warfare in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn.
Only one other heavyweight decided to come to Cuba to face Felix Savon, perennially the world's best amateur in the division, so Briggs received a bye straight into the finals. For two weeks, Briggs had no sparring partners, lost 5 pounds due to lack of food and stomach problems and did a lot of talking about the distinctive reddish pile of dreadlocks on top of his head.
Today, it was Felix Savon time. Briggs came out mimicking Savon's calisthenics, which is never a good idea. When the bell rang, Savon cornered him, knocked him down for an 8-count, and then sent him sprawling or running toward the ropes. The United States cornermen stopped the fight at 2:45 of the first round.
"Not taking anything away from Savon, but it was just his day," Briggs said.
Actually, it was Cuba's day. And Cuba's week. And Cuba's Pan American Games.

HEADLINE: Screening for Breast Cancer: Questions of Cost and Quality

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
Sandra Thomas snapped her wallet shut and walked out of the Breast Cancer Detection Center in Charlotte, N.C., recently, $39 poorer but the very model of the modern medical consumer.
In the course of 15 minutes, her breasts had been X-rayed, films had been developed to be sure the pictures were complete and she was on her way back to work six miles away. 
 Ms. Thomas, 43 years old, says her annual mammography routine is just "common sense." But her common sense is uncommon among her peers.
 
Wide Ramifications
 "A lot of women are frightened," said Kathleen Lacombe, 58, a fabric saleswoman in South Portland, Me. "I wanted to have one and I didn't want to have one. I wanted to know if I had a problem and I didn't want to know."
How to get millions of women together with the machines that could help them is a crucial question, with ramifications not just for women's health but also for the business of medicine and the nation's health costs, now more than 12 percent of the gross national product.
About 52 million women fall under the mammographic screening guidelines of the National Cancer Institute, the American College of Radiology and the American Cancer Society. These groups recommend regular mammographic screening for women over 40, either annually or once every two years, depending on a woman's age and medical history.
Some 18 million women like Mrs. Thomas use the procedure regularly. According to the cancer institute's statistics, this is eight million more than four years ago but still barely more than a third of those for whom annual or semiannual screening mammography is recommended.
The rest, about 34 million women, stay away. Some four million of these are expected to contract breast cancer in their lives. According to calculations by Martin Brown, an economist with the National Cancer Institute, regular mammography screening leading to early treatment for breast cancer will add 1 to 10 years to their life expectancy.
The interests, the well-being and the lives of these absent women have become the banners waved by the two newest wings of professionals in the mammography business, who are engaged in a polite but earnest struggle that exemplifies the tensions between cost and care in American medicine.
Some practitioners say the way to get women in for screenings is to lower the costs, which now average $100 and can exceed $300, to $60, $50 or $40. In practice this means promoting a limited number of heavily used clinics where the economies of scale bring down costs. Other practitioners say the answer is to spread mammographic screening devices in doctors' offices around the country, promoting convenience but insuring inefficiency and increased cost.
Andrea Camp, an aide to Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who is active in women's health issues, said: "How do you make the machines good, and how do you get the women to the good machines? How do make them good at a cost that will allow the women to get to the machines? Those are the questions."
The questions of cost and quality are now surfacing, more and more contentiously, in a Congress newly sensitive to women's health issues. Since January, thanks to the efforts of Representative Mary Rose Oakar, Democrat of Ohio, Medicare, the Federal insurance program that covers people over 65, has reimbursed mammography providers.
Now other legislators are showing an interest. Senators Dave Durenburger, Republican of Minnesota, and Brock Adams, Democrat of Washington, and Representative Schroeder have either sponsored legislation or held hearings on mammography's quality and cost.
The current debate over mammography costs shows in microcosm the struggle over the future of mammography, who will do it, how well and for how much.
Ms. Thomas, who works for a marketing company, has been getting regular mammograms for about five years. She came into the Breast Diagnostic Center at midday recently, waited about 10 minutes, had an exam lasting 10 to 15 minutes, paid in cash and left.
At the end of the day, Ms. Thomas's films and those of the 37 other women who had mammograms that day were sent a few miles away to the offices of Richard E. Bird, one of the leading evangelists of high-volume, low-cost screening mammography. There, Dr. Bird or a partner spends a couple of hours reading the films and sorting them into two groups: the vast majority whose pictures appear normal and those whose pictures show danger signs -- abnormal densities, growths and lesions -- that call for further investigation.
The separation of asymptomatic women from those who should be examined more closely is the basic concept behind screening mammography. According to a registry of more than 23,000 Colorado women having regular screenings kept in a program sponsored by the Federal Centers for Disease Control, about 10 percent to 12 percent of women who have screening need to return for a second mammogram or other tests.
This second or "diagnostic" mammogram, taken because the radiologist believes there is something there to look for, is more expensive -- $120 to $300 -- in part because the suspicious area must be carefully examined, and because the radiologist also spends time talking with the patient after the exam, discussing whether there is cause to suspect cancer.
 
Effort to Cut Cost
 In an interview, Dr. Bird said he had been the younger doctor in a joint practice in the early 1980's when he decided that the costs of mammography could be reduced significantly using this technique, first widely used in Sweden by Dr. Lazlo Tabar, whom experts regard as the father of modern mammography screening.
Dr. Bird's partner was not enthusiastic. When the partner retired, Dr. Bird started talking to other colleagues around town. "I didn't get a tremendous response," he said.
But Dr. Bird's plan for screening mammography proved to be a better mousetrap. He has just opened a fourth screening clinic in the Charlotte area. The newer ones average 25 to 30 mammograms per machine per day, the older ones closer to 40.
He and others who advocate this methods, like Dr. Daniel Kopans, who heads the Breast Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, argue that there is an added benefit. The more procedures done, they argue, the better the technologist knows how to do them, and the better the radiologist knows how to read the film.
 
Early Detection
 Dr. Bird proffers his calculations of the health benefits to a visitor almost vehemently. It is the figures that make him messianic on spreading the technology. His study shows that in his centers 70 percent of all breast cancers detected are caught before the disease has spread to the lymph nodes. A National Cancer Institute study of breast cancer patients from 1974 to 1986 showed that less than half of the cases diagnosed were caught before they spread to the lymph nodes.
If all the women for whom mammograms are recommended used such centers, the country's 11,000 mammographic screening devices would be more than enough. But many women find the clinics inconvenient and prefer an exam in their doctor's office or close by. Dr. Buell Miller, a gynecologist in South Portland, Me., and five colleagues used to refer patients to the Maine Medical Center in nearby Portland for mammograms. More often than not, the women never turned up.
"There weren't enough people coming in," said Dr. Miller in a recent telephone interview. "They didn't come in even when the hospital offered a weekend of free mammograms."
So the radiologists at the Maine Medical Center opened Imaging Diagnostics Center, a joint venture with Dr. Miller and his colleagues in a building next to their medical offices. The gynecologists referred their patients there, the radiologists read the film, and together they paid $60,000 to $70,000 for a machine. The center does 14 to 22 studies a day, at $110 apiece.
 
'Don't Have the Volumen'
 "We don't have the volume Dr. Bird does," Dr. Miller said. "We're not going to get it unless a whole bunch of other mammographic facilities shut up shop. There are seven or eight in the area."
Are that many needed? "It depends on what you mean by 'need,' " Dr. Miller said. "For high-volume studies, no. For patient convenience for different enclaves of populations, yeah, it makes sense. If a patient has to drive 15 miles to get a low-cost screening mammogram, I doubt they'd do it if they have the money to get one conveniently next door."
His words are echoed by other doctors, including Bruce H. Drukker, chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at Michigan State University in East Lansing, and Richard F. Jones 3d, a Hartford gynecologist and president-elect of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
"At the present time I'd give a guesstimate that less than 10 percent of gynecologists, perhaps one or two percent, have mammographic equipment in their offices," Dr. Drukker said.
Dr. Jones has leased from a company in Windsor, Conn., Spectrascan Imaging Services, which has placed machines in "hundreds," of doctors' offices in 35 states, says its president, Alan Ware.
In its advertising, the company includes a chart that shows at a charge of $100 per mammogram, the annual profits to a practice using the Spectra scan system run from $30,000 (at a rate of 6 mammograms per day) to $60,000 (for 12 mammograms per day).
On average, Mr. Ware said, Spectrascan machines are used 6 to 8 times a day. But he and Dr. Jones said that convenient machines increase women's willingness to get mammograms.
"I say, 'You need a mammogram. Would you like to have it here today?' " Dr. Jones said. "Compliance has gone to 80 percent. " The films taken in his office are read by a local radiologist. The total charge is $125.
Dr. Jones's office-based service is accredited by the American College of Radiology, which runs a voluntary program. But only about 25 percent of the offices or clinics where mammograms are given are accredited.
 
Some Failures
 Helene Toiv, an auditor with the General Accounting Office, argues against blind faith in the technology, which can sometimes fail or be used by people who can make mistakes. "A bad mammogram," she said, "is worse than no mammogram at all."
One woman in York, Pa., had two successive annual mammograms that, according to the initial radiologist, showed no abnormality. Concerned about a lump she could feel, she sought an opinion from another doctor who identified suspicious lesions clearly visible in both the 1989 and 1990 films.
Aside from errors, some radiologists estimate that as many as 1 in 10 "negative" mammogram results mask an unseen malignancy. Such "false negatives" and the "false positive" tests which mean unnecessary, expensive costly and unnerving follow-up tests, have made quality a paramount concern.
R. Edward Hendrick, an associate professor of radiological sciences at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Boulder who helped develop the accrediting standards, said about 30 percent of first-time applicants fail to meet them. But more than 87 percent of those centers that fail to win accreditation the first time win it on the second try. He said he suspected that those percentages would be less likely to hold true for the centers that have not volunteered.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Democrat's Invisible Man Specializes In Making Inequity to Poor Easy to See

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Few things give Wendell Primus as much pleasure as a bar chart that looks like this:
Few things in recent years have given the Republican Party more grief. 
 Mr. Primus, a little-known but influential aide on the House Ways and Means Committee, is the architect of the latest version of the "fairness debate" -- the Democrats' quadrennial charge that a decade of Republican rule has helped the rich but hurt the poor.
His bar charts measure how rich and poor, and those in between, fare when Congress changes spending and taxes. When the bars on the left rise, as they did after last year's watershed budget negotiations, poor people gain. This makes Mr. Primus happy.
 
Resounding Whispers
 If it is true, as President Bush hyperbolically contends, that the Democrats seek class warfare, Mr. Primus might be considered their chief of intelligence, with his bar charts providing a kind of aerial surveillance of the landscape of financial inequality.
Mr. Primus (pronounced PRY-mus) is an unlikely dragon slayer: a quiet, devoutly religious economist who grew up in poverty on an Iowa farm and thought his only view of Congress might come from the window of a tour bus. But his mastery of social policy esoterica has offered proof that on Capitol Hill, knowledge is power, when whispered into the right ears.
"I was the prime teacher here -- the one, if you will, who had to educate the chairman," said Mr. Primus, referring to his role last year in persuading his boss, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Ways and Means chairman, that the Republican plan for cutting the deficit could be portrayed as unfair.
At last year's drawn-out budget conference, Mr. Primus's bar charts seemed to be everywhere -- on the negotiating table at Andrews Air Force Base, in the newspapers, and in the craw of top Bush Administration officials, like the chief of staff, John H. Sununu, who favored deficit reduction proposals that hit more heavily on low-income groups.
Stirred by Mr. Primus's analyses, Congress spurned the summit plan and passed one that took much more of its bite from the wealthy.
"The thing that drove me up the wall is that the Republicans never put a plan on the table that called for the richest 1 percent to sacrifice," Mr. Primus said. "I thought to myself, 'If the American people ever knew.' Over time, that dribbled out, and it was not one of Mr. Sununu's better days."
Having left his fingerprints on $500 billion of deficit reduction, Mr. Primus this spring accepted a new job on a Ways and Means subcommittee that promises to put him in the middle of another national debate, the one on child poverty. The Subcommittee on Human Resources, led by Representative Thomas J. Downey, oversees the nation's welfare, child support and foster care program.
"I don't think there's any question that this man has made a pivotal difference in the way that Congress encounters tax and budget issues," said Mr. Downey, a Suffolk Democrat.
 
The Woodwork Type
 Stung by Mr. Primus's analyses, some Congressional Republicans have begun a counterattack. Several have asserted that Mr. Primus doctors the data to lay a case for bigger government and higher taxes. Others have cited different statistics to argue that Republican rule has helped rich and poor alike.
Among Mr. Primus's talents is a flair for invisibility, a useful quality in a world where aides are expected to remain colorless servants of their elected bosses. He works reporters but is never quoted.
Even his build is indistinct, round but not plump, with hair somewhere along a journey from brown to gray. A taciturn man of 44 years, Mr. Primus operates in English with none of the precision that he brings to his economic analysis, fuzzing out the ends of his sentences with the favorite phrase, "et cetera, et cetera."
For a man who seems at home in a pew, the partnership with Mr. Rostenkowski, a backroom politician of the old school, appears a puzzle. It points to another side of Mr. Primus: his desire to get things done.
 
Guiding the Leaders
 When he speaks of Mr. Rostenkowski, he can barely keep awe from his voice. "He's a leader in a way that I could never be," he said, referring to his boss's "body language" but growing flustered at the reference. "This is sensitive -- I mean, if anything could get me in trouble," he said.
At times like these, Mr. Primus sounds like the precocious teen-ager who tutored the high school football stars. Laughing at the analogy, he said, "I guess I'd like to be known as an educator on how to think about the issues."
The origins of Mr. Primus's views can be found in Eldora, Iowa, population 3,000, where as a child Mr. Primus watched his father work long hours for scant rewards.
"I grew up in a poor, working dairy farm environment," said Mr. Primus, putting equal emphasis on working and poor. "My Dad had to milk cows twice a day, for seven days a week."
Is his career, in part, an attempt to better reward laborers like his father? "That is a fair statement, yes," he said.
Among the chief influences on Mr. Primus's thinking has been the Christian Reformed Church, of which he has been a lifelong member. While emphasizing conservative social mores, Mr. Primus said, the church also stresses "that Jesus was very concerned about justice."
Though devoted to progressive taxes, Mr. Primus said he is not "a flaming liberal." He stresses the need for the poor to help themselves by working and taking care of their children. Divorced and remarried, he pays child support and bristles when other fathers do not. "I'm concerned about behavior," he said.
Mr. Primus grew up planning to follow in his father's farming footsteps. But he won a scholarship to Iowa State University, where he wound up with a doctorate in economics.
He earned a reputation as a data whiz in the mid-1970's while working as a consultant to the House Agriculture Committee during a fierce debate over food stamps. The success of his analyses earned him a permanent job on the Ways and Means Committee, where he rose to chief economist.
 
Fixation on Fairness
 Fairness had long been a concern -- some might say fixation. A 1984 hearing he organized on the tax burdens of the poor helped shape the landmark 1986 legislation that removed from the tax rolls more than four million low-income Americans. For the past several years, Mr. Primus has included data on income inequality in the Green Book, the influential compilation of social welfare statistics put out yearly by the Ways and Means panel, which he edits.
Predicting several years ago that Congress would make major changes to cut the deficit, he began to lay the groundwork to protect the poor when it happened. Working with Rick Kasten, an economist with the Congressional Budget Office, Mr. Primus helped devise a computer model that showed how any package of tax increases or spending cuts would affect rich and poor.
As each new proposal hit the table during negotiations last year at Andrews, Mr. Primus would phone in the data to Mr. Kasten. An hour later, the Andrews fax machine would start spewing charts and graphs showing the impact on rich and poor. Pointing to the figures, Democratic negotiators would rail at the Republicans.
Indeed, the fairness argument became so persuasive that junior House Democrats eventually voted down the agreement endorsed by their own leaders, largely because it did not go far enough to help the poor.
 
Noticeable Difference
 The behind-the-scenes influence of the Primus-Kasten team can be summarized with these numbers from the budget office:
The Administration's first proposal would have reduced the after-tax income of the poorest fifth of Americans by 1.4 percent; the one that passed gave them a 1.4 percent increase.
The first Administration plan would have given the richest 1 percent an increase in income of 1.4 percent; the one that passed took a 2.2 percent bite.
Despite Republican attacks, most academic experts have defended Mr. Primus's statistical methods.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, interprets the numbers differently. In an article in the summer issue of Policy Review, he argues that the incomes of the poor started to sag under President Jimmy Carter. Republican influence, he writes, can best be seen in post-1983 figures that show rising incomes for both rich and poor.
This spring, when Mr. Primus accepted his new job, the Congressional rumor mill buzzed with speculation that he was pushed from the full committee by colleagues jealous of his influence with Mr. Rostenkowski.
Mr. Primus downplays the tension with colleagues and says he wanted the new job, which gives him a staff and plunges him into a new debate. The subcommittee he joined is pushing a plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans in order to give tax breaks to families with children.
Asked whether his new perch will give him unusual influence on child poverty issues, Mr. Primus, the formerly impoverished child, couldn't suppress a grin. "I'd like the world to think that, yeah," he said.

HEADLINE: A Smart Start in Haiti

 BODY:
The impossible keeps happening in Haiti. The long dictatorship, too entrenched to be ousted, is gone. The people too poor to care about a democracy have created one. And now the President too radical to avoid destructive confrontations has completed six solid months in office.
The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide once electrified audiences with his blasts at American neocolonialism and angry attacks on the lending policies of the International Monetary Fund. He excoriated military leaders for their complicity with the old regime. And he promised that if he were elected, he would propel a popular tidal wave of revolutionary change. 
 But since coming to office in February, President Aristide has modulated his style. He has developed a particularly warm relationship with U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams. His Government has negotiated seriously with the I.M.F. for assistance. He has received crucial support from the armed forces. Most impressive of all, he has proved more willing than most of his predecessors to respect constitutional norms.
This moderation has provoked predictable grumbling from impatient voices on the left. As predictably, it hasn't dented the distrust of the right. Conservatives are probably correct in assuming that Father Aristide remains faithful to his revolutionary beliefs. For all his moderation, he has already brought substantial change.
He has started replacing corrupt and authoritarian officials with reformers and democrats, in the armed forces as well as in civilian administration. He has shifted rural police powers from military to civilian hands. And he has begun bringing to justice the thuggish leaders of the Tontons Macoute, the Duvalier family's private army.
President Aristide has made no visible progress in stimulating Haiti's long-depressed economy. In fact, some of his reforms, like trimming 5,000 unaffordable jobs from the public sector and demanding better treatment for Haitian migrant workers in the Dominican Republic, have increased unemployment, at least temporarily.
But the new President is betting that renewed flows of foreign aid and investment will bring revival over the longer term. That probably explains his willingness to consider policy compromises in exchange for an I.M.F. seal of approval. Realistically, he has no alternative. After years of looting by its elites, Haiti is today too poor to finance its own development.
Six months into his five-year term, only interim judgments are possible. But President Aristide is clearly off to a smart start.

HEADLINE: Katherine Dunham's Mission: Giving Children a Gift of Dance

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.

 BODY:
The summer heat bears down on a scrubby lawn in East St. Louis, a small desolated city on the banks of the Mississippi River that has become a national symbol of poverty and despair.
But the air also throbs with excitement and pride as the young dancers of the Katherine Dunham Children's Workshop here expertly move through pieces in a wide variety of styles. Well-schooled, they dance with a rare expansiveness and joy. All are black and what the world calls disadvantaged. But each is a member of an elect group. Each is a dancer, moving across the makeshift stage of the workshop with an easy, gracious consciousness of self. 
 That has been the mission of Miss Dunham, whose vibrantly theatrical productions of traditional Caribbean, African and American choreography for the dance stage, Broadway and films turned her and her company into stars throughout the United States and Europe in the 1940's and 50's. It is a mission that has faltered in recent hard economic times. But now that mission has been embraced by a group of cultural, social and business leaders in bustling St. Louis, just across the river.
 
Of Plans and Money
 Under the leadership of Elizabeth Sayad, a public relations consultant, musician and writer, the group is working as a newly constituted board of directors to raise money to meet Miss Dunham's personal and professional needs and to support and strengthen her training programs. There are also plans to extend the programs to centers to be built in urban areas throughout the country.There are plans to raise money to preserve her influential technique and dances along with her collection of art and artifacts, housed in her handsome little Dynamic Museum, a few blocks from her home in East St. Louis.
"You can stick your head in the sand," said Kenneth H. Bitting Jr., a former Anheuser-Busch executive, who is the vice president of the Dunham board and a self-described cynic, as he spoke of the problems of that city. "And why not? It's a different state. Then you meet someone like Katherine Dunham."
Miss Dunham, who worked her way out of an impoverished, tumultuous childhood in the Midwest to become not only an internationally recognized dancer and choreographer but also an anthropolgist, writer and teacher, settled in East St. Louis in 1967, dividing her time between her small, neat house, school and museum and a home in Haiti. Her mission, urged on her by officials of the University of Illinois, was to imbue the angry, forsaken youngsters of East St. Louis with a sense of a larger, better world to which they could also have access.
 
'Culturally Heroic Society'
 "I was trying to steer them into something more constructive than genocide," the 82-year-old Miss Dunham said in a recent interview in St. Louis. "Everyone needs, if not a culture hero, a culturally heroic society. There is nothing stronger in a man than the need to grow."
She and an international staff taught languages and photography, anatomy and woodcarving, music, many forms of dance and even karate, which troubled some institutional sponsors of the school. "We told them we were only teaching the theory of martial arts," Miss Dunham said with her low, earthy laugh. "A very small lie. The martial arts were it for the young men. They loved that."
Faced with an influx of violent, confused young veterans of the Vietnam War, she took some to New York City to talk about violence with the psychologist Erich Fromm, a friend of hers. She watched as some of the children she worked with grew up to be public figures, including Reginald and Warrington Hudlin, the film makers, and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the Olympic long jumper, and university graduates, doctors, teachers and performers.
But Miss Dunham's financial resources have dwindled drastically over the last decade. Most of the programs, which serve about 40 children, ages 4 to 16, have been cut and it has become hard to properly maintain the museum's holdings, which include artifacts, art and musical instruments of African, Caribbean and North American black traditional and modern society, paintings by Miss Dunham and exquisite costumes designed by John Pratt, her late husband, for the Dunham company.
 
Leading to a Board
 Admirers of Miss Dunham grew concerned. In 1989, after the success of a "Magic of Katherine Dunham" gala that opened the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater's spring season in St. Louis, the dance presenter Adam Pinsker commissioned a study, paid with a Ford Foundation grant, that led to the formation of a board incorporated in St. Louis and East St. Louis in the spring of 1990.
A few friends and colleagues, chief among them Jeanelle Stover, Miss Dunham's longtime personal assistant and now a member of the board's executive committee, had struggled to help Miss Dunham continue her work.
Ms. Sayad, who studied dance with Miss Dunham in the early 1970's, said, "Katherine is beginning to understand that in order to accomplish her mission she has got to have a larger frame of reference." The 18 members of the new board represent "resources she just wouldn't have access to in East St. Louis," Ms. Sayad added.
The eighth annual Dunham Technique Seminar, which ended on Sunday at the Center of Contemporary Arts in University City in St. Louis, was preceded by a gala dinner and performance in early August that raised close to $35,000 to meet a matching grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.
At the gala, in one corner of the poolside party Miss Dunham greeted the guests who came over to her, often a little timidly, to shake her hand. Dark eyes glowing, she was both matter of fact and regal, submitting graciously to the cosseting of early Dunham dancers who had come to St. Louis to teach in the seminar.
There was an extra gentleness in Miss Dunham's voice as she gravely spoke of her conversations with her young goddaughter, Tikati, about the future of the earth. And she watched with affection as Vanoye Aikens, who had partnered her, charmed the crowd with his extravagant repartee as the master of ceremonies. "He lifted me, heavy or light, for about 30 years," she murmured.
The next morning, Mr. Aikens, Talley Beatty, Lucille Ellis and Tommy Gomez were teaching dancers, teachers and agile dance lovers from across the nation and abroad the fine points of the sensuous Dunham technique. In one studio, Mr. Aikens coaxed a jazz step he called the chocolate shake out of his students. In another, Mr. Gomez quietly analyzed the correct body placement of a Dunham dancer and spoke of a head movement associated with Uday Shankar, the Indian dancer.
Mr. Beatty's instructions were interspersed with anecdotes about Miss Madam Dunham, as he called her, delivered with wry detachment. And Miss Ellis drove her students to dance with space-gobbling abandon. Together again, the four spoke of their days with Miss Dunham with laughter and admiration.
"Dancers came into the company like mice and walked out as straight as cornstalks," said Miss Ellis, who teaches at her own studio in Chicago. "Miss D. taught people to be proud of themselves."
The company, which disbanded in 1962 after two decades of performing, wove its way through the United States refusing to perform for segregated audiences.
"We were with her when she broke the nightclub barriers in Chicago," Miss Ellis said. "That's all we did. We broke barriers all along. We didn't know that. We just wanted to work. We loved what we were doing. We survived because of love and pride."
Those days may be long gone, and the notion of a new Dunham company merely a cherished dream, but Miss Dunham is still surrounded by loyal colleagues. At the gala, a son of the Senegalese drummer Mor Thiam performed beside his genial father, whom Miss Dunham described as the Pied Piper who helped to draw children to the school over the years. Three of the four elegant, glowing dancers had been reared in East St. Louis and trained at the Dunham school. Miss Dunham watched them intently, drumming a soft rhythmic counterpoint on the table edge as they danced.
"It can be done," she said. "Don't tell me no."

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
Bush Monitors 'Serious Situation' As U.S. Scrambles for Information

BYLINE: By Reuters

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Monday, Aug. 19

 BODY:
President Bush was caught by surprise today by reports of the ouster of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and was closely monitoring the "serious situation," a White House official said.
Mr. Bush was informed of the dramatic change by Brent Scowcroft, the White House national security adviser, who learned of the announcement through news reports. 
 "We are aware of the press reports concerning President Gorbachev," said Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman. "We have no details at this time."
"We are continuing to seek details," he said.
 
No Advance Notice
 Mr. Bush was given no advance notice that Gorbachev would be replaced, said several officials who themselves voiced shock at the development.
Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush met in Moscow two weeks ago for a summit meeting that saw the two superpowers agree to slash their long-range nuclear missile arsenals and endorse a new drive for a Middle East peace conference in October.
The signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty had been opposed by conservatives in the Soviet Union, but Administration officials were reluctant to interpret the abrupt change of power at the Kremlin.
"We really aren't sure what's happening at this point," said one official who acknowledged being stunned by the announcement carried by the official Tass news agency.
Another official said "we have no independent knowledge of what's going on" in Moscow.
The United States Embassy in Moscow was immediately directed to make urgent checks to clarify the situation, said one official, who added that it was not known how quickly a clear picture would emerge.
Mr. Bush has helped Mr. Gorbachev to move his country toward a market economy, using his trip to Moscow to announce that he would seek most-favored-nation trade status for the Soviet Union.
Under that trade status Moscow would be given the most beneficial tariff rates available for its goods sold in the United States.

Graduated from the Gorky Agricultual Institute and the All-Union Law Institute. . . . Holds an advanced degree in history. . . . Rose through Soviet youth groups locally and nationally until he earned a place on the Politboro in 1990. . . . His rise to vice president disappointed reformers who had hoped for a more aggressive supporter. . . . Many saw him and Mr. Gorbachev as kindred spirits. . . . Initially an active proponent of perestroika, which caused some to say Mr. Gorbachev had found a yes man. . . . But he told the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, "I'm a normal guy, I assure you," and Mr. Gorbachev pleaded, "I want someone alongside me I can trust."
 
Vladimir A. Kryuchkov
Chairman, K.G.B.
 Accompanied Mikhail S. Gorbachev to Washington in December 1988 for a summit meeting with President Reagan, and thus startled both American experts and some in the Communist Party itself since it was one of the few times that a senior Soviet intelligence officer had accompanied a Soviet leader to the United States, and Mr. Kryuchkov leaped over several others in the party to achieve such a prominent and visible role. . . .Worried the Bush Administration last year by assailing Mr. Gorbachev's reforms as "blind radicalism," giving a firm indication that Mr. Gorbachev's position in power was anything but secure. . . .A hardliner, Mr. Kryuchkov joined the party in 1944. . . .As a young diplomat, was chosen as an assistant to Ambassador Yuri V. Andropov, who played an important role in the invasion of Hungary in 1956. When Mr. Andropov became director of the K.G.B. in 1967, Mr. Kryuchkov moved with him as a senior aide. . . .According to many American officials, he next served at the United Nations as the Soviet Union's senior spy, or "rezidant."
 
Valentin S. Pavlov
Prime Minister

At 67, Mr. Yazov has already headed two of the Soviet Union's 16 military districts -- the Far East and Central Asia -- and has commanded Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia. . . . Mr. Gorbachev seemed to rely on his breadth of experience. . . . Most important, he had spent the years from 1977 to 1987 out of the country, which many analyists believed made him free of political entanglements at home.
 
Boris Karlovich Pugo
Minister of Internal Affairs
 Among the recent movers in the Soviet Politboro. . . . Born in Kalinin, Latvia, 55 years ago. . . . Graudated in 1960 from Riga Polytechnical Institute. . . .

HEADLINE: Hard Times at Auction Houses: Has the Art Market Hit Bottom?

 BODY:
In one week in May 1990, the Japanese industrialist Ryoel Saito paid $160 million for two paintings bought in New York: $82.5 million for van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" (1890) at Christie's and $78.1 million for Renoir's "At the Moulin de la Galette" (1876) at Sotheby's. This year, by comparison, the most expensive work auctioned was Degas's "Racehorses" (1870's), which was sold for $9.7 million in June to an unidentified buyer at Christie's in London.
 After five years of rapidly rising prices, the frenzied buying of art at auction is over. Sotheby's and Christie's have gone into reverse: the two aucton houses, the world's largest, announced record declines in total sales for the season, which ends on Aug. 31. Sotheby's is projecting a 59 percent decline in international sales, to $1.3 billion from a record $3.2 billion in 1990. Christie's worldwide sales are expected to fall 50 percent, to $1.2 billion from $2.4 billion. 
At both houses the sagging sales figures are attributed to the worldwide economic recession and the Persian Gulf war.
 
Contrasting Assessments
 Additional reasons are cited by knowledgeable auctiongoers, especially in the categories of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, where the greatest declines occurred. At the top of the list is the retreat of the Japanese, who regularly toppled auction records for five years. This season, though, they stayed away as economic problems and financial scandals - some relating to art buying - spread to Tokyo. Throughout the year, Japanese dealers and collectors bid and bought infrequently.
 "The Japanese stockmarket peaked early last year and then came skating down," said Robert S. Salomon Jr., the chief investment officer of the asset management subsidiary of Salomon Brothers. "They certainly have money but they are feeling a lot poorer."
 The absence of Japanese buyers contributed to a decline in sales of artworks produced over the last century to one quarter of last season's volume. At Sotheby's, sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary works slid to $406 million from a record $1.6 billion, and at Christie's they declied to $325 million from $1.25 billion. Significantly, the figures at both houses dropped to levels last seen in the 1986-87 season, just before art prices took off.
 Despite the figures, Michael L. Ainslie, the president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings, the parent company of the auction house, expressed optimism. "I think we have seen the bottom of the market," he said. "I think we are going to see a gradual recovery. I don't think there will be a dramatic recovery until the leading economies of the world begin to show much more strength."
 Christopher Burge, the president of the downturn was no surprise. "We said right along it was going back to where it was in 1987," he said. 'My next prediction is you will see the present pattern holding for the next three or four years."
 Others, however, are not so sanguine.
 Allan Stone, a New York contemporary-art dealer, said: "We are in a market which is searching for its bottom. We're in tough times and we're going to be in tough times for four or five years."
 Thomas W. Weisel, the chairman of Montgomery Securities of San Francisco, and a contemporary-art collector, said buyers were having a variety of business problems. "It's going to be a long time before this area bottoms out,"he said. "Anytime you have a pendulum that has swung so far one way it takes time for it to swing back."
 Richard Gray, a Chicago art dealer, said: "The market is very, very soft. I went to London in June with the hope and expectation that we had bottomed out and might see an upturn. It did not happen. We've had some very good business, but it's been very, very slow.
 "I don't even think it's the fact that money is tight. People are not optimistic. By and large this market has always been supported by people who have money. I don't think that money has gone away. Most people are just scared."
 Donald B. Marron, the chairman of the Paine Webber Group and vice chairman of the Museum of Modern Art, attributed part of the decline in sales to the quality of artworks available. "We all know about the run-up in the art market and that certain marvelous pictures only came for sale because the market moved up so much," he said. "Right now there is a real dearth of absolutely first-class pictures."
 Meanwhile, the number of unsold artworks has increased drastically. In sales if Impressionist, modern and contemporary art this season as many as 40 to 50 percent of the artworks offerd did not sell compared with as few as 10 percent a year ago.
 There were however, some minor improvements in the sales of contemporary art in May in New York and in June in London.
 "In both sets of sales there was considerably more enthusiasm, more bidding and collecting activity in contemporary art," said David Nash, who heads Sotheby's fine art sales internationally. "This compres with the almost sluggish bidding for Impressionist paintings."
 Auction-house officials say that regardless of the period of the works, prices of important paintings from prominent collections that have not been for sale for many years will hold firm. The most important test of this will be at Christie's in New York on Nov. 5 and 12, when 50 artworks from the 20th-century collection of Burton G. and Emily Hall Tremaine, holdings that include paintings by Leger, Mondrian, Miro, Juan Gris, Georges Braque and Jasper Johns, are estimated by the house to bring $35 million.
 In collectibles, Christie's will offer two examples of one of the rarest United States postage stamps on Sept. 25: the 24 cent Jenny air mail stamps from 1918 with an upside-down airplane. Both are to be sold inblocks of four stamps and are from the same seller, Arthur J. Kobacker, a sho manufacturer of Columbus, Ohio. The presale estimates are at most $700,000 and $800,000 each.
 Sotheby's plans a number of smaller sales of property from prominent collections for October. On Oct. 13 Karl Lagerfeld is selling his 1980's made-in-Italy Memphis designs from his Riviera apartment at a sale in Monte Carlo, estimated to bring $255,000. And Oct. 4 the contents of William S. Paley's Fifth Avenue apartment - $2 million worth of 18th-century French furniture, tribal art, Oriental art and precious objects - are to be auctioned.
 Sotheby's is also auctioning property collected by major figures in the ballet world. The $2 million collection of Ruth Page, the doyenne of ballet in Chicago, is to be sold on Nov. 7 inNew York, and the paintings, letters, books, manuscripts and photographs of Diaghilev's personal secretary and friend, Boris Kochno, are to be auctioned in Monte Carlo on Oct. 11 and 12 in a sale that is estimated to total $2.5 million.
 Such auctions of decorative arts, jewelry, books and colelctibles are expected to fare well next season, as they have for the last year. Both Sotheby's and Christie's chalked up some impressive totals in auctions of everything other than fine arts - furniture, jewelry, books, collectibles and automobiles - although the totals were lower than the year before. At Sotheby's, theybrought $532 million compared with $827 million a year ago. At Christie's the total was $607 million, down from $714 million.
 
The Outlook
 Many questions remain. "We don't know yet to what level Impressionist, modern and contemporary paintings have come down," Mr. Burge said. "The market in its cyclical fashion has a steady run of years that show healthy normal increases. Then it begins an acceleration up to a peak. The sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art sales are around 20 percent of the market in the steady times and then accelerate up to 45 or 50 percent. We are now back to about 20 percent."
 Will the Americans and Europeans who collect for investment, who bought heavily at auction in the last five years and stopped this year, return to buying art?
 "I don't think so," Mr. Nash said. "They have to sell the things they paid too much for. Many of the changes seen over the last year are probably permanent.
 "The Japanese bubble money is gone from the market and I don't expect it to come back. There are however, many serious Japanese collectors, museums and Corporate buyers that werenot part of this phenomenon. They are keeping a low profile at this moment. Inevitably they will return."
 James Roundell, who heads Impressionist and modern art sales at Christie's in London, said: "I think it is a pretty uneven picture. Some high prices have been achieved, including the $9.7 million 'Racehorses.' But the peaks are fewer and farther between. Overall, we are still in a market that has a lot of problems. We are still trying to find a level for certain pictures where instead of bidders going to a certain level, we have no bidding at all."
 Mr. Salomon's view is less bleak. "People have always wanted to be able to demonstrate their success or their presumed successes in business by buying art," he said. "The stock market is close to the record highest level. Presumably there are people who have made enormous sums who may become the next group of art buyers."
 But before that happens, Allan Stone said, "I think the art market is going to be left for the people who really like art again. All the speculators have gone home."
 "Unfortunately," he added, "you hope the cure isn't going to kill the patient."

When You Can't Get In Front Door

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
WITH graduating seniors still having a tough time searching for jobs, their job-seeking techniques are changing.
It is back to the old days of using contacts for all they are worth, said Lee J. Svete, college placement director of St. Lawrence University, in Canton, N.Y. "About 66 to 70 percent of those who do find jobs have been finding employment this year through contacts with alumni, parents, friends and others, compared to only half the class relying on contacts a year ago," he said. "If you cannot go in the front door you go through a side door." 
 He estimates that about half the class at St. Lawrence have found jobs, in many cases perhaps not what they want, and thinks 30 percent will go to graduate school within a year, based on last year's statistics.
Internships have given a haven to about 15 percent of the 500 seniors, which he calls a "unique statistic" because in previous years only about 2 percent of the graduating class took internships. The theory is that internships sometimes result in permanent jobs and that in any case they offer experience and look good on a resume.
Mr. Svete said the average job search for a graduate was taking much longer, perhaps six months now, compared with three months or so last year.
Another placement director, Vicki B. Lynn of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., reports that in past years she has had good luck in helping graduating seniors find good jobs with good companies. Most are engineers or computer science majors, who are usually in demand. But she has not been as lucky in 1991.
"This has been the worst year in the last 20," she said last week. "I went through the recession of 1982-83 and that was not as bad as this year."
Of R.P.I.'s senior class of 700, she said, 35 percent have jobs, compared with 46 percent a year ago. About 30 percent are still looking, compared with 25 percent last year, she added.
Graduate school is a handy alternative for those who can afford it. About 25 percent are headed there, compared with 14 percent last year, she said.
Of the remaining graduates, 10 percent are taking another semester of courses, hoping the job market will improve in the meantime.
With many companies shrinking, Mrs. Lynn wonders why they do not take in more interns. "You would think companies would be recruiting for interns," she said. "It gives them a short look at an individual at low cost."
She recently asked several companies about this, and the replies basically were, "Our managers are too stressed to hire interns, who need a lot of supervision."
Job cuts have reduced staffs sharply, increasing the responsibilities of managers. And in many cases they must worry about the loss of their own jobs.
Mrs. Lynn has noticed a new corporate approach to the job market -- contract hiring. "A company asked me for resumes of six students who were computer science majors willing to work for six months on a project for a major electronics firm," Mrs. Lynn said. The students are being paid at the rate of $30,000 a year, she added.
She is encouraging students to take such contract jobs because they offer experience. "Students can say, 'Hey, I got a shot at a major electronics firm even though times are tough,' " she said. "It certainly is better than slinging hamburgers while waiting for the job market to improve."
Mrs. Lynn calls contracting a trend because she expects such jobs to be offered more and more by companies that want to save on pensions and other benefits.
Another answer to the insecurity of the current job market, she said, is an approach now used by Northern Telecom, a major Canadian company: It offers three-year contracts to its recruits.
As might be expected, recruiting by Wall Street firms has declined, but she noted that J. P. Morgan hired R.P.I. students this year, as did Goldman, Sachs, the First Boston Corporation, and Chemical Bank.
One strategy that companies are using in these bad times, Mrs. Lynn said, is to decentralize recruiting, letting plant managers do the hiring. She named companies like General Dynamics and Hughes Aircraft as examples.
Campus recruiting is down sharply. She said: "We had 353 companies recruiting on campus for the 1990-1991 year and 34 percent made no offers. That compares with 422 companies that recruited in 1989-1990, of which 27 percent made no offers."

More State Curbs On Insurer Rates

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
A SMALL but growing number of states are cracking down on health insurers that aggressively reduce premiums to attract small businesses with young, healthy employees, and raise rates to discourage employers with potentially high medical costs. Critics say that such practices make access to health care unaffordable for those who need it most, adding to more than 34 million Americans already without insurance.
Vermont and Oregon enacted sweeping laws this year that require all insurers to spread risks evenly among small businesses by offering uniform community rates, regardless of the health status of employees. Bob Opel, a vice president with Blue Cross in Vermont, said the new law prohibited setting rates based on medical or demographic criteria. 
 But many insurers contend that even more people would have to give up their coverage if community rating was compulsory. They say that premiums would go up for young workers who are considered good risks, and many would drop out. "It is not unusual to have a spread in rates of 1,000 percent between groups," said Greg Scandlen, publisher of Health Benefits Letter, which is based in Alexandria, Va. "Obviously those at the bottom would pay more."
Similar legislation is also being considered in New York, California, Maine and Minnesota, where the Governor recently vetoed a wide-ranging health-access bill that included community rating.
The debate heated up in New York this summer when the state's largest insurer, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, applied for rate increases and the elimination of longstanding community rating for 350,000 employees of small businesses. Empire argued that it had to tie small-group rates to the employees' health status because it had lost several hundred thousand of its healthiest customers to commercial insurers offering lower rates. And Empire said it was losing money on the remaining small-group customers.
Michael Dowling, a senior health policy adviser to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, said Empire's rate request "underscores the necessity of moving forward with some kind of community rating" law. He added that the Governor's aides were discussing the Empire proposals with the Insurance Superintendent, Salvatore R. Curiale, whose approval is required for Blue Cross increases. Commercial insurers strongly opposed a Cuomo community rating bill earlier this year, and it did not reach a vote. But Mr. Dowling said there would be "a major push" to get the bill enacted.
Chris Petersen, a senior counsel with the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group, said that before passing a new law, the New York Legislature should wait to see the results of new Insurance Department regulations, which limit rate increases based on health status for small groups. "A lot of the abuses that the Blues complain about have been addressed," he said.
Eleven states enacted less sweeping laws on small-group insurance this year. They limit the difference betweeen the premiums that may be charged to small businesses considered poor risks and those charged to younger, healthier customers. The new laws -- in Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia -- generally follow recommendations adopted in December, with industry support, by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a group of state officials.
There are mixed views about community rating among the 73 Blue Cross and Blue Shield associations across the country. Their roots go back to the Great Depression, when hospitals organized Blue Cross associations to help hard-up patients pay their bills. But by the competitive 1980's, most Blue Cross plans had dropped community rating and become more like commercial insurers. They see little merit in going back to the old ways.
"A quick transition back to community rating would cause disruptions," said Gretchen Babcock, executive director of state services with the national Blue Cross association. She said most Blue Cross plans still "tend to have higher-risk enrollees" than commercial insurers, making it harder to compete under community rating.
The community rating concept survives in places where Blue Cross still dominates the market, notably in New York, Pennsylvania and Michigan. In return, Empire Blue Cross, for example, receives a 13 percent discount on hospital bills, and state tax concessions on premiums. But Empire executives said that its edge had been eroded as health care had increasingly shifted out of hospitals, and commercial insurers also got discounts, for prompt payment of hospital bills.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
State of Emergency Committee's Statement: 'A Mortal Danger Has Come'

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement to the Soviet people issued today by the State Committee for the State of Emergency in the U.S.S.R., as provided by Tass:
Compatriots, citizens of the Soviet Union, we are addressing you at the grave, critical hour for the destinies of Motherland and our peoples. A mortal danger has come to loom large over our great Motherland. 
 The policy of reforms, launched at Mikhail S. Gorbachev's initiative and designed as a means to insure the country's dynamic development and the democratization of social life has entered for several reasons a blind alley.
Lack of faith, apathy and despair have replaced the original enthusiasm and hopes.
Authorities at all levels have lost the population's trust. Politicking has replaced in public life concern for the fate of Motherland and the citizen.
 
Now Ungovernable
 Malicious outrage against all state institutes is being imposed. The country has in fact become ungovernable.
Having taken advantage of the granted liberties and encroaching upon the first sprouts of democracy, there have emerged extremist forces that have embarked on the course toward liquidating the Soviet Union, ruining the state and seizing power at any cost.
The results of the nationwide referendum on Motherland's unity have been trampled upon.
Cynical speculations on national feelings are merely a smokescreen to satisfy ambitions.
Neither today's misfortunes of their peoples, nor their tomorrow, worry political adventurists. In creating an atmosphere of moral and political terror and seeking to hide behind the shield of popular trust, they forget that the relations they condemn and disrupt were established on the basis of far broader popular support, which, besides, has passed the centuries-long test of history.
 
Inter-Ethnic Conflicts
 Today, those who are in fact working toward the overthrow of the constitutional system should be brought to account before mothers and fathers for the death of the hundreds of victims of inter-ethnic conflicts.
The fate of more than half a million refugees is on their conscience. They are to blame for the loss of tranquillity and the joy of living of tens of millions of Soviet people who only yesterday lived in a united family but today found themselves living as outcasts in their own home.
People should decide what social system should exist, but attempts are being made to deprive them of this right.
Instead of showing concern for the security and well-being of every citizen and all society, persons that have come to positions of power not infrequently use it for interests alien to the people, as a means for unscrupulous self-assertion.
Torrents of words and piles of declarations and promises only underline the scanty and meager nature of their practical deeds. The inflation of authority is destroying our state and society in a more frightening way than any other.
 
Increasing Uncertainty
 Every citizen is feeling increasing uncertainty about tomorrow and deep concern about the future of his or her children.
The power crisis has had catastrophic effects on the economy. The chaotic, spontaneous slide toward a market provoked an explosion of egoism -- regional, departmental, group and personal.
The war of laws and encouragement of centrifugal tendencies spelled destruction of the integral national economic mechanism that has been shaping for decades. The result includes sharp drops in the living standards of the vast majority of the Soviet people, and the blossoming of profiteering and the shadow economy.
It is high time people were told the truth: If urgent and decisive measures are not adopted to stabilize the economy, hunger and another spiral of impoverishment are imminent in the near future, from which it is just a step from mass manifestations of spontaneous discontent with devastating consequences.
Only irresponsible people can bank on some aid from abroad. No handouts can solve our problems; our rescue is in our own hands.
 
Real Contributions
 The time has come to measure the authority of every person and organization by their real contributions to the rehabilitation and development of the national economy.
For long years, we have heard incantations from all sides about the commitment to the interests of an individual and concern for individual rights and social security. In fact, man has found himself humiliated and desperate, his real rights and possibilities infringed upon.
All democratic institutions created by the popular will are losing weight and effectiveness right in front of our eyes. This is a result of purposeful actions by those who, grossly violating the fundamental law of the U.S.S.R., are effectively in the process of staging an anti-constitutional coup and striving for unbridled personal dictatorial powers. Prefectures, mayoralties and other illegal structures are increasingly replacing, de facto, popularly elected governing councils.
An offensive is under way on the rights of working people. The rights to work, education, health, housing and leisure are in jeopardy.
Even the elementary personal security of people is increasingly under threat. Crime is fast on the increase, getting organized and politicized. The country is sinking into the quagmire of violence and lawlessness.
 
Sex and Violence
 Never before in national history has the propaganda of sex and violence assumed such a scale, threatening the health and lives of future generations. Millions of people are demanding measures against the octopus of crime and glaring immorality.
The increasing destabilization of the political and economic situation in the Soviet Union is undercutting our positions in the world. Revanchist notes are to be heard in some places and demands are being made for a review of our borders. Voices can even be heard speaking of dismembering the Soviet Union and of the possibility of establishing international guardianship over individual facilities and regions of the country.
Such is the bitter reality. Whereas only yesterday a Soviet person finding himself abroad felt himself a worthy citizen of an influential and respected state, now he is often a second-rate foreigner, the attitude to whom is marked by either contempt or sympathy.
The pride and honor of the Soviet people must be restored in full.
The State Committee for the State of Emergency in the U.S.S.R. is fully aware of the depth of the crisis that has afflicted the country, it takes upon itself the responsibility for the fate of the country and is fully determined to take most serious measures to take the state and society out of the crisis as soon as possible.
We promise to hold a nationwide discussion of the draft new union treaty. Each individual will have the right and opportunity to think over this major act and define his attitude toward it because the fate of numerous peoples of our great Motherland will depend on what the Soviet Union will be like.
 
Law and Order
 We intend to restore law and order straight away, end bloodshed, declare a war without mercy to the criminal world, eradicate shameful phenomena discrediting our society and degrading Soviet citizens. We shall clean the streets of our cities from criminal elements and put an end to arbitrariness of the squanderers of the national wealth.
We favor genuine democratic processes, a consistent reform policy leading to the renewal of our Motherland, its economic and social prosperity, which will enable it to take a worthy place in the world community of nations.
The country's development must not be built upon the declining standards of living of the people. A consistent rise in the living standards of all citizens will become the norm in a healthy society, without reducing care for strengthening and protecting the interests of the widest layers of the population, those who are the hardest hit by inflation, production disorganization, corruption and crime.
Developing the many-tier character of the national economy, we shall support private enterprise, granting it necessary opportunities for the development of production and services.
Our prime concern is the solution of the food and housing problems. All available forces will be mobilized to meet these, the most essential needs of the people.
We are calling upon workers, peasants, working intelligentsia, all Soviet people to restore, within the briefest period of time, labor discipline and order, raise the level of production in order to resolutely march ahead. Our life and the future of our children and grandchildren, the fate of the Motherland depend on this.
We are a peace-loving country and shall undeviatingly honor all our commitments. We have no claims to make against anybody. We want to live in peace and friendship with all. But we firmly declare that no one will be ever allowed to encroach upon our sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. All attempts to talk the language of Diktat to our country, no matter where they may come from, will be resolutely suppressed.
 
Patriotic Feelings
 Our multinational people have lived for centuries, proud of their Motherland. We have never been ashamed of our patriotic feelings and we hold it natural and rightful to raise the present and future generations of citizens of this great power in this spirit.
To remain inactive at this hour of crisis for the fate of the Motherland means to take upon oneself the heavy responsibility for the tragic, truly unpredictable consequences. Each individual who holds our Motherland dear, who wants to live and work in peace and confidence, who does not acquiesce to the continuation of the bloody inter-ethnic conflicts, who sees his Motherland independent and prospering in the future must make the only right choice. We call on all true patriots, people of good will, to put an end to the present time of uncertainty.
We call on all citizens of the Soviet Union to grow aware of their duty before the country and render all possible assistance to the State Committee for the State of Emergency in the U.S.S.R. and efforts to pull the country out of the crisis.
Constructive proposals from socio-political organizations, work collectives and individuals will be appreciated as the show of their patriotic readiness to actively participate in the restoration of the century-old friendship in the single family of fraternal peoples and the revival of the Motherland.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
Yeltsin's Remarks: A 'Reactionary Coup'

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks made in Moscow today by Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian federated republic, as translated by the State Department:
I am reading. 
 Citizens of Russia: On the night of 18-19 August 1991, the legally elected President of the country was removed from power.
Regardless of the reasons given for his removal, we are dealing with a rightist, reactionary, anti-constitutional coup. Despite all the difficulties and severe trials being experienced by the people, the democratic process in the country is acquiring an increasingly broad sweep and an irreversible character.
The peoples of Russia are becoming masters of their destiny. The uncontrolled powers of unconstitutional organs have been considerably limited, and this includes party organs.
The leadership of Russia has adopted a resolute position toward the union treaty striving for the unity of the Soviet Union and unity of Russia. Our position on this issue permitted a considerable acceleration of the preparation of this treaty, to coordinate it with all the republics and to determine the date of signing as Aug 20. Tomorrow's signing has been cancelled.
These developments gave rise to angry reactionary forces, pushed them to irresponsible and adventurist attempts to solve the most complicated political and economic problems by methods of force. Attempts to realize a coup have been tried earlier.
 
Citizens' Rebuff Urged
 We considered and consider that such methods of force are unacceptable. They discredit the union in the eyes of the whole world, undermine our prestige in the world community, and return us to the cold-war era along with the Soviet Union's isolation in the world community. All of this forces us to proclaim that the so-called committee's ascendancy to power is unlawful.
Accordingly we proclaim all decisions and instructions of this committee to be unlawful.
We are confident that the organs of local power will unswervingly adhere to constitutional laws and decrees of the President of Russia.
We appeal to citizens of Russia to give a fitting rebuff to the putschists and demand a return of the country to normal constitutional development.
Undoubtedly it is essential to give the country's President, Gorbachev, an opportunity to address the people. Today he has been blockaded. I have been denied communications with him. We demand an immediate convocation of an extraordinary Congress of People's Deputies of the Union. We are absolutely confident that our countrymen will not permit the sanctioning of the tyranny and lawlessness of the putschists, who have lost all shame and conscience. We address an appeal to servicemen to manifest lofty civic duty and not take part in the reactionary coup.
Until these demands are met, we appeal for a universal unlimited strike.

HEADLINE: At Kemper, No Defaults But Lots of Skepticism

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Among the nation's major insurance companies, the Kemper Corporation would appear to be an exception in this real estate recession: virtually none of its $1.97 billion in commercial real estate mortgages and real estate joint ventures are in default. Or so it seems from its financial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
But over the last few months, insurance ratings agencies and stock market investors have become increasingly skeptical of Kemper's real estate portfolio. In particular they have questioned whether the insurer is hiding losses in its joint-venture mortgages, in which Kemper lends money to partnerships it is a part of. 
 Their conclusions so far make Kemper's record look very different from what can be learned simply from looking at Kemper's reports to the S.E.C.
What worries analysts and investors is Kemper's joint-venture mortgages and the more than $110 million in "equity loans" that Kemper has put into propping them up. A close examination of some of these projects in Illinois shows that the company suffered paper losses on some of its investments and continued, as late as last year, to tie up hundreds of millions of dollars in property ventures with little or no cash return.
Kemper's real estate joint ventures have prompted the company to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on development deals at a time when the commercial property market in Chicago is still severely depressed and the residential market is weak. Some of these deals have provided tens of millions of dollars in fees to developers but little or no immediate cash return for Kemper.
Despite a series of unprofitable joint ventures, the partners have until recently continued to bring new deals to Kemper in which the insurer paid them fees for everything from structuring the deals to managing the development, doing the construction, leasing the property and later running the project. These partners put in little or no money up front but got substantial chunks of equity in addition to the fees.
Kemper is also saddled with loans covering more than 3,000 acres of raw land in Illinois that it hopes to develop. Strangely, the insurer lent more than $75 million to partners to acquire some of these parcels before they were even zoned for development. Much of this land was zoned for farming when the loans were made, and the value of farmland in Illinois has since fallen.
Richard S. Curto, the senior vice president of real estate investments for Kemper Financial Services Inc., another unit of the Kemper Corporation, emphasized that Kemper had chosen a few good developers with which to do joint ventures and create long-term investment value for Kemper shareholders.
"The joint-venture program is working very well to provide the shareholders with hidden assets," Mr. Curto said, explaining that over the long run the value of the investments would increase and that the company could wait.
The Kemper Corporation is a huge, diversified insurance and financial services company with nearly $14 billion in assets, of which the real estate portfolio represents about 21 percent of the consolidated corporation's invested assets and 23 percent of the combined invested assets of the company's two life insurance units. The life insurance industry as a whole has about 24 percent of its assets in real estate.
As of March 31, Kemper had $1.34 billion in joint-venture mortgages. On most of those mortgages interest accrues, but the partnerships do not make cash interest payments to Kemper.
Kemper also had about $503 million in traditional third-party commercial mortgages, and $110 million in what the company calls "equity loans." In addition, Kemper has at least $600 million in commitments to real estate ventures that it has not yet financed.
 
Potential for Defaults Admitted
 Mr. Curto and Steven Timbers, Kemper's chief investment officer, both emphasized that Kemper was large and liquid enough to take these risks on property developments. Mr. Curto reluctantly acknowledged recently that as time passed, some loans might have to be restructured and there was the potential for defaults.
Several analysts have taken comfort in the fact that Kemper's "equity loans" category did not expand rapidly last year and in the first quarter of this year. But Kemper's real estate executives have turned debt investments in some partners' projects into equity positions in those projects, which can also serve to mask problems. Through depreciation, Kemper has substantially reduced the equity investments that show up on its books.
Kemper told analysts last week that as of June it had accumulated losses of $71.3 million on its $57 million of equity real estate investments.
 
Not 'a Traditional Portfolio'
 "One of the reasons that you do not have delinquencies and problems reported is that you don't have a traditional portfolio," said Michael W. Blumstein, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. "When a joint venture isn't quite making it, they make an equity loan to the joint venture, and that's why there is the question about how much they are propping up these joint ventures."
The ratings agencies have expressed similar concerns and have moved twice in recent weeks to downgrade the rating of Kemper Investors Life Insurance Company, known as Kilico.
In the Chicago area, Kemper has three developers with which it has done most of its recent development deals: Walsh Higgins & Company, the Prime Group Inc. and LaSalle Partners.
 
Downtown Chicago Project
 Take, for example, an unfinished office building in downtown Chicago. The building, designed by Ricardo Bofill is a 1.1-million-square-foot joint venture at 77 West Wacker Drive, on the Chicago River. Kemper's partner in the project is the Prime Group, a 10-year-old company headed by Michael W. Reschke, a fast-rising Chicago lawyer who had never built a downtown office building before the Kemper project.
Mr. Curto said that Kemper decided to go ahead with the project in 1989, although the percentage of vacant commercial office space was about 15 percent, an unhealthy level. The partnership broke ground in 1990, and the downtown Chicago vacancy is now about 20 percent, according to the Chicago office of Julien J. Studley Inc., a national brokerage company.
In financing developments, Kemper and its partners usually approach commercial banks to secure construction money, and Kemper guarantees the long-term mortgage.
In the case of 77 West Wacker Drive, four Japanese lenders, the Suisse Bank Corporation and the Bank of Montreal provided a $230 million, seven-year construction loan last March. Kemper also put in a big chunk of equity money that got the construction started, as much as $70 million, some Chicago executives say. Mr. Curto called the contribution substantial but declined to give the exact number.
Kemper will have to keep paying the monthly interest costs on the $230 million even if office rents from the building do not cover the payments. If payments lapse, Kemper would lose its initial equity investment.
Mr. Curto predicted that the partnership would see a 9 1/2 percent return on the building by 1996, but he expects that over the next five years there would be virtually no return on the millions invested in the building and that Kemper would have to finance any shortfalls.
That 9 1/2 percent forecast may be optimistic. Kemper and its partner signed various leases with tenants for most of the space in the building, which after concessions and other special costs average about $10 or $11 a square foot. The building cost at least $250 a square foot to build and lease.
R. R. Donnelly & Company, the country's largest commercial printing company, signed a 15-year lease for 200,000 square feet of space -- 10 floors -- in the building. But to close the deal, Kemper purchased about $14 million in raw land from Donnelly, agreed to pay about $52 a foot for interior work for Donnelly offices, promised to move the company and granted it almost four years' free rent. It is unclear whether the land purchase was done as a separate deal.
The result: The Kemper partnership gets a net effective rent of about $8 a square foot from the lease.
The $250 to $300 a square foot Kemper spent on the space Donnelly will take will thus yield about 2 to 3 percent. Treasury bills, which do not appreciate but are much safer, yield more than double that. Of course, if the property market rebounds and the building can be sold later for a substantial gain, the yield will be higher.
Other tenants fared about as well. Keck Mahin & Cate, a law firm, was lured away from the Sears Tower with a 20-year lease, a year of free rent for 200,000 square feet, $6 million for buying out the remainder of their old lease and more than $60 a square foot in tenant improvements. The bottom line for Kemper: about $12 a square foot.
In deals like this and in others in the suburbs of Chicago, Kemper's partners put up little or no cash for their equity ownership in the projects. If the projects do poorly, as other Illinois deals have, Kemper's partners are still ahead if their equity interests erode and the insurer has to lend more money to the project, because the partners still collect big fees without facing capital calls.
LaSalle Partners, which sold the raw land to Donnelly for about half the price at which Donnelly then sold it to Kemper, made big fees even though it was not an equity partner in that deal. In that case, LaSalle collected several million dollars in leasing commissions for bringing Donnelly to Kemper, LaSalle's development partner in another deal.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS: WHAT BUSH IS FACING;
Prospects for a 'New World Order' Are Precarious, and Critics Line Up

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The edifice of hope that George Bush has spent much of his Presidency building may not come crashing down as a result of the epochal events in Moscow today. But it will probably be much harder to maintain, because the Soviet Union no longer seems a ready or reliable partner.
To some extent Mikhail S. Gorbachev had cooperated with the United States to create a new world order, on issues ranging from the Gulf War to arms control, because his country was weak and he thought he had no other choice. In that sense, little has changed with his ouster; the Soviet Union is now weaker and more vulnerable to internal disruption than it was two weeks ago, and the United States is therefore proportionately stronger. That reality was reflected in the flight to the dollar around the world. 
 But the new Soviet leadership is likely to play a weak hand differently, a senior Administration official said, "and that means things will be harder to achieve -- in the Middle East, at the United Nations, in central Europe."
 
Suddenly an Observer
 Then there is the politics of the thing, with an election year approaching.
The departure of Mr. Gorbachev has clearly left Mr. Bush and his main allies with little influence over events in the Soviet Union. Charles William Maynes, the editor of Foreign Policy magazine, said "we have been pushed to the sidelines, reduced to the status of observers, because we didn't help Gorbachev and the reformers as vigorously as we should have and could have done."
Early in his administration, the President seemed reluctant to make a commitment to the Soviet leader, and such officials as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney regularly predicted Mr. Gorbachev's downfall. Then came the Persian Gulf War and successful summit conferences, and with them what Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat, called "something approaching a real partnership."
Even so, Washington fought shy of large-scale economic aid and opposed giving Moscow full membership in international financial institutions, as advocated by the major European powers, especially Germany. That prompted behind-the-scenes clashes at the summit conference in London last month, when Mr. Gorbachev pleaded in vain for more help in rebuilding his collapsing economy.
 
Critics on Both Sides
 Mr. Bush will no doubt be criticized by conservative elements in his party for having tied American interests too closely to Mr. Gorbachev's fate; Frank Gaffney, the former Pentagon official who monitored arms proliferation in the Reagan administration, accused Mr. Bush as well as Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d of having been "too enthralled" with the Soviet leader to see what was happening. Critics on the left, like Mr. Maynes, will say he missed his big chance to change the strategic balance forever.
But the President moved quickly to minimize any domestic political damage by emphasizing his support for Boris Yeltsin, the most important remaining reformer, and picturing himself as a champion of democracy, regardless of who holds power in the Kremlin. The White House was quick to note that Mr. Bush had received Mr. Yeltsin at the White House and had talked with him in Moscow.
"Our national interests have not been damaged, in a global sense, no matter how sad we may be because brave people in Russia and the Baltics are going to suffer," said Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana. "More clearly today than on some other days, you can see that the locus of world authority remains with the United States, and George Bush remains the key leader."
Among many politicians in Washington, there was a powerful sense that, barring a political miracle, a figure of historic dimensions -- someone who may stand alongside Churchill and Roosevelt in the 20th-century pantheon -- had left the world stage. And there were appeals for measures to deny those who toppled him any means to solve the problems he could not.
Mr. Nunn, for example, said President Bush and other leaders should repeat every day the assertion that the new Government was "illegitimate," should refuse to recognize it, should permit no high-level visits, should discourage American companies from further investments in the Soviet Union and should put all economic-aid programs "on hold," as Mr. Bush said he planned to do.
Neither the trade treaty, which would give preferred status to the Soviet Union, nor the treaty covering conventional forces in Europe is likely to be ratified by the Senate this fall, as had seemed certain only last week. An additional $900 million in grain credits, due in October and in February of next year, are not likely to be forthcoming, said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican minority leader.
Most strategic analysts agreed that the cold war wasn't about to be reborn and argued that Soviet military expansionism was not likely to be revived. Rozanne Ridgway, a former assistant secretary of state for European affairs, said the division of Europe, Germany and Berlin were issues that had been solved once and for all, eliminating one of the main causes of that 40-year struggle. The Cold War was also about a competition of ideologies, and Communism has little appeal left, except for Soviet and Cuban hard-liners.
 
Impact on the Middle East
 But the Soviet leadership may be less cooperative in the Middle East, since some of the major backers of today's coup think Mr. Gorbachev too readily abandoned traditional allies in the region, like Syria and Iraq. And given the new order in Moscow, the United States may be reluctant to have Moscow as co-sponsor of a peace conference.
Any further arms-control negotiations, about which the United States already had substantial doubts, are probably out of the question for now. At the United Nations, the Soviet Union will probably be much more inclined than under Mr. Gorbachev to use its veto, one Western ambassador there predicted.
Most ominously, in the view of Administration officials and the Germans as well, the coup has caught the process of Soviet military withdrawal from central Europe in midstream. Almost 250,000 Soviet troops remain in reunified Germany.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates Plunge in Rush to Buy Bills

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's stunning ouster as president of the Soviet Union sent investors from around the world running for the safe, secure haven of Treasury securities yesterday.
As often occurs at times of crisis, short-term Treasury bills were the investment of choice, and interest rates fell sharply. Three-month bill rates fell well below 5 percent for a while yesterday, the first time they have been below that level since after the stock market crash in October 1987. Meanwhile, bond yields dropped below 8 percent for a time, at one point falling as low as 7.92 percent, their lowest of the year. 
 Traders said that profit taking began to emerge once it became clear that stock prices, which plummeted early in the day, had stabilized and were on the rebound.
 
'Things Have Quieted Down'
 "When the stock market stabilized and started to improve, there was heavy retail selling of everything from bills to bonds," one government bond trader said. "After a chaotic morning, things have quieted down a lot."
The movement into Treasury issues on such a tumultuous day seemed to serve as a counterpoint to the recent misdeeds at Salomon Brothers, acts that prompted some critics to question whether the giant firm's transgressions had compromised the market's integrity.
"If you recognize that the Government market is the highest-quality market, I don't think what happened at Salomon Brothers affects investment decisions that much," said Rao Chalansani, chief investment strategist at the Kemper Securities Group in Chicago. "The government market is much too big to be influenced by one party."
Traders said the sharp downward move in short-term bill rates yesterday made bidding difficult at yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills. But the auction results were about as anticipated, the traders said, and demand for the new securities was good.
 
Restrictions on Salomon
 As mandated by the Government on Sunday, Salomon Brothers was prevented from placing bids for clients at the bill auctions.
At the auctions, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.17 percent, down sharply from an average rate of 5.30 percent at last week's sale. It is the lowest rate on a three-month bill since the sale on Oct. 26, 1987, when three-month bills were sold at an average rate of 5.12 percent.
Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.23 percent, down from an average rate of 5.39 percent a week ago. The new rate is the lowest since Oct. 27, 1986, when six-month bills were sold at an average rate of 5.23 percent.
The unsettled situation in the Soviet Union increases the odds that short-term rates will fall further, analysts said.
Some added that the turmoil could be yet another reason why the Federal Reserve Board at its policy-making meeting today might decide to lower its target on the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market as well as its discount rate.
"The Soviet situation clearly creates uncertainty, both among consumers and businesses," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International. "When that happens, people tend to postpone decisions. To me the coup raises the possibility that the Fed might lower both the funds rate and the discount rate."
 
Money Flowing to U.S.
 Aside from being a mild negative for the American economy, a development that would favor lower interest rates, analysts said the Soviet situation would almost certainly induce some money invested in Europe to flow to dollar-denominated assets like fixed-income securities.
"International capital flows into the United States should heighten," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities. "Everything augurs for a firm bid on the bond, as well as the dollar."
After moving to new highs early in the session, bond prices ended lower on the day.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 100 7/32, down 1/4 point, to yield 8.10 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 10/32, down 2/32, to yield 7.82 percent. And the 6 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 1/4, up 1/8 point, to yield 6.18 percent.
In the secondary market for short-term Treasury bills, three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 5.08 percent, down 14 basis points, or 14-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 9 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.09 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Florida Power and Light Company, a unit of the FPL Group, offered $150 million worth of 30-year first-mortgage bonds through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 9 1/8 percent securities were priced at 99, to yield 9.223 percent, 1.12 percentage points more than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are nonrefundable for five years, are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In conjunction with its taxable offering, Florida Power and Light also offered $51.9 million of tax-exempt revenue bonds at various prices through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. These securities are rated A-2 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said prices of most issues were little changed in quiet trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to up 1/8 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Our Towns

BYLINE: By Wayne King

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J.

 BODY:
Nicole Colon is 40 years old, and a woman of considerable authority, but when it comes to things like going to the park, she knows who is boss: her granddaughter, Migdalia Melendez, who is bright, chubby and 2 1/2.
"I don't bring her, she brings me," said Mrs. Colon. "I got custody of her. Or maybe she got custody of me." 
 Mrs. Colon and Migdalia come to the park every day to gain surcease from the stifling heat of their apartment in the adjoining housing project and to stay off the mean streets of North Camden on hot August days. It's safer, says Mrs. Colon, "and Migdalia, she loves the water."
So do a lot of others here, children and teen-agers mostly, who come to take advantage of the spray pool that is fenced off like an oasis in a gritty urban desert.
Camden has seven spray pools, the city equivalent of the sprinkler on the suburban front lawn. The youngsters, and sometimes their parents, run through the sun-sparkling spray and giggle and cavort the way they always do in that happy, hissing chemistry that results when you turn on the water, add children, and stir.
By that measure and others, Camden's spray pools are an enormous success. They are cheaper to build and maintain than swimming pools, which is the reason Camden has only two public pools for 21,000 school children; small children like the spray pools better; lifeguards are not required; in most cases the water is cleansed and recycled and there is little loss and little cost.
Camden could use a lot more of them. Once, like Chicago a city of broad shoulders with a thriving shipyard and a muscular blue-collar economic base, it is now the state's poorest. Forty percent of its 85,000 residents are under 18; over half drop out of high school; 85 percent are black or Hispanic; a third of the babies are born to teen-agers and 90 percent are unmarried.
"We have 14 city parks and ideally we'd have at least 14 spray pools," said Beth Richmond, the city's recreation superintendent. Indeed, the city could use a lot more. There are no spray pools in East Camden, which has a third of the city's population.
In a city with no more than a hundred households with incomes over $50,000, they don't have a lot of air-conditioning, and Camden in August is an oven.
So they do what they can, and that is very often to go out in the street with a wrench and open a fire hydrant. That, of course, is an invitation to disaster.
The last time there was a rash of "hydrant-popping," as the water burglaries are called, the water pressure dropped so low that they closed City Hall and sent everyone home. "The toilets wouldn't flush," said a city spokesman, Tom Hinkle. Fortunately there were no serious fires.
"We did have a spray nozzle program," said Ms. Richmond of the recreation department, referring to a program in use in many urban areas that provides fixtures to residents to attach to hydrants to create a fine spray and save water.
"But the city is self-insured, and they were afraid if the nozzles came off under pressure and caused injury they might get sued. They discontinued the program last year."
Meanwhile, although the city has just opened a spiffy new park with a spray pool just across the street from the one that little Migdalia frequents, it will be hard-pressed to open others. Federal grants and state aid that financed the creation of Camden's spray pools during the late 1970's and into the 80's have been either cut back or dismantled by the Reagan-Bush Administrations in Washington or economic hard times in New Jersey.
The new park and spray pool were financed by the state's Green Acres fund, but the city has to pay back most of the money, close to a million dollars, which it does not have. The money will be repaid by a nonprofit corporate sponsor called Fair Share Housing Development Inc., which will also pick up maintenance costs.
"There was a time during the mid- to late 70's when the Fed was just throwing money at towns like Camden," said Ms. Richmond.
"Now it doesn't begin to fill the need."
Mrs. Colon says the spray pool is even therapeutic. "You know, she got bitten by something, a mosquito I think," she said, gesturing to Migdalia's button nose, which is cherry red. "The water is good for it."

HEADLINE: California Medical Researcher Nominated as New York State Health Chief

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today nominated Dr. Mark R. Chassin, a California medical researcher and businessman who has worked to improve the quality and affordability of health care, as the state's new health commissioner.
In selecting Dr. Chassin, Mr. Cuomo placed the state's evolving policies on AIDS, health insurance, medical malpractice and health care regulation in the hands of a man with little experience in New York's singular health care problems. But aides to Mr. Cuomo and Californians who know Dr. Chassin praised his intelligence and his openness to diverse opinions, and said those qualities would offset his lack of familiarity with New York. 
 The nomination is subject to confirmation by the State Senate. John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, said the Senate is not likely to consider the nomination until the Legislature convenes a special session, probably in November or December.
 
Extra Pay
 Mr. McArdle said "some eyebrows have already been raised" by the salary package offered Dr. Chassin, which would total $160,000. The previous health commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, received $98,399, but Cuomo officials said they could not lure Dr. Chassin for that.
Dr. Chassin, 44 years old, will receive the health comissioner's salary, which is set by law, and an additional $61,601 as president of Health Research Inc., a nonprofit corporation operated by the Health Department. The corporation, which Dr. Axelrod directed without pay, solicits and administers grants for Health Department research projects.
Dr. Chassin is senior vice president of Value Health Sciences, a Santa Monica company that markets state-of-the-art computer software that helps hospitals and doctors determine the appropriateness of particular medical treatments. He is a former health care researcher for the RAND Corporation and an emergency room physician.
 
Complicated Search
 His areas of expertise -- health care access and cost containment -- are likely to dominate the state's health agenda in the 1990's, particularly as the Governor and Legislature grapple with the costs imposed by a growing Medicaid caseload and simultaneous epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis and measles.
"Dr. Mark Chassin has distinguished himself as an innovative leader in the health care field, particularly in his work on such key issues as quality of care, cost control and the appropriateness of various health services," Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.
The Governor made it clear, however, that Dr. Chassin would have to fill large shoes in succeeding Dr. Axelrod, who suffered a stroke in February. Dr. Axelrod, who directed the 4,200 workers and $930 million budget of the health department for 11 years, was a nationally recognized expert on health policy and one of the Governor's closest advisers.
Dr. Chassin was en route to Albany today for two days of meetings and could not be reached for comment.
Several leaders of New York's health care community said they found the Governor's choice unusual because Dr. Chassin has had little experience managing a public health bureaucracy and has spent most of his professional life in California, where health care is far less regulated than it is in New York.
The search, which began formally with the announcement of Dr. Axelrod's retirement in April, was complicated by a state law requiring the health commissioner to be a medical doctor. Cuomo aides said many doctors found the statutory salary unacceptably low.
By creating a salary for the corporation job, Mr. Cuomo was able to offer Dr. Chassin the highest salary paid to a state commissioner. By comparison, the Governor receives $130,000. Because the corporation salary will be paid with funds generated by the corporation's activities, and not through the state budget, it will not require legislative approval, said Michael J. Dowling, Mr. Cuomo's director of health, education and human services.
 
Raised in New York
 Dr. Chassin, a doctor's son, was born in Brooklyn and reared in New York City and on Long Island. He received undergraduate, master's and medical degrees at Harvard and spent three years in Washington as deputy director of an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. He has lived in California for the last 10 years.
Some health care officials in New York expressed concern that Dr. Chassin's positions on major issues are unknown and questioned whether he would take the tough stands that made Dr. Axelrod a larger-than-life figure in the state's health community.
But those who sometimes resented Dr. Axelrod's uncompromising dedication to heavy regulation said they welcomed a change. "From what we understand about him, he is extremely bright but is not going to be an individual who is going to overpower other opinions," said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hopsital Association.
Mr. Cuomo has said there will be no backsliding on any of the administration's leading health initiatives, including proposals to impose universal health care and no-fault malpractice insurance. But some health care advocates questioned where Dr. Chassin would place his priorities.
"The concern is, is this a guy who has the commitment to and the expertise in the area of health policy to play the aggressive role necessary to make these things happen?" asked David A. Hansell, deputy executive director of Gay Men's Health Crisis, the New York City-based group that serves people with AIDS.
Mr. Hansell and other AIDS lobbyists said they are particularly concerned about the future direction of Dr. Axelrod's policies protecting the confidentiality of AIDS patients. In light of new Federal guidelines and several high-profile cases, the Health Department currently is reviewing its policy of not requiring infected health care workers to disclose their condition to patients.

Restore Gorbachev, Bush Urges Moscow

 BODY:
In a sharp condemnation of the coup that overthrew President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President Bush made a blunt demand for Mr. Gorbachev's restoration to power and said the United States did not accept the legitimacy of the self-proclaimed new Soviet Government. 
 Mr. Bush issued his strongly worded statement after a day of consultations with other leaders of the Western alliance and a concerted effort to squeeze the new Soviet leadership by freezing billions in economic aid. He assailed the coup as a "misguided and illegitimate effort" that "bypasses both Soviet law and the will of the Soviet peoples."

Glancing Blow Seen in U.S., with Little Lasting Damage

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The downfall of Mikhail S. Gorbachev is likely to deal the United States economy a mild, glancing blow over the next few weeks. But it is sufficiently insulated from the Soviet Union's economy to avoid much lasting damage.
Many economists said yesterday that short-term problems -- the impact on the stock market, the dollar and perhaps agriculture -- could throw the incipient recovery from recession temporarily off course. "But over the long term, the impact won't be very great, beyond the uncertainty that is likely to prevail for a while," said David M. Kemme, a Russian expert and economist at Wichita State University. 
 The immediate effects can cause some pain. Sharp declines in stock prices beyond yesterday's plunge would reduce the wealth of millions of Americans. A stronger dollar would increase the prices of American exports, curtailing this important source of economic growth. And grain sales to the Soviet Union could be disrupted.
 
Grain Shipments Delayed
 Grain dealers said yesterday that the loading of grain in New Orleans aboard ships bound for the Soviet Union had been delayed because of concern about Soviet payment. Reflecting that uncertainty, the prices of corn, wheat and soybeans dropped sharply on commodity exchanges yesterday.
The Soviet upheaval came just as the Federal Reserve's top policy makers were preparing to travel to Washington for one of their periodic meetings to review recent economic developments and decide whether to change interest rates. The Fed lowered a key short-term rate earlier this month out of concern that the recovery might be fading. Now Mr. Gorbachev's downfall might prompt consideration of another rate cut at today's meeting, economists said.
"The Fed is already biased toward lower rates to stimulate the economy and this could tilt them more in that direction," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
That would be the case particularly if the dollar rises against the German mark and the Japanese yen, as it did yesterday. Lower rates discourage investors from buying the dollars needed to purchase American securities.
For the longer run, economists expressed concern about how the emergence of a hardline Soviet Government might affect military spending in the United States.
Currently, they expect that military spending will be cut by as much as 25 percent over the next few years, with the money saved -- "the peace dividend" -- diverted to reducing the budget deficit and financing public works and social programs. A decision to rebuild the military, in response to some renewed Soviet threat, would most likley increase the deficit and renew the debate over its size.
But economists pointed to another factor that might help reduce the deficit. Many hold that when the deficit rises, so must interest rates, as the Government tries to borrow from a limited worldwide pool of savings. But until the Gorbachev Government fell, a portion of this pool was earmarked for investment in that country. Now, investments there and in Eastern Europe appear less attractive, said Edward S. Hyman, president of ISI Group Inc., an economic consulting firm.
"The capital shortage story has been lessened a fair amount by these latest events," Mr. Hyman said. "If anything, these events are somewhat deflationary."
The Soviet upheaval also raised the possibility that Americans, unnerved by the news, might cut back on consumer spending, further damaging an already weak retail sector. But Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Research Center, discounted this concern.
"The worst thing that could happen to consumer confidence would be the emergence of a general sense of uncertainty," he said. "And even if this happened, consumers would soon conclude that the Soviet struggle is not going to have much lasting impact on them."

Text of White House Statement

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement by President Bush, issued today by the White House:
We are deeply disturbed by the events of the last hours in the Soviet Union and condemn the unconstitutional resort to force. While the situation continues to evolve and information remains incomplete, the apparent unconstitutional removal of President Gorbachev, the declaration of a state of emergency, and the deployment of Soviet military forces in Moscow and other cities raise the most serious questions about the future course of the Soviet Union. This misguided and illegitimate effort bypasses both Soviet law and the will of the Soviet peoples. 
 Accordingly, we support President Yeltsin's call for "restoration of the legally elected organs of power and the reaffirmation of the post of U.S.S.R. President M. S. Gorbachev."
Greater democracy and openness in Soviet society, including steps toward implementation of Soviet obligations under the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris, have made a crucial contribution to the welcome improvement in East-West relations during the past few years.
In these circumstances, U.S. policy will be based on the following guidelines:
*We believe the policies of reform in the Soviet Union must continue, including democratization, the process of peaceful reconciliation between the center and the republics and economic transformation.
*We support all constitutionally elected leaders and oppose the use of force or intimidation of suppress them or restrict their right to free speech.
*We oppose the use of force in the Baltic states or against any republics to suppress or replace democratically elected governments.
*We call upon the U.S.S.R. to abide by its international treaties and commitments, including its commitments to respect basic human rights and democratic practices under the Helsinki Accords, and the Charter of Paris.
*We will avoid in every possible way actions that would lend legitimacy or support to this coup effort.
*We have no interest in a new cold war or in the exacerbation of East-West tensions.
*At the same time, we will not support economic aid programs if adherence to extra-constitutional means continues.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Increases Sharply; Gold Also Moves Upward

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar soared in wild foreign-exchange trading yesterday, reflecting a surge in demand for the safe-haven currency on news that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union had been overthrown.
The dollar's rise came despite heavy intervention by several central banks, which sold dollars to contain the currency's strength. The United States currency's increase was especially sharp against the German mark, because Germany is seen as the Western nation most vulnerable to Soviet political and economic upheaval. 
 The mark "is the first one to benefit in case of any good news and the first one to be suffering in any development of this sort," said Lorenzo Troni, vice president of foreign exchange with Paine Webber International Ltd.
Gold also finished higher. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted an after-hours bid of $358.20 a troy ounce, up 50 cents from late Friday. Gold for current delivery rose 60 cents a troy ounce, to a late bid of $358.60 on New York's Commodity Exchange.
Money trading was active and volatile in Europe, though it moderated by afternoon in New York, analysts said.
"Most of it happened in overnight trading, and most of it's been concentrated on the dollar vs. the mark," said Terri Reid, an investment officer with Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
The dollar finished at 1.8245 German marks in New York, up from 1.7645 late Friday. In Europe, the dollar closed at 1.8155 marks, up from 1.7605 Friday.
Other currencies declined less in value against the dollar, but the moves were still significant, underscoring the dollar's historical role as the most secure currency when uncertainty prevails.
In New York, the British pound finished at $1.6255, down from $1.6575 late Friday. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.6305, from $1.6610 late Friday.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.50 yen, to a closing 138.40 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 138.20 yen, and in New York, the dollar was quoted at 138.15 yen, up from 137.30 yen Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.5535 Swiss francs, up from 1.5440; 1.1431 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1450; 6.1775 French francs, up from 5.9975; 1,359.59 Italian lire, up from 1,320.25.
Selected late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.5510 Swiss francs, up from 1.5395; 6.1535 French francs, up from 5.9875; 2.0460 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9855; 1,352.25 Italian lire, up from 1,319.25; 1.1442 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1438.
In precious metals trading, silver, as well as gold, rose yesterday, but not so sharply as some analysts had expected.
"The dollar in a way has usurped the safe haven status of gold," said Warren Myers, a vice president with Merrill Lynch & Company. "The dollar is the prime beneficiary of what has happened in the Soviet Union."
Earlier in London, gold rose to a late bid price of $360.50 a troy ounce, from $358.25 bid for an ounce late Friday, and to $360.70 an ounce in Zurich, up from $357.75 late Friday.
In Hong Kong, gold rose $4.95 to close at $363.33 an ounce.
Silver for August delivery rose 0.10 cents an ounce, to $3.986 on New York's Comex. Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $4.05 a troy ounce, up from Friday's $4.01.

2 Retailers Post Profits For Quarter

 BODY:
The K Mart Corporation said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings increased by 10 percent. But profits of another big retailer, Toys "R" Us Inc., slid 11.7 percent. Following are details of the companies' results: 1
 
K Mart
K Mart said profit rose to $162.8 million, from $148 million in last year's period. Earnings per share were 81 cents, compared with 74 cents last year. 
 Second-quarter sales rose 8 percent, to $8.49 billion, compared with $7.88 billion a year ago.
Edward A. Weller, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said K Mart's results, which were at the high end of analysts' expectations, demonstrated the "benefits of selling goods early in the season at full margin."
He said the huge retailer also benefited from better-looking in-store displays and the improved overall appearance of its stores. With some K Mart stores more 20 years old, the company is in the middle of a $2.3 billion, five-year refurbishing program.
In a statement, Joseph E. Antonini, K Mart's chairman and chief executive, said K Mart was "poised to benefit significantly from an acceleration in the pace of sales" because of a cost-cutting program and a recent move to improve its line of merchandise.
In yesterday's bear market, K Mart shares closed at $42.125, down $1.50, in trading on the New York Stock exchange.
 
Toys 'R' Us
By The Associated Press
The nation's largest specialty toy retailer said its earnings in the quarter ended Aug. 3 fell to $23.4 million, or 8 cents a share, from $26.5 million, or 9 cents a share, for the correspoinding period in 1990.
Overall sales increased 9.5 percent, to $1.06 billion, compared with sales of $964 million a year earlier. But sales at the company's established stores -- those open at least a year -- decreased 2.6 percent. Sales from older stores are considered the more accurate barometer of a retailer's business.
Toys "R" Us, once seen as a "recession proof" company, has found that cautious consumers have curtailed spending on toys and other items for their children. The company said, however, that its second-quarter sales improved as the quarter progressed, with July the strongest month.
Toys "R" Us operates 457 toy stores in the United States, 97 international stores and 189 Kids "R" Us children's clothing stores.
In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Toys "R" Us shares fell 75 cents to close at $31.125.

HEADLINE: MOSCOW AND THE MARKETS;
Oil Up $1.17 on Concern Over Coup

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The price of oil jumped on world markets yesterday as traders worried that the coup in the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer, would disrupt that nation's exports.
In New York, oil closed up $1.17 a barrel, after trading as high as $1.80 above the Friday close. 
 The countries that would feel a disruption first are in Europe, which is the market for almost all of the 2.2 million barrels that the Soviet Union exports each day. But eventually, all importing countries would feel the disruption, as the Europeans turned to other sources.
The United States, which imports very little oil from the Soviet Union, would nonetheless be affected, because Europeans would probably seek heating oil and diesel fuel on the American market, which would drive up prices in this country.
 
Soviets Need Hard Currency
 Oil is the Soviet export commodity of greatest interest to the West. And no matter who is in charge in that country, experts said, maintaining oil exports will be the leadership's top priority to help insure a supply of hard currency. But a disruption of exports seems possible: 90 percent of the country's oil resources lie in the Russian Republic, and the oil workers have been very supportive of the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, who is calling for a general strike.
Even before the coup, Soviet oil exports had been declining because of the nation's domestic turmoil.
"Soviet oil has always been a wild card," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "Now," he said, "it's more of a wild card."
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for September delivery closed at $22.47, after peaking at $23.10 a barrel near the opening and sinking briefly in midafternoon to $22.15. Thomas P. Blakeslee, an analyst at the Pegasus Econometric Group of Hoboken, N.J., said the market was calmed somewhat by the appearance on television of the new Soviet leader, Gennadi I. Yanayev.
But the market's movement yesterday provided little clue about the direction of oil prices in coming weeks. Mr. Blakeslee noted that when Iran invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 last year, the market jumped immediately but did not peak until Oct. 10, nearly 11 weeks later.
 
The Wrong Time of the Year'
 The coup in the Soviet Union comes as Western companies are beginning to build stocks for winter, a high-demand period, said Larry J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "We're going into the wrong time of year," he said. With uncertainty about oil production, he said, those companies may seek higher inventories, driving up demand and therefore price.
Also vulnerable are supplies of natural gas to Western Europe. On an energy basis, the Soviets' natural gas exports are nearly as large as its oil exports. And while an oil buyer can always purchase a tanker load from a different source, coping with a gas pipeline that stops flowing is often much harder. Some of it could be replaced with oil, which would further increase demand for scarce supplies.
Stated on an oil-equivalent basis, Germany imports 400,000 barrels' worth of natural gas a day from the Soviet Union, and France imports another 200,000 barrels' worth, according to the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based consulting firm. Turkey and Italy, combined, take in another 460,000 barrels' worth of gas, the firm said.
Soviet oil exports had been falling sharply in recent years. Mr. Lichtblau said exports this year had been expected to run about 2.2 million barrels a day, down from 3.2 million barrels a day last year.
The coup against Mikhail S. Gorbachev came a day before the scheduled signing of a new "all Union" treaty that, among other provisions, would have given the Russian Republic managerial control over its oil resources, with revenues to be shared with the central Government. Many experts said they thought the timing of the coup was determined by the treaty.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
In a Brooklyn Haven, Fear for the Homeland

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Soviet emigres in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn reacted yesterday with shock, anger and sadness to the news that the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, had been deposed in a coup.
"If the K.G.B. takes over, it's like fascism," said Nina Koganovsky, who owns the Cafe Zodiac on Brighton Beach Avenue and who came to the United States from the Ukraine 10 years ago. "Gorbachev brought a better life for people, but he couldn't change the Soviet Union. The Russian people don't understand freedom." 
 Leo Blinder, the manager of Odessa, another popular restaurant and nightclub in the area, said: "It's a total shock. It's like snow on a sunny day."
Throughout Brighton Beach, the home to about 25,000 Soviet-born residents who make up perhaps the largest emigre community in the United States, people gathered at newsstands and in restaurants to discuss the latest news bulletins from Moscow and share their fears about the safety of relatives and friends in the Soviet Union.
"I have cousins and sisters in Russia," said Tsila Polevetsky, who left the Soviet Union for Israel in 1973 and moved to New York in 1982. Like many in Brighton Beach, she had tried to call her family in the Soviet Union yesterday, only to have operators say that there would be no open telephone lines for the indefinite future.
Among emigres there was particular fear that Soviet Jews would be most vulnerable after the coup.
"Jews, entrepreneurs and liberals will be persecuted first," said Felix Andreev, a former critic for Soviet Screen who emigrated last year and now hosts a twice-a-week Russian-language radio show on WKRB-FM in Brooklyn. "But Jews are always the first scapegoat. Any upheaval in Russian history, Jews are persecuted. It's a deeply anti-Semitic country, and the right-wingers now accuse them of everything that's wrong with Russia."
 
Doubts Are Realized
 Yelena Arutinyan, who left the Soviet Union in 1979 and whose father still lives in Odessa, said: "The K.G.B. are like animals. They're worse than Hitler."
"Gorbachev did good things for me," she added. "Before him, I couldn't see my family. But he let people visit relatives in the U.S. and in Israel."
Indeed, many emigres who came to this south Brooklyn waterfront section during the 1970's and 80's praised Mr. Gorbachev's reforms. But they also said they had doubted that democracy could become permanent in their former homeland.
"I was expecting it because of events in the last year," said Samuel Zeritsky, who left the Soviet Union 13 years ago.
Mr. Andreev agreed. "This coup was inevitable, because you can't reconcile fire and ice," he said. "Ice is communism and fire is democracy, and they're incompatible."
"Gorbachev represented a new trend compared with Andropov or Brezhnev," he added. "He was someone with a human face, who could kiss an American child. But all his attempts at reform were futile. He didn't believe he would succeed either."
Vladimir Sukhoi, the chief New York correspondent for the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda, said Mr. Gorbachev's undoing might have been of his own making. "Maybe Gorbachev wasn't decisive enough in making policy. He tried to be between left and right; that's his tragedy as a politician."
Mr. Sukhoi said yesterday morning that he had heard that Pravda was among only a handful of Soviet publications that had not been suspended.
Few emigres held out hope that Mr. Gorbachev would return to power. Most offered grim predictions.
"I think blood will be shed," said Michael Weinstein, the owner of the Soft Line art gallery. "If people follow Yeltsin's call for a general strike, it will further paralyze a weak and unstable economy. And the new government, who are outlaws, will force people back to work. These events will test how six years of perestroika have affected people's minds in Russia."

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS: THE WESTERN ALLIANCE;
Condemnation And a Halt to Aid

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Amid strong condemnations of the overthrow of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Western governments demanded today that the new Soviet leadership maintain the ousted leader's reform program and honor Moscow's international commitments.
The English-speaking allies -- the United States, Britain and Canada -- announced the freezing of economic assistance to the Soviet Union, and European Community foreign ministers scheduled a meeting on Tuesday to discuss a suspension of the Community's $1.5 billion aid program. French and British officials said a summit of Community leaders may also be called to discuss the crisis. 
 Some Western European leaders adopted something of a wait-and-see attitude. "We will know very soon," France's President, Francois Mitterrand, said of the new leadership's direction.
Mr. Mitterrand, who said the first phase of the coup in Moscow had clearly succeeded, was among several Western leaders to receive a personal letter from the new Soviet leader, Gennadi I. Yanayev, in which he pledged that Mr. Gorbachev's program of reforms would continue.
Mr. Mitterrand and Prime Minister John Major of Britain conferred by telephone, and both leaders also spoke during the day with President Bush, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands, the country that currently holds the rotating presidency of the 12-nation European Community.
After an urgent meeting of NATO ambassadors today, it was disclosed that foreign ministers of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization would probably meet in Brussels later this week to analyze whether the coup in Moscow could signal a resumption of the cold war.
Canada, a NATO member, announced that it was freezing a $131 million program of food aid to the Soviet Union. "We have a Government there that we do not recognize," said Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. "Until that is resolved everything is suspended."
Britain announced suspension of an $80 million technical assistance program with Moscow.
Denouncing the "hard-line and reactionary coup," Mr. Major said the Soviet Union's future depends on continuing reforms. "It is in their interests to have reform and it is in the West's interest to see reforms," he said. "But the omens at the moment are not propitious."
In a television interview, Mr. Mitterrand said the Moscow coup could rapidly become "a cold war act" if the new leadership were to reverse the reform process.
Holding up what he described as "a rather astonishing letter" he had received from Mr. Yanayev, the French leader quoted it as saying: "Reforms will continue. Our choice is made. We will stick to democracy, glasnost. We will strive to build up the economy, including private enterprise. We shall continue the policy to guarantee civil rights and freedoms."
Earlier, Mr. Mitterrand issued a statement demanding that Moscow guarantee the "life and liberty" of both Mr. Gorbachev and of the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin. He noted that Mr. Yanayev had assured him in his letter that Mr. Gorbachev is "in perfect safety and nothing threatens him."
The Secretary General of the United Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar, said he was ready to cut short his vacation in Portugal. He expressed hope that Moscow would respect the sovereignty and independence of the countries of Eastern Europe.
Condemnation of the coup also came from Italy, Spain, Belgium, Turkey, Finland, Denmark and Greece.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
Excerpts From Soviet News Session: 'What Is He Sick With?'

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the news conference held today by Acting President Gennadi I. Yanayev and four other members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency, as translated by Soviet Foreign Ministry interpreters:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
 MODERATOR: Welcome to this press conference by the acting U.S.S.R. President, Mr. Gennadi Yanayev. Also present are Mr. Oleg Baklanov, who is deputy chairman of the Defense Council under the U.S.S.R. president. Next is Mr. Boris Pugo, the Minister of the Interior. Mr. Vasily Starodubtsev, chairman of the U.S.S.R. Peasants Union. And finally, Mr. Aleksandr Tizyakov, president of the Association of Transport and Communications Enterprises of the U.S.S.R. 
 I recognize Mr. Gennadi Yanayev.
 
YANAYEV'S STATEMENT
 Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, comrades, as I am sure you know from the media reports, due to the inability to continue in office, and under article 127.7 of the U.S.S.R. Constitution, of the U.S.S.R. president, the Vice President has taken office of the U.S.S.R. president.
I'm addressing you, Mister -- you, ladies and gentlemen, at a crucial moment for the Soviet Union and for the entire international community who took a path and have gone a long way toward reform, and now the Soviet Union has faced a deep crisis which can call into question further reform and bring major upheavals in the international scene.
It is no secret to anyone that a drastic drop in production, which is not being compensated by alternative economic structures, posing a real threat to further development and survival of the U.S.S.R. nations. The situation has gone out of control in the U.S.S.R. and we are facing a situation of multi-rule.
This is a cause of popular discontent. We're also facing a threat of disintegration, a breakup of a single economic space, a single space of civil liberties, single defense, and a single foreign policy.
And normal life under these circumstances is impossible. In many regions of the U.S.S.R., due to interethnic rivalry, there is bloodshed, and the breakup of the Soviet Union would entail the gravest internal and international repercussions.
Under the circumstances, we have no other alternative but to take resolute action in order to stop the country from sliding down to a disaster.
As I am sure you know, in order to provide an effective government under the state of emergency, it has been decided to set up a State Committee for the State of Emergency in the U.S.S.R., which will consist of Mr. Baklanov, first deputy chairman of the Defense Council; Mr. Kryuchkov, Chairman of the K.G.B.; Mr. Pavlov, Soviet Prime Minister; Mr. Pugo, who is Minister of the Interior; Mr. Starodubtsev, chairman of the U.S.S.R. Peasants Council; Mr. Tizyakov, president of the Transport and Communications Association; Mr. Yazov, Soviet Defense Minister; and Gennadi Yanayev, Acting President of the U.S.S.R.
Today I would like to say the following. The State Committee on the State of Emergency in the U.S.S.R. is well aware of the gravest crisis which we're going through, and it is determined to take full responsibility and to adopt urgent measures to get the country out of the crisis. We pledge to insure a nationwide discussion of the draft union treaty, and every citizen of the U.S.S.R. will have the opportunity to assess this document at his leisure and make a decision that will shape the future of our multinational homeland.
 
Law and Order
 We are determined without further delay to restore law and order, stop the bloodshed, and to wage relentless war on the criminal underworld and to root out this social scourge. We will rid our cities of crime and will prevent further pilfering.
We stand for genuine democratic reforms, for a consistent reform policy toward a social renewal and economic prosperity which will enable our country to adopt the place it deserves in the world community of nations.
But the development of the country must not be built on falling living standards. Without departing from the human-rights principles, we will emphasize the protection of rights of those individuals who are most at disadvantage and suffer most from inflation, economic disintegration, crime and corruption. We will develop an economic diversification, we will uphold free enterprise and create all the conditions for the development of production and the services sector. Our top priority is food and housing.
We will mobilize all the forces to meet these most urgent needs of the people. We call on the peasants, the workers and the working intelligentsia -- in other words, all Soviet people, to re-establish labor discipline and to uphold production in order to continue forward. On this will depend the future of our children and grandchildren and the future of our homeland.
We are a peaceful nation and we will strictly adhere to the obligations we have assumed. We have no claims on anyone at all. We want to live in peace and harmony with everyone, but we state that nobody, but nobody, can infringe on our sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and any attempt to dictate terms to our country, whoever they come from, will be stopped.
Our multinational country has lived for generations in pride for its homeland. We have never been ashamed of our patriotic feelings, and we think it justified that the younger generation be raised in that spirit.
To do nothing at this crucial period means to take a grave responsibility for tragic, really unpredictable circumstances. Anyone who wants live and work in peace, who does not accept the bloodshed, who wants to see his homeland in prosperity must take the only right choice. We call on all genuine patriots, all people of good will to put an end to this turbulent time. We call on all the citizens of U.S.S.R. to fulfill their responsibility and to provide the necessary support to the State Emergency Committee to get the country out of the crisis.
All constructive proposals from individuals and work collectives will be considered with gratitude as their manifestation of patriotism and a desire to re-establish multinational friendship for the revival of our homeland. I thank you.
Yes, please. Ladies first.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Where is Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev? What is he sick with? Specifically, concretely, what disease does he have? And against whom are the tanks that we see on the streets of Moscow today directed? What is the purpose of those tanks today on the streets?
A. Let me say that Mikhail Gorbachev is now on vacation. He's undergoing treatment in the south of our country. He is very tired after these many years and he will need some time to get better, and it is our hope -- it is our hope that Mikhail Gorbachev, as soon as he feels better, will take up again his office.
At any rate the policy that was initiated back in 1985 by Mikhail Gorbachev will be continued by all those present here. So far as the state of emergency is concerned, quite naturally the state of emergency is introduced, as I have already stated, at a very difficult and crucial time in our history and in order to rule out any dangers and menaces we had to take certain steps to insure security.
 
Economic Program
 Q. I have two questions. Perestroika has not brought any tangible results, among other things because there was no clear-cut tactics or strategy of implementation of the policy of perestroika. Do you have a specific program for improving our economy? Will existing laws still remain in effect? Will you still continue the movement toward a market economy?
Now my second question. The Russian Information Agency has transmitted an address by Yeltsin [inaudible] Russian Federation, where what happened last night was described as a right-wing anti-constitutional coup d'etat.
What do you think about this? And secondly, the same address also contained an appeal to a general strike. I think that such an appeal can have tragic consequences.
Do you think that the, your committee will take any specific action against that?
A. Let me start by answering your second question, and I'll ask Comrade Tizyakov to answer your first point.
TIZYAKOV: It is true that perestroika, that what was initiated back in 1985, did not bring the results which we all expected from it.
Our economy today is undergoing a very difficult time. There is a drop in the rate of production, and thus as a result of a convergence of a number of factors, including the fact that, of -- it was for the first time that we were undertaking perestroika at such a scale. We were looking for ways and means of achieving that, and as we search for such ways and means of course there may be errors and mistakes.
Now where do we move on from here? The situation that has developed was the reason why the state of emergency was introduced.
You know that the system of horizontal communications, and ties and relations among various enterprises have collapsed.
Many of those present here know that at the end of December 1990, a meeting of the directors of enterprises was held in Moscow which addressed relations among enterprises in various regions of this country.
We discussed this problem at great length and in January 1991 we had 85 percent of the contracts already concluded, and we thought that this provided a good foundation. However, later on, as a result of the parade of authorities, many borders and frontiers were blocked, including the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltics and other republics, which brought about a very difficult situation for our enterprises. There was a slowdown in the rate of production. There was a lot of uncertainty. And it has brought its results.
Now, what we are going to do is this. We will try to stabilize the economy of this country, and naturally the policy of the reforms toward a market economy will not be reversed. We think this is the right and wise policy, except that we will have to make some more thinking about that and to be more organized.
YANAYEV: And now let me take up your second point. It is true that today, when our people were informed about the establishment of the emergency committee, other members of the committee and myself had a contact with the leaders of the nine republics which had stated their readiness and willingness to become part of the new union. We got in touch with leaders of many regions and districts in this country. And I can say that on the whole the establishment of the committee and the efforts by this committee to lead this country out of the crisis were appreciated and supported.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Acting Leader's Health
 Q. I have two questions for Mr. Yanayev. The first question is this. Could you tell us how you feel today? Do you feel healthy?
And, secondly, under your Constitution the state of emergency can only be introduced by the president of the country or by the presidium of the Supreme Soviet, provided that the republics agree. Who took this decision? And there is no provision in the Constitution for the establishment of a national salvation committee, or a committee for the state of emergency. Are you going to convene a Supreme Soviet meeting any time soon?
A. With regard to the state of my health, I think I feel fit and I'm quite capable of working long hours, up to 16 hours a day. So, as you can see, I am alive and kicking, and I look fit, although we had a sleepless night.
Now, with regard to the state of emergency. We were guided by the principle that sometimes there are critical situations which call for immediate action, and it is our intention to ask the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. to reaffirm the state of emergency, and that will happen on the 27th of August. The meeting of the Supreme Soviet will be convened on the 27th of August.
 
Food Shortage Problem
 Q. I have a question for Mr. Yanayev. The emergency committee in its address to the nation has stated that as a first priority it will take care of the interests of the widest -- of the population of this country. It will try to address the food problem. Do you have any specific measures in mind to do that? And what are your resources?
A. This is a very good question, it's a very interesting question. The first priority step that we will take is do all we can to salvage the crops that have been brought in. I think tomorrow we will adopt a document that will provide for emergency actions and measures to salvage whatever crops have been brought in. Secondly, we will try to use the whole potential of this country to make up an inventory of everything that we have in this country.
In our statement, we said that as soon as we have set up an inventory, we will tell our people what we have, what our resources are, including the material resources that we can put at our disposal to get the housing problem moving.
Over the past three years, we did a bad job in terms of housing construction, and many people who were standing in line for new housing and expected us to fulfill the housing problem that at the very beginning of perestroika we proclaimed back in 1985 -- unfortunately, we could not meet their expectations. And therefore I believe that we are faced with three tasks now: food, housing, and transportation and energy. Because winter is approaching, the energy situation is very, very difficult, and we have to take extraordinary measures to make sure that the country does not face an energy crisis during the wintertime.
 
Fate of the Press
 Q. [inaudible] were closed. For how long is my question, and when will they be reopened?
A. Thank you. I think if we introduce a state of emergency we will have to make a provision for re-registering the mass media. We are not closing down newspapers, we are just thinking in terms of having them re-registered, reincorporated -- because the country is facing a crisis and many mass media have played a certain role in this. . . .
 
U.N. Reaction
 Q. A question to Mr. Yanayev. What is the reaction that you have received to your address to the United Nations Secretary General and the world leaders?
A. They have studied very carefully reactions from the world leaders, and I must say that their reaction has been rather low key because the situation is still unfolding and it is still too early to take a stand. I am familiar with President Bush's latest statement in which he expresses the hope that the foreign policy commitments that the Soviet Union has assumed will be fulfilled. I believe I mentioned that earlier in my statement, and this was confirmed just after the state of emergency committee was set up.
 
Comparison of Coups
 Q. Are you aware that you committed a military coup this past night, and which is a more fair comparison, with 1917 or '64? And a second question, about newspaper registration. How long will it take and what will be the criteria? Who will be in charge? And will a political censorship be reintroduced in the newspapers?
YANAYEV: We will try to expedite the newspaper re-registration process. I do not want to comment on the criteria of registration. As for your statement that tonight there was a -- there was a military coup, I beg to disagree, because we are basing ourselves on the constitutional provisions, and the endorsement of our decision by the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet will enable us to say that all the constitutional norms have been observed. I think any analogy, including a comparison to 1917 or '64 are, are simply dangerous.
 
Consulting Gorbachev
 Q. It's again on Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev. Did you discuss with the President your takeover before doing it? Did he agree? Why is there no medical bulletin on his health?
And the second question is, given the wording of your, of your communique, did you ask for any suggestion or any advice through General Pinochet?
A. I believe that in due course, the medical bulletin on the President's state of health will be issued. As for your statement that we have snatched the power, ousted President Gorbachev from office -- President Gorbachev is temporarily incapacitated, and is unable to continue in office, and given that, the Vice President of the Supreme Soviet takes over.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Reaction in the Republics
 Q. Two questions to Mr. Yanayev. Question one. You said you consulted presidents of the constituent republics. How do you visualize the reaction of those republics who do not belong to the nine-plus-one, and do you have a contingency plan toward putting an end to interethnic rivalry. And what is it?
A. Yes, we do have a plan to bring down the tension in interethnic relations. We have specific provisions to settle the differences between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and we have specific proposals on settling other regional issues and those are the most important challenges facing the country and the country's leadership, and the leaders of the state of emergency committee must get down to business without any further delay.
As for your first question I'm afraid I, I forgot that.
Q. You said you consulted the constituent republics. How do you visualize the further development of the situation there?
A. Yes, we spoke with most of the republican leaders. I met with leaders from the 15 Russian autonomies, and I must say that we have the support from the autonomies and from the overwhelming majority of the constituent republics. They support our intention to save the country and to put our house in order.
 
Producing Gorbachev
 Q. Novosti Television. Mr. Yanayev, could you spell it out for us -- when you say in certain territories, what do you mean? And what is their geographic location? And when can we meet President Gorbachev?
A. As soon as he feels well enough, President Gorbachev is sure to meet journalists.
As for the state of emergency, I assume that there is no need to introduce the state of emergency throughout the country. Everywhere in the country there are regions where the state of emergency must be imposed to resolve the problems. In countries -- republics -- like Uzbekistan or Kazakhstan, there's no need to impose a state of emergency there. I'm afraid I cannot give you the specifics, but Moscow is definitely a state of emergency territory, and as of today the state of emergency will be introduced in Moscow.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Moving Against Yeltsin
 Q. Mr. Yanayev, you used to be a trade-union leader, and a very successful one at that. My question is: Are you prepared to adopt some constitutional legitimate steps against Yeltsin's decree, which is directed not only against the party cells but against the trade-union organization?
And a question to Mr. Pugo. Your ministry is in pretty bad shape, including financially. And all the links with the republics, with the Baltic republics, have been disrupted, and the Ministry of Interior branches have fallen into the hands of separatists. What are the steps you are going to adopt in order to centralize the law-enforcement system?
YANAYEV: I think that all the decrees and all the decisions that will be taken will be considered from the viewpoint of the state of emergency that we are introducing in this country. However, let me avail myself of this opportunity to emphasize that what the leaders of the Russian federation are doing now, setting out barricades, calling for civil disobedience, is a very irresponsible and dangerous policy.
I think this policy is fraught with the potential of an armed provocation in order to lay the blame for whatever catastrophe may happen on the leaders of the emergency committee. We want to issue a stern warning against that. We want to tell all the Soviet people, particularly the Muscovites, so that they know that there is a state of emergency in Moscow, and we hope that law and order will be insured.
PUGO: . . .
Let me simply say that we have regular meetings with Ministers for the Interior of the federal republics, and at all the meetings that we have had we met with all the ministers, including the Baltics, and the Transcaucasian republics and Central Asia -- I mean, all 15 republics were represented.
 
Gorbachev's Fate
 Q. Can you provide a guarantee or can you give us your word of honor in front of members of the mass media that Mikhail Gorbachev will continue feeling better?
YANAYEV: Let me tell you that nothing threatens Mr. Gorbachev. He is in a safe place. He needs some time to feel better.
Ladies and gentlemen, you can imagine the stress that he has had to endure over the past six years. I hope that my friend President Gorbachev will return to his office and we will work together.
 
Union Treaty Vote
 Q. Regarding the Treaty of the Union, does this mean that there will be a referendum on the Treaty of the Union? And secondly, what does the committee think about the Baltic republics, Georgia and Armenia and Moldavia, who do not intend to sign the union treaty? And did Mikhail Gorbachev know that the state of emergency was being introduced and that the committee was being established?
A. With regard to the establishment of the committee, the committee, as some of you have already said, was established last night, and I think that President Gorbachev understands and will understand this. He will appreciate that at a time where the country is undergoing a crisis, we will have to find effective ways and means of leading the country out of the crisis.
So far as our attitude to the Baltic republics, Moldavia, Georgia and Armenia, is concerned, namely, the republics that have made known their intention not to sign the Treaty of the Union, our attitude remains unchanged. President Gorbachev made it known on a number of occasions, we will respect the will of the people of those republics.
I think we will find a way to gauge the feelings of our people with regard to the union treaty. I do not know whether this will be a referendum or whatever, but we will try to make sure that the union treaty, on which the future development of this country will depend, is discussed and adopted by the public at large.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Defining Interim Rule
 Q. Mexican Television. How interim is your government? Just how interim is it? And will there be a presidential election?
A. I have assumed the office of president on an interim basis, on a provisional basis, as I have already said, and I believe that as the situation improves, we will hold direct elections of the president of the U.S.S.R. based on the democratic principles that we have always announced.

HEADLINE: Weather Stalls Hartford Budget Plan

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 19

 BODY:
State lawmakers had set aside today for one more hard push to pass a budget for the fiscal year that began seven weeks ago, but, like so many other budget plans, this one was derailed -- this time because the weather was so threatening that legislators were told to stay home.
But there was renewed hope that a budget compromise was perhaps within reach in the State Senate, which has been the main bulwark of opposition to the income tax and revenue overhaul plan being pushed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. 
 Mr. Weicker, who represents a third party that has no members in the legislature, has vetoed three budgets that lacked the income tax, and the Senate has blocked every option that contains such a tax.
 
An Executive Order
 Mr. Weicker, who said last week that he would veto any further attempts to continue running the state with temporary two-week budgets and who briefly shut down many state agencies last month, also issued an executive order today saying services would be maintained even though the last temporary budget expired this morning just after midnight.
The new executive order contained no expiration date, but Governor Weicker's press secretary, Avice A. Meehan, said the order was issued in the belief that progress was being made on the budget.
Connecticut is one of only 10 states that do not tax wages, and Mr. Weicker has argued that one is now necessary to allow other cuts in business taxes to stimulate the state's floundering economy.
Opponents say opening the door on the long-avoided income tax would release a flood of new revenue and break the restrictions that have restrained state spending.
The chief of staff for the Democratic majority in the State Senate, David J. McQuade, said that a Senate session was scheduled for 1 P.M. on Tuesday and that discussions today -- by telephone and in person among those senators who were actually in the building -- centered on a plan for a flat income tax with a rate set between 4 percent and 5 percent. The sales tax would be reduced from the current 8 percent rate to between 6 percent and 6.5 percent.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
Bush Condemns Soviet Coup And Calls For Its Reversal

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 19

 BODY:
In a sharp condemnation of the coup that overthrew President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President Bush made a blunt demand today for Mr. Gorbachev's restoration to power and said the United States did not accept the legitimacy of the self-proclaimed new Soviet Government.
Back at the White House after rushing from his vacation home here, Mr. Bush issued a strongly worded statement that followed a day of consultations with other leaders of the Western alliance and a concerted effort to squeeze the new Soviet leadership by freezing economic aid programs. He decried the coup as a "misguided and illegitimate effort" that "bypasses both Soviet law and the will of the Soviet peoples." 
 The Bush statement, drafted after an afternoon of meetings with top aides at the White House, was much more forceful than the President's initial reaction this morning in Maine. It was in keeping with a unified Western effort to apply both diplomatic and economic pressure to the group of Soviet officials seeking to gain control of the Kremlin and the country.
 
Britain Freezes Aid
 In London, the British Government announced that it had frozen $80 million in economic aid to Moscow, and the European Community scheduled an emergency meeting for Tuesday in which it was expected to suspend a $1.5 billion aid program.
President Bush decided to send Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to a meeting in Brussels of the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to discuss the crisis in the Soviet Union.
News of President Bush's decision was first disclosed tonight by ABC News, which said the meeting would be held on Tuesday. A State Department official said, however, that plans were being made for such a meeting on Thursday.
Holding to a dwindling hope that the coup might still fail, Mr. Bush outlined a series of tough positions that would guide American policy toward the Soviet Union during this latest crisis. It dennounced the use of military force in the Baltics and demanded that the Soviet Union respect all of its international treaties and commitments, including the Helsinki guarantees of free speech and other human rights.
"We believe the policies of reform in the Soviet Union must continue, including democratization, the process of peaceful reconciliation between Moscow and the republics, and economic transformation," Mr. Bush said in a written statement that marked a deliberate escalation in the tone of his comments after an initially restrained response.
"We support all constitutionally elected leaders and oppose the use of force or intimidation to suppress them or restrict their right to free speech," Mr. Bush said.
 
Contact With Leaders
 In addition to telephoning his Western allies to coordinate his response to the coup, the White House said Mr. Bush also spoke today with leaders of Eastern Europe and stressed that the changes that had taken place in their countries -- democratic reform and separation from the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact -- were irreversible.
Moving to align the United States with the most visible voice of resistance to the newly imposed leadership -- Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian federation -- Mr. Bush said, "We support President Yeltsin's call for restoration of the legally elected organs of power and the reaffirmation of the post of U.S.S.R. President M. S. Gorbachev."
James Collins, the senior American diplomat in Moscow, met with Mr. Yeltsin today while Mr. Bush pondered whether he should contact the Russian president himself.
"We will avoid in every possible way actions that will lend legimitacy or support to this coup effort," Mr. Bush said.
 
Change in Policy
 With these words, Mr. Bush, who has taken pains to keep out of Soviet internal affairs during the period in which he has tightened his political bonds with Mr. Gorbachev, marked a significant change in American policy toward the Soviet leadership.
Since Washington recognized the Communist Government of the Soviet Union in 1933, the United States has never tried, even through indirect political pressure, to reverse a change of leadership in that country.
The only contact between the United States and the eight-man committee that ousted Mr. Gorbachev, the White House said, came when the Soviet Ambassador in Washington, Viktor Komplektov, met with the Deputy Secretary of State, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, and Robert M. Gates, the deputy national security adviser.
Mr. Komplektov gave Mr. Gates a letter for Mr. Bush from Vice President Gennadi I. Yanayev of the Soviet Union, who has been proclaimed the new president. Administration officials said the letter, like others received by Western leaders today, contained assurances that Mr. Yanayev would continue Mr. Gorbachev's policies. But American officials said the Bush Administration discounted those assurances.
Although the United States's economic ties to the Soviet Union largely involve grain sales and technical assistance programs, other Western countries today moved to freeze billions of dollars in financial assistance.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, which has become the Soviet Union's largest donor of financial aid, having given tens of billions of dollars, said it was too early to decide about halting those programs. But he warned that Western aid to the Soviet Union would end if the new Government abandoned reform or violated human rights.
Because the Kremlin upheaval threatened to stall, if not reverse, the improvement in Soviet-American relations that had evolved under Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Bush's first response today was restrained.
"I've said over and over again that we did not want to see a coup backed by the K.G.B. and the military, and apparently that is what is under way," Mr. Bush said at his vacation home here three weeks after he met with Mr. Gorbachev in Moscow.
Trying to mitigate the potentially explosive nature of the stunning developments in Moscow, Mr. Bush said: "We're not going to over-excite the American people or the world. And so we will conduct our diplomacy in a prudent fashion, not driven by excess, not driven by extreme."
 
Evident Alarm
 But even before Mr. Bush stepped up the tone of his comments with this evening's written statement, the alarm of the President and his aides was evident. Mr. Bush, who values his vacation time, flew back to Washington from Maine as a hurricane lashed the Atlantic coast and he summoned Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d from their Western vacations.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bush planned to swear in his new Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Robert S. Strauss. But the Administration has yet to face the decision of whether to send him to Moscow in light of Mr. Bush's determination not to legitimize the group that deposed Mr. Gorbachev.
Mr. Bush offered words of praise for Mr. Gorbachev, calling him "an historic figure," and said "the world would be sighing with relief" if he were back in power, but he also said, "We have other democratic forces out there now and we want to give them the kind of support we can without being counterproductive."
Mr. Bush called the change in power "disturbing" and "extra-constitutional" and described the eight-man committee that replaced Mr. Gorbachev as a "very hard-line group."
Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said later that the United States assigned little credence to assurances by Mr. Yanayev that the shift of power "was not a reversal." He added, "It can only be, I think, for the purpose of setting back reform."
Mr. Scowcroft said there was evidence of haste in the way the coup was carried out. "It's interesting to note that in ordinary coups the tanks move about the time an announcement is made," he said. "The tanks didn't move for a number of hours afterwards, which indicates that that they had not completed their preparations before they did that."
 
Question of Treaties
 Mr. Bush and his aides were particularly careful to say that there was no indication of a threat to the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal or any suggestion of Soviet military activity outside the country's borders. The President also said that he expected Moscow would adhere to the terms of the treaty reducing long-range nuclear arms that he signed with Mr. Gorbachev last month, although American officials have said they believe there was resistance to the treaty within the Soviet military.
"These treaties are in the interest of the United States, clearly, and they have said that all treaties will be abided by," Mr. Bush said. "We don't want to go back to the cold war days, and we're not going to do that."

HEADLINE: Fatal Crash Starts Melee With Police In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON

 BODY:
A 7-year-old boy was struck and killed and his cousin was injured when a car jumped a sidewalk in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn last night and pinned them against a window grate, the police said.
More than 100 police officers, some in riot helmets, surrounded the accident scene as more than 250 neighborhood residents, mostly black teen-agers shouting "Jews! Jews! Jews!" jeered the driver of the car, a Hasidic man, and then turned their anger on the police. 
 Some youths threw bottles and set a Yeshiva van on fire, the police said. A 17-year-old fired a gun at a police officer, without hitting him, and another youth drove his car at a group of officers but did not injure them, the police said. Both youths were arrrested.
 
Barricades Set Up
 The police set up barricades at several nearby intersections as youths continued to roam the neighborhood. At 11:30 P.M., three blocks from the accident, a group of youths stopped a car and stabbed the driver, another Hasidic man, the police said.
Witnesses said the youths confronted the man at the corner of President Street and Brooklyn Avenue. When he jumped from his car, he was stabbed in the left side and left bleeding on the hood of his car.
The police arrested one of the youths as they fled. The victim, a yeshiva student from Australia, was in stable but critical condition at Kings County Hospital.
The fatal accident occurred at 8:20 P.M. as the car, carrying three Lubavitch Hasidic men, swerved to avoid another car at the intersection of President Street and Utica Avenue, said Sgt. Edward Burns, a police spokesman.
 
Driver Questioned
 The car, a dark blue station wagon, ran up on the sidewalk in front of 1681 President Street and pinned the two children against an iron grate covering the window of a first floor apartment in the four-story brick building.
One child, Gavin Cato, was pronounced dead at the scene. The other, Angela Cato, also 7, was in serious condition at Kings County Hospital.
Mayor David N. Dinkins visited the girl in the hospital shortly after midnight.
"No words and no deeds can bring Gavin back to us," the Mayor said at the hospital. "There has been the loss of one life and the injury of two others. There should be no more hurt."
Sergeant Burns said that the driver and two passengers were treated at the 71st Precinct, where they were questioned about the accident.
 
Rumors Abound
 At the scene, descriptions of the accident swept through the crowd. Some youths in the crowd said they had heard from other youths that the three Hasidic men had received medical treatment before the two youths.
Bob Leonard, a spokesman for the Emergency Medical Service, said that the ambulance unit was on the scene in three minutes and that in a matter of two to three minutes more, the first child was on the way to the hospital.
"I'm not aware of us treating anyone other than the children," he said.
Rabbi Yehudah Krinsky, a spokesman for the Lubavitch community who did not witness the incident, said that he had been told that the driver and a passenger had been dragged from the station wagon and beaten by some of the angry youths.
However, Mr. Leonard said they had no report of anyone in the car being injured.
Sharon Bell, a 28-year-old neighborhood resident, said the trouble began when an ambulance came and the word spread about the three men in the car being attended to before the children.
She said that a police cruiser was escorting the car through the intersection when the light changed.
"The cop went through and the car followed, but another car came along and forced it up on the sidewalk," she said.
Crown Heights has a history of black-Hasidic tension. Some of the earliest anti-crime patrols of the Jewish Defense League started in the area, and in the 1970's a number of incidents of violence between the two groups flared up.
Although relations have been relatively quiet in the past decade, the tension has remained. In the summer of 1986, a Hasidic man was beaten unconsious by a group of black youths on a subway station and eventually died. In April 1987, 400 blacks marched through the area to protest what they said was harassment by a Hasidic surveillance patrol.
In March 1989, a crowd of Hasidic Jews surrounded and beat a black teen-ager who they said had slashed a Hasidic woman and her son.
This history of ill will was much on the minds of black Crown Heights residents last night as they milled about in front of their apartments.
"My husband is afraid to go down the street at night to get baby formula," said one woman. She said Hasidic patrols were "always questioning him about what he is doing on his own block. It's a shame, but it's true," she said.
Another black resident of President Street, Kobie Foster, said he resented the presence of Hasidic patrols on the block.
"We're not living in their neighborhood, they're living in our neighborhood," he said.
"It ain't about us getting together," Mr. Foster said. "It's about us being able to live together without killing each other."
As President Street grew quiet around midnight, a small crowd of about 40 blacks gathered nearby across the street from the Tomchy Yeshiva at 770 Kingston Avenue, the world headquarters of the Lubavitch sect.
About 50 Hasidic men stood in front of the yeshiva, with about 25 police standing in the street street between the two groups.
"I believe this is just a group of young people who for a number of reasons, whether it's the recession or the excitement of the summer heat, got together and turned to a bit of violence," said Joe Kopfer, a yeshiva student.
"I hope it's just a small group that will go away very quickly," he said.
Across the street, Arnold Jacobs, a black man, said, "The reason we're here is we want justice. They don't want to give it to us, so we're going to take it," he said.
As the standoff continued at the Tomchy Yeshiva, flames were suddenly visible a block away at Albany Avenue and Eastern Parkway where a yeshiva van had been set afire.
Witnesses told the police that a group of black youths was seen running from the van as it burst into flames.

A Jolt From Moscow
The world's financial markets reacted quickly and sharply to Gorbachev's ouster, with stock markets around the world falling as much as 9 percent. [Page D1.] U.S. stocks plummeted, with the Dow losing 69.99, to 2,898.03, its largest drop since the early days of the Kuwait crisis. Defying the trend were military equipment stocks and oil shares. [D7.] The dollar soared in wild trading, reflecting a surge in demand for a safe currency. The dollar's rise came despite heavy intervention by several central banks. [D16.]

HEADLINE: Species Loss: Crisis or False Alarm?

BYLINE: WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
RATS, weeds, cockroaches and other hardy, ubiquitous "tramp" species may never inherit the earth. But some scientists say they could make a run for global ascendancy if humans, as many biologists fear, precipitate a mass annihilation of less adaptable creatures.
In this scenario, the actions of an exploding human population are sundering the ecological webs that support life by setting off a worldwide wave of extinctions comparable to the one in which the dinosaurs perished some 65 million years ago. 
 But is the scenario accurate? A minority of dissenters says that while wild habitats are indeed disappearing because of human expansion, and species with them, the supposed magnitude and rate of the extinctions are unsubstantiated by hard evidence and have probably been exaggerated. In possibly overstating the risk, some critics say, conservationists may harm their own cause by setting themselves up for the charge of crying wolf.
The perceived threat to species diversity has prompted delegates from around the world to meet under United Nations auspices in Nairobi, Kenya, next month in the second of three negotiating conferences aimed at producing a treaty by next June.
Meanwhile, the argument over the seriousness of the threat has surfaced in the current issue of the journal Science. In one of six articles on biological diversity and extinction of species, two prominent biologists, Dr. Edward O. Wilson of Harvard University and Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich of Stanford University, assert that if tropical rain forests continue to be cut down at the present rate, a quarter or more of all the species on earth could be exterminated within 50 years. For the first time in geological history, they say, plant species are becoming extinct in large numbers.
The tropics, and most of all the rain forests, are the richest repositories of biological diversity on earth, and the two biologists point out that many tropical species exist only locally and are subject to immediate extinction with the clearing of a single tract. They say that while conservation efforts are needed, the only way to head off the crisis in the long run is to reduce the scale of human activities.
Since the Science article was prepared, Dr. Wilson said in an interview, he has further estimated that 50,000 species a year, or about six every hour, are being doomed to eventual extinction. The estimates are based on a mathematical model of the observed relationship between habitat area and number of species and on the observed disappearance of rain forests.
Coral reefs, dry tropical forests and other tropical habitats are also being destroyed. The resulting mass extinction, Dr. Wilson said, is likely to compare with the largest extinctions in geological history and to take place in a much shorter time: decades, perhaps, instead of centuries or millennia. "It is a genuine holocaust," he said.
"That sounds alarmist," Dr. Wilson conceded. "But I invite anyone to check through the figures."
The skeptics have not yet had a chance to examine Dr. Wilson's latest assessments in detail, but they have attacked earlier, similar assessments made by him and other scientists. The critics say there simply is not enough information on which to build a reliable assessment.
While species constitute a "valuable endowment" and should be protected, there is "a total lack of evidence" of a biological holocaust, said Dr. Julian Simon, a University of Maryland economist. He is perhaps better known for arguing that the world's resources, coupled with human ingenuity, can support a surging population. "We're being asked to take the entire scenario on faith" and on the judgment of those who advance it, he said. The warnings of mass extinction, he said, "seem like guesswork and hysteria."
Other dissenters say there is a problem, but that its dimensions simply cannot be known at the moment. No one even knows the true number of species in the world, they say. This is acknowledged by Dr. Wilson and others who share his view.
Only 1.4 million species have been identified worldwide, but estimates of South American species alone range from 5 million to 50 million, and estimates of global species range up to 100 million.
"When you deal with that kind of error, it's hard to say what's happening," said Dr. Michael A. Mares, a zoologist at the University of Oklahoma who is an expert on neotropical habitats.
Likewise, he said, it is difficult to come up with a rate of extinction when the geographical distribution of organisms is not known. "Most of them are invertebrates," he said. "We really don't have a good handle on whether or not they're going extinct and how rapidly. The problem is data right now."
More should be known, he said, before the poor countries of the world are asked to make large sacrifices to preserve tropical forests.
For his part, Dr. Mares said, he believes that the wolf is not yet at the door. "The wolf is coming," he said, "but he's coming later."
It is "understandable that there's disagreement," said Dr. Jared Diamond, an ecologist at the University of California at Los Angeles who has examined the problem. "What people are arguing about is what's going to happen in the future."
Predicting the stock market, with its well-known variables and wealth of data, is a far more certain pursuit than predicting the future of species, he said.
Dr. Diamond has concluded that, even taking into account all the uncertainties, "something like half the species that now exist will go extinct or will be on the verge of going extinct in the next century" if current trends continue.
Geological history is filled with mass extinctions. The most famous is the wave of extinctions in which the dinosaurs vanished 65 million years ago. Three-quarters of the species on earth were wiped out in that event, paleontologists say.
Extinctions of similar scope took place about 208 million, 367 million and 439 million years ago. An estimated 96 percent of all species disappeared in a mass extinction 245 million years ago in the most extensive wipeout of species in the geological record. Most recently, an estimated 35 percent of species disappeared in an extinction 35 million years ago.
 
Dispute Over Causes
 Scientists argue about the causes of such events. Species become extinct in the natural course of evolution, but this "background" rate of extinction is very low, said Dr. David Jablonski, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago. Some scientists have tried to assign a single cause, like an impact of a meteorite or comet, to the mass extinctions. Others say changes in climate, sea level, ocean currents or ocean oxygen content could do it. In any case, some great environmental disruption, or combination of disruptions, is believed to be responsible in each case.
Writing in the current issue of Science, Dr. Jablonski says that according to fossil studies, widespread species are more likely to survive a mass extinction, whereas specialized species adapted to a smaller area are especially vulnerable. This, he wrote, suggests that disruption and fragmentation of habitat caused by humans are likely to result in the increasing appearance of "widespread, weedy species -- rats, ragweed and cockroaches." The weedy species, he said in an interview, "are biologically prepared to cope" with environmental change and are "capable of using a lot of different kinds of resources," like disturbed roadside habitats and human waste.
Coming at it from a different perspective, Dr. Terry L. Erwin, an entomologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, wrote in Science that if the disruption of ecosystems continues, "we can expect the evolutionary process as we know it to become degraded and retarded." If current trends continue and are pushed to their extreme, he wrote, "within a few hundred years this planet will have little more than lineages of domestic weeds, flies, cockroaches and starlings evolving to fill a converted and mostly desertified environment."
The big question is whether the disruptions caused by human activity will be enough to create this bleak landscape and to bring about a mega-extinction like those of the distant past.
"That's the $10,000 question," said Dr. Jablonski. "We have no idea how many species are out there and how many are dying. My own personal feeling is that if the destruction goes unchecked, we will reach an extinction level unmatched since the end of the Cretaceous" period, when the extinction of the dinosaurs took place. "Under any circumstance, we're going to have a big loss," he said.
Dr. Simon has argued since the mid-1980's that there is no evidence of extinction rates of the magnitude advanced by Dr. Wilson and others. In an article in 1986, to which he says he still holds, he wrote that "there is no prima facie case for any expensive policy of safeguarding species without more extensive analysis than has so far been done." He says that the only scientifically observed extinction rate in this century is one species a year.
 
'Massive and Worldwide'
 On the contrary, says Dr. Wilson, "the observed extinctions of species in this century have been massive and worldwide." While "our very incomplete knowledge" makes it difficult to monitor extinctions, he said, "in the small minority of groups of plants and animals that are well known, extinction has been found to be proceeding at a rate hundreds or thousands of times above pre-human levels. That has been spread prominently on the scientific and public record."
While no comprehensive global survey has been taken, he says, there are hundreds of separate examples of serious recent extinctions: for instance, 90 plant species whose only habitat was a single mountain ridge in Ecuador, and half the 280 freshwater fish species in peninsular Malaysia.
Dr. Wilson bases much of his case on calculations employing a mathematical model that describes the effect on the number of species when the geographical area in which they exist is reduced. The model, which he says has been tested for validity against field studies and observations "over and over again," calculates that when species' habitat in a given area, an island or a continent, and the habitat is reduced by 90 percent, the number of species eventually declines by about half.
Worldwide, he said, tropical rain forests are being lost at the rate of nearly 55,000 square miles a year, a loss roughly equivalent to the land area of Florida. This figure, he said, was derived recently from satellite reconnaissance and from surveys by governments and scientific teams.
At that rate, Dr. Wilson calculated, the world's rain forests would be reduced by half in 30 years. Applying the area-species model to this finding, he calculated that 10 percent to 22 percent of the rain forest species would be "doomed" in the next three decades.
As used by ecologists, doomed means that extinction might take some time, but that it is a foregone conclusion. Although they cannot be sure, scientists believe that more than half the world's species, from bacteria to big mammals and trees, live in the rain forests.
 
Criticism on Data
 The mathematical model used by Dr. Wilson "is based on nothing but speculation," said Dr. Simon. "If scientific models are to have any validity, they must be based on some solid data." He said he has been unable to find such data.
Critics also say that deforestation statistics can be misleading, that in the Amazon, for instance, more than a third of the region that is considered tropical forest is not rain forest but savanna and semi-desert. They say also that some of the forest is not virgin forest, which is richest in species, but secondary growth. In reply, Dr. Wilson says that his calculations involve rain forest only, and apply globally, and that secondary forest is included as well.
To observations that not enough is known about the number of species in the world, Dr. Wilson says that this is "completely true," but that it makes no difference: Whatever the number, it is the proportion by which the species total is reduced that is important, and this is calculable.
Dr. Mares notes that there was no widespread extinction of species in the eastern United States after its forests were cleared. "While there were quite a number of changes in distribution patterns of many species," he said, "we haven't had massive die-offs."
Dr. Wilson said that in the temperate zones, species tend to be distributed over a wider area than in the tropics, where it is common for a given species to be confined to one mountainside or one river basin. Temperate-zone species, he said, are consequently better able to survive habitat destruction.
Dr. Mares acknowledged this, but said that "when you look at mammals" in the tropics, in which he specializes, "I don't think this is the case. Many have extensive distributions."
 
Puerto Rico's Experience
 Some dissenters have also said that the experience of Puerto Rico casts doubt on the doomsday scenario. There, they say, there are as many species now, or more, than before the arrival of Columbus. Yet the island was largely deforested at the turn of the century.
"That's probably true," said Dr. Wilson, "but it has been loaded up with tramp species, cockroaches, weeds and so forth. Everywhere you go, you get them, and they're the same ones you get in Caracas and Lagos and Miami." Meanwhile, he said, some of the local species have been lost, and those are "gone from the global roster."
That, he said, is the direction in which the world is going, "as we wipe out very rich assemblages of local, endemic species that have taken millions of years to build up, in many cases wiping them out before we have put scientific names on them."

Diagrams: "Will the Weedy Inherit Earth?"
 
When humans disrupt natural habitats, scientists say, highly adaptable global species like rats and cockroaches invade the disrupted area and replace richly varied assemblies of local organisms. In mass extinctions of the past, fossils show, large vertebrates were more vulnerable than smaller ones. (pg. C1)
 
"Evolution, Density and Variety"
 
Vast numbers of insect species originate in lush tropical rainforests. Even while living close together, two different races of the same species evolve into two wholly new species. Although they are neighbors, they live and feed on different species of plants and are thereby reproductively and genetically isolate.
 
The tropics contain a much denser concentration and greater diversity of species than temperate zones. One study found 300 species of trees in one hectare (2.47 acres) of Peruvian rainforest, compared with 700 native species of trees in all of North America. A single tree in the same Peruvian area yielded as many ant species as live in Britain. (pg. C8)

HEADLINE: The New Range War Has the Desert as Foe

BYLINE: By MYRA KLOCKENBRINK

 BODY:
AS much as 85 percent of the rangeland in the Western United States -- about 685 million acres -- is being turned into desert by overgrazing and other problems, according to a study prepared for the United Nations Environment Program.
The desertification manifests itself through low groundwater tables, salinization of topsoil and water, reduced surface waters, high soil erosion and acute loss of native vegetation. The result is the general impoverishment of an ecosystem's productivity. 
 The land is principally degraded in two ways: overgrazing by cattle and salinization of the soil due to poor drainage on irrigated farmland. While salinization is more deadly -- plants will not grow in salt-laden soil -- overgrazing, while not necessarily irreversible, is by far the most pervasive cause of desertification.
 
Monitoring Costs Unmet
 At the heart of the rangeland's poor state of repair, according to Government officials, is a lack of adequate funds to monitor the number of cattle on public land or to manage them properly.
At least 265 million acres of Federal lands are made available to livestock grazing. Grazing fees generated by the leasing of these lands are well below those charged for private land, officials say, and don't cover monitoring costs. As a result, range managers don't have the data to enforce reduction in grazing capacity.
A report by the General Accounting Office found that 75 percent of the public lands believed to be overstocked had not been scheduled by either the Bureau of Land Mangement or the Forest Service for a reduction in livestock.
"We're not getting the job done," said Robert Williamson, director of the Range Management Program of the Forest Service. "We don't have the resources to do the monitoring or administering of our allotments."
Dr. Harold Dregne, the Horn Professor of Soil Science at Texas Tech University, measured precipitation and evaporation to determine productive yield on cropland and rangeland west of the 100th meridian. This runs from central North Dakota through central Texas.
Dr. Dregne, the author of the United Nations report, which is soon to be published, classified 430 million acres of this area as suffering a 25 to 50 percent reduction in yield from that of a healthy state. Thirteen million acres showed very severe degradation, largely because of salinization, with more than a 50 percent reduction in their ability to sustain crop yields or natural vegetative production. When land is abandoned, it becomes a source of dust storms and water erosion, eventually becoming sterile sand dunes.
Dr. Dregne says he believes these 13 million acres are "irreversibly degraded and cannot be economically rehabilitated or improved."
Government reports have made similar findings, although they are not usually expressed in terms of desertification.
Chief among the expensive habits that have depleted the land in the West is overgrazing. The cattle industry began with millions of acres of free and unrestricted pasturage. Though much of the damage was done in the great cattle drives of the late 1800's, the number of cattle on the land has reached an all-time high of more than 19 million head in the 11 Western states today.
The number of cattle and the long periods they are kept in one area are what leads to overgrazing, and repeated overgrazing undermines tissue reserves until the plant grows weak and dies.
"The Western range has been kept in a dynamic state of degradation," said Lynn Jacobs, the author of a forthcoming book, "Waste of the Land," about the effects of overgrazing on public lands. "People get the impression that the land has always looked like this. But just as your hair doesn't turn gray overnight, this land has been degraded over a long period of time, and it continues to be degraded."
While pressure from environmental groups and congressmen has led to some changes in land management practices, cattle ranchers have opposed new restrictions on the size of herds and the higher fees for the use of public lands.
"For too long the permittees have had priority," said David Oman, ranger for the Sawtooth National Park in Idaho, said of ranchers whose cattle graze on public land). "They talk about it as their land."
Livestock operators contend that preservationists are interested in limiting the use of the land to wildlife, excluding any human impact. In fact, they contend that management by the livestock industry accounts for increases in wildlife numbers and conservation of land.
"In our part of Montana my father never saw any wildlife," said Joe Etchart, a rancher in Glasgow, Mont., who is president of the Public Lands Council, an organization for the 31,000 Federal permit holders. "Today we have hundreds of hunting parties coming to our area each year to participate in our game harvest."
Cattle typical of the range today are northern European imports, which, unlike their bison counterparts, are fond of wet places and high-protein forage and dislike going far for either. However, wet places and good forage are scarce in the arid West. So while it may take one acre of land to raise a cow in Georgia, it may take 20 in Colorado or as many as 200 in the desert Southwest.
"We have tried to make the West a replica of Georgia by damming our rivers, through irrigation and groundwater mining," said George Wuerthner, an ecologist who studies the effects of overgrazing. "And we have failed. We have achieved desertification instead."
Many of the native grasses, like the grama grasses and bunchgrasses known to live 100 to 150 years, have been eradicated by grazing. Because they are among the most desirable forage, they are the first to be eaten. In addition, they are crowded out by the desert sagebrush, mesquite and introduced exotic grasses that quickly take over the depleted soil.
The delicate layer of topsoil, often held together by no more than a thin mat of algae, fungus or lichens, is easily broken apart by cattle roaming for forage. The soil is then exposed to wind and water erosion and the further infiltration of desert shrubs and non-native plant species.
Dr. Robert Stebbins of the Zoology Department at University of California at Berkeley, an expert on California desert systems, said, "the shift toward weedy species such as the Russian Thistle or tumbleweed tends to create monocultures, a uniform vegetation without the biological diversity" so important to all natural landscapes.
The prolonged presence of too many cattle further degrades the West's dry lands by compacting the fine clay soil and preventing what precipitation there may be from reaching the roots of plants. Rain on heavily grazed land will run off, carrying the topsoil with it and polluting streams and rivers.
In the West, riparian zones, the narrow belts of land along waterways, represent a small proportion of the land, but are critical to the overall ecological health of the rangeland because it here that the greatest diversity of plant and animal life exists. A 1990 report by the Environmental Protection Agency found that "riparian areas throughout the West are in the worst condition in history."
Because cattle need water( 20 gallons a day for each cow, according to the Bureau of Land Management) they congregate along streams and meadows. However, a fragile streambank is easily destroyed by the 1,000-pound animals. Tender grasses and saplings that line the streams provide succulent feasts for cattle, destroying the habitat for other animals. Eventually, the water table falls through the deepening and widening of the stream bed, and if the cattle stay long enough, they will effectively turn a stream into a dry arroyo bed.
Mr. Williamson said that more than half of the 101 million acres under the Forest Service protection were unsuitable for livestock grazing, but nevertheless were still being used.
A bill now in Congress would raise grazing fees from $1.97 per cow per month to $8.70 by 1995. Ranchers say that such an increase would make cattle too expensive to raise.
"We'll go out of business a piece at a time," said Kenneth Spann, a rancher in the Gunnison Valley of Colorado. "Our land will be subdivided and developed, and the water will go to the highest bidder, Denver or California, who knows?"
Before the era of great cattle drives, bison, bear and other wildlife were abundant. Giant trees paved the mountain sides and commanded flood plains and grasses grew as high as a horse's belly.
"Now it's hard to find anything growing that would scratch a horse's ankles," said Norbert Riedy of the Wilderness Society. "The natural grasslands are all but gone."

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR's WORLD;
Unraveling the Mystery Of Bypass Survival

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
To learn why death rates from heart bypass operations varied as much as 400 percent in a New England study, researchers are reviving an old practice: Surgeons are visiting each other's hospitals to watch colleagues operate. But in new twist, they are taking engineers, anesthesiologists, technicians and nurses with them.
The teams are seeking clues to death rates that defied explanation in a study of 3,055 bypass operations by the 18 heart surgeons in the five hospitals that do all the bypass operations performed in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. 
 The effort is a return to the days when surgeons routinely learned new techniques at first hand from their colleagues. But it is not the only one. In the belief that doctors often learn more from mistakes than successes, surgeons in Europe long ago formed what is known as Pete's Club, in which members report their biggest surgical disaster of the past year.
In the United States, 25 heart surgeons belong to a 12-year-old club that makes informal visits to a member's hospital once a year. They watch the host perform operations and talk with nurses and technicians to pick up tips that they often incorporate into their practices back home, said Dr. Dan J. Ullyot, a heart surgeon at the University of California at San Francisco and club member.
But unlike the members of Pete's Club and the 25 surgeons, the researchers in New England intend to publish results of their efforts to unravel the heart surgery mystery.
The puzzling new findings, along with those of another study from Philadelphia published in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, challenge the prevailing view that differences in death rates can be explained by simple factors, like differences in patients' conditions. They suggest that more complex factors are involved. So the New England team will consider such factors as drug treatments before and after surgery, the organization of the hospital and the personality of the surgeon.
All teaching hospitals once had amphitheaters or domes where surgeons watched masters perform operations. It was under what became known as the ether dome at Massachusetts General Hospital, for example, that surgical anesthesia was first publicly demonstrated in 1846.
But no such amphitheater was included in the new hospital that Duke University built 10 years ago because "no one uses them anymore," said Dr. David Sabiston, the chief surgeon at the Durham, N. C. medical center.
Instead, many surgeons now learn by watching films or videotapes of key portions of operations at meetings or on closed circuit television.
But such "films are often dressed up, so what you see looks almost perfect, and there's never anything on a film that shows bleeding and other problems," Dr. Sabiston said in an interview. He added: "Films do not tell you about pre-operative and post-operative care, and more important, you do not hear the conversation in the operating room."
Some famous heart surgeons have suffered tarnished images after visitors have seen them err.
One surgeon told about a colleague who was astonished to watch a world-renowned surgeon sew a heart valve in upside down. Junior assistants did not point out the mistake. As was his custom, the surgeon went on to work on another patient in another operating room, leaving his assistants to finish the first operation. Once the master had left, the assistants repositioned the valve.
Economic competition remains another obstacle to the practice of surgeons watching each other. Many surgeons have declined to host visitorsfrom another hospital in the same city out of fear that the visiting surgeon might steal a technique and thus, future patients.
"There's an old saying that 'the friendliness between surgeons is directly proportional to the distance between them,' " said Dr. Ullyot, the San Francisco heart surgeon.
Dr. Gerald T. O'Connor, an epidemiologist at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover, N.H. who led the New England team, said his study could not have been done in Boston or another big city. The medical centers in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont are 70 miles distant, separated by mountain ranges, Dr. O'Connor said. In an interview he added: "The doctors do not compete with each other, so there is less ego involvement in being the best, and there is more willingness to learn from each other."
Now, in another study, Dr. O'Connor's team is comparing the records of 350 patients who died after bypass surgery with those of 700 survivors. The aim is to determine whether any of 160 factors, some derived from observations made on team visits might be clues to the different death rates.
For example, the team will determine whether aspirin use is a factor. Aspirin is a standard therapy to prevent a heart attack because it makes it harder for blood to clot. But bleeding can be a serious complication in heart surgery. "We know some hospitals won't operate on someone who has had an aspirin and they do extensive screening for bleeding problems," Dr. O'Connor said. "Yet other places do not think such tests are important at all."
"We don't know which is right, but we will know" after the data is collected, Dr. O'Connor said.
The visiting teams have also found wide variation in the techniques used to deliberately stop the heart while the damaged coronary arteries are repaired. All teams use a heart-lung machine, but they vary the kinds and temperatures of the standard solutions added to the blood that circulates through the machine.
Experts agree that nursing care is a critical factor in the care of patients with heart disease. Although nurses are full partners in the New England study, there are fewer questions about nursing care than many experts might expect.
The fragile hearts of bypass surgery patients are vulnerable to little changes that could cause further heart damage. After bypass surgery, for example, nurses watch cardiac monitors for the earliest sign of a serious heart rhythm abnormality. Some can kill in seconds. Nurses also are alert to drops in blood pressure that could be clues to bleeding around the heart. Such bleeding can hamper blood pumping and lead to shock.
"In some hospitals the nurses say they do not know what is going on, that every doctor wants something different, while other hospitals seem more organized and nurses and doctors there seem to agree more on what they are doing," Dr. O'Connor said.
Another potentially critical factor is the ratio of nurses to patients. In most acute care units the ratio is one to one, but sometimes is stretched to one nurse to two patients, said Dr. Sabiston of Duke. He added, "There's a lot of variation in the ratios."
The ratio can be critical because if a heart stops, nurses are often the first to start resuscitation measures.

Chess Game With Big Differences

BYLINE: By L. R. SHANNON

 BODY:
PLAYING chess on a personal computer is nothing new, but here is a program with three important differences. First, it was designed to work with Windows 3.0, so it does not force you into the contortions sometimes required to get a plain DOS program to run in that environment. Second, if you have a modem and a friend with a modem, as well as his own copy of the program, you can play chess over the telephone lines. Finally, if your computer is linked to other computers in a Netbios-compatible network, you can play through that.
ChessNet for Windows, version 2.0, plays a good game, too, much better than this writer's. 
 Installing the program into Windows is a breeze and, when the screen appears, there is the familiar menu bar across the top for the various options. You can change the color of the squares, the background and border and have the moves recorded in either algebraic or coordinate notation. Everything can be done with the keyboard, but a mouse is easier.
The computer can play either the black or the white side at six levels of difficulty, will give hints if asked and can even be made to switch sides in the middle of a game. If you are playing through a modem or on a network, there is a "chat" feature that lets the two human players praise, or vilify, each other on screen.
Playing by telephone could become expensive, but playing by mail -- long favored by some -- certainly tries the patience. Playing over the office network sounds like a good way to win a spot in the unemployment line, but one can imagine the members of a company chess club competing after hours. Games may be saved on a disk.
The manual includes a summary of the official rules of the game prepared by the U.S. Chess Federation in addition to instructions. The package contains both 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch disks and can be played on any computer capable of running Windows 3.0. The suggested retail price is $49.95. ChessNet for Windows, 2.0, is a product of Masque Publishing of Englewood, Colo. If you can't find it in a retail outlet, it can be ordered by calling (800) 765-4223.
 
Playing With Fear
 Arachnophobia is the unnatural fear of spiders. If you don't have it now, you may after playing the computer game of the same name.
Based on the popular movie of last year, the program sends you to seven different towns to try to destroy the offspring of a venomous South American spider. If you succeed (I didn't), you go to the jungle home of the species to try to eradicate it.
If this sounds like fun, Arachnophobia is available for MS-DOS computers for $49.95 or, in a package with the Sound Source, which greatly improves such sounds as spiders frying, for $69.95. There are also versions for the Amiga, coming soon, and Commodore 64/128. The grisly thing is a product of Walt Disney Computer Software, a division of the Walt Disney Company, of Burbank, Calif.
Also from Disney is Mickey's Jigsaw Puzzles, 15 puzzles that can be put together on screen. When completed, the scene becomes an animated sequence. Intended for children 5 years old and older, the program can be tailored for the user; puzzles can have as few as 4 to as many as 64 pieces, and there are three levels of difficulty.
The puzzles can also be printed out for coloring. The suggested retail price is $49.95, or $69.95 with the Sound Source.
 
Wheel of Fortune Revised
 GameTek, of North Miami Beach, Fla., has enhanced its Wheel of Fortune game and renamed it Wheel of Fortune Featuring Vanna White. The game is played pretty much as it is on television, and the bonus round now incorporates changes made in the show: for one, the player starts off with N, S, L, R, T and E already selected.
The DOS version of Wheel should be in the stores next month, at $49.95, and a Nintendo version is due in November. By now, Pat Sajak probably wishes he had taken the letter-turning job.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL COMPUTERS;
Test-Drive for Software

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS

 BODY:
A PICTURE used to be worth a thousand words. Today, in the age of personal computers, a graphical display is worth a kilobyte of text.
At least that's the premise behind Select Demos, a CD-ROM product that contains more than a thousand graphical demonstrations of popular (and not so popular) MS-DOS and Windows programs. It requires an I.B.M. PC or compatible equipped with a CD-ROM drive. 
 At the introductory price of $99 for the disk, Select Demos can be either an economical alternative to spending afternoons going from computer store to computer store to test-drive software or a cheap way to entice people to spend hundreds of additional dollars on software they never knew they needed.
Many software companies offer their prospective customers a so-called demo disk, a diskette that shows off the features of a program in a way that no printed product review or box blurbs can. The user plugs the diskette into his or her PC, types "demo" or some other command and watches as the software struts its stuff, often with flashy animation and sound.
Computer Library, the New York City company that also produces a CD-ROM product called Computer Select, has persuaded more than 600 software companies to put their demo disks on this single shiny platter. There are more than a 1,000 demo programs in all, from companies including Aldus, Ashton-Tate, Borland, Broderbund, I.B.M., Microsoft, Lotus, Symantec-Norton, and Wordperfect.
There are also lots of demos from companies that are less well known, which is a good thing. This disk might allow a PC user to see products that otherwise might never show up on the radar screen.
In the best demos, the software company simply gives the user a copy of the real software, but cripples it in some way that renders it useless for day-to-day operation. A word processing program demo might not print, or a data base might not accept more than a dozen entries. All the commands work, through, and the user gets a good sense of whether to invest in the full program.
In the worst demos, the company just uses a bit of animation and fancy graphics to make a slide-show sales pitch. Product features are listed and promises are made, but the user does not really get a chance to play with the software or even see how it operates. Slightly more than half the demos on Select Demo fall into this category.
Jonathan Pollard, director of development for Computer Library, a division of the Ziff Communications Company, said companies were encouraged to contribute crippled software rather than the automated slide shows.
A handful of companies also decided to contribute actual working programs, functionally the same as one would find in the stores, but without printed documentation.
Hayes Microcomputer Products contributed Smartcom EZ, a simple, $49 communications program, presumably in the hope that users would like it enough to go out and buy the more powerful Smartcom package.
The Checkfree Corporation, maker of software that allows PC users to pay bills electronically, offers its $29.95 software, but the catch is that there is a monthly fee for use.
And for those who are either a year late in paying their taxes or a few months early in evaluating programs to handle next year's tax returns, there are four 1990 tax preparation programs on the disk: Andrew Tobias TaxCut, Macintax for WIndows, Turbotax Personal and 1040.
The pick of the pack, however, is Geoworks Ensemble, a collection of applications that works essentially like Microsoft's Windows, but without the need for a powerful PC and lots of memory. Ensemble is a so-called multitasking environment, which means that more than one program can be running on screen at once, each in its own window.
Ensemble is more than a "poor man's Windows," though. It comes with programs that handle word processing and simple desktop publishing, file management, communications, drawing, scheduling, and personal secretary stuff. There is also a solitaire game. The choices are much more limited than for Microsoft Windows, which has sold 4 million copies and drawn commitments from hundreds of software companies, but perhaps Geoworks is using Select Demos to spread the word.
Geoworks has contributed version 1.0 of Ensemble to this disk; the current version is 2.0. Still, it is a great idea to test the program on Select Demos to see if it is worth going out to buy the newer version.
Mr. Pollard of Computer Library said no decision had been made on whether to offer regular updates of Select Demos, or how much to charge for them. If this new CD-ROM format is a success, which it deserves to be, it would be nice to see quarterly or semiannual updates, sold either individually or as a subscription.
Select Demo's CD-ROM companion, Computer Select, is a compilation of computer-related reviews taken from the past 12 months of publication of 1,300 magazines, newspapers and industry newsletters. Computer Select is sold on a subscription basis for $995 a year.
Computer Library can be reached at (212) 503-4400 or (800) 848-1472, extension 107.

HEADLINE: Democrats Attack Bush on Economy As Spotlight Shifts to Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Democratic Governors tried to escalate the pressure on President Bush today over his handling of the economy and other domestic issues, but found themselves overshadowed by a foreign policy crisis that threatened to freeze Presidential politics once again.
The Democrats, gathered here for the annual summer meeting of the National Governors' Association, passed a resolution assailing Mr. Bush for his "refusal to recognize that 8.5 million Americans out of work is a tragedy and an emergency." They urged him to reverse his decision last week to block the spending of money needed for extended unemployment benefits authorized by Congress for more than three million people out of work for more than half a year. 
 It was part of the Democratic Party's orchestrated effort to highlight Mr. Bush's domestic record, which it considers his Achilles' heel. But it came as the crisis in the Soviet Union turned the spotlight once again on foreign policy.
Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, chairman of the Republican Governors' Association, offered a preview of the political uses of the Soviet crisis, asserting, "We're lucky to have George Bush in a position to deal with this."
Some Democrats acknowledged that the developments in the Soviet Union, like the war in the Persian Gulf, will play to Mr. Bush's strengths, at least in the short term. "Right now the ball goes back in his court, where his strength is," said Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida.
There is a further danger for the Democrats: the possibility that the Soviet crisis will slow the race for the Democratic nomination, which was already stalled for months by the Gulf war and the President's towering wartime popularity. But this possibility was strenuously dismissed today by Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman, who was here to brief the Democratic governors on the 1992 campaign.
"I don't think it has anything to do with freezing partisan politics," Mr. Brown told reporters. "If anything, it raises a lot of questions in an area that is supposed to be George Bush's strength, the foreign policy arena."
The chairman also said that while the Soviet developments were "a matter of grave concern" he was "not sure" the American people felt a "sense of crisis" or "wartime footing."
But the immediate political impact of the crisis was apparent in the caution of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a potential contender for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Mr. Clinton, who only yesterday was pressing the case against Mr. Bush, both foreign and domestic, was subdued and careful on the Soviet crisis today.
"We ought to give the President a decent breathing space to find out what the facts are and make a statement on behalf of the United States," Mr. Clinton said. "Then the rest of us can decide what we think about that."
He added, "I think people like me shouldn't say much right now until we find out exactly what's happened and we give the President a chance to asess it and announce a policy."
The four-day meeting of the nation's governors, which concludes Tuesday, has been dominated by the health care issue and bipartisan panels on a number of other policy issues. But it has also featured careful partisan maneuvering. On Sunday, Democratic Governors assailed the Administration's progress on health care, and today they focused on its handling of the unemployment issue.
Mr. Bush announced Friday that he would make the symbolic gesture of signing a bill that would provide extended unemployment benefits, but would block actual spending of the bill's $5.8 billion in benefits. "I won't bust the budget," he told a news conference at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me., saying he would not sign a declaration of budget emergency necessary to spend the money.
In the resolution approved today, the Democratic Governors urged the President to reconsider his decision, declaring, "Just as President Bush had the wisdom to help those in need in Israel, Turkey and Iraq, he should move immediately to help victims of this yearlong recession in America."

HEADLINE: Gambling Raid Angers Mining Town

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WALLACE, Idaho

 BODY:
Well before Idaho was a state, there were gambling houses, brothels and boisterous saloons in this storied mining country in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains.
So it wasn't exactly a surprise when, on the morning of June 23, Federal agents from all over the West raided virtually every bar here in Shoshone County and found more than 200 video poker machines. Gambling, local officials say, is one of the few industries that have yet to die in the area. 
 What is so perplexing to residents of the panhandle of north Idaho, and to outsiders as well, is why the Federal Bureau of Investigation used such a show of force. The raiding party on that Sunday comprised 150 agents, and now Federal lawyers are moving in court to take control of the places that were raided, a move that would make the Government owner of every bar in Wallace.
To a community that considers itself on its knees, racked by a series of economic and environmental calamities, the raid has provoked protests and stirred old animosities.
 
Machines Not Target, U.S. Says
 In an age when banking scandals have cost the nation's taxpayers billions of dollars, many residents here say the Government has spent far too much time and money on video poker machines in a crippled mining town.
Federal officials say the focus of the raid was not so much the machines as the local authorities who had allowed them to flourish.
The raid was the biggest single Federal law-enforcement raid ever in the Rocky Mountain region, said James T. Screen, a spokesman for the F.B.I. in Salt Lake City. Not since the late 19th century, when Federal troops were sent here to battle union organizers, have so many Government agents moved so heavily against one community in the region.
Residents of this valley, which once produced more silver than any other place on earth but is now poverty-stricken and polluted, say the raid can be explained more by the area's reputation than by any real criminal enterprise.
 
Panhandle Goes Its Own Way
 "Here you've got a community that's always lived a little bit outside the law," said Chris Stuecker, a local contractor who specializes in renovating historic houses. "And then you get an outside agency, like the F.B.I., that doesn't understand that we're just average folks, and they hear about all these gambling devices and it gets them going."
Mr. Stuecker helped to organize a rally last month to protest the raid, and about 200 people attended.
This town of about 1,000 people is a national historic site, an example of the boom-and-bust mining towns that used to dot mountain valleys throughout the West. Even the newer buildings here look archaic. But, Federal officials say, it is not just architecture that is frozen in time in the Silver Valley: so are attitudes.
Many residents and some public officials of the valley admit that their county is different from most. Idaho is better known for potatoes and Mormons than gambling and prostitution. But the northern part of the state, in the mountainous panhandle, has always gone its own way.
When the silver mines were running rich, the area was full of rough-edged men who spent their earnings on the basic vices of typical mining and timber camps -- gambling and prostitution. Once, more than a dozen brothels operated in Wallace, local residents say.
But the Silver Valley has changed dramatically in the last decade. As the mines have closed and toxic levels of lead have been found in local streams and soil, Shoshone County has lost more than 27 percent of its residents, down to about 14,000 now. Unemployment has been running at more than 20 percent, and last year the last known brothel went out of business. "It died a natural death," said Dick Caron, who owns the Wallace Corner, a general store.
 
'Corruption of Public Officials'
 Federal agents say local authorities have long tolerated the traditional forms of vice here, and the raid was intended to end that. "Corruption of public officials was the focus," said Mr. Screen of the F.B.I.
The case is being handled by the Justice Department's Division of Public Integrity, a unit in Washington, D.C., used primarily to prosecute corrupt elected officials. Department officials would not comment on the investigation.
Grand jury proceedings are under way in Boise, but no one has yet been indicted.
 
Agents Confiscate $500,000
 The 150 F.B.I. agents raided 58 bars, breaking down doors and windows in some cases. So many agents were needed, Mr. Screen said, because there were so many bars.
The agents confiscated more than $500,000 in cash from various bars and seized all the video poker machines. The machines are legal in Idaho but are considered unlawful by the state if they are used for actual gambling -- that is, if the bar pays players for points scored on the machines.
 
'We're Talking Quarter Games'
 Rather than expressing outrage at crimes that the authorities say were going on in their midst, Wallace residents have directed their anger at the F.B.I.
"What we have in these saloons is no more harmful than bowling on Sundays," Mr. Caron said. "It's petty, insignificant, victimless entertainment. We're talking quarter games."
Jack Rose, the Shoshone County Prosecutor, said, "I think the F.B.I. would be better served trying to solve the many killings back in their headquarters city, the murder capital of the nation."
Mr. Rose said that he had done nothing wrong and that he was not aware of any gambling on the video poker machines.
F.B.I. agents, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Rose was one of the public officials under investigation. Justice Department officials refused to comment.
T-shirts criticizing the F.B.I. quickly sold out at Dickison's Trading Post here. A local newspaper, The Silver Valley Voice, published a satirical front-page picture of a clownish-looking man, posing in fake nose and glasses, wearing an F.B.I. hat and shorts while standing in front of a bar.
Several hundred people have signed a petition calling for a Congressional investigation of the raid; it accuses the agency of selective enforcement of the law.
 
'Colorful Way of Life'
 Video poker machines can be found throughout the state, said Keith Mathews, assistant director of the Idaho Department of Law Enforcement. "I don't think that Shoshone County is any different than any other part of Idaho," he said.
The area's Representative in Congress, Larry LaRocco, a freshman Democrat from Boise, said the raid left him with many questions.
"I wonder if they are using an F-117 when a small rifle would do the job," Mr. LaRocco said, adding that the Silver Valley has long had a "live and let live" attitude and "colorful way of life" that local officials have tolerated.
Mr. Caron, the merchant, said, "We might be hicks in the sticks, but we know what overkill is."

Congressional investigators studying a $4 billion Federal job training program have found that women and blacks are more likely than white men to be channeled into lower-paying jobs.
The investigators said they also found instances of blatant racism and sexism by the private companies that provide classroom and the on-the-job training in the program, which serves economically disadvantaged people, dislocated workers and others who face significant employment barriers. 
 In the study, which is not yet complete, investigators with the General Accounting Office examined programs established in 16 states through the Job Training Partnership Act.
It said the findings did not mean that civil rights violations had occurred, and it cited factors that accounted for disparities in the treatment of blacks and women. In some cases, the study said, the clients felt more comfortable in jobs that happened to pay less, or they shunned the training that would enable them to get higher-paying work.
 
Quayle's Top Achievement
 The jobs program, which Vice President Dan Quayle has said was the most important achievement in his eight years in the Senate, provides Federal money to the states. While state and local governments have ultimate responsibility for the management of the local program, they are run primarily by private industry councils. Ten million people have participated in the programs since they began in 1983.
The General Accounting Office obtained data from the 1989 program year, the most recent information available, on adult participants who had a high school education. The data came from 227 local projects, about a third of the programs nationwide.
The study, to be completed by February, will include information about minorities other than blacks and additional information about disparities in treatment by sex.
In one unidentified project, the study said, 55 percent of the white men in classroom training received electronics instruction, and this led to jobs that paid the highest wages, an average of $7.50 an hour.
But among the black men in classrooms, only 26 percent received electronics training. Forty-two percent of them received training in health or food services, and this led to jobs paying an average of less than $6 an hour.
In 11 percent to 20 percent of the projects, the study found, blacks were more likely than whites to get assistance only in searching for jobs, without any classroom or on-the-job training. When blacks did receive training, it was usually for lower-paying jobs, the study found.
The study said that women were more likely than men to receive classroom training, but that the training was for lower-paying clerical or health jobs.
 
Defense of the Program
 Assistant Secretary of Labor Roberts T. Jones defended the Job Training Partnership Act programs and said the G.A.O. report "at no point recognizes that minorities and women generally have less education and work force experience." He said minority members and women "start further behind, but make greater progress" because of the program.
Mr. Jones said that the disparities in wages cited in the study mirrored those in the work force in general and that the data in the study did not support "any findings of overt or systematic discrimination" against minorities or women.
"There's no question that this program does better for all these groups than they normally experience in the work force," he said. "It doesn't excuse discrimination, but let's be careful about what we're attacking. This program is doing better for these groups than anything we've had."
Mr. Jones said the Secretary of Labor, nevertheless, had asked the department's civil rights division to review all grant recipients to insure that they were in compliance with civil rights requirements.
 
Clients Stuck in Stereotypes
 The General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of Congress, found that participants sometimes requested jobs that were lower-paying than others.
"Some of the clients selected stereotypical jobs," said the head of the study, Franklin Frazier, director for education and employment issues for the G.A.O. "Someone might walk in and say, 'I want to be a truck driver,' even if he knows he would have a brighter future if he received computer training, or someone might say, 'I want a job right away. I don't want training.' "
But the study also found blatant racism and sexism affecting the work of some of the local programs, called service delivery areas, or S.D.A.'s.
"Some employers told the S.D.A.'s that they didn't want them to send out a black or a Hispanic or a woman," Mr. Frazier said. "And in some cases, whenever the S.D.A.'s would send minorities to the employer, none of them would be hired."
Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, who ordered the study as chairman of the Government Operations Committee, said the program should not be striving to simply put people in jobs, but rather should be trying to improve workers' skills and put them into the best possible jobs.
"You can process a lot of short-order cooks and fast-food processors and elevator operators," Mr. Conyers said, "but what that really does is downgrade people and hold them back from realizing their potential."

HEADLINE: Gorbachev's Loss, and Ours;
The Lunge for Legitimacy

 BODY:
The world stopped yesterday in the Soviet Union. The coup against Mikhail Gorbachev may not have been a surprise, exactly, but it's still a shock. The Grand Bargain advocated by some Westerners to aid Soviet reform might never have worked; but now the world is threatened with a grievous loss.
Everybody knew the Soviet President was walking a tightrope. And there were warnings of a coup, like the one last Friday from Mr. Gorbachev's old ally Aleksandr Yakovlev. But even so, after standing at the nuclear brink for decades, Americans were just starting to trust the forces of change that Mr. Gorbachev set free. 
 Now, suddenly, the reckless takeover by members of a discredited Communist old guard imperils the surge of progress. They may yet fail, if the Soviet public sweeps them aside and resumes the march to political and economic freedom. But even if the coup lasts, the plotters lack the legitimacy and the vision needed to succeed.
The likely catalyst for the coup was today's scheduled signing of a new union treaty redefining relations between the central Government and its restive republics. That treaty would have devolved power from the center, diminishing the power of the hard-liners.
And that was just the beginning of the end for the old guard. A companion agreement would empower the republics to collect taxes and share only a portion of revenues with Moscow. That would eventually have starved the military-industrial complex. And local elections this fall in Russia could have pushed most party hacks out of power.
But there is not a word of these realities from the plotters. Instead they lunge for legitimacy, trying in the first instance to justify their rash action with the kind of big lie made famous by past totalitarians: Mr. Gorbachev supposedly was sidelined for "health reasons."
For those who doubt that, the plotters appeal to the desire of some citizens for order over change. And if that's not reason enough, the new State Committee for the State of Emergency recoils in horror from "the chaotic, spontaneous slide toward a market." But the plotters do not stop at large, labored justifications. They rail also against shameless "politicking." They praise political relations that have "passed the centuries-long test of history," which sounds, bizarrely, as though these old Communists claim the blessing of the czars.
Not only that; the plotters justify their action by citing a need to resist the spreading "propaganda of sex and violence." And then, reflecting their own privileged station, they complain that "Only yesterday a Soviet person finding himself abroad felt himself a worthy citizen of an influential and respected state." Now he is "often a second-rate foreigner."
One way or another, they are likely to lose. They may not be able to stay in power long; the Soviet people may already have developed a preference for robust, even raucous politicking over the security of Big Brother. But even if the coup stands, there is no reason to believe that the new State Committee can manage the shrinking economy and the swelling thirst for autonomy. It is hard to see how the plotters can restore the old central command system. Neither can they retrieve the Soviet position in Eastern Europe.
Mr. Gorbachev and his fellow reformers have faced the future, knowing there is no choice but perestroika to build a better life for the Soviet people. The outside world had a monumental opportunity to help him win. There will be intense debate in the West over whether, by forfeiting that chance, the world also has lost. For now, the Soviet people are on their own.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Last Act

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
For six years now, ever since Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, the United States and other Western governments have done their best to avoid facing the one most important truth about the Soviet Union.
Now that reality, which Mr. Gorbachev knew better than any man on earth, has led to the coup against him. It is this: The Soviet Union is not a country but a collection of nationalities forced to live under a system of control that rests on a Communist Party whose own authority and protection are provided by the police organization known as the K.G.B. 
 All through its history, the K.G.B. has correctly described itself as the sword and shield of the Communist Party. The party and its police have been inseparably interwoven, parts of a single instrument of domination.
Mr. Gorbachev came up through this apparatus. He was placed in power by the party-K.G.B. to try to save a collapsing economy -- of course, without destroying the whole system.
He did his best. For most of his rule, he had the support of the party and the police, as they had his.
Mr. Gorbachev did not challenge the K.G.B. But he dreamed an impossible dream -- to bring about reform within the party-K.G.B. system.
The system itself began to fall apart when the move toward sovereignty -- and eventual independence -- of the nationalities became unstoppable. The party-K.G.B. complex, no dreamers, faced the choice of surrendering power and dachas, or fighting.
Mr. Gorbachev's failure to confront the K.G.B. -- or demand an accounting of the murders it carried out for one Kremlin regime after another -- is understandable. Seeing it as the enemy would have been like looking at his own hand and wondering how to cut it off.
But the West had no such excuse. The West's failure to see and state the truth about the Soviet system was based on short-term self-interest and long-term blindness, a congenital political disease in the West. President Bush himself fantasized that if only he became friendly enough with Mr. Gorbachev he could influence Soviet destiny -- quite as if the sword and shield never existed.
The U.S. Government didn't mention it. Last month, after I wrote a column emphasizing the power and danger of the K.G.B., some friends in government said oh, no, the K.G.B. was finished. But they forgot to tell that to Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, its chief, so he went on to lead the coup.
For years, Mr. Bush made Mr. Gorbachev the center of American Soviet policy and tied everything to him, including his Administration's reputation for judgment. The New World Order looks a little strange these days: Saddam Hussein rules in Baghdad, and Stalin calls out the tanks in Moscow.
History gives Mr. Bush another chance. My Soviet friends who have spent their lives fighting Communism believe that although the Soviet tragedy is not over, the last act has begun. They pray that the U.S. will refuse to recognize the coup government, however long it lasts. They believe that parts of the army command will refuse to obey party-K.G.B. orders, that many Soviet soldiers will refuse to kill their countrymen and that neither Boris Yeltsin nor the millions of Soviet democrats will surrender to the coup.
They believe that the coup will eventually fail, perhaps soon, and that a new government will emerge, breaking with the party-K.G.B. -- and the Gorbachev era of trying to bring reform within the system.
They think that unless the U.S. intervenes once more to save it, the Soviet Union will disappear into the annals of failed empires. It will be replaced by an association of 12 to 15 former republics, joined in an economic union with Eastern Europe.
It won't be neat and always stable, but it certainly will be a lot more peaceful than a system that gobbled up Eastern Europe, kept the world on military alert for half a century and slaughtered tens of millions of people trapped within its borders.
To help, the West should not only refuse to recognize the coup government but increase its contacts with Mr. Yeltsin -- and all the democratic groups of the Soviet Union.
But the policy of tying political and economic aid to one Kremlin leader has failed. It should not be tried again -- even if Mr. Gorbachev should somehow be politically resuscitated by his friends, or by the sword and shield.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates Plunge in Rush to Buy Bills

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's stunning ouster as president of the Soviet Union sent investors from around the world running for the safe, secure haven of Treasury securities yesterday.
As often occurs at times of crisis, short-term Treasury bills were the investment of choice, and interest rates fell sharply. Three-month bill rates fell well below 5 percent for a while yesterday, the first time they have been below that level since after the stock market crash in October 1987. Meanwhile, bond yields dropped below 8 percent for a time, at one point falling as low as 7.92 percent, their lowest of the year. 
 Traders said that profit taking began to emerge once it became clear that stock prices, which plummeted early in the day, had stabilized and were on the rebound.
 
'Things Have Quieted Down'
 "When the stock market stabilized and started to improve, there was heavy retail selling of everything from bills to bonds," one government bond trader said. "After a chaotic morning, things have quieted down a lot."
The movement into Treasury issues on such a tumultuous day seemed to serve as a counterpoint to the recent misdeeds at Salomon Brothers, acts that prompted some critics to question whether the giant firm's transgressions had compromised the market's integrity.
"If you recognize that the Government market is the highest-quality market, I don't think what happened at Salomon Brothers affects investment decisions that much," said Rao Chalansani, chief investment strategist at the Kemper Securities Group in Chicago. "The government market is much too big to be influenced by one party."
Traders said the sharp downward move in short-term bill rates yesterday made bidding difficult at yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills. But the auction results were about as anticipated, the traders said, and demand for the new securities was good.
 
Restrictions on Salomon
 As mandated by the Government on Sunday, Salomon Brothers was prevented from placing bids for clients at the bill auctions.
At the auctions, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.17 percent, down sharply from an average rate of 5.30 percent at last week's sale. It is the lowest rate on a three-month bill since the sale on Oct. 26, 1987, when three-month bills were sold at an average rate of 5.12 percent.
Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.23 percent, down from an average rate of 5.39 percent a week ago. The new rate is the lowest since Oct. 27, 1986, when six-month bills were sold at an average rate of 5.23 percent.
The unsettled situation in the Soviet Union increases the odds that short-term rates will fall further, analysts said.
Some added that the turmoil could be yet another reason why the Federal Reserve Board at its policy-making meeting today might decide to lower its target on the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market as well as its discount rate.
"The Soviet situation clearly creates uncertainty, both among consumers and businesses," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International. "When that happens, people tend to postpone decisions. To me the coup raises the possibility that the Fed might lower both the funds rate and the discount rate."
 
Money Flowing to U.S.
 Aside from being a mild negative for the American economy, a development that would favor lower interest rates, analysts said the Soviet situation would almost certainly induce some money invested in Europe to flow to dollar-denominated assets like fixed-income securities.
"International capital flows into the United States should heighten," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities. "Everything augurs for a firm bid on the bond, as well as the dollar."
After moving to new highs early in the session, bond prices ended lower on the day.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 100 7/32, down 1/4 point, to yield 8.10 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 10/32, down 2/32, to yield 7.82 percent. And the 6 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 1/4, up 1/8 point, to yield 6.18 percent.
In the secondary market for short-term Treasury bills, three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 5.08 percent, down 14 basis points, or 14-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 9 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.09 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Florida Power and Light Company, a unit of the FPL Group, offered $150 million worth of 30-year first-mortgage bonds through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 9 1/8 percent securities were priced at 99, to yield 9.223 percent, 1.12 percentage points more than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are nonrefundable for five years, are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In conjunction with its taxable offering, Florida Power and Light also offered $51.9 million of tax-exempt revenue bonds at various prices through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. These securities are rated A-2 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said prices of most issues were little changed in quiet trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to up 1/8 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
Excerpts From Bush News Conference on Soviet Coup: Hope and Warnings

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference this morning in Kennebunkport, Me.:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
While we're still watching the situation unfold -- and it still is unfolding -- all is not clear -- it seems clearer all the time that contrary to official statements out of Moscow that this move was extra-constitutional; outside of the constitutional provisions for constitutional change. 
 Clearly, it's a disturbing development, there's not question about that. And it could have serious consequences for the Soviet society, and in Soviet relations with other countries, including the United States.
 President Gorbachev is clearly an historic figure, one who's led the Soviet Union toward reform domestically, and toward a constructive and cooperative role in the international arena. And it's important to keep in mind the enormous changes that have taken place towards openness, towards reform, the changes in Eastern Europe, the new-found cooperation with the United States and others in the Gulf, and many other areas. There's a whole new era of cooperation, and we don't want to see that change, obviously. Now, Gorbachev's contributions have laid a foundation for progress that I am convinced the people in the Soviet Union want to see continue.
 
Calls to World Leaders
 This morning I've been in touch with other world leaders. I just hung up from talking to Chancellor Kohl. I talked to President Mitterrand. I talked to Prime Minister John Major. I'm sure I'll be talking to others today. I've talked to the Secretary of State.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 So what we'll do is follow the events very carefully as they unfold in order to determine the appropriate response that we, in consultation with our allies, should make. And we expect that the Soviet Union will live up fully to its international obligations, and clearly, any commitments that are outstanding on the part of the West will be judged and acted on in accordance with that statement that the Soviet Government must live up to its obligations.
 Obviously, the West is not going to retreat from its principles of reform, openness, commitment to democracy. And there's a lot at stake here. I don't know whether to take heart or not from Yanayev's statement that this does not mean turning back the reforms, but there was such a statement made by him. So the situation is still quite murky inside the Soviet Union.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Assessment of Yanayev
 Q: Mr. President, you know Yanayev. You mentioned his report the last time you were in Moscow. What do you make of him? . . .
 A: Well, my gut instinct was that he has a certain commitment to reform. The book on it so far has been something to the contrary, but I think, if not he -- him that is -- that he that is calling the shots, and you see some of the other individuals involved. They have been real hard-liners. One of the reasons that we have conducted our policy the way we have is to encourage reform and democracy, and I've said over and over again that we did not want to see a coup backed by the K.G.B. and the military, and apparently that is what is under way. I think it's also important to note that coups can fail.
 They can take over at first, and then they run up against the will of the people. So it's too early to say, but let's hope that Yanayev . . . was speaking from conviction . . . that this will not mean . . . setting back reform and commitment to go forward.

 	 	 		.. .	 	 Q: Mr. President, have U.S. forces been placed on any heightened alert because of this?
 A: No. . . .
 Q: Has the United States detected any heightened alert on the part of Soviet forces in Central Europe or in the Soviet Union?
 A: Well, I don't think there have been any changes there, but . . . certainly we've seen heightened use of Soviet force in Moscow and outside . . .
 
Background of Coup
 Q: What do you believe the motivation is, sir, behind the coup? Why did they remove him?
 A: We don't know that. . . . Clearly, some of the hard-liners have been concerned about the rapidity of reform. They've been concerned about the demise of the Communist Party per se. And . . . I think they've also been concerned about the Soviet economy . . . But the people's commitment to reform and democracy and openness is very profound. . . . I'm inclined to believe that, when people understand freedom and taste freedom and see democracy in action, that they're not going to want to change.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 Q: Mr. President, do you actually know who's in charge right now and, more specifically, who's in charge of the Soviet nuclear arsenal? Is that a great concern?
 A: Well, I don't imagine there's been any change in that. And we don't know who's in charge, except that they say Mr. Yanayev is in charge.
 . . .
 Q: Are you going to stop the process of economic cooperation that's been unfolding in recent months?
 A: I think things will be on hold. If we're going to set back democracy, set back reform, obviously not only the United States, but Europe will put things on hold as well.

Call for General Strike
 Q: Mr. Yeltsin seems to have called for a general strike in protest. Do you support that call?
 A: Well, we'll just see what happens on that.
 Q: Mr. Yeltsin has said that the Russian federation will not abide by the new decrees. Do you support that, sir?
 A: Well, I support what I've outlined here as our principles. And certainly I can understand where an elected leader like Mr. Yeltsin is coming from. . . . And I think what he's doing is simply expressing the will of the people there to have these reforms and have democracy, the steps already taken to democracy strengthened. And I hope that people heed his call.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 Q: Mr. President, what do you feel you could do at this point to effect events in the Soviet Union, if anything?
 A: There's very little we can do except to reiterate, in total cooperation with the European allies, our commitment to these principles of reform, and openness and democratic change.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 Q: Mr. President, you said the economic aid was on hold. What about the START treaty? Will you hold back on that as well?
 A: No. These treaties are in the interest of the United States, clearly. And they have said that all treaties will be abided by, and that's good. We don't want to go back to the cold war days, and we're not going to do that. . . . We're not going to go back to seeing Europe as it used to be, with Soviet forces into -- all through Eastern Europe.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 Q: How can you be sure the hard-line government will honor the terms of the treaty?
 A: Well, hard-line governments in the past adhered to certain treaties that were enacted, and so I don't think we need to raise that specter at this point. Obviously, if they weren't adhering to the treaty, . . . that would be a whole different ball game.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
A Militry Threat?
 Q: Mr. President, you say you don't want to go back to the cold war days. But at this point, do you feel that the Soviet Union may again be a threat to the United States?
 A: A threat in what sense?
 Q: Military threat.
 A: Well, I think we've always based our defense posture on the fact that Soviet missiles are aimed against the United States. One of the reasons I rejoiced in getting a strategic arms talk is that there . . . will be fewer missiles aimed against the United States. But nobody in their fondest dreams has suggested that that is not a problem.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 And if you think there's some concerns here about this, try talking to the Germans about it. They don't want to see the clock set back. Nor do the Eastern Europeans. . . . I don't want to . . . act like we're going to go back into a status quo ante; go back and encourage, through reckless statements, something to take place that would set the clock back to where it was before these changes under Gorbachev took place.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
Defense Chief Saw Gorbachev Hours Before Coup

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The Soviet Defense Minister, Gen. Dmitri T. Yazov, flew to the Crimea on Sunday and met with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hours before Mr. Yazov and other senior officials staged a coup and removed Mr. Gorbachev from power, according to Bush Administration officials.
 The nature of the conversations between the two men is not known, according to these officials, and General Yazov's flight has become a critical indicator only in hindsight as the Administration sought today to reconstruct the events of the weekend to understand the coup, which caught the world by surprise. 
Administration analysts today put two likely interpretations on General Yazov's mission. The first is that he flew to the Crimea simply to inform Mr. Gorbachev that he was being removed from power and placed under house arrest.
 If this was the case, an official said, the general may also have wanted to attend to security arrangements personally to insure the loyalty of forces that were to detain Mr. Gorbachev.
 
An Alternative Hypothesis
 The second interpretation, Administration officials said, was that General Yazov was engaged in last-minute negotiations to bring Mr. Gorbachev into the conservative camp and thus prevent the scheduled signing this week of a new union treaty that would have significantly diminished Moscow's power over the Soviet republics.
 "There are a number of things that indicate he was approached," a State Department official said, referring to Mr. Gorbachev. "But there's no evidence so far that rules out either hypothesis."
 "The other thing is that if they are going to go down and arrest him," the official continued, "Yazov would want to go down and make sure it happens."
 This official also said that today's statement by Acting President Gennadi I. Yanayev expressing the "hope that Mikhail Gorbachev, as soon as he feels better, will take up his office" was another indication that the conservatives may still be engaged in discussions with him.
 
Precipitous Action Seen
 Adding to the sense that the coup plotters acted precipitously, President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said Moscow's belated deployment of military forces to control the capital suggested that the coup plotters "had not completed their preparations before they did it."
 "It's interesting to note that in ordinary coups the tanks move about the time an announcement is made," Mr. Scowcroft said to reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that there was no military activity in Moscow early today when Tass, the Soviet press agency, announced that a State Committee for the State of Emergency had taken power. "The tanks didn't move for number of hours afterward," Mr. Scowcroft added.
 United States intelligence agencies were not able to give the Administration any specific advance warning about the coup, according to officials in a number of agencies that receive intelligence reporting.
 The coup caught both the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency off guard, according to Administration officials, though both agencies have been warning for months that Mr. Gorbachev faced formidable conservatives forces opposed to his reform campaign.
 "Although the intelligence community did not know the date and the time of the coup, there has been reporting on the possibility of a hard-liner crackdown for more than a year," an official said.
 "It was known that the military and security forces were unhappy with their diminishing role under a relatively weak center," the official said, adding that the hard-liners had also sought to help create a crisis atmosphere to justify their actions.
 Some officials inside and outside the Administration said warnings from prominent Soviet figures, such as former Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, who resigned his Kremlin post last week, should have been taken more seriously. Both men in recent weeks have been forecasting a hard-line crackdown.
 In Washington today, a former National Security Council staff member, Vincent Cannistraro, also asserted that raw intelligence available to Administration analysts would have sounded alarm bells earlier.
 Speaking to reporters before he left Kennebunkport, Me., to return to Washington, President Bush said there had "always been a concern" that Mr. Gorbachev would be overthrown.
 
Military Crisis Avoided
 Administration officials sought to play down any prospect that the Soviet Union's internal crisis could become a military crisis affecting its external relations, especially with the United States.
 Although the Soviet Union and its former allies in Eastern Europe have dismantled the Warsaw Pact military alliance, an estimated 250,000 Soviet troops remain in eastern Germany and 50,000 are in Poland.
 Pentagon officials said they had received no formal or informal warning from Soviet military leaders that a coup was under way. There has been no alert or unusual activity among the Soviet Union's strategic nuclear forces, which are the focus of the most intense intelligence monitoring.
 Mr. Bush said United States forces had not gone to any high state of alert, but officials said intelligence monitoring had increased sharply. After Mr. Bush's remarks, Mr. Scowcroft emphasized to reporters that "this is not a military crisis."

Chart: "Accords Threatened by Soviet Discord"
 
MAJOR PENDING AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS
 
Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe
 Conventional arms reduction treaty, with heaviest cuts in Soviet forces, especially tanks, has already been submitted to Senate. Action was likely this fall, but now is likely to be put off.
 
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
 First pact to lower the numbers of nuclear warheads, especially those carried by intercontinental ballistic missiles. Signed at the Moscow summit meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, the act is being refined to correct textual problems. Was likely to be considered by the Senate early next year; may be delayed further.
 
Trade
 A three-year trade agreement granting most-favored-nation status to the Soviet Union, and establishing various other conditions, such as copyright protection for literary and other cultural works and computer software, to promote trade and U.S. investment. Approval was considered almost certain after the Soviet Union passed a law formalizing free movement into and out of the country. The measure was considered likely to have been approved before Congress adjourned this fall; now it seems sure to be put off.
 
Joint Venture
 In the largest Soviet-American business venture ever, the Chevron Corporation planned to develop huge oilfields in Kazakhstan. It was unclear what effect the ouster of President Gorbachev would have on the deal.
 
Grain Sales
 President Bush has authorized $600 million in loan guarantees for selling grain to the SovietUnion and planned to authorize another $500 million in October and $400 million next February. Delays possible to put pressure on the Soviet Union, although grain-state lawmakers are considered likely to resist.
Lesser Agreements Signed at Summit
 
Airplane Hijacking
 Promises each country will use force and assist the other in criminal proceedings if a plane from one country is hijacked to the other.
 
Disaster Assistance
 Establishes exchanges of information and assistance.
 
Economic Assistance
 Approves U.S. technical assistance to the Soviet Union and its 15 constituent republics.
 
Medical Supplies
 Allows U.S. to fill critical shortages.
 
AREAS OF COOPERATION AND POTENTIAL AGREEMENT
 
Regional Conflicts
 Both superpowers have been trying to resolve conflicts in the Middle East by working together to encourage a peace conference that would bring Israel and Arab nations face to face, and have been urging Vietnam and other parties to the civil war in Cambodia to make peace.
 
Poison Gas
 The two countries have been negotiating bilateral and multilateral agreements to eliminate most chemical weapons.
 
AREAS OF POTENTIAL COOPERATION
 
 Discussions are in the early stages on whether the two nations can work together to limit the spread of nuclear weapons or missile technology, whether they can strengthen international institutions or develop new ones, and whether the can develop other areas of cooperation.

HEADLINE: MOSCOW AND THE MARKETS: Kremlin Shake-Up Jars the Financial World;
Stock Prices Drop In Global Selloff; Dollar, Bonds Up

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The world's financial markets reacted quickly and sharply yesterday to the ouster of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, with stock markets around the world falling as much as 9 percent. The American dollar soared 3 percent against some currencies as the uncertainty sent investors looking for a safe harbor.
 The Tokyo market was the first to feel the jolt and ended by losing nearly 6 percent, but as the trading day followed the sun westward and the immediate emotional impact of the coup wore off, some European and American stock markets regained a portion of their lost ground. And in morning trading today in Tokyo, prices were down only slightly at midday. 
The Dow Jones industrial average, after being off 106 points in early trading yesterday, closed down 69.99, or 2.36 percent, at 2,898.03, but military equipment and oil stocks defied the trend, holding steady or rising. The dollar, oil prices and gold came off their highs. [Pages D7 and D16.]
 
Iraqi Effects Cited
 Analysts argued that the impact on world financial markets of Mr. Gorbachev's fall would be less than that from the Iraqi invsion of Kuwait just over a year ago, although major markets fell two, three or even seven times as far yesterday as they did the day after the invasion.
 Oil prices rose, but not nearly as sharply as they did a year ago. The price of crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed up $1.17, at $22.47 a barrel. Many economies, including the American, are on the verge of recoveries after the recession that began last year. And there is a belief that the crisis in the Soviet Union could lead to lower interest rates as governments try to make money more readily available to help limit the impact.
 The flight from stocks also helped ease the pressure in bond markets, another safe harbor for investors in time of trouble. The move to the United States was reflected in the drop of three-month Treasury bills below 5 percent yesterday for the first time since just after the stock market crash in October 1987. Bond markets in Europe and Japan also fared better than their stock markets.
 
New Opportunities Seen
 And some analysts were looking at the sharp falls in many stock markets as new opportunities to buy quality stocks that are much cheaper than they were a week ago.
 Yet, the economies of many countries, including the United States, Britain and much of Continental Europe, are struggling to begin economic recoveries. In addition, before yesterday, many markets, including Germany's, had not even recovered all the ground lost in the Persian Gulf crisis.
 Some analysts said the latest jolt could trip up the economic recoveries. To have this impact, however, analysts say the Soviet upheaval has to dampen consumer and business confidence, a result that many do not expect unless the Soviet situation deteriorates significantly.
 "The worry that stock markets were reflecting today was that the impact of what happened in the Soviet Union would somehow find its way through and slow down the incipient recoveries" around the world, said Martin Paling, the international investment strategist for James Capel in London.
 "But the only way for that to happen is through falling business and consumer confidence and that is very difficult to forecast," he added. "The real problem is that at this time we haven't got enough to go on but there is a new element of risk."
 All financial markets are likely to continue to be volatile while the new hard-line Government moves to consolidate its control. But markets in the United States and in the Far East, are expected to be hurt less. They are farther away and have little trade or other economic relations that can be disrupted.
 The hardest impact is expected in Germany because of the Government's close role as a financial backer of Mr. Gorbachev; the threat of immigration because of the flight from countries bordering the Soviet Union and the presence of 372,000 Soviet troops in what was East Germany. Germany is also a major importer of natual gas from the Soviet Union.
 
Plunge in Tokyo
 In Tokyo, where the stock market was already weakened by a series of stock and banking scandals, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks was already off about 360 points when the news of the coup arrived. In minutes it was down by 1,000 points and closed down 1,357.61, off 5.95 percent, at 21,456.76. It fell 1.92 percent the day after the Iraqi invasion. At midday today it was off 36.48, at 21,420.28.
 In Germany, the drop was more severe. The DAX index of 30 leading shares plunged 155.40 points or 9.40 percent, to 1,497.93, which exceded the first-day drop after the Iraqi invasion, which was 1.24 percent, and was the largest one-day drop since the small market crash of October 1989.
 Other stock markets falling in Europe included Britain, where the FT-SE 100 dropped 80.5 points, to 2,540.5, its largest one-day drop since October 1989; France, where the CAC-40 fell 132.77 points, to 1,687.54, and Italy, where the Milan Bourse index dropped 79 points, or 7.23 percent, to 1014. The markets in Spain, Switzerland, Beligum, Norway and Sweden also fell sharply.
 The dollar rose the most against the German mark because of the impact the Soviet coup could have on Germany. After jumping to over 1.83 marks to the dollar, the dollar ended in New York at 1.8235, up 3.34 percent on the day. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose only 0.57 percent, to 138.15, reflecting the expected smaller imact of the crisis in Japan.
 For the impact of the Soviet coup to change the economic foreces that are pushing the world's economy now there would have to be an abrupt slump in both business and consumer confidence. If this happened, like it did during the Persian Gulf crisis, spending by business and consumers would decline and the economy would slow.
 But many analysts do not expect this to happen. "This crisis is localized," said Michael J. Howell, chief strategist for Salomon Brothers in London. "It will have fewer ramifications for the global economy because the economic fundamentals on the near-term baisis are not that bad." He added that its impact should be more like that of the Tiananmen Square massacre in June of 1989 in China when the Government crushed the democracy movement.
 In the United States, Fabian Linden, the executive director of the consumer research center of the Conference Board, a business research group, said he expected no signficant impact on business or consumer confidence because the Soviet coup should not have the fallout of the Persian Gulf crisis. "With the events in Iraq, we were deeply involved; there was talk of body counts and other dreary forecasts," he said. "There was the impact on taxes, on inflation and on oil prices and the cost of driving to work. These were things that really hit home."
 But George Mangus, the chief strategist at S. G. Warburg in London, said confidence had been hurt, which, he added, meant that Europe, outside of Germany, "could bounce along the bottom of this recession for considerably longer" and that doubts about an American recovery could deepen.
 The big risks now, said Paul Feldman, global strategist at Goldman Sachs & Company in London, was that oil prices could rise, there could be "blood on the streets" in the Soviet Union; American investors could pull money out of European stocks and there could just be a long period of volatility.

HEAVY ASIAN SELLING
 TOKYO, Tuesday, Aug. 20 (Special to The New York Times) -- Asian financial markets, which were the first to react to the Soviet coup, were hurt on Monday by a heavy wave of selling by nervous investors from Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur.
The huge Tokyo stock market fell almost 6 percent, while the Hong Kong stock market tumbled 8.4 percent. Stock markets in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur also took steep dives.
 Analysts suggested, however, that as the initial shock wears off, Asia may fare better than markets in the West. Asian economies, while vulnerable to any major shocks to the global political and economic system, generally have fewer direct ties with the Soviet Union, analysts said.
 "There are some ominous signs here, but in the longer term I would rather be in Japan than Germany," said Peter Norton, head of research here for Baring Securities.
 The Soviet shock waves hit an already weakening market in Tokyo and jolted it into a near free-fall just after midday. A series of financial scandals and worries that the economy is slowing have sent the market lower here for weeks.
The 225-stock Nikkei index was off about 360 points just before the first reports hit Japan. Minutes later, at 1 P.M. the index had fallen by about 700 points. At 1:04 P.M. the Nikkei average had dropped more than 1,000 points, or about 4 percent.
 The closing price of 21,456.76 on Monday, off nearly 6 percent, is close to what is considered the psychologically important 20,000 level. At midday today it was off 36.48, at 21,420.28.
 Mr. Norton of Baring Securities said much of the Monday selling came not from Japanese, but foreign investors worried about the impact of the developments in the Soviet Union.
 In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index had its sharpest decline since the Chinese Government cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square two years ago. The index fell 340 points, or 8.4 percent, to 3,722.
 In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrial index tumbled 84.51 points, or 6.1 percent, to 1,309.23. Nearby, in Malaysia, the Kuala Lumpur index skidded 36.19 points, or 6.7 percent, to 505.47.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
SHOCK IN EUROPE
 BONN, Aug. 19 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Soviet coup shocked Europe's financial markets today. Fearing a reprise of the cold war economic climate, investors sent stocks plunging while driving the dollar's value sharply higher in tumultuous trading.
 Economists said Mr. Gorbachev's removal and subsequent replacement by an emergency committee of Communist hard-liners might continue to roil financial markets until the situation in the Soviet Union stabilizes. Big losses on Wall Street would also weaken European share prices, despite the fact that the sudden change in the Soviet leadership was not seen endangering Western Europe's economic health.
 "I don't see any great economic effect on Western European nations since their ties to the Soviet Union simply aren't that big." said Ulrich Ramm, chief economist at Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt. "There could be short-term disruption of Soviet trade, depending on developments. And the markets may suffer because fantasies about the potential for business in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe are really gone right now."
 Should the situation in the Soviet Union deteriorate, the broader consequences of Mr. Gorbachev's fall could include at least a temporary freeze in Western economic aid to the Soviet Union. "There can be no money and know-how from the West for a return to totalitarian thinking," Germany's Economics Minister, Jurgen Mollemann, said.
 Many Western banks and businesses may share that view. They will immediately begin reassessing their strategies in the Soviet Union, said Jonathan Hoffmann, an economist with Credit Suisse-First Boston in London.
 Those factors helped drive prices sharply lower on Western Europe's major stock exchanges. The Frankfurt stock market was hardest hit, with the DAX index of 30 leading German stocks falling 155.40 points, to close down 9.4 percent at 1,497.93. It was the DAX's biggest one-day drop since October 1989 and prompted some comparisons with the global stock crash of October 1987.

HEADLINE: Under the Heel -- for Now

BYLINE: By Richard Pipes; Richard Pipes, professor of history at Harvard and author of "The Russian Revolution," was director of Soviet affairs in the National Security Council in the Reagan Administration.

DATELINE: MARLBOROUGH, N.H.

 BODY:
Today, Mikhail Gorbachev was to sign a new union treaty with the presidents of major republics. Its text has not been released yet but it was known to transfer much authority from the central organs of the Communist Party and Soviet state to institutions in those republics.
But the most reactionary elements in the Communist leadership -- die-hards of the party nomenklatura, army and K.G.B. -- pre-empted the event with a coup.
These elements had at first approved of Mr. Gorbachev's reforms because they promised to revitalize the country's economy and, by so doing, renovate the armed forces, the mainstay of the regime. But perestroika turned out to be more than they had bargained for. To energize the economy Mr. Gorbachev had to restore freedom of speech; freedom of speech led to the emergence of public opinion and the formation of political parties. 
 In the end, perestroika cost the party its monopoly on political life. At the same time, securing financial and technical aid from the industrial democracies required a less aggressive foreign policy, cutbacks in military spending and, in the end, the restoration of freedom in Eastern Europe.
The conservatives watched these developments with disbelief, then with dismay and finally with uncontrollable fury. For them, Mr. Gorbachev's support of the U.S.-led coalition in the gulf war seemed to have been the last straw: the allied victory, won with Moscow's diplomatic help, drove the final nail in the Soviet claim to superpower status. To exact punishment, they made the life of Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze intolerable, forcing his resignation in December 1990. More than anyone, he had been responsible for ending the cold war.
Preparations for a coup were already under way last fall. The signal was to be a crackdown on Lithuania, following which fraudulent "committees of national salvation" were to assume power throughout the U.S.S.R. In mid-January the plotters stood in readiness. Special forces massacred unarmed Lithuanian youths. But after an outcry, Mr. Gorbachev lost his nerve and called off the operation. Col. Viktor Alksnis, the reactionaries' spokesman, accused him of betrayal.
Two factors assured the inevitability of a military coup. One was the unprecedented degree to which Soviet generals presumed to criticize the Gorbachev Government openly for its laxness at home and concessions abroad. Such criticism ran contrary to the Russian Army's tradition and indicated that the disaffected armed forces had slipped from party control. The other was the conservatives' hostility to plans to decentralize the Soviet Union. Transferring authority to the republics threatened to emasculate the power of the party, army and K.G.B.
It was on such grounds that in November 1990 I thought it warranted on these pages to call attention to the possibility of a military coup.
The putsch this week is still too veiled to permit authoritative analyses. Some things, though, seem reasonably clear. One should not assume that the coup will succeed: most military bids for power fail, and this one may be no exception. Whether the generals establish effective authority or turn out to be paper rulers depends on several unpredictable factors: the resistance of the crowds, especially in Moscow and Leningrad; loyalty of the military and its willingness to fire on civilians; readiness of the bureaucracy, notably in the Russian republic, to take orders from the usurpers.
And perhaps, most important, it hinges on the courage and skill with which the president of the Russian republic, Boris Yeltsin, the generals' only credible rival, takes charge of the scattered democratic forces.
If the coup does succeed, its prospects for instituting a viable regime appear slim. The State Committee for the State of Emergency is made up of primitive personalities. One member, Vladimir Kryuchkov, the K.G.B. head, not long ago accused the West of using economic aid to subvert the Soviet Union. These people evidently have learned nothing from the crisis that has afflicted their country in the past decade. Notwithstanding Gennadi Yanayev's claims yesterday that he supports perestroika, he and the others believe in the golden age of Stalinism.
They want the union -- that is, the empire -- to be reconstituted in all its glory. This objective is certain to clash with the wishes of the non-Russian citizenry and virtually to eliminate the possibility of the Soviet Union being preserved. They have no idea of the complexities of modern industry, of the need for incentives and international collaboration. They are anti-Semitic and anti-Western. It is unlikely that such people, or those who stand behind them, will be capable of running the country for any length of time.
Nevertheless, the coup most likely has ended Mr. Gorbachev's political career. The Soviet leader managed to stay afloat by skillfully maneuvering between left and right. In following such a course, he left himself without a loyal constituency.
The new leaders, if they hang on to power, will likely make friendly overtures to the West. They know that to qualify for foreign assistance, they have to calm the anxieties of Europe and the U.S. But in the long run their presence in the Kremlin threatens world stability. The hard-liners are likely to rely on force to maintain power at home and to reclaim their status as a superpower abroad. We may assume that they will further delay the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland and Germany, resume large-scale aid to Cuba, Vietnam and other client states and sabotage the promised reductions in weaponry.
Unhappy Russians! The British writer Maurice Baring described them 85 years ago as a "people who have been longing for the dawn and condemned to the twilight." If any hope exists that this time, perhaps, the darkness will lift, it is that the past 70 years may have cured them of utopian fantasies and the past five years have rid them of fear.

HEADLINE: Deere Net Off 72% in Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOLINE, Ill., Aug. 20

 BODY:
Deere & Company today reported a 72 percent drop in its third-quarter net income. The maker of farm and industrial machines said a worldwide recession had dampened demand for its products.
The company's third-quarter net income totaled $31.3 million, or 41 cents a share, down from $114 million, or $1.50 a share, for the quarter a year earlier. 
 Revenue amounted to $1.79 billion, down 13 percent from $2.05 billion in the 1990 quarter.
Deere's stock closed today at $46.875, down $2.625, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
The Moline-based company predicted that conditions would not improve in the near future. Last week, Deere began labor negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union to replace a contract that expires Sept. 30.
In the first nine months of the fiscal year, Deere laid off more than 1,400 workers, cut production by 12 percent and reduced inventories. Deere's work force stood at 37,000 at the end of the quarter.
Deere's chairman, Hans W. Becherer, said the company expects a 17 percent reduction in production this year. "We expect farmers to remain cautious in making new product purchase decisions," he added.

German Unity: Paying the Bill

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHAT a difference a year can make.
When the eastern and western German economies merged in anticipation of political union last July, most analysts assumed that the east's financial troubles would be washed away in a torrent of Deutsche marks. Today eastern Germany is straining to produce two-thirds as much as it did in 1989, and T-shirts bearing the legend "Bring Back The Wall" are all the rage in Berlin. 
 Germany is not Romania: Bonn has committed to doing whatever is necessary -- including raising taxes and interest rates -- to sustain eastern Germans at a living standard other eastern Europeans can only dream about. But Janet Yellen, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, argues that the means to economic integration may matter almost as much as the end. By subsidizing unemployment rather than employment, she says, Germany is wasting productive resources and condemning millions to life on the dole.
Everyone knew that East Germany produced little the world coveted, save Dresden china and Olympic athletes. Somehow, though, hardly anyone inferred what now seems obvious: Once eastern Germans (and East Germany's former trade partners) were free to buy western goods, they would not settle for the shoddy old stuff, unless it was much cheaper. But by the same token, eastern Germany's factories would be in no position to cut prices to competitive levels unless they could cut wages to a small fraction of western German rates.
The Deutsche Bank, the largest private bank in Germany, estimates that the productivity of eastern Germans now averages just one-third of their western counterparts. But the difference is not reflected in wages. In fact, Ms. Yellen and three Berkeley colleagues, George Ackerlof, Andrew Rose and Helga Hessenius, estimate that at current compensation rates eastern industry can afford to employ only 8 percent of its pre-unification labor force. Their analysis was published in the first 1991 issue of the Brookings Institution's "Papers on Economic Activity."
The gulf between productivity and wages might be expected to hold down compensation. But eastern Germans, trapped for 45 years in a socialist backwater, are in no mood to wait for a better life. And German unions, fearful that easterners will compete for jobs in western German factories, are cheering them on.
This explains why industrial production in the east has already fallen by two-thirds, and why the Deutsche Bank predicts that total eastern employment will dip to five million by 1992, half the number employed in 1989. It also explains the Government's failure to find buyers for the great majority of eastern Germany's public enterprises. The Berkeley economists argue that the fairest and least disruptive way out of the bind is to subsidize eastern German wages. They estimate that Bonn could make it profitable to employ three-quarters of the eastern German industrial labor force at current wage rates by temporarily underwriting three-quarters of the labor bills of eastern factories.
The fairest way, they predict, would also prove the cheapest: Every 100 marks spent on wage subsidies would save 79 marks in unemployment benefits. And much of the rest would be recaptured in the sale of eastern German enterprises, many of which would become financially viable overnight.
German Government officials, however, are not buying. In public, they denounce the idea of paying eastern Germans to work. In private, they worry that wage subsidies would encourage labor to become more militant. And they fear that once in place subsidies would be impossible to remove.
Ms. Yellen concedes that the subsidy approach could prove an expensive mistake unless it was linked to a tough social contract that limited wage increases and set a timetable for phasing out benefits. But she thinks the practical alternatives are equally problematic.
Millions of eastern Germans do not have a prayer of finding work at home today, she argues, and will not for many years. The most ambitious will probably move west, draining the east of skilled workers needed for development and straining the resources of western German cities already bracing for a flood of refugees from the collapsing Soviet Union. Others will scramble from one temporary job to another, playing the social insurance system for maximum benefits. Still others will join the army of the chronically unemployable.
In the long run, western investment will no doubt eliminate east-west productivity differences. But in the long run, Germany could become a very different place to live and work -- one far less to the liking of its deeply conservative citizens.

Earnings Off For Dayton

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Dayton Hudson Corporation, the department store operator, said yesterday that second-quarter earnings skidded more than 32 percent amid the continuing slump in consumer spending.
The company said it earned $40 million, or 47 cents a share, in the quarter ended Aug. 3, down from $59 million, or 75 cents a share, in the comparable 1990 period. Revenue totaled $3.56 billion, up 10 percent from $3.24 billion a year earlier. 
 "We expected a tough first half," said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive officer of the Minneapolis-based retailer. "We have just started to see a modest improvement in sales in several difficult markets. However, we do not know what effect the events of the last two days will have on consumer confidence in the next few months," Mr. Macke said, referring to the ouster of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
Operating income for the department store division, which includes the Dayton Hudson and Marshall Field stores, rose slightly because of the contribution of the Field stores, the company said.
Dayton Hudson operates 733 stores in 33 states, including the Mervyn's clothing stores and Target discount stores. The company was particularly hard-hit by the weak economy in California, where one-third of its stores are situated.
Dayton Hudson's stock fell 62.5 cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, closing at $71.75.

Where Beauty Queens Preen, No Eyesores, Please

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand

 BODY:
The World Bank and Miss Universe are coming to town, and for that reason some of Bangkok's struggling poor have been told to move out.
Thousands of Bangkok slum dwellers have been ordered to leave their homes as quickly as they can. The first 2,000 must be out by October, when the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund open their annual conference in the new National Conference Center. As many as 5,000 others will be evicted before May, when the glistening conference center is the site of the 1992 Miss Universe Pageant. 
 Apparently embarrassed that the nation's spectacular economic boom has not provided for all of its citizens, the Thai Government has hastily put forward a "beautification" plan that calls for poor neighborhoods to be removed from the view of well-heeled visitors. It is the sort of story as likely these days in the developing world as it has long been in richer lands.
 
Put in Awkward Position
 Despite the protests of slum residents, most of whom do not want to go, the first were evicted from the jumble of tin-roof shantytowns in early August.
Bangkok newspapers have rallied to the slum dwellers' cause, and the publicity has put the Washington-based World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the first big guests in the conference center, in the awkward position of distancing themselves both from their Thai hosts and from the appearance, if not the reality, that thousands of poor people are being uprooted so as not to offend a group of Western bankers.
"We have never asked or suggested that this should be done," said Philippe Annez, the chief of the regional mission of the World Bank. "The Thai Government knows very clearly that we are concerned."
Boonnoeng Phanyong, a 42-year-old widow whose husband died of cancer in June, has been told she must leave her dilapidated one-room home and move her tiny papaya-salad stand out of the neighborhood.
 
'Government Is Ashamed of Us'
 "The Government is ashamed of us," she said, putting down the bamboo-handled knife that she used to chop greens and pointed to the sprawling glass-and-steel conference center across the street. "They do not want the bankers and the businessmen to see how we live."
The Thai Government insists that it has been planning since 1986 to demolish some of the slums. One of the shantytowns is on a draining ditch that the city says must be dredged to control street flooding; another is being torn down to build a road to ease traffic jams.
Thai officials acknowledge, however, that it took the October conference of the World Bank and I.M.F., which is expected to attract bankers, financiers and government officials from 150 nations, to make them act.
The two development organizations meet outside Washington every three years. In 1976, when they gathered in Manila, more than 400 families were evicted from slums there as part of what was described as a "beautification" campaign by Imelda Marcos.
 
What Might People Think
 Thai officials, stung by publicity over the evictions in Bangkok, now refuse to be quoted by name about the move.
But when the plan was made public in June, a spokesman for Thailand's National Housing Authority said the slums were "an eyesore in the heart of Bangkok" and might cause foreign visitors to think less of Thailand.
Thai officials also said they were concerned that terrorists might try to hide among slum dwellers -- a suggestion slum residents find laughable, if only because the overcrowded slums offer no privacy to anyone, terrorists included.
Under the plan, many will be moved to apartment developments going up only a few hundred feet away from their current homes.
Luan See Loh, a shopkeeper who has lived in the Theppatharn slum for 40 of her 60 years, said she would prefer to stay. "But the Government says I will not move very far and if the Government says we must go, we must," she said. "They say the new apartments will be nice."
 
Being Moved 10 Miles Away
 Others are being moved to developments more than 10 miles from the heart of the city -- a potential calamity for the many slum residents who sell candy or fruit along city streets, earning the equivalent of $3 or $4 a day.
Because of Bangkok's appalling traffic and its lack of reliable public transport, it will be hard for them to return downtown to work. There is hope, but no guarantee, that jobs may become available at factories near their new homes.
"If we leave here, we will be leaving our customers and our livelihoods," said Akaraj Chanpuang, the elected leader of the 40-year-old Klong Pai Sington slum. "I am a taxi driver. How will I find work so far from Bangkok?"
The hurried evictions are part of a larger problem in Bangkok, a city of more than six million people that is growing so rapidly and with so little planning that the whims of real-estate developers often force the poor from their homes.
 
1.3 Million Live in Slums
 As Thailand has emerged in the 1990's as one of the economic tigers of Southeast Asia, the capital, Bangkok, has turned into a congested boom town, with an estimated 1.3 million people living in the city's 1,500 slums.
Mr. Annez of the World Bank said he hoped and believed the slum residents who face eviction would be well compensated for their move.
As for the Thai officials overseeing the evictions, Mr. Annez has urged them to keep in mind that Bangkok has no monopoly on poverty -- that New York and London and Hong Kong and most of the world's other financial centers have their slums, too.
"The delegates to our conference have plenty of slums at home," he said. "They have all seen slums before."

HEADLINE: Potent Office Weaves Web In China Arms

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 20

 BODY:
If Western leaders want to know what they face in trying to get China to restrain its weapons sales, they might drop by the secretive office of Poly Technologies on the 17th floor of the Citic Building in downtown Beijing.
The efficient, well-equipped office is at the core of a remarkable Chinese military-industrial complex. Western complaints to China's Foreign Ministry about arms deals are unlikely to impress this company, which in some respects is more powerful than the Foreign Ministry itself. 
 Among those who have been active in Poly Technologies in recent years are relatives of President Yang Shangkun, Vice President Wang Zhen and Deng Xiaoping, the nation's senior leader.
The family links between Beijing's arms dealers and its top rulers appear to be one reason why China's weapons industry has rapidly become a major exporter in recent years, and why it will be difficult to curb. The West's arms control debate with China, far more than with other countries, involves links of family and friendship that are the veins of power in China.
 
A Holdout on Pacts
 While most major military powers seem to be moving toward agreement on curbs on the proliferation of arms, China stands out for its refusal so far to join the Missile Technology Control Regime, an agreement to curb the spread of missiles, although it says it is considering joining. China also has not joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but said this month that it would do so.
In recent months, China is believed to have sent Pakistan M-11 missiles, which can carry nuclear warheads and could be used against India. Beijing may also be sending Syria its new M-9 missiles, which would be able to strike targets throughout Israel. The Far Eastern Economic Review of Hong Kong reports in its current issue that up to 24 of the M-9 launchers already have been spotted in Syria.
Such sales may have been arranged through companies other than Poly Technologies. The common denominator is that the aim of such deals is not to cultivate friends or spread Communism, but a more capitalist motive.
"In the United States, arms sales are an expression of your foreign policy," a Chinese official said. "But in China, the reason for arms sales is to earn money."
Xie Datong, the president of Poly Technologies, did not respond to requests for an interview. Citic, the Chinese investment company that on paper is the parent of Poly Technologies, also declined interviews.
 
Like a Military Outfit
Other Chinese with knowledge of Poly Technologies' operations were more forthcoming. In interviews recently, they portrayed a sophisticated company run like the military organization it is, where employees address one another other by army rank and where Hong Kong chefs provide catered lunches.
"It started because the army general staff department wanted to have its own arms trading company, but it thought that it wouldn't be appropriate to do this openly," said a Chinese familiar with the company. "So it approached Citic, and Poly Technologies was set up on paper as a subsidiary of Citic."
Poly Technologies was formally founded in January 1984 with the approval of the State Council, China's Cabinet. It is registered as a subsidiary of Citic. In fact, Chinese say, it reports to the armament department of the general staff of the army.
Poly Technologies seems to be authorized to sell virtually everything in the Chinese arsenal, although the Central Military Commission must approve politically sensitive deals.
The most important deal arranged through Poly Technologies was the sale to Saudi Arabia of about $2 billion worth of Chinese ballistic missiles with a range of about 1,600 miles. That transaction, arranged in 1985, came to light in 1988 and caused a wave of indignation in the United States.
 
Car Stoned in Myanmar
 Among recent deals arranged by Poly Technologies was the sale of guns and ammunition to Myanmar, formerly Burma.
"Poly Technologies has an office in Myanmar, and when its car goes out on the street, it's sometimes stoned by the Burmese," said a Chinese who has worked for the company. "They think we're helping the Burmese Government suppress the people."
The first head of Poly Technologies was He Pengfei, son of a famous Chinese marshal. The son also rose in the army, and after heading Poly Technologies, he returned there, attaining the rank of major general and becoming director of the armament department, a vantage point from which he continued to oversee the company.
The next president of Poly Technologies was He Ping, who is married to Deng Rong, a daughter of Mr. Deng and now his personal assistant.
An article this spring in International Security, a scholarly journal, asserted that the Foreign Ministry had tried to restrain Poly Technologies but had had little success.
In one indication of where business is headed, Poly Technologies has recently expanded, taking up an entire floor in the Citic Building. Most of the employees are on loan from the army.
Morale is said to be high and job benefits substantial. The staff need not lunch in the regular Citic cafeteria, because the chefs of the Hong Kong-managed Windows on the World restaurant on the top of the Citic building send them lunches every noon. The price charged each employee is just nine cents a meal.

HEADLINE: Cuba Seeks U.N. Debate on U.S. Trade Embargo

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Calling the nearly 30-year-old United States economic embargo against Cuba illegal, unjust and a violation of the United Nations Charter, Cuba's mission to the United Nations said today that it had asked for a General Assembly debate on the issue.
Taking the matter before the General Assembly is seen as an attempt by Havana to help kill legislation pending in the United States Congress that would close one of the last and most lucrative loopholes allowing trade with Cuba. 
 "The issue is not if the U.S. will trade with a particular country," said the head of Cuba's United Nations delegation, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada. "but the U.S. has no right whatsoever to attempt to impose its own legislation over other sovereign states, as they are doing throughout the world."
A senior member of the United States mission said today that Washington was likely to oppose such a debate. "There is nothing in international law or politics that says all countries have to trade with other countries," said the American diplomat, who spoke on condition that he not be identified by name.
Before the embargo, the United States was Cuba's largest trading partner.
Mr. Alarcon de Quesada said at a news conference today that Cuba did not expect Washington to relent on direct trade with Cuba but that it hoped to put pressure on other countries that were host to foreign subsidiaries of United States companies to demand that those companies be allowed to do business with Cuba.
Originally, the embargo applied to United States citizens, companies and their foreign subsidiaries. But under pressure from allies, Washington in the mid-1970's eased some restrictions.
The relaxed guidelines applied the ban only on those foreign subsidiaries of United States companies headed by United States citizens and allowed trade with Cuba so long as United States currency or manufactured goods were not involved.
Last year, United States foreign subsidiary trade with Cuba amounted to $700 million and involved hundreds of companies, most of them in Switzerland, Canada and Britain, a Treasury Department official said.
An amendment sponsored by Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, would close that loophole and increase the embargo against Cuba to the level now imposed against North Korea, Vietnam and Cambodia. The Bush Administration, while eager to keep the economic pressure on Cuba, is opposed to the legislation because of pressure from allies.

According to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest rate publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., the rapid decline of C.D. yields has sent depositors reeling, since many of the traditional havens for depositor money are just as low, or even lower than current yields. 
 "The main competition for C.D. money is in the form of U.S. Treasury securities and money market funds, and they have tumbled just as fast," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of the weekly bank rate publication.
The unsettling international news from the Soviet Union has sent money flooding into the United States markets and into Treasury securities, pushing up the price of Treasuries and sending interest rates down. Mr. Heady advised depositors to stay short through this down cycle, staying with certificates of deposit with short maturities, so to be in a position to shift into a higher-paying certificate later as the economy recovers.
At the Treasury Department's weekly bill auction on Monday average discount rates, which have been down for four consecutive weeks including yesterday, showed a steepening decline for the second straight week. The three-month bill fell 13 basis points, to 5.17 percent, while the six-month bill fell 16 basis points, to 5.23 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Analysts note that the average three-month bill rate was the lowest yield since Oct. 26, 1987, when it was 5.12 percent, and the six-month was the lowest since Oct. 27, 1986, when it was 5.21 percent.
The largest yield changes in New York area banks this week were at Emigrant Savings Bank, which cut the yield of its money market account by 20 basis points, to 5.30 percent, and at Chase Manhattan, which lowered the yields on its three-month certificate by 27 basis points, to 5.07 percent, and its six-month certificate by 26 basis points, to 5.13 percent.
Among the commercial banks, an average money market account fell by 3 basis points, to 4.95 percent, with three-month certificates off 8 basis points, to 5.15 percent, and the six-month certificate down by 10 basis points, to 5.32 percent.
Depositors at savings institutions saw the average yield on a money market account fall 4 basis points, to 5.46 percent, and a three-month certificate fall 2 basis points, to 5.64 percent. The yield on a six-month certificate down 4 basis points, to 5.90 percent.
By comparison, 20 large banks around the country, all of which are outside the New York market, showed the average money market yield down one basis point, to 5.15 percent, and average yield of a six-month certificate down 7 basis points, to 5.47 percent.

Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, August 21, 1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

The Dollar Declines Slightly While Gold Is Also Down

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most major currencies in choppy dealings yesterday, as traders nervously tracked the rapidly changing developments in the Soviet Union.
Gold also fell, with gold for current delivery dropping $2.70 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, to a late bid of $355.90. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted an after-hours bid of $356 an ounce, down $2.20 from late Monday. 
 "Everyone has had an eye on the news," said Harlan Matusow, a trader with Bank Julius Baer & Company. "It's strictly a news follower's market."
The dollar traded most actively against the German mark, since Germany is seen as the Western nation most vulnerable to Soviet political and economic upheaval. In New York, the dollar fell to 1.7985 German marks, from 1.8245 late Monday.
The dollar, as a safe-haven investment, soared with early-morning reports that tanks were rolling toward the Russian Parliament building, then fell when the Soviet Vice President, Gennadi I. Yanayev, said he would not storm the building, said Gabriele Schmitt, a vice president with the Bank of New York. Mr. Yanayev heads the committee that ousted Mikhail Gorbachev Monday.
Although analysts said the market remained jittery yesterday, Mr. Matusow said that "everything seems to be certainly a lot calmer and a lot more diplomatic than it was" on Monday.
But the dollar eased even lower after afternoon reports of a shake-up among members of the coup committee. "It seems the chance that Gorbachev is going to come back into power is greater today than it was yesterday," Mr. Matusow said.
In New York, the British pound finished at $1.6440, up from $1.6255 late Monday. In London, the pound rose to $1.6380, from $1.6305 late Monday.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.62 yen, to 137.78 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 137.41 yen, and in New York, the dollar was quoted at 137.20 yen, down from 138.15.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Monday, included: 1.5432 Swiss francs, down from 1.5535; 6.1140 French francs, down from 6.1775; 1,340.50 Italian lire, down from 1,359.50, and 1.1417 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1431.
Commenting on precious-metals trading, an analyst with Barclays Bank said the metals came under selling pressure on rumors that Far Eastern traders were secretly acting as brokers for Soviet selling.
Earlier in London, gold fell to a late bid price of $355.50 a troy ounce, from $360.50 bid late Monday, and to $354.50 an ounce in Zurich, down from $360.70 late Monday.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Short-Term Rates Drop Further

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Interest rates on short-term issues moved lower again yesterday and bond prices rose as the continuing crisis in the Soviet Union gave investors ample excuse to redirect funds into high-quality, safe securities.
In addition to the Soviet crisis, traders said prices had also risen in anticipation that the Federal Reserve Board is about to lower short-term interest rates again soon and the idea that the economy may be falling back into recession. 
 "Given those three factors, how can you bet against the market?" one government bond trader said.
Compared with Monday, when trading activity bordered on the chaotic after news of the ouster of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, dealers said yesterday's session was much quieter.
"People are just waiting, but right now the fundamentals for the market are in pretty good shape," another bond trader said.
Traders hoping to see a sign from the Fed that it had eased policy yesterday were disappointed. The central bank refrained from conducting open market operations when the funds rate was trading at 5.50 percent, the rate widely seen as the Fed's current target.
 
Fed Panel's Meeting
 Market participants were watching the Fed's activities more closely than usual yesterday because members of its policy-making Open Market Committee were meeting in Washington.
Recurrent weakness in the economy and the positive inflation outlook have led some analysts to forecast that the Fed would move almost immediately after yesterday's meeting.
Steven Slifer, an executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers, is not among that group. But he added that he expected the Fed would not delay too much longer. Moreover, to restimulate the economy the funds rate, which the Fed trimmed just two weeks ago, may have to fall much, much farther, he said.
"I think they will wait for the employment report," on Sept. 6, Mr. Slifer said. "But we have a long ways to go on the funds rate," he added.
"In almost every other business cycle, the funds rate has had to fall below the inflation rate in order to promote a vigorous recovery. Given where inflation is now, and where I think it will be by the end of the year, I think that means the funds rate will have to get down to 4 percent."
 
Bill Rates Down
 The Soviet crisis and anticipation of a Fed easing move helped to push down Treasury bill rates again yesterday.
By late in the session, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.10 percent, down 5 basis points, or five one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates dipped 8 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.13 percent. And one-year bill rates fell 3 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.16 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 100 14/32, up 1/4 of a point, to yield 8.08 percent, down from 8.10 percent late Monday.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 17/ 32, up 7/32, to yield 7.79 percent. And the 6 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 11/32, up 3/32, to yield 6.12 percent.
Activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by an offering of $993 million issue of securities backed by auto loan receivables from a financing subsidiary of the Security Pacific Corporation.
The 6.70 percent securities, which have an average life of 1.34 years, were priced at $99.30 to yield 6.844 percent, 70 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 7/8 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for the transaction. The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, market participants said the prices of most issues were unchanged to up 1/8 of a point in quiet trading.
Meanwhile, municipal bond traders said the prices of most widely quoted tax-exempt issues fell by about 1/8 of a point. CS First Boston

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Coup Seen Aiding Stocks in U.S.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
WITH stock prices down on news of the Soviet coup, many American stock market strategists are arguing that the coup, and the resulting economic and financial impacts, made American stocks a much better buy.
"My experience is that these political events do turn out to be pretty transitory" in terms of market impact, Greg Smith, the chief strategist at Prudential Securities, said yesterday. But he added that the turmoil in the Soviet Union was likely to make investing in Europe less attractive, while improving the relative standing of markets in this hemisphere. 
 Mr. Smith recalled that the negative market reaction to the killing of Chinese students in Tiananmen Square had been brief, and that even the Hong Kong stock market later recovered from the shock.
Another widely followed market guru, Elaine Garzarelli of Shearson Lehman Brothers, said she was convinced there would be little if any harm to the American economy. "This makes us the strongest nation in the world," she said. "Our dollar will be stronger. It is good for us."
Mr. Smith said yesterday that he had recommended that institutions with portfolios split between stocks and bonds invest an additional 10 percent in stocks, raising that portion to 70 percent. The portion in cash was cut to 10 percent, while bonds stayed at 20 percent.
At Goldman, Sachs, Steve Einhorn recommended that equity portfolios go to 95 percent stocks, leaving only 5 percent for cash. That was a move of five percentage points, and the highest he had recommended in at least five years, he said.
"The Soviet event, in my opinion, should not disturb one's bullishness," Mr. Einhorn said. "It is bankrupt, and in no position to be belligerent to the West."
The bullishness was based in significant part on the reaction of markets on Monday, the first day after the coup. Short-term interest rates fell sharply, continuing a trend that has been under way for months. At the same time, stock prices tumbled around the world. Yesterday, rates moved a little lower, and stock prices staged a mild recovery.
Many measures of stock valuation are based in part on interest rates. Lower rates justify a higher level of share prices, all other things being equal. Mr. Einhorn said that before the Soviet coup, American stocks were mildly overvalued, based on averages, but now they were undervalued.
He said he expected share prices to rise well above fair valuations, in part because other factors were in line. "The economic fundamentals are still quite good," he said. "Inflation is mild and there is a mild recovery developing in the economy and in earnings."
One indicator Mr. Einhorn pointed to was the relationship of the dividend yield on stocks to the rate on Treasury bills. Dividend yields are near the low end of their historic range, at 3.2 percent, but with the rate on three-month Treasury bills falling yesterday to 5.12 percent, the ratio of the two is relatively high, and by itself would indicate that the stock market is 20 percent undervalued, Mr. Einhorn said.
Ms. Garzarelli said that largely because of the fall in rates, her indicators were now 90 percent bullish, an unusually high level and far above the 65 percent needed for a buy signal. She said she thought the Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 15.66, to 2,913.69, yesterday, could rise to 3,500 or more.
The low level of short-term interest rates has been a big bullish argument for several months, and the reaction to the Soviet coup simply stimulated those arguments. "The issue here, amidst all the fog, is that the Federal Reserve has every reason to keep interest rates on a downward path," Mr. Smith said. He said that was needed to keep the economic recovery from faltering.
Mr. Smith said he believed that the low level of interest rates would force many savers to take money out of certificates of deposit and put the cash into other securities, with some going into stocks and some into longer-term bonds.
Ms. Garzarelli said she discounted the possibility that the Soviet coup might damage the American economy, largely because she did not think it would force up oil prices and lower consumer sentiment, as happened a year ago following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. If she thought that was likely to happen, she said, she would be less bullish. Oil prices rose modestly on Monday, but slipped back yesterday.
Not all Wall Streeters are bullish, although the ones who are were the most vocal yesterday. David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, noted that while getting 5 percent on Treasury billls might seem low by recent standards, other markets could produce large losses.
"This uncertainty will take a long time to resolve," he said. "The moral of this story is to preserve what you've got from the 1980's. Safe, short-term investments are where you should be."

HEADLINE: Development Not Even a Contender on Brooklyn's Waterfront

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Three burned-out steel piers stand like eerily twisted skeletons in Upper New York Bay as teen-agers swim past the rusted shell of a half-submerged Chevy Cutlass off the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn. Just to the north, beyond the stench of the Gowanus Canal and a huge, unused grain terminal, a short-lived Port Authority project called Fishport stands empty, and row upon row of scofflaws' cars fill an impoundment lot.
Further north are the little-used piers beneath the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, the subject of long, bitter debate, and the industrial waterfront in Williamsburg and Greenpoint, where a few factories and waste-processing plants operate, but much of the land remains a foreboding, fenced-off no-man's land. 
 This is the north Brooklyn waterfront.
 
'Neglect and Decay,' and Studies
 Despite years of voluminous studies -- including a comprehensive waterfront plan being prepared by the City Planning Department -- much of this waterfront continues to suffer from "neglect and decay," said Marcia Reiss, the policy director for the Parks Council, a private group, and author of a 1990 report, "Creating Public Access to the Brooklyn Waterfront."
"No real changes, no development or creation of public access has moved forward substantially," she added. "The city has no comprehensive thinking, because they don't have the confidence that they will derive sufficient revenues from the waterfront."
There have been some commercial success stories, like the Red Hook Marine Terminal, the only active container port in New York City; the Cocoaport at the still mostly empty South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park, and the industrial revitalization of the old Brooklyn Navy Yard along the East River and the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park. But this winding, 10-mile stretch of waterfront is largely an economic, esthetic and recreational disaster.
 
Few Stevedores and Fewer Parks
 Commercially, it is a pale shadow of a waterfront once teeming with stevedores unloading cargo ships and bustling shipbuilding and repair yards. And, in the borough with the city's lowest percentage of parkland, virtually none of this coastline, with its views of Manhattan and New York's harbor -- is accessible to the public.
"New York City was built around the water," said Richard J. Aneiro, the president of the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation. "But it turned its back on the water because the city wanted to be white-collar."
Consequently, he added, as traditionally waterfront-based industry fled the city during the last 40 years, "nothing was done to develop industry -- only white-collar business and luxury housing."
Officials of the city's Planning Department, Economic Development Corporation and Department of Business Services -- which last month superseded the Department of Ports and Trade -- as well as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, all express cautious optimism about the waterfront's future, and point to a net gain in industrial tenants near the waterfront during the mid-1980's.
Yet, many Brooklynites feel frustrated and bitter about the waterfront, saying that New York City has done pitifully little to attract commerce or visitors to its waterfront, compared with cities like Boston, Baltimore, Miami and San Francisco.
"With the development on the Manhattan side of the river, the neglect on this side makes one angry," said Marilyn Gelber, the executive assistant to the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden.
 
Prostitutes Sleeping on Benches
 And Pompilio Rosario, who often rides his bicycle to the tiny, debris-strewn waterside park between the Amstar sugar factory and the Pfizer pharmaceuticals plant at the end of Grand Street in Williamsburg, said: "During the day, you see prostitutes sleeping on the benches. People leave garbage here and the city doesn't even put in garbage cans. It could be a lot better."
After World War II, waterfront businesses gradually left Brooklyn, as traditional cargo shipping gave way to giant container ships. Because Brooklyn lacked enough inexpensive land for container storage, much of the region's shipping industry moved to New Jersey, where the Port Authority developed container ports in Elizabeth and Newark. Many Brooklyn piers and warehouse sheds were abandoned and allowed to deteriorate. And the Brooklyn Navy Yard -- which employed 70,000 people at its peak during World War II -- closed in 1966.
The waterfront's problems are further aggravated by its divided ownership by a patchwork of city agencies, the Port Authority, New York State, private developers hungering to build and other individuals. Some disputed claims date to titles issued three centuries ago by English monarchs, said Ann Buttenwieser, vice president for waterfront planning with the Economic Development Corporation.
The number of groups involved makes comprehensive planning and concrete action difficult, said Alfred Ng, the director of Port and Aviation development for the Department of Business Services.
The north Brooklyn waterfront is in fact a series of somewhat discrete areas -- including, from south to north, Sunset Park, the Gowanus Canal area, the Erie Basin, Red Hook, Brooklyn Heights, the Fulton Ferry area, the Navy Yard, Williamsburg and Greenpoint. Each has its own problems, controversies and promise.
The Sunset Park waterfront, from about 69th Street north to the Gowanus Canal, illustrates both the legacy of neglect and successful attempts at economic redevelopment.
The 42d Street pier, known as the Camelot pier locally after a nearby restaurant, is one of several adjacent burned-out, garbage-filled piers whose contorted steel frames are gradually sinking into New York Bay. Nonetheless, fishermen come in search of porgies and bluefish, and teen-agers use a makeshift diving board to jump into water filled with abandoned cars and other debris.
"I don't care if it's polluted," said David Gomez, 18, one of a dozen Sunset Park youths swimming near the pier on a recent hot afternoon. "If they fix it up, we can't swim anymore. At least now we can have fun."
To the south are city-operated garbage-transfer terminals and a sewage plant.
Although the 110-acre South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park is only 10 percent occupied, more than 20,000 people work in the area between Owl's Head Park in Bay Ridge and the Gowanus Canal, according to Karen Burkhardt, the director of the Brooklyn office of the City Planning Department.
On the 39th Street pier, near several topless bars and the mile-long phalanx of mostly empty eight-story yellow-and-white warehouses known as the Bush Terminal, a pungent smell of cocoa fills the air. Brown 150-pound bags are packed 15 feet high in a warehouse nearly half a mile long. Some 200,000 bags have been unloaded from ships coming from West Africa and Southeast Asia in the last three months alone, said Dean Milone, a manager of the two-year-old Cocoaport.
North of 23d Street, where Continental Terminals unloads coffee, more desolation looms. The Gowanus Bay and Canal -- lined with more garbage-transfer stations, Hess Oil tanks and Con Edison generators -- remains a foul industrial inlet that has long been the butt of Brooklyn jokes. Further north, an arm of land forms the Erie Basin, where Navy and commercial ships are still repaired and garbage barges, with nets covering their mountains of debris, float past relentlessly.
 
Port Authority's Fishport Fiasco
 Amid this seascape of rusting piers and giant cranes is a recent Port Authority fiasco -- Fishport. In the late 1980's, the agency spruced up the southern flank of the Erie Basin to develop a commercial fishing center. About one year after opening, Fishport closed, and the pier is now incongruously used by a lobsterman to store his traps and by the city to store police cars and other public vehicles.
Along Van Brunt and Imlay Streets, Red Hook's main waterfront thoroughfares, homeless men sit on sidewalk sofas, prostitutes ply their trade, cars are stripped and drugs are openly sold near deserted red-brick warehouses. However, many small and medium-sized businesses like Mercedes Distribution, a data-processing storage firm with 150 employees, have moved into many of the area's old warehouses.
Beneath the Brooklyn Heights Promenade are a string of barely used Port Authority piers. In the early 1980's, the agency decided that it wanted to dispose of Piers 1 through 6, to let either the city or private developers transform the 60-acre parcel into housing, and for commercial and recreational uses. What ensued were several development plans, now defunct, and years of squabbling.
While the most recent proposal languishes, Mr. Golden and the Brooklyn Bridge Park Coalition -- a Brooklyn Heights community group that has developed an alternative plan including a park, marina and conference center -- are now calling for the creation of a new public authority like the one that developed Battery Park City in Manhattan to gain control of the site.
 
Navy Yard's Success Story
 Northeast of the Manhattan Bridge, beyond the industrial loft area known as Vinegar Hill, colonized during the 1980's by hundreds of artists, is the waterfront's other recent success story -- the Brooklyn Navy Yard. A decade or so after the Navy closed the shipyard, a publicly chartered industrial park began to emerge. Today, about 3,500 people are employed by 180 businesses -- from furniture and jewelry makers to ship repair companies and theatrical set designers -- which occupy the complex of century-old brick and steel buildings.
The northern end of the Navy Yard is also the city's designated site for a giant garbage-burning plant. The futures of an adjacent 40-acre Naval Reserve Station, recently declared surplus property by the Federal Government, and two privately owned sites in Williamsburg and Greenpoint, are also undecided.
Indeed, the waterfront's future remains very much in question. City officials concede that it is unlikely that major commercial, residential or recreational development will happen any time soon.
Instead, they see waterfront redevelopment as a delicate balancing act, in which fragile, existing industries are not driven away; new, light industry is attracted to areas like the Navy Yard and the Army Terminal; new housing is built in such areas as Red Hook and in severely overcrowded neighborhoods like Williamsburg, and recreation areas are created in Brooklyn Heights, on refurbished piers and at mall street-end parks.
"The future is not rosy and glory," said Mr. Ng, of the Department of Business Services, "but we're working with what we have the best we can."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
From a Pollutant, a Cleaner Fuel

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Despite recurring energy crises, the world has plenty of fuel. The problem is, it is in the wrong place or the wrong form. Coal does not run cars and trucks, and natural gas, because it is hard to ship, often runs nothing at all.
From time to time, desperate governments and venturesome capitalists try to produce diesel fuel and gasoline, the cream of the hydrocarbons, from natural gas or surplus coal. But usually these efforts are uneconomical. 
 Next month, a group will try a new method. A new refinery in Pueblo, Colo., will turn methane gas, a pollutant given off by decaying garbage, into diesel fuel. The fuel will be far cleaner, but no more expensive, than what is now available at filling stations. More important, the plant's builder, Rentech Inc., expects to make money.
 
Broad Expansion Sought
 Other landfills have burned methane to produce steam for powering factories or generating electricity, neither of which is needed in Pueblo. For the new plant -- called Synhytech, for synthetic hydrogen technology -- Rentech developed a patented catalyst that performs a key step of the operation. The new method could also be used to convert natural gas into diesel fuel in locations like Alaska that are too remote to justify building a natural gas pipeline.
At 240 barrels of products a day -- enough to fill one tanker truck -- the Pueblo plant is "a boutique refinery," said Rentech's president, Dennis L. Yakobson. But Rentech, based in Denver, believes that 100 landfills around the country could use the process. Rentech, which went public earlier this year and trades over the counter, hopes to license its technology to companies around the world. The stock, which is lightly traded, closed yesterday at $2.50.
The new plant's construction cost, $16 million, was put up by Fuelco, an unregulated subsidiary of the Public Service Company of Colorado.
Along with the diesel fuel, the Pueblo plant will produce naphtha and wax. Naphtha is used to make other chemicals; the wax, of a type mostly imported from South Africa, is used in everything from adhesives to lipsticks. The total value is about $60 a barrel, providing a satisfactory rate of return, Mr. Yakobson said.
 
52 Percent Methane
 Situated above Pueblo's 110-acre municipal landfill, the Rentech plant collects a gas that is 52 percent methane -- the main component of natural gas -- plus carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor.
The technology disposes of a hazardous pollutant; the methane is flammable and adds to global warming. The United States Environmental Protection Agency in May proposed regulations that would force controls on methane emissions at more than 10 percent of the 6,000 landfills now operating.
Mr. Yakobson said the technology would prove valuable in converting natural gas to liquid fuels in remote areas, where there is gas but no market for it.
In these cases, the gas has to be cheap to make conversion economical. If a pipeline is available to ship gas to a conventional customer, the gas price becomes too high for the Rentech process to be competitive. The Pueblo plant will pay $50,000 a year for its gas, which is found money for the local government but only about 60 cents a barrel of product.
Another group interested in the new method includes companies that drill offshore, where gas can be a nuisance or even an impediment. Some have found gas associated with oil, but the gas cannot be economically shipped by tankers, and pipelines would be too costly.
Normally, in such circumstances, the gas is reinjected underground, but in some formations this is difficult because pressures are too high. Marathon Oil, a subsidiary of USX, initially rejected the Rentech process but is reconsidering it because of recent improvements.
 
From Decay of Trash
 The Rentech process involves taking the carbon and hydrogen atoms that emerge in small molecules from the decay of trash, in this case as methane gas, and stringing them together into the giant hydrocarbon molecules found in diesel fuel.
Rentech mixes the methane, or CH<4>, and water, or H<2>0, at high temperature and low pressure, producing two gases, carbon monoxide, or CO, and hydrogen, or H<2>. These are fuels also, because they burn readily.
Some carbon dioxide that is also produced in the process, and some that is naturally present in the landfill gas, is removed using standard industrial methods.
Then the remaining gases are sent to a synthesis reactor, where an iron-based catalyst a little coarser than talcum powder absorbs the carbon monoxide and the hydrogen and strings them together in straight-line hydrocarbon fuel molecules. The company says the catalyst, embedded in molten wax, represents an improvement on the Fischer-Tropsch process developed in the mid-1920's and used by the Nazis.
The diesel fuel that results has several advantages over what is made from crude oil, according to Mr. Yakobson. It has no sulfur, a component that the Environmental Protection Agency is struggling to remove from conventional diesel fuel with progressively stricter limits. It also has no aromatics, which are harder to burn and thus are a source of pollutants, some of them cancer-causing.
The fuel is pale champagne-colored, with very little smell. Commercial diesel fuel is amber and has a smell well known to anyone who has visited a truck stop.
 
More Nitrogen Oxide
 The Detroit Diesel Corporation tested the fuel recently in a transit bus engine and compared it to No. 1 diesel fuel, an off-the-shelf formulation cleaner than the No. 2 diesel now sold in truckstops. It found substantial decreases in particulate matter, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, but an increase in nitrogen oxide, an ingredient of smog. Nitrogen oxide rises with combustion temperature, and the Rentech diesel burns hotter.
If the plant turns a profit, it will be standing on the shoulders of giants that collapsed before it. The biggest coal-to-liquids project to date was run by the Nazis, to provide fuel for the Luftwaffe and the Wehrmacht during World War II. South Africa, in response to international sanctions, also makes gasoline from coal, at costs that are secret but believed to be high.
Other efforts to make diesel from coal or gas are under way or planned. The Department of Energy announced on July 30 that it would put $5 million over the next two years into research on making liquid fuel from coal. The goal is to reduce the cost to $30 a barrel over five to ten years.
New Zealand, to reduce its vulnerability to international crises, heavily subsidized a plant that turns natural gas into methanol and the methanol into 900,000 barrels of high-octane gasoline a year. Opened in 1985, the plant has operated smoothly, "like a Rolls-Royce," said Bruce Wallace, a spokesman for Fletcher Challenge, a company that owns 75 percent of it.
 
Not a Commercial Success
 The rest is held by Mobil, which runs the plant. But the project is hardly a commercial success; it cost $1.2 billion to build. The New Zealand Government paid Fletcher Challenge to take the 75 percent stake.
Mr. Wallace said that given the amount the Government had invested, it would not have turned a profit for New Zealand until oil prices rose to $50 or $60 a barrel, more than triple current levels. If prices do go that high, someone might build another plant as a profit-making venture, he said. But as to when that would be, he said, "we probably wouldn't even ask ourselves."

GRAPHIC: Diagram: "Using Landfill Gas to Produce a Clean Diesel Fuel"
 
A plant designed by Rentech uses landfill gas, currently a waste product and pollutant, to produce a very clean diesel fuel as well as naphtha, a chemical feedstock, and a wax, used in products from textiles to lipsticks.
 
1. Gas from landfill: Landfill gas, mostly methane, but also carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor, is collected through pipes.
 
2. Gas compression and sulfur removal: The gas is compressed and strippe of sulfur, a mjor pollutant.
 
3. Steam reformer: Steam breaks down the landfill gas at high temperature into two gases, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, that can be burned as fuels, along with carbon dioxide.
 
4. Carbon dioxide absorber: The carbon dioxide is absorbed using conventional technology.
 
5. Carbon dioxide stripper: The carbon dioxide is purified and recycled into the steam reformer to improve the efficiency of the reaction.
 
6. Synthesis reactor: A catalyst stings the fueld gases into hydrocarbons and returns steam to the steam reformer.
 
7. Distillation column: The liquid hydrocarbons are cooled, producing diesel, naphtha and wax. (Source: Rentech)

HEADLINE: Dow Ends With 15.66 Rise; Early Rally Cut

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Stock prices yesterday regained part of the ground lost in Monday's slide, with many traders apparently believing that the Soviet crisis would have a limited impact on the American economy. Still, reports of tension in Moscow took some steam out of a strong early rally.
The Dow Jones industrial average took back nearly a quarter of Monday's 70-point loss, rising 15.66, to 2,913.69, after soaring 25 points at the opening. 
 Volume fell to 184.3 million shares, from 230.4 million on Monday.
"The market did not react as badly as many had feared," said Greg A. Smith, chief investment officer for Prudential Securities. "People realized that perhaps this thing isn't so bad for the economy."
Steven G. Einhorn, portfolio strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said that most investors saw the Soviet Union as "a bankrupt country that is economically distressed and doesn't have the option to be noncooperative with respect to the West."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.96 points, to 379.43, a rise of 0.79 percent. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks was up 4.41 points, to 502.05, an increase of 0.89 percent. The American Stock Exchange's composite index rose 1.39 points, to 360.30, a rise of 0.39 percent. And the New York Stock Exchange's index closed at 208.27, up 1.43 points, a rise of 0.69 percent. Advancing issues outpaced declining ones by 1,088 to 566.
As in the previous session, military equipment stocks continued to perform well yesterday. McDonnell Douglas rose 4 1/4, to 55 1/2; Lockheed was up 1 5/8, to 45 3/4, and General Dynamics rose 2 1/2, to 46 3/4.
Oil stocks also performed well generally. Triton Energy, an oil and gas exploration and development company, rose 4 3/4, to 43 1/4; Mobil was up 1 5/8, to 67, and Occidental Petroleum was up 1 1/8, to 24 1/8.
Westinghouse Electric was the most active issue on the Big Board, rising 1/8, to 22 5/8. H. J. Heinz, No. 2 on the active list, rose 1/4, to 45, following speculation that it might be a takeover target.
Shares of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, were down 5, to 128 1/4. The stock fell after more airlines joined in another round of fare discounting.
Deere was down 2 5/8, to 46 7/8, after the company reported a 72 percent slide in third-quarter profits.

HEADLINE: Airlines Speed Up Fare Cuts

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The airline industry is cutting its lowest discount fares more widely, deeply and earlier than it normally does at the end of the summer, a time when travel usually falls off and the industry puts in some lower fares to attract passengers.
Yesterday American Airlines capped a series of cuts in domestic fares begun by USAir on Sunday and matched by other major carriers. American reduced its lowest discount fares by as much as 28 percent on all domestic routes. 
 Typical savings for travelers will range from $60 to $100, but on some routes the reductions are more substantial. The round-trip off-peak super-saver fare between New York and Los Angeles will drop 28 percent, to $338 from $468; in peak periods the fare will be cut 24 percent, to $398 from $518.
The off-peak round-trip super-saver fares between New York and Miami will be reduced 24 percent, to $258 from $338, while the peak fares will fall 16 percent, to $318 from $378.
 
On Sale Until Oct. 31
 "The cuts are deeper than usual for the fall," said Ray Neidl, an airline analyst for Dillon, Read, "but they are not totally a surprise, taking into account the weak economy."
The fares, which were being put into computers yesterday, will be good for travel from Sept. 4 through Dec. 15, and will be on sale until Oct. 31.
The reductions affect only the super-saver fares, which are typically used by about 30 percent of those traveling. The figure is higher in the busy summer season because vacation travelers like to take advantage of the restricted fares. Tickets must be purchased seven days in advance, are nonrefundable and are valid only when fliers stay over a Saturday night.
Although some business travelers, particularly independent-business owners, are able to take advantage of super-saver fares, restrictions barring refunds and requiring a Saturday stay-over make them impractical for most corporate travelers, who require some flexibility in scheduling.
Moreover, airlines place limits on the discount fares for each flight, generally allotting more discount seats per flight on off-peak days like Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday.
Earlier this year the industry substantially increased some fares, particularly those used mostly by business travelers, and imposed restrictions that have made it more difficult for them to use discount fares.
Most other carriers, like United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which have already followed USAir's move by cutting fares on competitive routes, are expected to match American's across-the-board cuts.
American initially said it had tried to match USAir's cuts only on routes where it competed with the carrier, which has its hub in Pittsburgh. But as United and Delta joined in trimming fares, it made sense to extend the cuts to all its routes, said Tim Smith, a spokesman for American.
"The point came where it was easier to match it everywhere," Mr. Smith said.
Fares on some international routes were cut 15 percent last week by British Airways P.L.C., a step that was matched by American and United. Then Pan American World Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways lowered their ticket prices on some international routes.
Pan Am has distributed coupons through newspapers and travel agents for 25 percent off on flights to Europe, the Caribbean, Mexico and South America.
Northwest Airlines announced last weekend that it would cut fares by as much as 50 percent for fall and winter travel between the United States and London, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Glasgow, Scotland. The lower fares are available through Sept. 18.
Mr. Neidl of Dillon, Read said that once a major carrier like USAir made a fare cut, the other large carriers were virtually forced to match it to prevent losing their customers.
In addition to matching the USAir move, some carriers, including Delta and Trans World Airlines, said they were reducing fares on some international routes by as much as 50 percent.
American Airlines also said it would expand its Latin American Service from 142 to 181 flights a week, for an increases of 27 percent. American acquired the routes from Eastern Airlines.
The anouncement comes a little more than a week after Pan Am, which has a major presence in Latin America, received approval from bankruptcy court to sell most of its assets to Delta. The deal will make Pan Am a smaller carrier concentrating on Latin America.

The investigation of Salomon Brothers widened, and the shaken firm began to see the first significant client loss as the California Public Employees' Retirement System suspended business with the Government trading desk. [Page D1.] Other dealers in Treasury securities might have violated the Government's rule against buying more than 35 percent of the bills, notes or bonds at auction, Brady suggested. [D2.]
Peter S. Kalikow filed for personal bankruptcy protection and also put one of his property partnerships in bankruptcy. The New York Post and many other properties are not directly named in the filing, but could wind up as collateral for bank loans. [D1.] Kalikow went to The Post to reassure employees that the operation of the paper would not be affected. [D6.] 
 American joined other airlines in cutting the lowest discount fares deeper and earlier than normal for the end of summer. [D1.]
Metropolitan Fiber Systems announced plans to offer high-speed communications "superhighways" in several cities that are far faster than telephone lines now available. [D1.]
Mazda, in an evident appeal to violinists and lovers, has named its new luxury car "Amati." [D4.]
Reader's Digest named James P. Schadt, a soft-drink executive with no publishing background, as its president. [D17.]
Continental Airlines said it would lay off 600 employees and cut more than 100 flights daily. [D4.]
 
THE SOVIET CRISIS
European executives are prepared to do business with a more authoritarian Soviet Government, even one that came to power by unconstitutional means, as long as the situation does not degenerate into civil war. [D1.]
While leaders of the Soviet coup paint themselves as the true champions of reform, few Western analysts say they have the way or the will to reverse the Soviet economy's slide. [D1.]
World financial markets rebounded slightly after Monday's fall, but analysts warned of continued volatility. [D6.]
 
BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY
Despite recurring energy crises, the world has plenty of fuel. The problem is, it is in the wrong place or the wrong form. In the latest move to counter that, a Colorado refinery will turn methane gas, a pollutant given off by decaying garbage, into diesel fuel. [D7.]
To aid chair designers, a new software package can place a movable human figure onto a computer screen. [D7.]

Stock prices regained part of the ground lost on Monday, with traders apparently believing the Soviet crisis would have limited impact on the U.S. economy. The Dow rose 15.66, to 2,913.69. [D6.]
Prices of Treasury securities rose and interest rates moved lower again, as the Soviet crisis gave investors ample excuse to redirect funds into high-quality, safe securities. [D14.]
The dollar slipped against most currencies as traders watched Moscow nervously. Gold also fell. [D15.]
Prices of corn and wheat futures fell modestly and soybean futures rose as traders awaited word on how grain sales to Moscow would be affected. [D15.]

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
Changed Agenda for Moscow Envoy

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
For Robert S. Strauss, the Democratic elder and millionaire lawyer, the political chaos in the Soviet Union makes his mission as Ambassador to Moscow far different from what he envisioned when he accepted the appointment two months ago.
When President Bush selected him, he was expected to work with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and help him pioneer a way to a free-market economy. But now the coup by hard-liners has inspired questions of whether Mr. Strauss, who knows little about the Soviet Union and has only a smattering of Russian, is equipped to handle the very different challenges posed by the current turn of events. 
 At a news conference in the Rose Garden, Mr. Bush pointedly said that Mr. Strauss would not present his credentials to the current leadership, which the United States considers illegitimate.
Senior Administration officials said that unless Soviet authorities made it impossible, it was probable Mr. Strauss would attempt to meet with Boris Yeltsin, the President of the Russian federated Republic, to offer Mr. Bush's support to the democratic opposition forces. Mr. Strauss is also expected to ask to see Mr. Gorbachev.
"You go in there and use your own judgment," a senior official quoted Mr. Bush as telling Mr. Strauss at the White House today.
Mr. Strauss conceded to reporters after he was sworn in at the White House this morning that "circumstances have changed rather dramatically since I accepted this assignment. It's a different world." But in an apparent effort to point out that his strengths were still suitable to his task, Mr. Strauss added, "although the circumstances have changed, it seems to me that my mission remains basically the same, and that is to go to Moscow, speak very clearly, speak very plainly and, if necessary, with undiplomatic candor from time to time."
The Administration's original plan was to have Mr. Strauss, who is 72 years old, make his way to Moscow by the end of September after spending the summer studying Russian and being sworn-in just after Labor Day. But in the aftermath of the coup, Mr. Bush decided to have him dispatched to Moscow this week with instructions to demonstrate support for the anti-coup forces and assess the political crisis. Mr. Strauss left for Moscow tonight.
 
No Expert on Soviet Affairs
 "He was an interesting and creative appointment," said Dimitri Sims, an analyst of Soviet affairs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "But this is the time for sophisticated reporting. Mr. Strauss is not a Soviet affairs analyst, he has no network of connections in Moscow, and his arrival may create an impression that the United States is prepared to maintain normal relations."
"It is unfortunate timing," said Herbert J. Ellison, a professor of Russian history at the University of Washington. "What one needs now is someone with the kind of savvy about Soviet politics as well as skills in Russian language and knowledge of Russian culture possessed by the former ambassador."
A senior State Department official disagreed, however, saying that Mr. Strauss had the political expertise to be effective in Moscow. "He's a man of great energy and dynamism," he added.
 
Something of a Surprise
 Mr. Strauss's appointment to replace Jack F. Matlock, who retired, came as something of a surprise given that he would be only the second envoy to Moscow since World War II who was not a career diplomat or a high-ranking military officer. Mr. Bush passed over Edward P. Djerejian, a professional diplomat initially favored by the State Department, who is now Ambassador to Syria.
Senior Administration officials said Mr. Strauss's functions would remain fluid until the situation in Moscow became clearer. Mr. Strauss will return to brief Mr. Bush some time next week. A senior State Department official said it is doubtful Mr. Strauss would then return full-time to Moscow any time soon unless the coup against Mr. Gorbachev failed.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
BUSH SNUBS CHIEFS OF 'ILLEGAL COUP'

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
President Bush today told the leaders of Monday's coup in the Soviet Union that the United States would refuse to establish normal relations with them, and he telephoned Boris N. Yeltsin to offer support.
"We are not giving up on the restoration of constitutional government in the Soviet Union," the President declared as tanks maneuvered in the streets of Moscow, well before the first signs that the coup might have stalled. 
 Moving to coordinate his strategy with European leaders, who voted today to hold up most of the European Community's planned economic aid to Moscow, Mr. Bush dispatched Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. [Page A11.]
 
Envoy to Shun Coup Leaders
 After Robert S. Strauss was sworn in as the new United States Ambassador to Moscow, Mr. Bush appeared with him on the White House lawn. The President said Mr. Strauss would travel to the Soviet Union immediately as a special envoy.
But to symbolize Mr. Bush's determination to help Mikhail S. Gorbachev regain office, Mr. Strauss was instructed not to present his credentials to the coup leaders, indeed not to meet with them at all except in a dire emergency.
"We're making very clear to the coup plotters that there will not be normal relations with the United States as long as this illegal coup remains in effect," the President said, in a noticeable toughening of his language.
But Mr. Bush was careful to avoid threats and to sound cautious and measured. He said he had no desire "to see this turn into an East-West confrontation" and declined to say which United States-Soviet agreements would take effect and which would not.
"We're just sitting here for a while, leaving everything on hold," the President told reporters at the White House before returning to his vacation home in Maine. "We've just got to take our time, we've got to be prudent -- a word I think is applicable here -- and I think we've got to be strong."
But American officials conceded that there was relatively little anyone outside the Soviet Union could do to defeat the coup, and specialists in Soviet affairs raised doubts about the effectiveness of the attempt to freeze out the new regime in Moscow by political means and of the Western allies' moves to cut off economic aid.
Asked what specific help the United States could give the forces headed by Mr. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian republic, Mr. Bush replied only, "We're certainly going to offer encouragement in every way we can."
"You don't take freedom away from people very easily," he added. "You don't set back democracy very easily. Some coups fail. The likelihood of this, it's hard to evaluate in this circumstance. However, there appears to be very strong support from the people in the Soviet Union for constitutional government, for democratic reform."
The President appeared eager to identify American policy with Mr. Yeltsin, whom he had shunned for a time as a threat to Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Bush said of the Russian leader, who was elected in a landslide this year, "He's a very courageous man, and he said he's convinced the people will stand with him, and well they should."
 
Strauss's 'Undiplomatic Candor'
 Mr. Strauss said, in an uncharacteristic understatement, that "circumstances have changed rather dramatically since I accepted this assignment." But in an apparent effort to deflect suggestions that a Soviet expert rather than a corporate lawyer like himself is now needed in the Moscow embassy, he added, "It seems to me that my mission remains basically the same, and that is to go to Moscow, to speak very clearly, to speak very plainly and if necessary with undiplomatic candor from time to time."
Mr. Strauss left for Moscow tonight. White House officials said one of his first tasks would be to talk with Mr. Yeltsin, if the opposition leader remained at liberty when he arrived.
Mr. Bush also said he had sought several times to call Mr. Gorbachev, including one attempt this morning, but could not get through. The President did not say where he believed Mr. Gorbachev to be, though he is widely believed to be in a villa in the Crimea. The coup leaders have said Mr. Gorbachev stepped down for health reasons, but Mr. Bush, echoing other world leaders, said, "I must tell you I don't believe it."
Among the issues that the Administration is still reviewing are whether agricultural credits for the Soviet Union will be halted permanently, the status of treaties still awaiting approval by the Senate and the planned sponsorship with the Soviet Union of a Mideast peace conference in October.
 
Trade Status and Arms Treaties
 Senior officials on Capitol Hill said Congress almost certain not to grant the Soviet Union favored trade status and was unlikely to act on pending arms treaties when it returned from its summer recess next month.
Most Senators and Representatives who commented on the situation concentrated on attacking those who seized power. But as Mr. Bush himself noted in defending what he has done, there were criticisms of his policies from the right and the left.
Representative Bob Toricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, said the Administration had squandered "a chance to virtually remake history" by providing too little help for Mr. Gorbachev when he needed it worst.
Senators Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, faulted the Administration from another perspective, arguing that it had focused too heavily on Mr. Gorbachev at the expense of support for Mr. Yeltsin and other reformers. Mr. Moynihan commented, "There are a thousand ways to tell those people that if they lay one hand on Yeltsin they will be left to live off rotten cabbage for the next century."
But most political analysts said Mr. Bush found himself in a commanding position, with the emphasis once again back on foreign policy, his strength, rather than on what opponents say are his domestic-policy failures, which the Democrats have spent the summer attempting to exploit. One Democratic strategist commented, "He looks like the President of the world again, just like during the gulf, and that's very bad for us -- I have to admit it."
The President showed his confidence by deciding to continue his vacation, although he said that he would have "a more formal work schedule" than expected in the period before he returns to the White House on Sept. 3.

HEADLINE: Free-Trade Zone Progress

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Trade officials from the United States, Canada and Mexico said today that they had made progress toward setting up a North American free-trade zone, but that negotiations remained at an early stage.
"Fight as you may, you're not going to find that much controversy today," the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, told reporters at the close of a second round of talks. 
 The three countries want goods and services to move freely within a free-trade bloc of the continent's 360 million consumers, which would rival the European Community in size.
But labor leaders, environmentalists and other critics say the agreement would lead to an exodus of American and Canadian companies to Mexico to escape stricter environmental laws and exploit a low-cost labor force.
The trade officials said that they had no timetable for reaching an agreement, but that one was still possible before the end of the year.
The next round of talks would take place at Zacatecas, Mexico, on Oct. 26, when each country's proposals for reducing tariff barriers would be ready for discussion.
None of the trade officials would say how some of the social and environmental issues in the proposed trade agreement might be settled.
Labor leaders and environmental groups have complained that discussion of those issues have been secret.
Mrs. Hills said the agreement would raise labor standards. "It is a fact that as our economies grow, that there will be greater wealth for all."

HEADLINE: Papp Names Akalaitis to Step In As Shakespeare Festival Head

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL

 BODY:
Joseph Papp, the founder of the New York Shakespeare Festival and its sole artistic leader for 37 years, has appointed JoAnne Akalaitis to succeed him, effective immediately.
The appointment ends a year of speculation on who would take over for the legendary director and showman who introduced New York City to free Shakespeare in the Park in 1956, and who turned 70 in June. The choice of Ms. Akalaitis, 54 years old, who has been Mr. Papp's artistic associate for the last year, signals a major change in the programming direction of the festival, long considered the premier nonprofit theater in the United States. 
 A figure synonymous with the New York avant-garde, Ms. Akalaitis is better known for reinterpreting the classics than for collaborating with playwrights in the development of new plays and musicals, as Mr. Papp has done. He has provided Broadway with some of its biggest hits, including "A Chorus Line," "Hair" and "That Championship Season," and nurtured some of the theater's greatest contemporary writers, including Vaclav Havel, David Mamet, David Rabe, Caryl Churchill, David Henry Hwang, John Guare, David Hare, Wallace Shawn and Tina Howe.
 
Other Staff Changes
 In addition to the appointment of Ms. Akalaitis, other staff changes include the promotions of Jason Steven Cohen, from associate producer to managing director, and Rosemarie Tischler, from casting director to artistic associate. Mr. Papp will retain the title of producer.
Mr. Papp has been absent from the theater since last spring because he is being treated for cancer and recovering from the death of his 28-year-old son, Tony, a sculptor and jewelry designer, of AIDS in June. During his leave, the festival has slipped into a financial crisis that has resulted in an almost 50 percent cutback in the number of new productions this season.
Last week, Mr. Papp agreed to give his first interview since the spring. He has lost a great deal of weight, and when he crossed the room of his Greenwich Village apartment, his walk was slow and uncertain. But when he sat down to talk, his manner was as vigorous as ever. His determination to fight for the survival of his own theater, and of the theater in general, has not abated. And although his reputation in the industry has been as a maverick -- if not an egomaniac -- recent events seem to have mellowed him somewhat.
 
Didn't Know What 'No' Was
 "My life has been the theater," he said. "The idea of free Shakespeare happened because I believed it was good for the whole city. I was always a good organizer and I didn't know what 'no' was. When people told me something couldn't be done, I knew they were wrong. And I would just plow my way through. I never saw myself as a hero or as doing anything unusual. I never went to college. I have a real working-class background. But I knew the city and the people in it."
As Mr. Papp steps down as artistic director, his theater's operating budget has been cut to $10.5 million from last season's $13.5 million. Besides the cuts in production, the theater plans, for the first time in its history, to co-produce up to four shows with other nonprofit theaters in order to share expenses.
Forty-three staff members have lost their jobs, including 37 stagehands from in-house production shops -- scenic, costume, electric and props -- that have been closed.
Festival Latino, a program of Hispanic theater and film that has been produced annually for the last 15 years, may also be in jeopardy.
Compounding the institution's financial troubles is Mr. Papp's refusal to accept money from the National Endowment for the Arts. Two seasons ago, he disagreed with the agency when it withdrew its support from an exhibition by the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. The festival lost Federal grants worth $373,000 that year, and Mr. Papp refused to apply for funds last year.
Also in the last year, the festival's funds from New York City have been cut 33 percent, and from New York State 60 percent. Foundation support has shifted away generally from the arts toward health and social concerns, and corporate support is down because of the recession. Perhaps most important, the festival no longer has the profits of "A Chorus Line" to pay its bills. The show earned $38.8 million before it closed on April 28, 1990, after a 15-year run.
 
'You Can't Pigeonhole Her'
 But the tough economic times, Mr. Papp said, are an opportunity for the festival's rejuvenation, and he calls Ms. Akalaitis, who has directed at the Public intermittently for the last 15 years, the perfect person to guide it. "JoAnne has the most original mind in the theater today," he said. "As a leader, she is independent. She doesn't recognize boundaries and you can't pigeonhole her. She has great drive. And she is very astute about how the theater is run."
As might be expected, Ms. Akalaitis's new season will consist mostly of classics, albeit those that are infrequently produced. Bertolt Brecht's "Jungle of the Cities," a co-production with Mabou Mines, directed by Anne Bogart, will open the season, followed by "Pericles," the only Shakespeare on the schedule, starring Campbell Scott and directed by Michael Greif. Mr. Greif was chosen by Mr. Papp last season to be one of three resident directors at the festival, along with George C. Wolfe and David Greenspan. "Pericles" is his only production this season.
Mr. Greenspan, too, will have one production instead of three, directing a pair of new plays he has written, as yet untitled. Because Mr. Wolfe is directing a Broadway-bound musical this season, "Jelly's Last Jam," he will not direct at the festival at all. Instead, Ms. Akalaitis says, he will be a "curator producer" of a bill of solo performance artists who will appear at the theater.
The season will also include a double bill of Jean Genet's "Four Hours in Shatila," about the 1982 massacre of Palestinians in a refugee camp by Lebanese Christians allied with Israel, which Ms. Akalaitis will direct ("it is not an anti-Israeli piece," she said) and Dario Fo's "Story of the Tiger," directed by Chris Ashley, an artistic associate at New York Theater Workshop and an "up-and-coming talent," according to Ms. Akalaitis. She described the piece as "anti-Maoist."

 In a co-production arrangement with the Second Stage, "Before It Hits Home," a play by Cheryl West about AIDS and a black family, will be presented at the Public, directed by Tazwell Thompson, who did the play last season at Arena Stage in Washington. Ms. Akalaitis will direct John Ford's " 'Tis Pity She's a Whore," and Melia Bensussen, a young director who ran a free play-reading series at the Public last season, will direct Federico Garcia Lorca's "Blood Wedding," starring Gloria Foster.
Three more Shakespeare productions are tentatively planned for next summer, which would make four for the season. When questioned on the progress of the Shakespeare Marathon, Mr. Papp's plan to give American actors a chance to work on the classics by presenting all 36 of Shakespeare's plays, Ms. Akalaitis said, "I haven't even thought about that, frankly."
She did allow that the season she has chosen was "too serious."
"It sort of shook down that way," she said. "But you can't measure a season on how many times people laugh. If they need a giggle, they can find it in a John Candy movie. We will have funny plays and musicals, eventually, but this is a tough world."
Has she thought about how this season might appeal to a Public Theater audience accustomed to having its esoteric fare balanced by "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" or "Much Ado About Nothing?"
 
Wants a Wider Audience
 "I think it is hard to characterize the Public Theater audience," she responded. "It is wide and it should be wider. There should be more people of color."
Ms. Akalaitis said one of the ways she wanted to reach out to different audiences was to present the work of smaller theater companies that have lost their homes because of the recession. These would include Cucaracha, Baca and Home for Contemporary Theater.
Although Ms. Akalaitis has directed only one full production of a play by an American playwright (Len Jenkin's "American Notes," at the Public Theater in 1988), she said, "We have to be very aggressive in establishing connections." Among the playwrights she says she will pursue are Marlane Meyer, Suzan-Lori Parks, Tony Kushner, Elizabeth Egloff, Eric Overmyer and Charles Mee Jr.
These playwrights are mostly unknown to a large theatergoing audience, and their work will need financial subsidy. Mr. Papp realized early on that he could present plays by lesser-known talents by also producing plays and musicals likely to have a commercial future, often through transferring them to Broadway. Among Mr. Papp's hits were "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf," by Ntozake Shange; "Sticks and Bones" and "Streamers," by David Rabe, and the highly lucrative musicals "Drood," "The Pirates of Penzance" and "Two Gentlemen of Verona."
Ms. Akalaitis said she, too, was committed to the development of new musicals at the Public, though she admitted no knowledge of -- or interest in -- Broadway. "Believe me, I have nothing against money," she said. "But Broadway is not my scene. I think there should be people in this institution who can keep us involved there; it just doesn't have to originate with me. Theater should be pluralistic. We are talking about hiring a consultant to work as a scout for any musicals that are out there."
What would the motivation be for a musical team to go to the Public, instead of Playwrights Horizons or Lincoln Center, whose artistic directors have recently produced such hits as "Anything Goes," "Sarafina!" and "Once on This Island"?
"History, for one thing," she said. "The cachet of the Public and the promise of a first-rate production with a really great audience. But cultural institutions are not business institutions. We are about making art accessible and important. We are communicating."
One person who might prove helpful to Ms. Akalaitis is the actor Kevin Kline, who recently joined the festival's board and who will be in charge of an advisory board whose purpose, Mr. Kline said, is "pretty vague at the moment."
"It will be comprised," he said, "of the old guard who have worked at the festival and have a grasp of its ongoing philosophy, who will be part of the continuum."
What may not continue is the institution's refusal to apply for National Endowment funds. It is an issue that seems to find Ms. Akalaitis and her predecessor on different sides, and she declined to discuss it. "I want to talk to the board about it," she said. "I'm not sure how I feel, frankly."
 
Health a Priority
 Even so, Mr. Papp's commitment to Ms. Akalaitis seems solid. "I will not censor JoAnne in any way," he said. "She is the artistic director now. I'm the producer and can provide the overall view. It remains to be seen what will happen, but isn't that exciting?"
Perhaps, though many in the industry still cannot envision the theater without Mr. Papp.
His health, however, must remain a priority. "I've been going through treatment at Sloan-Kettering," he said, "as part of some kind of experiment that has to do with a new drug." And he added firmly, "It looks like I'm improving."
He said the death of his son, the youngest of five children, had hit him especially hard. "Tony knew all the songs, all the lyrics of all the shows we did," he remembered. "His artistic ability as a sculptor. . . ." He was unable to finish the sentence, looking suddenly like an old man.
"I still haven't been able to deal with that grief," he continued in a steadier tone. "It is the most grievous experience to lose this young man, at the peak of his artistic life and his youth. I found notes he had written saying his dad was a great guy, which made me feel good, because when you work so hard in your career you always feel that you are neglecting your children. But I taught him how to hit a ball, ride a bike. I spent a long time with him. He learned from me. And I learned from him." He shook his head. "Twenty-eight years old," he said.
He was told about an incident that happened at the festival last March, after he stopped going to the office. A maintenance man, a self-professed spiritualist, went into Mr. Papp's locked office to clean it. When he came out, he told a co-worker that he had felt "a cold wind in there" and didn't want to go back.
"I don't want to make fun of spirituality," Mr. Papp said, "but maybe a window was open. Look, why make it all so ominous? What's bad? People get sick, people die. It's the law of nature. The important thing is to maintain a positive attitude toward life. That's what gives me courage. I don't see life as something to dread."
He mentioned that he had been reading a new translation of the French classic novel "Les Liaisons Dangereuses," and he talked about the complexity of the language and how the adaptor had mastered it. "You know," he said with admiration in his voice, "there are still so many ways to say something new."

HEADLINE: Patients Refusing to Be Well: A Disease of Many Symptoms

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
THE young man said his head felt as if it were filled with cotton, his heart felt "weak," his arm was numb and tingled, his veins ached.
By the time he was referred to Dr. Arthur Barsky, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, he had been examined by specialists in infectious disease, endocrinology, allergy, kidney disease and neurology and was scheduled for tests at three different Boston hospitals. 
 But none of the tests showed any medical problems. "He just had the conviction he was sick, and so interpreted all his vague aches and pains as proof," Dr. Barsky said.
 
Many Unexplained Symptoms
 The young man is not alone. "Up to 50 percent of patients in physicians' offices are there for at least one symptom with no medical explanation," said Dr. Charles Ford, a psychiatrist at the University of Alabama who is a leading expert on hypochondria. "And 10 percent of patients have no evidence of any medical disease whatever."
Doctors, out of frustration, often dismiss such patients as hypochondriacs or "crocks." Sometimes the problems are with the doctors: the patients have real problems but the doctors cannot identify them. But often the patients are "somatizing," expressing emotional conflicts or the need for attention as physical maladies.
While in the past such patients shuttled from emergency rooms to specialists to medical labs, doctors are finding new methods to identify these patients and help them.
One motive for the recent interest in treating somatizers is economic. "Somatizers have medical costs 10 to 14 times higher than the national average," said Dr. Michael Kashner, a medical economist at the University of Arkansas medical school in Little Rock. Dr. Ford, who earlier this year prepared advice for the American Academy of Family Physicians on how to treat somatizers, said somewhere between $20 and $30 billionwas spent each year on unneeded health care for such patients. The cost is borne, not only by the individual, but by all those people whose insurance premiums rise because of these bills.
Of course, it is prudent to consult a doctor when there is a symptom of illness. And the symptoms that most commonly bring people to a doctor's office usually have no medical cause.
A 1989 study of 1,000 patients seeking help from internists found that the most common symptom, chest pain, signified a medical problem in just 11 percent of cases. For fatigue, the next most common, there was a medical cause in only 13 percent of cases. For dizziness, the figure was 18 percent.
 
A Step Further
 "Hypochondriacs carry it a step further," Dr. Barsky said. "Unlike most of us, they don't feel better when a doctor reassures them that there's nothing wrong."
He added, "Somatizers have the firm belief that they are sick and so reinterpret ambiguous sensations like dizziness or being out of breath as proof." The more symptoms they notice, the more anxious they get and this, in turn, makes them physically upset, thus providing them with still more symptoms.
One man Dr. Barsky treated feared he had tuberculosis and had a skin test for it. "For the test, they prick your arm," Dr. Barsky said. "Everyone gets a red flare for a while, but all that matters is what's there after 48 hours. His test was normal, but he remained convinced his initial skin flare meant he had TB."
Dr. Barsky's research suggests that hypochondriacs are prone to complaining about their symptoms in part because they are more sensitive than others to physical sensations in general.
In an article published this year in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, Dr. Barsky said a study of 41 hypochondriacs showed that compared with other people, the hypochondriacs tended to feel bodily sensations of all sorts more intensely and tended to interpret them as disturbing. While other people would see sensations, like cold hands or a twitching eyelid, as perfectly normal, the hypochondriacs seized on them as a sign of disease.
"If most people start to pay close attention to their throat, they'll begin to notice it's dry, scratchy and itchy, and try to clear it or start coughing," Dr. Barsky said. "That's a normal response, which comes from paying close attention to a bodily sensation. It's the hyponchondriacs who will then interpret that as a medical symptom of some sort rather than normal discomfort."
 
Counseling Distraction
 Because part of the problem for hypochondriacs is that they focus so intently on scanning their bodies for signs of disease, Dr. Barsky's treatment includes teaching them to distract themselves when they find they are worrying about some sensation.
Another facet of his suggested therapy for hypochondriacs is teaching them to relax. "When they're anxious, they get hypervigilant and start scanning their body for something worrisome," Dr. Barsky said. "If they calm down, they won't do that so much."
A third approach is to explain to those prone to hypochondria "what are normal aches and pains," Dr. Barsky said. "They have completely unrealistic views of good health, so they see any bodily discomfort, from a bloody nose or cramp to feeling dizzy, as a symptom" he said.
For many somatizers, the real problem is depression or anxiety. A study published in the Archives of General Psychiatry last March found that in 68 women who were somatizers, two-thirds suffered from depression and three-quarters had an anxiety disorder, like panic attacks. The study was published by Jacqueline Golding, a psychologist at the Institute for Health and Aging at the University of California at San Francsisco, and colleagues.
Psychiatrists say that when the underlying depression and anxiety are treated, the hypochondria often disappears. But because hypochondriacs are convinced that they have medical problems, it can be hard to get them to consider psychotherapy.
"Psychotherapy often is just not appropriate," said Dr. Ford said. "Somatizers get angry if you refer them to a psychiatrist, since they don't believe there could be a psychological cause."

HEADLINE: A Nation Hungers for Farm Stands And a Harvest Without Cellophane

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
LIKE steepled white clapboard churches, dusty Little League parks and weathered rail fences that cinch acres of corn, the roadside farm stand is part of the American landscape, a fixture in the national psyche. The sight of a wood plank set between sawhorses at the side of the road, buckling under the weight of tomatoes and corn, is enough to set most drivers' brake feet atingle and triggers involuntary rubbernecking.
It's hard to resist vestiges of a shared past. 
 The farm stand has entered the 90's: The wooden plank may have grown into a rambling food emporium; the local raspberry stand may have gone whole hog into mail-order jam; the local herbgrower might have moved his stand from the roadside to an urban farmers' market. But the farm stand essence remains: a link between farmers and those who left the farm, a world dependent on memory and the senses -- things that frenetic, modern life tends to blunt.
After decades of eating food encased in cellophane protection, more and more shoppers are reaching for naked, sun-warmed tomatoes, unwrapped lettuce, cucumbers with tender, unwaxed skin. The urge hasn't abated since John McPhee described the arrival of fresh corn at a New York City Greenmarket in 1976:
" 'The people fell on it, stripped it, threw the husks around,' " he writes, quoting Rich Hodgson of Hodgson Farms in Plattekill, N.Y. " 'They were fighting, grabbing, snatching at anything they could get their hands on,' said the farmer. 'It was as if there was a famine going on.' "
The famine was for personal contact as much as for fine produce, a hunger that hasn't been sated.
"It seems like the bigger and more sophisticated conventional supermarkets get, the more people want a connection with the people who grow their food," said Hilary Baum, a co-founder of Public Market Partners, a nonprofit group in New York City that has assisted 20 urban farmers' markets around the country.
Ms. Baum estimates that nearly 2,000 urban farmers' markets and thousands more farm stands have sprouted up in the past 15 years. Some urban markets allow farmers to sell only what they grow, while others are more lenient; most farm stands sell their own crops as well as produce that they have bought. Agriculture experts say that the amount of money that Americans pay directly to farmers has doubled in those 15 years and is now close to $2 billion a year, or 2 percent of the total that people spent on produce.
Changes in the nation's diet over the past two decades sent produce sales soaring, stoked an appetite for arcane greens and fueled a preference for organic fruits and vegetables. A bumper crop of farm cookbooks in 1991 -- "The Modern Country Cook," (Viking), "Food from an American Farm" (Simon & Schuster), "The Farm Market Cookbook," (Doubleday) and "Farm House Cookbook" which will be released by Workman in the fall -- say that the farm fixation is more than dietary. A steadfast piece of the American heart has sent customers to small, family-owned stands where the deals are person to person.
"Naturally," is how farmers and market organizers explain the success and the continuing evolution of local markets.
"Customers have a natural sympathy for the small farmer," said Robert A. Lewis, the chief marketing representative of New York State's Department of Agriculture, who helped found the Greenmarket in New York City in 1976. Direct marketing, he said, has been a "natural antidote" to the escalating operating costs and land values of family farms.
By becoming retailers, farmers weed out wholesale brokers, "natural predators," said Perry Kozlowski, a berry grower in Forestville, Calif., in Sonoma County. A small farmer who sells directly to customers can make up to three times the amount that one who sells to a wholesale broker can make, he said, adding that brokers also impeded a farm's "natural diversity."
"When my parents started this ranch in the 50's, wholesalers basically bought one kind of raspberry and one kind of apple," he said. After moving into direct marketing, the Kozlowskis began growing "golden raspberries, blackberries, boysenberries, strawberries," he said. "We grow what people want now, not just what wholesalers can ship."
Alexander Van Rensselaer, owner of the Hay Day farm stores in Westport and Greenwich, Conn., encountered a similar barrier between customers and the vine-ripened tomatoes that he began growing in 1970. "Brokers gave me these blank looks," he said. "They bought green tomatoes, and they had no idea what to do with a red tomato." He set up shop to sell his tomatoes.
For these growers, going retail with produce was the first step. Mr. Kozlowski's family now sells as much private-label jam as berries; Mr. Van Rensselaer doesn't grow tomatoes anymore. His orginal store has doubled in size; he opened a second location in Greenwich and this week he is opening Hay Day Cafe in Ridgefield, Conn.
But for other family farmers, growing new varieties of vegetables and fruits was enough. Inspired by chefs like Alice Waters, who opened Chez Panisse 20 years ago in Berkeley, Calif., and who says she spends "as much time shopping for diverse, high-quality ingredients as cooking," farmers across the country have planted new vegetable varieties that fetch premium prices. "When we started Greenmarket, it was basic corn and tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers," Mr. Lewis said. Today one Greenmarket farmer has 40 varieties of peppers.
Old-time farmers are amused at how urban farmers' markets have affected planting. They offer their own theory on the rise of baby vegetables. "You have to plant little things and herbs, stuff that has more value to it so you can pack a truck with a thousand bucks worth and make the drive worthwhile," said Edward Latham, whose 400-acre family farm at Orient, L.I., dates to 1805. "If you just grow corn or potatoes, you're going to need a semitrailer to make a day's pay."
But customer demand doesn't stop at the city limits. Ten years ago, Mr. Latham grew strawberries and his daughter sold them at a stand outside his farm. Today, six employees help sell the strawberries, plus the panopoly of produce, herbs and flowers at his stand. "It helps," he said. "A lot of neighbors who didn't go retail ended up selling out to developers."
There is an undeniable similarity between those who would buy the vacation homes built near Mr. Latham's farm and those who request bunches of hand-plucked baby lettuce or pricey little boxes of wild berries at the urban farmers' market 90 miles west. The yuppification of American farming is part of the current direct-market ecosystem.
But like most natural phenomena, the market for midget vegetables and arcane fruit is balanced by the enduring need for affordable healthy produce. American Demographics magazine found that direct-market customers were concentrated at opposite ends of the economic scale. "Consumers who buy food from farms tend to be older and relatively well-to-do or low-income and looking for bargains," the article said.
Public Market Partners concurs. "The rise in direct marketing is not simply about people who want to pay dearly for a perfectly dear tomato," Ms. Baum said. Markets in high-rent neighborhoods stock high-rent produce, but, she said, "Markets continue to thrive in inner-city areas by offering bargains for bulk buying of in-season produce."
City planners recognize the wide-ranging appeal of centrally located farmers' markets. "The market in Syracuse was originally sponsored by a civic association; so was the one in Buffalo," Mr. Lewis said. Tucson, Ariz., Lynchburg, Va., and Little Rock, Ark., have also created central farmers' markets to revitalize downtown shopping areas, Ms. Baum said. "It's gotten to the point that cities are fighting each other for farmers," Mr. Lewis said.
Everytown, U.S.A., wants Mr. Greenjeans. He is an antidote to the plastic-wrapped world of suburban shopping malls. He brings a timeless pageant that is as much about people as it is about produce.
Every Saturday morning a patch of asphalt in Carrboro, N.C., outside Chapel Hill, begins blooming before dawn. When the sky is still a tug-of-war between gray and blue, a battered Ford pickup rattles into the lot. It has a bumper sticker that says "I Own a Gun and I Vote" and it is loaded with tomatoes. A shiny Volvo station wagon with a Greenpeace decal pulls in. A rusty brown Buick whose front license plate says "Prayer Changes Things" arrives next, full of homemade pies.
"It's mountain mint week," says one shopper, divining the herbaceous perfume between the layers of sausage and biscuit smell, the coffee, cinnamony apple turnovers, basil and damp earth in the city's morning air.
"That's right, lady, and I got organic corn, yep," said Chester Copeland, a 68-year-old, fourth-generation farmer who is also the Carrboro market's manager. "Organic tomatoes. Touch 'em lightly, darlin'. Careful!"
"They can't keep their hands off," he whispered and then, hooking a thumb to the suspender of his denim overalls, he told how going retail had saved his 15-acre farm: "I was losing my shirt and then, see that guy over there? That hippie-looking type? He started this market. That was over 10 years ago and I'm doing real good. We get the society type and the college type and the family people, young, old, you name it. This is where the elite meet to greet."
He waved to a sprout-grower in the neighboring stand, raised his eyebrows and grinned. "I never thought I'd live to see the day," he said. "But they show me things and I show them a few things. It takes all types and it's fine with me. I see my friends. I sell my stuff. I'm staying alive."

HEADLINE: Louisiana Baffled by Vast Fish Kills

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 17

 BODY:
All across South Louisiana in this wettest of summers, the fish stories are depressingly the same: dead fish.
At last count, 750,000 fish had died: striped mullet, largemouth bass, yellow bass, freshwater drum, spotted gar, ladyfish, shad, buffalo, mosquito fish, carp, southern flounder, blue catfish and more. 
 What is killing them is not clear.
State environmental officials suspect a pesticide used in the vast fields of sugar cane that stretch along the waterways of south-central Louisiana.
State agriculture officials say they cannot blame the pesticide without more information, although they have imposed a temporary ban on its use.
Many people say the fish are dying for a combination of reasons: the heat, the pesticide and a runoff of various farm chemicals from some of the heaviest rain on record.
 
Unusually Massive
 The Federal Environmental Protection Agency says the kills dwarf the summer's other much-publicized environmental disaster, the pesticide spill that destroyed tens of thousands of fish in the Sacramento River in California. There have been 19 fish kills since early July, about half of them in Vermilion and Iberia Parishes, the rest in the parishes south and west of Baton Rouge. Two kills, in Bayou Lafourche and the Blind River, extended for 10 miles.
While it is not unusual to find dead fish floating on waterways in the steamy Louisiana summers, when oxygen in the waterways is depleted by the heat, this summer's kills are unusually extensive, and they have captured the attention of the region like the steamiest political scandal.
Sister Helen Vinton, a Roman Catholic nun who has become the state's most active lobbyist seeking safer use of farm chemicals, said the fish kills had brought attention to a serious problem in which Louisiana's farmers had grown much too dependent on chemicals. "We've used so many pesticides for so long," she said.
Sister Helen, a grass-roots advocate for displaced sugar cane workers, slipped almost unnoticed into the state bureaucracy in 1989 as a member of the Pesticide Advisory Commission, an arm of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry.
This week, the Agriculture Department, long regarded as more a friend of farming and industry than of the environment, banned the use, pending a review, of the pesticide azinphos-methyl, used liberally this summer to attack the sugar cane borer.
The department acted three days after a crop-dusting plane sprayed the chemical over the town of Grosse Tete, which lies alongside sugar cane fields just west of Baton Rouge. Six people were treated in hospital emergency rooms for complaints of burning eyes, throats, noses and nausea from the spraying on Aug. 9.
The pilot was arrested on charges of negligent injury and his license and those of two other pilots involved in spraying incidents were suspended.
The Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner, Bob Odum, assembled a panel of experts in an attempt to learn what has killed so many fish this summer and whether azinphos-methyl is to blame.
The panel, which is still investigating, said it was too early to know exactly what had caused the kills.
But one panel member, Paul Conzelmann, a biologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, said that 10 of the 12 kills he had studied showed classic signs of poisoning by the family of chemicals that includes azinphos-methyl.
According to the State Department of Environmental Quality, fishermen and others have observed crop-dusters spraying near or over bayous and canals before some of the fish kills. But some insist that the chemical is not the only culprit.
 
Pointing to Natural Process
 Norris Grabert Jr., a parish agricultural agent in New Iberia, said much of the problem was a result of oxygen depletion caused by the heat and by the runoff of organic matter from woodlands into streams in the frequent rains.
In New Iberia, where sugar cane propels the economy, the borer is a major villain. The farm economy is already vulnerable because of a killing freeze the winter before last. And last year's mild winter encouraged the borer.
Mr. Grabert said nearly 85 percent of the sugar cane crop had been attacked by the borer.
Still, thanks in part to use of the chemical, the crop is expected to be good this year.
The American Sugar Cane League, a farmers' lobbying organization, said that it was concerned about the fish kills and that if waterways were sprayed with pesticide it was accidental. But the group said that naturally occurring processes could be involved.
In most cases the fish have died by the thousands or tens of thousands, left floating in the waterways that help make Louisiana a fisherman's paradise and seafood an important business.
 
'Everything Was Dead'
 Describing several of the kills, Maureen O'Neill, a state water quality official, said: "Everything was dead. Fish, turtles, snakes, everything in the immediate vicinity."
The Federal Environmental Protection Agency said that if the pesticide was behind the deaths, the Louisiana kills would be among the largest pesticide-related kills of the past decade.
"More than 10,000 is an unusual occurrence," said Susan H. Wayland, the deputy director of the agency's Office of Pesticide Programs. The agency said at least 100,000 fish were killed in the Sacramento River. In one Louisiana kill, in Assumption Parish, there were more than 200,000 dead fish.
From her base in an old Cajun cottage near New Iberia, Sister Helen is riveting public attention on what has long been regarded as a nuisance to be endured like the humidity: careless crop-dusters.
She says the planes periodically dust people along with sugar cane, which stretches in long green rows across much of Southern Louisiana, nudging highways, homes and waterways.
Since her appointment to the nine-member commission, Sister Helen has been the sole commissioner calling for stricter control of crop-dusters and a public hearing into their practices.
The banned chemical is toxic to insects, fish and people, attacking the nervous system like a nerve gas used in warfare.
In Grosse Tete, which has 727 residents, the crop-duster exposed "the whole town" to the chemical, said Mayor Pro Tem Dolores Nall.
 
'An Ongoing Problem'
 "The plane got caught in the wind as the pilot was spraying," Mayor Nall said. "It was 6:30 P.M. and people were mowing their yards or relaxing in patios. People were overcome by fumes. This is an ongoing problem."
After a crop-duster flew low over Cesar and Ruby Romero's house near New Iberia on a breezy day last month, 400 catfish, 80 gamefish and 7 bass died in the spring-fed pond behind the house near the cow pasture. The plane flew close enough for Mrs. Romero to read its identification number.

HEADLINE: Rep. Harley O. Staggers Sr., 84, Democrat Who Aided Railroads

BYLINE: By NOAM S. COHEN

 BODY:
Harley O. Staggers Sr., a West Virginia Congressman for 32 years who is credited with helping to revive the nation's rail system, died yesterday at Sacred Heart Hospital in Cumberland, Md. He was 84 years old and lived in Keyser, W.Va.
Mr. Staggers died of congestive heart failure and respiratory failure, a family spokesman said. 
 From 1949 to 1981 he represented West Virginia's Second District, a sweeping mountainous region that covered the state's least populated areas. His son Harley Jr. has represented the district since 1983.
An old-style liberal Democrat, Mr. Staggers in the mid-1950's proposed the creation of a domestic Marshall Plan to curb unemployment and proposed the creation of a new Cabinet-level post, Secretary of Peace.
 
Daylight Time an Issue
 In 1966, Mr. Staggers won passage of a law requiring uniform observance of daylight-saving time. Referring to the confusion that the law was meant to correct, he said at the time, "It's a small thing, but it irritates thousands of people in this land."
During one hearing, he cited a Moundsville, W.Va., bus driver who encountered seven time changes while making runs to St. Clairsville, Ohio, a distance of about 20 miles.
That same year, Mr. Staggers became chairman of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. He used his platform to influence laws on energy, broadcasting, health and transportation.
He used his position in the House to insure that train lines through West Virginia continued to operate. He also helped convince the Department of Transportation to spend $120 million for the experimental Personal Rapid Transit system, which used computer-controlled passenger cars at West Virginia University in Morgantown.
But he also suffered setbacks that were unusual for a powerful committee chairman.
In 1971, he tried to force CBS to turn over to his committee the outtakes from a documentary on the Pentagon, but he was rebuked when the full House voted against his proposal for citing the network for contempt for refusing to comply.
In 1975, Mr. Staggers was ousted from the chairmanship of his committee's Investigations Subcommittee by those who thought the panel was inactive under his leadership.
In one of his last acts in the House, he successfully pushed for passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. The law brought about partial deregulation of the national railway system.
The act created competition within the railway system and with the trucking industry, and is credited by economists with making the nation's railroads more efficient. Economists who studied the issue have said the act saved at least $20 billion by eliminating wasteful train routes and encouraging competition.
"There's a consensus among economists that regulation was doing more harm than good," said Theodore E. Keeler, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies transportation. "That view certainly was vindicated."
Harley Orrin Staggers was born in a two-room log cabin in Mineral County, W.Va., on Aug. 3, 1907. He would have gone to work as a railroad hand, his son Harley said, had he not been a high school football star.
"He used to say that he wouldn't have gotten a college education without the sports," his son said in an interview yesterday. "Without that help he would have been in railroads."
Mr. Staggers graduated from Emory and Henry College in Emory, Va., in 1931. He was a college football and basketball coach, until he became a sheriff of Mineral County in 1937.
Mr. Staggers served in naval aviation during World War II and was elected to Congress in 1948.
In addition to his son Harley, Mr. Staggers is survived by his wife, Mary; another son, Daniel Casey Staggers of Keyser, and four daughters, Margaret Ann Staggers of Beckley, W.Va., Mary Katherine Staggers of Burlington, W.Va.; Frances Susan Tasker of Keyser, and Elizabeth Ellen Shank of Morgantown, and 10 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Governors Urge Overhaul of Health Care in U.S.

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 20

 BODY:
The nation's governors approved a policy statement today urging sweeping reform of the American health care system to make "health care affordable and available for all," but only after sharp partisan debate over whether to call for the Bush Administration and Congress to act by 1994.
The policy statement passed unanimously, reflecting broad agreement that there was a growing crisis in both the cost and the availability of health care, which the governors said was straining state budgets already pressed by the recession. 
 But the governors, here for the annual summer meeting of the National Governors' Association, divided along partisan lines when Democrats unsuccessfully sought an amendment to demand that the Federal Government overhaul the system by 1994.
While several Democratic governors said they had sought to prod both Congress and the White House, there was a clear focus on President Bush, frequently accused by Democrats of neglecting the domestic agenda.
"When the President of the United States places the full force of his executive leadership and the power of his office behind any issue, things happen," said Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, a Democrat. "We mobilized an entire country behind Desert Storm."
 
A Prediction for 1992
 Several governors did not attend the Seattle meeting. Democrats failed to get the two-thirds vote needed for the amendment to set a 1994 deadline (the vote was 19 to 17), but Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington, a Democrat who is retiring as chairman of the governors' association, predicted later that the health care issue would be at the center of the 1992 Presidential campaign.
Mr. Gardner said there would be a "chain reaction" push for change in the system, saying, "In my seven years in this association, I have never seen this intensity on an issue before."
The policy statement passed today asserts that Medicaid, the state and Federal program to provide health care to the poor, is "broken," has become "rigid and overly complex" and should be replaced. It calls for a new program to provide care to people with low incomes, including those who are working but lack health insurance. It also suggests that the Federal Government, through the Medicare program, pick up the responsiblity of providing long-term care for the elderly and disabled.
The statement also calls for new flexiblity from the Federal Government to allow states to experiment with ways of providing health care; many of the Governors here envision states' leading the way to a new health care system.
The bipartisan consensus behind this proposal, however, was overshadowed today by the intense partisan skirmishing around whether to set a deadline. "I hear Democratic governors ready to put the heat on Congress, which is controlled by the Democrats," said Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, a Democrat who led the fight for the deadline. "I don't hear the other side ready to put the heat on the White House."
 
'It's All Over; We Won'
 But Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, a Republican, dismissed the effort as simple politics. "That's all right," he said, "It's all over; we won. We got a good policy that was bipartisan to begin with."
Republicans opposed the deadline as unnecessary, unlikely to move Congress and unlikely to produce a good program if it did. The policy statement, as passed, calls for the White House and Congress to begin working with governors immediately to achieve reform.
The skirmishing was yet another example of Democrats' seeking to ratchet up the pressure on Mr. Bush over domestic issues, an effort that seems all the more difficult when overshadowed by the crisis in the Soviet Union.
This four-day meeting, which ended today, was consumed with the health care issue. The governors also passed a resolution deploring an effort expected from the Federal Government to curtail a widespread fund-raising technique used by states to pay for the care of poor people under Medicaid.
Under the new rules expected from the Federal Government, Washington would no longer match state spending for Medicaid when the state share comes from funds donated by hospitals or by taxes imposed on hospitals, nursing homes or institutions for the mentally retarded. Governors here said such a ruling would be devastating.
"This proposed rule will not play well in Peoria," said Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois, a Republican.

HEADLINE: When Parents and Children Go to School Together

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
In two portable classrooms, hardly more than construction trailers with desks and blackboards, two generations of students venture into often perplexing streams of printed words.
Set on a grassy elementary school playground in Louisville, Ky., one classroom contains preschool-age children, while a neighboring one contains their mothers. Three days a week they come to the same school -- traveling in the same yellow buses, eating meals in the same cafeteria, pursuing the same certificate -- as part of an innovative program to break the cycle of illiteracy and poverty in America and establish a foundation for learning and critical thinking among families at risk. 
 Two years into its mission the National Center for Family Literacy, a private, nonprofit corporation based in Louisville, has become the progenitor of literacy programs that serve parents and children as students in the same classroom. It supports programs in 32 states.
And the Toyota Motor Corporation recently gave the center $2 million to expand its work. The money is financing 15 new literacy programs, scheduled to begin next month as demonstration projects in five cities: Atlanta, Rochester, Tucson, Ariz., Pittsburgh and Richmond.
 
Higher Literacy Skills
 "We are trying to get parents to raise their literacy skills so that they can, in fact, support education in the home," said Sharon Darling, the center's founder and president. "We want them to also have skills that will help them be employable and skills that will help them be better parents."
The children, most of them 3 or 4 years old, are taught what early-education teachers call preliteracy skills -- how to express themselves orally, for example, and how to get along with others.
In a nation in which an estimated 87 million people are marginally illiterate, one in five cannot read at all and succeeding generations slip further into the haze of the chronically undereducated, the center's adult-child approach has an obvious appeal.
"I am convinced that 'at-risk' families can change their lives if provided the opportunity to learn together in an environment that constantly demonstrates and reinforces positive values," Don Seaman, director of the Texas Center for Adult Literacy and Learning at Texas A&M University, said of the program.
The program is sometimes called the "Kenan model," after the William R. Kenan Jr. Charitable Trust of Chapel Hill, N.C., which helped establish the Louisville center.
 
Study Finds Gains
 A recent study by the literacy center has found that once in elementary school, children who participate in Kenan-style programs outperform children with similar needs who do not receive such help.
Only 10 percent of the program's participants are considered "at risk for school failure" by their elementary schoolteachers, Mr. Seaman said; at least 75 percent rank in the upper half of their classes, and more than a third are in the top quarter. Without the literacy program's intervention, he said, 50 percent would be at the bottom of their classes and 25 percent would probably be held back a year before fourth grade.
None of the children in 100 participating families in Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia who were approached for the study had been kept back.
The study also examined how participating parents were affected. While the literacy program helps adults become more employable, the study focused on results not related to employment. Parents reported that the program helped them feel better about themselves and about participating in their children's school activities, including talking to teachers and administrators.
 
'I Read to My Child'
 One parent, Chloe Gentry, told researchers: "Now I read to my child almost every day. I sure didn't do that before."
All of the parents in the study were high school dropouts, yet half of them work as volunteers in their children's schools, the report said. Many parents said they now read newspapers, books and magazines for pleasure and visited the public library.
The typical adult participant is a 27-year-old woman who may be married and have two or three children. She is unemployed and has an annual income of less than $5,000; she dropped out of school in the 11th or 12th grade.
About 1 percent of participants are fathers, said Robert E. Spillman, vice president of the national center, and a small number are grandparents, aunts or uncles. In most cases, Mr. Spillman said, the fathers are either not available or are working and cannot attend the daytime classes.
Thousands of adults are participating in Kenan-model programs nationwide, Mr. Spillman said, including 1,300 in Kentucky alone. The center provides staff training and technical support for all the literacy programs. The center also helps finance programs involving research and development, such as the 15 model programs and a $100,000 center scheduled to open in Louisville in September, complete with a day-care program for children too young for existing programs.
The center, which will serve 30 families, will be operated by the Jefferson County public school system, which includes Louisville.
 
Joint Literacy Effort
 By contrast, the model programs are intended to demonstrate how various community agencies and organizations can create and sustain local literacy projects, Ms. Darling said. The three project sites in Richmond, for example, have brought together the public library, the Junior League, the United Way and the Virginia Family Literacy Task Force, among other groups.
Donald W. Ingwerson, the Superintendent of Schools in Jefferson County, said one reason for adopting a literacy program for parents and children was to reinforce the importance of education, but especially in adults.
"Many times parents have not had a good experience in our schools; consequently, when they are ready to send youngsters to us they are ambivalent," Mr. Ingwerson said. "They are not able to communicate good, positive feelings children need to have about school."
All that changed for Janie Smith, a 33-year-old mother of two who came to the program as a high school dropout wanting a better life for her children.
Last fall, Mrs. Smith enrolled in the program with her 3-year-old daughter, Charlie. By March, Mrs. Smith had earned her general equivalency certificate. By the summer, she and her daughter had received their literacy program certificates in a joint graduation ceremony.
 
Learning Is 'My Job'
 Eventually, she said, she came to think of the program as "my job." Now she is applying for jobs as either a teacher's assistant or a data entry clerk at a local bank.
Three days a week, from September through June, classrooms like those attended by Charlie and Mrs. Smith are alive with the commotion of learning.
Adult education teachers press the grownups to think critically while helping them master basic reading, writing and math skills. Parents are also taught practical skills like resume writing and job interviewing.
The children are taught preliteracy skills while being routinely treated to special guests: their mothers and sometimes their fathers.
Just before lunch, the parents come to their children's classroom for joint projects: some parents read aloud from books their children have selected, while others help their children write their own books, dutifully recording the tales the youngsters spin; still others just play.
 
Some Frank Discussions
 Later in the day, as the children take naps, parents perform volunteer duties in the school, working in the office or library or tutoring elementary school pupils. The last 45 minutes of the parents' more than five-hour day are devoted to parenting skills and an open -- and sometimes frank -- discussion about things like discipline and problems at home.
Karen Palmer, who is 30 and the mother of four, says she dropped out of high school because her mother gave her the impression that education was not important.
"If I said I was sick and just laid in the bed, my mother would knock on the door and ask me if I was going to school," Ms. Palmer recalled. "If I said no, she would never say anything. If she didn't care, I didn't care."
Her haphazard schooling, Ms. Palmer said, left her feeling "like something was missing."
She enrolled in the Kenan literacy program in part, she said, because she wanted to feel good about herself.She said she discovered instead that she must also make her children feel good about themselves -- that self-esteem is a cornerstone of educational achievement.
If, for example, her son, Reginald, acts up, "we choose a book to read, or lie down and watch TV," Ms. Palmer said. "I see now that I have to make him feel important."
Ms. Darling said she had heard similar testimonials from other students, and added: "You just can't teach a mother to read and expect that is going to make a difference in their lives. You can't pretend that it is an isolated literacy problem."

People Like Us

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
I went to the Soviet Union in 1987 with a group of American women. A delegation from the Soviet Women's Committee waited to greet us at the airport, just beyond the security kiosks. A guard noticed what I had not: that the dates of birth on my passport and my visa were different. He looked from one to another and I, an American child raised on Godless Communism nightmares and Red Menace movies, wondered whether I was in deep trouble.
Suddenly one of the Soviet women, the one we would come to love for her sly cynicism about the system, stepped forward with her clutch of ceremonial red carnations and barked out several sentences. The guard looked at my flawed papers one last time and then slowly handed them back. I had officially arrived in Moscow. 
 I felt as if I'd landed on Mars.
I felt that way often as I stood in line for old cranberries and carrots one day and carrots and older cranberries the next, as I heard stories of exchanging vodka and cosmetics for clean sheets in the hospital, as I visited college professors in a crumbling barracks of an apartment building, their perishables chilling on the window sills as mine had in my dorm days.
The everyday tales of the women I met in Moscow stunned me: the ubiquitous only children because the authorities would never assign an apartment large enough for more; the hours of grocery shopping because the stores were poorly stocked and reliable refrigerators scarce; the repeat abortions because the supplies of decent contraceptives constantly ran out. A poet poured tea in her apartment, the walls lined with books. The bathroom ceiling was falling in. "The apparatus does not work," she said, with an air of meaning more.
They were hoping for something better then; "glasnost" and "perestroika" were just beginning to be catchwords, and letters critical of the Government had started to pop up in newspapers, which made people scent possibility. We visitors already had something better; once we got past the paucity of comforts, the acceptance of economic failure, we discovered that our hosts were people like us.
We talked of our children, of women's liberation, of whether the Soviet Union was ready for democracy and whether America was as democratic as it thought itself. We complained of husbands who watched sports events and left wives all the work. The Soviet Union still seemed like Mars, but after eating dinner in their combination living-dining (sometimes bed) rooms, its people no longer seemed like Martians.
Over the last three decades, a succession of square gray faceless nonocrats have come and gone in the Soviet Union, and we hardly noticed, in part because we believed they led square gray faceless people, whose most signal attribute was that they were essentially different from us.
But in the last few years, with glasnost, openness, Gorbachev, we learned something new, about essential similarities. We have seen the people of the Soviet Union hold beauty contests and fashion shows, jam into churches, listen to rock-and-roll bands, battle for independence, even go to the polls.
This week we watched Boris Yeltsin climb atop a tank to exhort an uprising, looking like a Chicago pol on the hustings. A wall of Muscovites linked arms, a human wall like the ones we have seen around the Washington Monument in other freedom fights. And the occasional comrade walked by and said it was about time they threw the guy out.
Never are the differences between the Soviet Union and the United States clearer to an American child than when she wakes to find that one of the world's great leaders has been called in permanently sick by his opponents, with the help of tanks. Contraceptives, vegetables, apartments, economic hope -- all are still in short supply. A McDonald's does not a revolution make.
But the Soviet Union changed, and so did we. Its citizens began to become people to us, with their struggles and their seemingly hopeless hopes, instead of ideology in a boxy topcoat, and that is one of many reasons we are riveted today by their continuing drama. History is happening at this moment there. Because of the Gorbachev years, for many of us it is history with humanity. That alone is no small change.

HEADLINE: New York State Errs on Vocational Education

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Oregon attempt to educate technically minded students should be looked at carefully by the New York State Board of Regents (front page, July 24). The Regents action plan has so far been a dismal failure when it comes to the needs of vocationally oriented students. There is a greater incentive to drop out of school now that a foreign-language requirement has replaced industrial arts as a New York State requirement. 
 My experience as a high school English teacher has been that students from modest-income families prefer technical studies for social and economic satisfaction. American students, unlike their European counterparts, cannot take a ferry or train to end up in another culture with a different language. The reality here is that the standards of a modern European culture are being applied to a civilization 3,000 miles away. Language teachers who themselves travel over summer vacations often encourage their students to do so.
The children of the successful go. The children of the struggling middle class usually stay home. Many students feel that since firsthand experience is impossible, the study of a language is fruitless.
Industrial arts programs have been gutted in New York State. True, students may travel to a designated school for vocational subjects, but are then no longer able to engage in extracurricular programs. They are singled out as students of lower expectations. There is little doubt that the foreign-language requirement has acquired a high degree of social status. Whatever flaws were contained in the old program, at least it meant that there was an inherent dignity to a technical education. Building engines in metal shop was not a lower form of education. A Regents diploma was possible.
The new emphasis on a foreign-language requirement has left a great number of students alienated. The one choice for genuine achievement and satisfaction is now denied to them. Oregon, I believe, is making the necessary adjustment to America's student needs. Its flexible system is insuring less student frustration and, it is hoped, far fewer dropouts.

HEADLINE: What Banks Can Do That Nothing Else Can;
Think of Workers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Jay G. Baris may make some novel points in "Abolish Banks (Seriously)" (Op-Ed, Aug. 6), but he curiously overlooks one major problem. By abolishing the roughly 16,000 banks within the United States, including the American-based branches and offices of foreign banks, Mr. Baris will cheerfully send hundreds of thousands of people to the unemployment office, ranging from janitor to chief executive officer. 
 Furthermore, many companies that provide products and services specifically for banks will also begin to hand out pink slips, and the dozens of national and regional banking trade associations would also be forced to send their staffs to the want ads. And in a classic case of guilt by association, there could be layoffs in the media and the Postal Service because of the lost revenue from bank advertising and the voluminous bank mailings.
Of course, the money that's saved in deposit insurance can be used to pay the unemployment insurance benefits of these newly out-of-work individuals, but that's like trading in a bout with malaria for a bout with dysentery.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
Voices of U.S. Scholars: 'These Forces Go Way Back in Russian History';
Scholars See a 'Putsch,' a Gang of Rivals, and Analyze the Plotters' Chances

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:

Stephen F. Cohen
Professor of politics and director of the Russian studies program at Princeton University
For almost seven years, Gorba chev led a reformation which sought to reverse the Russian des potic tradition which existed long before the revolution. He sought to do this through political and eco nomic democratization and open ing the country to the West. 
 At the same time there have al ways been powerful forces that have opposed this for political, cul tural and economic reasons. These forces are not just Communist -- they go way back in Russian history. This has been an epic struggle. While this coup d'etat is a shock, it is not a surprise.
These people and the institutions they represent -- the military-industrial complex, the K.G.B., the party apparatus, the Ministry of the Interior and the state collective farm structure -- were the primary targets of Gorbachev's reforms.
In terms of our own foreign policy before this, I am of the view that we should have done much, much more for the Soviet Union and much more quickly.
But I don't know if that would have helped, if that would have stopped this. Let's say we'd committed $10 billion a year last summer. At least when these people were going to do this, they would have had to calculate, "It'll cost us $50 billion."
 
Gail Lapidus
Professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley
The key issues are the extent to which Yeltsin and the reformers are able to mobilize large masses of the population in defense of reform and democratization, then to what extent can they exploit the cleavages within the military and security apparatus.
The longer they wait, the greater the size of the crowd, the higher the stakes and the higher price they have to pay if they open fire. One serious option for them is trying to work away at the opposition slowly, to have creeping totalitarianism: shut down the media, isolate cities from one another, and then pick up an opposition leader here or there.
This conservative coalition is united on what it is against. It is opposed to reform, democratization, the opening to the West and the significant devolution of power to the republics and the secession of some. It does not have a coherent program of its own. Significant cleavages will come to the forefront as soon as it has to formulate its own political and economic agenda.
Some elements of the situation resemble events in Eastern Europe in 1989. But a much larger circle of people have a stake in preserving the existing system than in Eastern Europe.
 
Roald Z. Sagdeyev
Professor of physics at the University of Maryland at College Park, former director of the Soviet space program and a recent adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev
There are two things to watch. One is the potential political resist ance. We are already witnessing how the demonstrations are build ing up momentum. The second issue is whether the government will be successful economically.
I think it is absolutely excluded that they could change the eco nomic situation to the better. The very composition of the people in this committee makes it clear. Starodubtsev is an ardent enemy of private farming and Tizyakov launched the movement against privatization of state-run enterprises.
They try to avoid mentioning the analogy with Poland, but for the past year some of the top party leaders were talking about the model of Pinochet in Chile, to create order via military administration and allow development of an economy in an unpoliticized way. But the economy is in a shambles and you know you cannot put people back to work on the old premises.
My friends point out that in their rhetoric, the new people are not using Communist jargon. They are trying to paint themselves as apolitical, on the side of order and legality and against chaos and civil war. They're looking for the support of the working class and the privileged groups inside the military industrial complex.
 
Alexander Dallin
Professor of history and political science at Stanford University
It's curious that there's been no mention of Communism so far. I think it's probable there's some difference of opinion on that. Some think it's so unpopular that they can't use it. For some others it's still a rallying cry.
The thing that unites the new leadership is the effort to stop the reforms. What divides them is, first of all, different institutional loyalties.
The army is largely made up of enlisted men from different nationalities. They are much closer to the rank and file of the population and would be much more hesitant to engage the civilian population. I think there was some feeling in the army that it should not be used internally in the country. That's obviously not true of the Interior Ministry. The K.G.B. is less subject to that kind of pressure, though there are fissures there, too.
There are also rival personalities. There's no reason to think these eight people like each other.
 
Zbigniew Brzezinski
National security adviser to President Carter
This is a struggle between the future and the past, not two differ ent views of the future. In the long run, the coup will most certainly fail. There is no way of putting the old system back together with a military putsch. The Soviet Union is an anachronism and Commu nism is disgraced. The putschists represent a bankrupt past, in many respects a criminal past.
In the short run, this is a close call. I lean to the proposition that it won't work. In the next weeks and months it will become clear that this gang has no conception of what needs to be done. Social opposition will become more intense.
It's extremely important that the West give unambiguous, energetic political and moral support to the forces struggling for democracy. We ought to do what we can within reason to help the men in the trenches -- Yeltsin in Russia, Landsbergis in Lithuania, Gamasakhurdia in Georgia.
We could find the Soviet Union becoming less cooperative in the Middle East, stalling with the implementation of arms control agreements. They need not repudiate them. There could be the rapprochement of the international outlaws, like the butchers of Tiananmen Square. That is why we can't afford, from the standpoint of the immediate future and longer-range history, to take a stance that is passive.
 
Condoleezza Rice
Associate professor of political science at Stanford and former chief Soviet specialist on President Bush's National Security Council
The reason this caught me and other people by surprise -- there have been calls for things like this quite a bit. People here were inured to it. There was no reason to believe things were any differ ent, until now.
Success for the plotters would be if they were able, without mas sive bloodshed, to silence the democratic forces, to really go after the breakaway republics. It's possible that the leaders will huff and puff but when people go into the streets they turn the turrets of the tanks the other way. When Gorbachev was President, he didn't have the stomach for major bloodshed. But it's anybody's bet whether Pugo and Kryuchkov and Yazov do.
There's a lot of calling this a military coup. The military's involved. But this is a right-wing putsch. This is all the right wing. That makes it more dangerous. The K.G.B. has its troops, the Interior Ministry has its troops.
There are two possible futures. One is the coup fails, because they don't have the stomach to go through with it or it fails because people resist and that could be bloody. The other scenario is dark: that these people win and succeed through brute force to put people in their place.
 
Henry Trofimenko
Visiting scholar at the University of Maryland and former head of the foreign policy department of the Institute of the United States and Canada in Moscow
The people who were making the coup, they bank on the total dissatisfaction of the people with the economic situation in the country. A lot of people are clamoring for some sort of stability. If it's promised from different quarters they might be willing to go along for a while. These people can deliver some goods for a short period. But the crunch will come very shortly.
In the long run, without big structural economic reforms in the Soviet Union, the system is doomed and you cannot restore it by reverting to the old setup. It is not that the money from the West will or will not be forthcoming. That's irrelevant. The people who made the coup did it to refurbish the Communist system. They are trying to do what Gorbachev failed to do in 1985 and 1986.
Somebody also should have warned Gorbachev that the gimmick of national salvation committees that was tried by him in the Baltics could be later used against him. Also, by deliberately emasculating the power of the Supreme Soviet not long ago, Gorbachev foreclosed the option of an appeal to the Supreme Soviet, or the option of using the Supreme Soviet to override the coup.
 
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick
Senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former United States representative at the United Nations
I think it has already succeeded in the short run. It has succeeded in disrupting and presumably deposing the Government and tak ing control of the streets in the capital city.
But it's wholly impossible to predict the long-run consequences. It's not probable that the same group that undertook this effort will remain together in power for very long. It's an ad hoc group cooperating for this particular end.
We don't know enough yet about the character of this new group but they are bad news for U.S.-Soviet relations, bad news for Soviet-world relations, bad news for arms control, bad news for global and regional cooperative arrangements. We don't know if this is the kind of group with whom we could be partners in anything.
We know that there have been plenty in the Soviet military concerned about the fate of unsavory allies in the Middle East and elsewhere. The same groups who conducted this coup are concerned about maintaining Saddam's strength and Fidel Casto's arms flow and Assad's high-performance aircraft. It was Gorbachev slowing down the sale of arms to unsavory dictators around the world. Gorbachev's opponents are now in power.

HEADLINE: Newport After the Storm: Peevish but Still Standing

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWPORT, R.I., Aug. 20

 BODY:
Like a dowager who has taken a fall into the pool, this stately resort town calmly but somewhat peevishly began to wring itself out today from the hurricane that crashed through on Monday.
 Newport was the first significant city to be hit by the storm as it moved ashore, and it greeted Hurricane Bob with a kind of sturdy disapproval befitting a city that was once a summer home to the Vanderbilts and the Astors, boarding up its windows and firmly securing its yachts. 
The city seems to have been spared real tragedy; few serious injuries were reported and fewer houses were damaged more than superficially. But the hurricane, which hit at the height of the summer season, did not spare this city's elite as it raged up the coast.
 The hurricane damaged some of Newport's most fashionable beach clubs, deposited a few 45-foot yachts on the shore and felled trees across the lawns of the city's great mansions. And it left much of the city, rich and poor alike, without electricity.
 
Assessing the Damage
 Today, under steel-gray skies and an occasional squall, Newport stepped out to assess the damage, some of it physical and much of it psychological.
 Paul Pedro, who came to the Newport Yacht Club this morning to check on his 31-foot sailboat, Irie, found that he had become one of the thousands of Rhode Islanders to be inconvenienced by the storm. His boat had rubbed up against another one during the hurricane and was looking somewhat the worse for the experience.
 "Believe it or not," he said, pointing to the boat's name on the stern, "that's Jamaican for 'no problem.' "
 For visitors drawn to Newport for its beaches and waterfront estates, there was much to be disappointed about today. The estates, usually open to the public, were closed while crews worked to cart away the storm's debris. The beaches, some of them also open to the public, simply were no longer there.
 
A Shattered Holiday
 Clive and Anne Spicer, tourists from Wallheath, England, stared disconsolately into their sodas this afternoon as they considered what was left of their American holiday. They had hoped to go to Cape Cod but, because of the storm, had washed up on Newport instead. Now, with half the roads in town closed and the beaches washed away, there was not much for a tourist to do.
 "We had planned to take a nice seaside break," Mr. Spicer said. "Wham, that's gone."
 This afternoon it seemed that much of Easton's Beach, one of the city's largest public beaches, had migrated onto the nearby highway and then across the divider. The dunes were torn up, the blue and white cabanas shredded.
 The more exclusive Bailey's Beach was similarly damaged, its cabanas left in tatters and their contents cast out to sea. Among those who came to sift through the fashionable wreckage check at Bailey's, according to the local newspaper, The Newport Daily News, were Annie-Laurie and Alexander von Auersperg, the children of Martha von Bulow.
 
Power Failure Persists
 With the beach clubs torn up and the National Guard called in to direct traffic, many store owners said they feared that the wealthy who summer in Newport would leave, taking their wallets with them.
 "The economy has not been good, and this does not help," said Cathy Loughlin, who was trying to sell an expensive array of model ships and leather luggage.
 To many Newport residents the most annoying legacy of the hurricane was the persistent power failure. Electricity in the city was still spotty today, and many stores and restaurants remained closed. Residents were warned that it might take several days before all the power was restored, and radio talk shows were flooded with calls blaming everything from unions to corporate greed for the continuing problem.
 "I haven't seen any utility trucks out here," said Ron Lurgio, who was clearing fallen branches from his yard. "We'd like to take showers again. We'd like to be able to flush the john."
 
1938 Hurricane Recalled
 Despite the complaints, though, many people were ready to declare that the storm, while a pain, was really rather tame compared with some of its predecessors.
 Newport, which sits on an island that juts out into the Atlantic, has been hit by several memorable storms this century, including Hurricane Carol in 1954 and an unnamed hurricane in 1938 that killed more than 250 Rhode Islanders.
 Madelyne Gillespie, who was working at Woolworth's in Providence when the 1938 hurricane struck, recalled that the flood waters reached up to the second floor in that storm. The memory of Hurricane Bob, she said, would probably soon fade.
 "This one," she added, "wasn't really very bad, was it?"

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET CRISIS;
Excerpts From Bush's Talk: 'You Don't Set Back Democracy Very Easily'

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference this morning:
 
BUSH'S STATEMENT
Well, events in the Soviet Union continue to deeply concern the whole world. The unconstitutional seizure of power is an affront to the goals and aspirations that the Soviet peoples have been nurturing over the past years. This action also puts the Soviet Union at odds with the world community and undermines the positive steps that had been undertaken to make the Soviet Union an integral and positive force in world affairs. 
 I have this morning spoken with Boris Yeltsin, the freely elected leader of the Russian republic, and I assured Mr. Yeltsin of continued U.S. support for his goal of the restoration of Mr. Gorbachev as the constitutionally chosen leader. And I also shared with him the support that other world leaders voiced in my several conversations yesterday, conversations I had with those leaders in Eastern Europe and leaders in Western Europe as well, and Prime Minister Kaifu. And I gave him that reassurance.
 Mr. Yeltsin is encouraged by the support of the Soviet people and their determination in the face of these trying circumstances. He expressed our gratitude -- his gratitude for our support of him and President Gorbachev. The situation concerning President Gorbachev's status is still unclear, and I have twice tried to reach him by phone, including within the last hour, but have so far been unsuccessful.
 We continue to closely monitor this situation. Our new, and I might add very able Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Robert Strauss, just sworn in, will be departing immediately for Moscow to take charge of our embassy and to report to me on the situation that he finds in the Soviet Union.
 So I'm asking him to go over there, get the lay of the land, establish what will be strong leadership at the embassy -- we've got a good team in place, but this man is in charge of this important mission -- and then to return within the next several days to give me a full personal report on what he sees there. He will not be presenting his credentials on this trip. It's going to be a short trip. And I have said that this group assumed power extraconstitutionally.
 
Kennebunkport Work Schedule
 In conclusion, I want to emphasize that we are going to monitor the situation closely and consider its ramifications throughout the entire world. And I've emphasized in my conversation with the Eastern European leaders that the democratic processes in their country cannot be reversed. Eastern Europe is important. And I've called three of the leaders.
 And I want to take this opportunity to assure them of our continued interest and the need to retain calm in those countries. And, indeed, they were very grateful for the contact by the United States. The United States will continue to support the economic and political reforms in their countries. And I will continue to seek the advice and counsel of Eastern European leaders in the days ahead. And, of course, the Secretary and I will be in close touch with the Western European leaders and others around the globe.
 Because this is an ongoing process of consultations, we intend to maintain a more formal work schedule during the remainder of my stay in Maine. There will be a number of meetings with government officials and private-sector experts related to the events in the Soviet Union. There will be daily briefings on a formalized basis by my national security advisers, and I will be keeping in touch with Secretary Baker. As you know, I'll be receiving Prime Minister Mulroney and also Prime Minister Major and, of course, receiving Ambassador Strauss when he returns. Secretary Baker will be leaving today for the NATO ministerial that's being held -- will be held in Brussels.
 These difficult events in the Soviet Union, I believe, demonstrate the wisdom of our strong and continuous support for the process of reform and restructuring. We'll continue to support the democratic processes that have been set in motion in the Soviet Union. And most importantly, I know that the American people stand behind the people of the Soviet Union who are seeking more freedom and more opportunity in their society.
 So, I'd like now to turn this podium over to Ambassador Strauss for a comment, and then Secretary Baker and I will be glad to take questions, or the Ambassador, and I have here, of course, our top national security team, and I -- Secretary Cheney and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is here, the Vice President, and if you want to direct questions to any of them, why, that would be fine, too. We're following the situations on all fronts there, economic, military, whatever it is, very, very closely.
 
STRAUSS'S STATEMENT
 Thank you, Mr. President. Let me just very briefly say that the circumstances have changed rather dramatically since I accepted this assignment. It's a different world. Nevertheless, although the circumstances have changed, as I've said, it seems to me that my mission remains basically the same, and that is to go to Moscow, speak very clearly, speak very plainly and, if necessary, with undiplomatic candor from time to time, to speak for you, Mr. President, you, Mr. Secretary, and for the American people, and to speak for the principles of freedom and democracy and rule of law, and that, I intend to do. I thank you for this -- express my appreciation to you for the confidence you've shown in me, and I'll do my best to fulfill the job.
Thank you, sir.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Has there been any evidence -- do you have any evidence that the -- that this coup might be on shaky ground, in line with what you mentioned yesterday about sometimes coups fail and that possibly the opposition that's rallying around Yeltsin has any possibilities to turn it around and what kind of support are you able -- or will you give them other than verbal?
 A. Well, I am -- I said yesterday that some coups fail. The likelihood of this, it's hard to evaluate, in this circumstance. However, there appears to be very strong support from the people in the Soviet Union for constitutional government, for democratic reform. And when you see the numbers turn out, President Yeltsin told me that he anticipated there were -- he thought there were 100,000 people near his building when I talked to him a few minutes ago. He thinks that there will be strong support from labor to his request that labor go out and do not -- don't produce until this matter is resolved.
 So, you don't take freedom away from people very easily, you don't set back democracy very easily, and I'd say that it is in the best interests of the Soviet Union and its relations with other countries if a constitutional government is promptly put back into operation there.
 
U.S. Aid to Yeltsin
 Q. Mr. President, what kind of support, though, are you going to give Yeltsin, or you just have to stay on the sidelines and offer verbal encouragement?
 A. Well, we're certainly going to offer encouragement in every way we can. And we're making very clear to the coup plotters and the coup people that there will not be normal relations with the United States as long as this illegal coup remains in effect. The Eastern -- the Western Europeans have met and they have come out with a statement along those lines. And I think, with the exception ofa few renegade regimes around the world, we're seeing universal condemnation. So, let's hope that that will bring these people to their senses.
 I was just looking here at the statement from the -- the E.C. decisions. And they have concluded that this C.S.C.E. human-rights conference in Moscow should not go forward, and we will certainly back them in that. Technical assistance, they're following what I mentioned yesterday in holding back all of that. And they have some serious economic problems, and they need the help of the West and they need the cooperation of Eastern Europe. And they're not going to get it under existing conditions.
 
Mideast Talks
 Q. What happens now to the co-sponsorship of the Middle East conference? Will we do it alone? And other front-burner issues with the Soviet Union? And what was the gist of the letter from Yanayev?
 A. It's far too early to say what will happen to the Middle East conference. The whole world wants to see that succeed. The hopes for peace in the Middle East -- and again I credit Secretary Baker for his indefatigable efforts in putting together this peace process. The whole world wants to see it succeed. And I hope that there will be no frustration of that on the part of the Soviet Union, who have heretofore played a very constructive role in all of that. But, again, we are not in contact with Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh. We simply don't know what is going to happen. What was the other part of your question?
 Q. Will we go it alone?
 A. Well, I mean, we will continue to fight for -- we will continue to use our best efforts to bring peace to the Middle East no matter what happens. Of course, we will. But let's face it, the Soviet Union heretofore has been constructive, and they're important in the United Nations concept and they're important on their own with the relations they have with some other countries.
 It is ironic that only a handful of countries, predictably extreme countries, have supported what's happening in Moscow. I think of Libya, I think of Iraq, and I think of Cuba. These are renegades. These are people that have been swimming against the tide of democracy. And the rest of the world appears to be very upset with this usurpation of power.
 
German Aid to Kremlin
 Q. Mr. President, in the past you've had differences with Chancellor Kohl over monetary aid to the Soviet Union. In your telephone conversation with him yesterday, did you say it was imperative that they not give any money to the new regime?
 A. No. We worked out, at the G-7 meeting, an agreement with Chancellor Kohl that he fully supported. Germany has some special problems. Germany wants those troops, Russian troops out of a unified Germany. We want the troops out of a unified Germany. But that was not discussed.
 
Talks With Europe
 Q. Aside from Secretary Baker's trip to Brussels, is it -- is this situation such that you might want to see the European leaders meet together in a summit?
 A. Well, I'm not sure that that's -- that's the next step. We're in close contact with them. I talked to the G-7 leaders yesterday, including Ruud Lubbers, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands who is head of the E.C. now. And I'm not sure that a face-to-face meeting of the -- of the European leaders is -- and United States and Japan would be productive at this point. But I think the process of Jim Baker going to NATO, his doing that, is a very important step.
 
Relations in Limbo
 Q. Mr. President, when you say that our economic relations with the Soviet Union are now on hold, does that mean you're actively going after suspending grain credits for example, or delaying Most Favored Nation status?
 A. Well, we're just sitting here for awhile leaving everything on hold, as I have said. We're reviewing all these matters, and it's way too early to say what -- how each individual category is going to work out. It's simply we -- we've got to just take our time. We've got to be prudent -- a word I think is applicable here. And I think we've got to be strong. I think the world is turning to the United States for leadership here -- many countries. And I think the best thing to do now is to put these matters on hold. We did this yesterday. As you've seen, the Europeans, Western Europeans have followed suit.
 
Gorbachev's Fate
 Q. Mr. President, have you heard from Mr. Yeltsin as of the whereabouts or the well-being of Mr. Gorbachev, or from anyone else, for that matter?
 A. Mr. Yeltsin told me that he tried to send emissaries to see Mr. Gorbachev, that those emissaries were unsuccessful because Mr. Gorbachev is being prevented from seeing people. As I say, I've tried to call him, yesterday.

HEADLINE: Downtown Retailing;
Cincinnati Puts a Mall In a Tower

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KENT
<, Special to The New York Times
DTL>CINCINNATI, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Tower Place at Carew Tower, a shopping center in the heart of this city, opens Wednesday as the $100 million bait that city leaders hope will lure shoppers downtown again.
The 250,000-square-foot center eoncompasses the renovated Art Deco arcade of the 61-year-old Carew Tower, Cincinnati's tallest building, and the adjacent atrium-style Tower Place, which was completed this month on the site of the former L. S. Ayres department store. 
 The downtown area has seen a net loss of 640,000 square feet of retail space in the last decade. At the same time, two shopping malls, each with more than a million square feet, have opened in the suburbs.
A third suburban mall underwent an $85 million renovation and also has more than a million square feet of space.
The $15 million Tower Place was developed by Faison Associates of North Carolina, while the Carew Tower arcade and Omni Netherland Hotel were renovated by the Belvedere Corporation of Cincinnati.
Belvedere became the tower's lead investor early last year when Emery Realty defaulted on a $50 million loan.
The project, which includes Ray Combs's Comedy Club, a fitness center and Morton's of Chicago steak house, is more than 90 percent leased, albeit without the prominent names that developers had initially sought. About 145,000 square feet are leasable in the 250,000-square-foot center.
The 1.7 million people who live in the Cincinnati area could find outlets of many of Tower Place's 65 stores and restaurants -- the Limited, the Gap, Footlocker, Chick-Fil-A -- at suburban shopping centers where the parking is free. At Tower Place, parking costs $1.50 an hour up to a maximum of $8 for 24 hours.
But Belvedere's president, Steven Stein, said the tenant mix was demographically correct.
"Perhaps some people will ask why we didn't go out and spend a million dollars to bring Gucci to the Carew Tower," he remarked. "The reason we didn't is that I don't think that's our customer base."
Also among the shops are the area's first Banana Republic and the third American shop of Goodebodies, a British retailer of bath products made from natural ingredients.
Mr. Stein acknowledged when Belvedere started the Carew Tower renovation that visions of Gucci, Fendi and Louis Vuitton danced in his head. But with today's retail environment battering many high-fashion retailers, he said he was glad they were only visions.
"We've got stores that are right for the 90's," he said.
He pointed out that designer apparel was readily available downtown at Saks Fifth Avenue and Gidding-Jenny, a stylish boutique, that just reopened under a new owner after a six-month, $2 million renovation. Saks is in the midst of a million-dollar renovation. The city's 18-block skywalk system connects Saks, Gidding-Jenny and McAlpin's department store to Tower Place.
Even if suburban shoppers do not flock downtown to buy lingerie at Victoria's Secret or books at Brentano's, there is a base of 82,000 downtown workers and 65 percent of them are women, Mr. Stein said.
Tower Place at Carew Tower brings a retail focal point to downtown, retail experts say. Though plenty of shopping has always been available, there is a perception that it is difficult to park and move from store to store downtown.
"It was until only three years ago that the largest concentration of retail was downtown," Mr. Stein said. "Ayres's closing caused the hub of the hub-and-spokes system to go dark."
City leaders' next priority is to move Lazarus, a locally based department store, several blocks away, to a site across the street from the Carew Tower known as Fountain Square West, said Mark McKillip, the downtown economic development officer.
Although the opening of Tower Place came a year and a half past schedule, its development was speedy compared with Fountain Square West, which has been idle since a department store, Elder-Beerman, pulled out in 1985.
Demolition of the store is almost complete, but the potential developer of a new mixed-use project at the site was deterred by financing difficulties, and the city now plans to turn the prime parcel into a parking lot until the economic picture changes.
City leaders, who have already invested $10 million in the Fourth Street retail district, do not want to lose momentum.
Mr. McKillip said that after Lazarus is moved, the city would seek out another department store of 60,000 to 100,000 square feet for its old Parkade Garage site two blocks north of Tower Place.

HEADLINE: Couples Who Tread 225-Mile Tightrope

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
WHEN Sally Shelton-Colby was a weekend commuter aboard the New York-Washington shuttle, she was not surprised by the sight of another passenger boarding a jet one Monday morning at National Airport carrying a vacuum cleaner instead of a briefcase.
Like Ms. Shelton-Colby, a former United States Ambassador to Barbados, the man was a member of a hardy band that struggles to maintain weekend marriages in one of the two cities and weekday jobs in the other. The vacuum cleaner, she concluded, was being transferred for duty in the man's New York apartment from his home in the capital. 
 "On some Mondays, I was schlepping orange juice and milk aboard the shuttle because I had none in my New York apartment," said Ms. Shelton-Colby, 47, whose husband, William Colby, the former director of the Central Intelligence, is a lawyer in Washington. "It was a crazy life style."
Couples who juggle homes and jobs in different cities can be found across the nation, but the Washington-New York connection appears to be a particularly strong one, and the commuting couples often come from the higher echelons of government and corporations. For them, it is a way of life, not just a hasty arrangement forced by a job transfer.
Marriages that span the two cities seem to be particularly common for a number of reasons, including these:
* The distance between the two cities -- 225 miles -- is covered, weather and air-traffic controllers permitting, in a one-hour shuttle flight (departing half-hourly from both cities most of the day) or a train ride of two and a half to three hours (hourly most of the day). By car, it is 5 to 6 hours.
* Professional men and women in New York and Washington who are employed in government service, law, communications, finance, publishing and the arts often meet through work and marry but wish to maintain careers in separate cities.
* Those who build a reputation in the Federal Government often go on to higher-paying corporate jobs in New York but are reluctant to uproot their families. And well-placed New Yorkers represent a talent pool for Government.
* Salaries in New York, often in the six figures, or prestigious appointments in Washington, can make the commute worthwhile as well as allow couples to cover commuting expenses, about $10,000 a year, and the costs of two households.
But for many of those who do the commute, the toughest part is the stress of frequent travel delays, airport shutdowns, weekend fatigue meltdowns and loneliness.
"It's the pits," said Ms. Shelton-Colby, who gave up an international banking position in New York after two years of commuting to teach at Georgetown University and work as a consultant. "Those of us who did it grew to hate the shuttle. The stress factor was horrendous. I think my gray hairs were caused less by working on the Latin American debt than by trying to find a taxi in midtown Manhattan for a Friday afternoon dash through traffic to the airport."
The shuttles operated by Trump and Pan Am fly between La Guardia Airport in New York and National Airport, two of the smallest yet busiest airports in the nation, and are subject to frequent weather and traffic delays. The shuttle flights cost $142 each way. One-way Amtrak Metroliner coach fare is $79.
Some professional couples do quite well despite the rigors of long-distance commuting, said Margaret Hall, a sociology professor at Georgetown who is writing a book on modern pressures on families. "When separated during the week they can better concentrate on their work and by the weekend let go of it and enjoy their time together," she said.
But, she added, when there are young children at home the major burden of the arrangement shifts from the spouse who is commuting to the one who stays with them and also works, usually the wife.
Charles Meissner, 50, a Chemical Bank vice president in New York and former ambassador at large for economic negotiations in the Carter and Reagan Administrations, has been a Washington-New York commuter since 1982. His wife, Doris, a former acting United States Commissioner of Immigration, is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
"I won't minimize the difficulties this arrangement poses to holding a relationship together," Mrs. Meissner said. "At least we live, unlike some couples we know, in the same time zone."
The Meissners had two school-age children in the early years of his commuting to New York, and they agree that children represent the biggest challenge. "We didn't understand in the beginning what a jarring change it meant," she said.
Like others doing the two-city dance, the Meissners set rules, including these, to lessen the burdens:
* Financial and household decisions made by one spouse are not challenged.
* The commuting spouse needs attractive accommodations in the city of employment, fully equipped to eliminate carting goods and clothing back and forth.
* Nightly telephone calls are necessary to maintain an emotional life and morale.
* Weekends are spent doing things that the whole family can enjoy.
* The commuter gets himself home.
Pedro Kuczynski, chairman of First Boston International and former Minister of Energy and Mines in Peru, his native land, and his wife have broken that last rule in the nine years he has been commuting to his New York office from Washington.
"My friends think Pedro is a Latin American male chauvinist because I always pick him up at the airport," said Jane Kuczynski, a Voice of America broadcaster. "But he actually pays me money for doing it. On my last birthday he gave me a phone for my car because I had so much trouble finding him at National Airport."
When she flies to New York it is usually for social functions connected with her husband's business. "The New York women simply can't understand why I prefer living in Washington," she said. "They imply you're not strong enough or competitive enough to live in New York. They haven't seen my swimming pool and sauna."
William Dunlap is an artist in McLean, Va., across the Potomac from Washington. His wife, Linda Burgess, is a New York painter and writer. They live apart by choice because he likes to paint in the Shenandoah Valley and she prefers the couple's SoHo loft to write.
When Mr. Dunlap, 47, thirsts for the art scene he hops up to Manhattan. When she hungers for fresh air she slips down to Washington.
David C. Levy, 52, executive director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington since January, prefers to spend summer weekends on Fire Island with his fiancee, Carole Feld. The rest of the year Ms. Feld, 35, who is director of promotions for Home Box Office and has an apartment in New York, goes to Washington on weekends. She said the couple planned to maintain the two-city arrangement after their marriage.
"I spend a lot of time on the road," she said, "so I seize opportunities to fly into Washington to see David for a night any time I can. If he still lived in New York I don't think we would get to see each other more than we do now."
Ed Rollins, 48, the Republican political strategist who managed President Reagan's 1984 campaign, is married to Sherrie Rollins, 33, director of information for ABC News in New York. She has commuted from the couple's Arlington, Va., home for 13 months.
"It's a modern marriage, with a young bright woman who has to travel to do her job while I stay home and look after her dogs," said Mr. Rollins, now a managing partner in a Washington consulting firm. "It's something that women have had to put up with over the years."
When major news stories break, Mrs. Rollins may not get to Washington at all. During the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Rollins commuted to New York on weekends to be with his wife in their one-bedroom Upper West Side apartment.
"There's something healthy about missing your husband each week and then getting to spend a weekend together," Mrs. Rollins said.
"Don't believe her," her husband said. "It's her dogs she misses."

HEADLINE: Mubarak Urges the Lifting of Sanctions Against Iraq

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CAIRO, Egypt, Aug. 21

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak, chief among Arab leaders aligned against Saddam Hussein in the Persian Gulf crisis, said in remarks pulbished today that he wants economic sanctions against Iraq lifted for the good of the Iraqi people.
The interview with the state-owned magazine Al Mussawar reflected a turnabout in Mr. Mubarak's support for sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council after Iraq invaded Kuwait a year ago. But he said the move should come only after world leaders devise checks on Mr. Hussein's ambitions. 
 "We strongly sympathize with the Iraqi people in their present ordeal resulting from the miscalculations of their leadership," he said. "We are for the lifting of these sanctions."
"It would not be difficult for the world community to agree on adequate guarantees that would prevent the squandering of Iraq's resources on projects which serve only the ambitions of its leader," he said.
His comments were published a day after Nabil Najim, Iraq's delegate to the Arab League, told reporters in Cairo that he had asked the Secretary General of the 21-member organization to try to persude the United Nations to ease the sanctions.
League officials initially saw little prospect that any effort by Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid, a former Egyptian Foreign Minister, would succeed. But Mr. Mubarak's comment could improve Iraq's chances.
Sanctions were maintained even after a American-led international military coalition drove Iraqi forces from Kuwait in February. Iraqi officials say shortages caused by sanctions have killed thousands of Iraqi civilians since the war ended.
The United Nations voted on Thursday temporarily to lift the sanctions by allowing Iraq to sell $1.6 billion in oil to raise money for food and medicine for Iraqi citizens.
Mr. Mubarak said his concern for the welfare of the Iraqi people also was behind his opposition to suggestions that the United States and other Western allies mount air strikes to destroy Iraq's nuclear installations.
He said he had conveyed this position to President Bush through Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d on the Secretary's visit to Egypt last month.
Mr. Mubarak also said all Egyptian troops in Kuwait would be back home by the end of this month. About 36,000 Egyptian soldiers joined the battle to rid Kuwait of Iraqi occupation.
Egypt began withdrawing them in May after Kuwait appeared to have second thoughts about a Persian Gulf security agreement that would have kept them there with Syrian troops as the core of a security force.

U.N. Team Ends Iraq Visit
BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 21 (Reuters) -- A team of United Nations experts wrapped up an inspection tour of Iraqi chemical weapon sites today, saying Iraq had cooperated fully and was working out ways to destroy its bombs and warheads.
The leader of the inspection team, Jean-Paul Peroz of France, attributed Iraqi helpfulness to an urgent need for permission to resume production of chemicals such as chlorine, which is used for water purification as well as weapons-making.
"They gave us many plans, much information, and they have very good cooperation with the inspection team," he told reporters.
The Security Council has linked a full lifting of trade sanctions to Iraqi compliance with its cease-fire terms, which include declaring and scrapping all weapons of mass destruction.
Mr. Peroz said his 21-member team, which leaves Thursday, had seen 6,420 small rockets with chemical warheads and 200 mustard gas bombs during their six-day visit.
He said they had found no inconsistencies between Iraq's declarations and what they had seen.
He said Iraq had asked for permission to turn chemical weapons production plants into arms destruction plants.
Mr. Peroz, whose inspections included production and storage sites, said Iraq was eager to put the issue of its chemical weapons program behind it because it urgently needed to reopen chemical plants for civilian needs.

HEADLINE: Is a Fifth Avenue Rose Wilting?

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Like a haughty Park Avenue matron whose credit has been challenged at the local supermarket, Saks Fifth Avenue is defending its blue-blooded reputation these days amid rumors of big losses and late payments to suppliers.
Saks denies it has any financial troubles, and industry analysts note that it has been one of the most profitable companies in the business. Competitors have long envied Saks's knack for finding and selling some of the most innovative, and priciest, lines of high-fashion merchandise. 
 But even Saks acknowledges that it has to seek new ways to stay profitable. Among other changes, its 48 stores are stocking more lines of less expensively priced clothing, like women's blazers for $400 to $600, compared with $1,000 or more for designer labels. It is also dropping some slow-selling high-priced lines and adding more of its own private brands and larger-sized clothing.
While these moves seem to be edging the store ever so slightly toward the retail mainstream of Bloomingdale's and Macy's, Saks executives insist they have no intention of abandoning their affluent customers.
"Reaching for a broader audience does not mean reaching down," said Arthur C. Martinez, 51 years old, one of Saks's two vice chairmen.
Saks is privately held and, befitting its status as one of retailing's crown jewels, it jealously guards its financial position and its merchandising plans. But recent interviews with top Saks executives, rivals, suppliers and others show a company pressed to reach out to new customers while trying to keep its singularity.
Much of the speculation about the company's health began in late July, when a major financial company stopped guaranteeing credit for shipments to Saks. Many people in the industry began to wonder whether the store that gave Fifth Avenue its cachet had contracted a touch of the malady afflicting so many of its retail cousins.
Saks certainly is not immune to the combined forces of a frigid sales climate and the huge debt the company assumed last year when Investcorp International Inc. bought it for $1.5 billion. Further, experts say, economic conditions in general and Saks's financial obligations in particular may change forever the character of its business.
Some evidence of that change can be seen in the strategies the company has adopted to see it through the recession. To be sure, Saks is still busy drawing up three-year business plans with Escada and Chanel and its other top design firms. But it has now joined other retailers in aggressively encouraging many of its suppliers to add new, less costly collections, called "bridge lines."
A woman's jacket in these lines, like Malisy from Genny and Company from Ellen Tracy, costs about half as much as those sewn with the designers' regular labels.
Saks is also re-establishing ties with some manufacturers it abandoned in the 1980's when it turned its attention to pricey sequined, beaded or beribboned $10,000 designer dresses and elegantly tailored $2,000 designer suits.
"For a while Saks went away from more middle resources and concentrated on the high end," said Shep Porter, owner of Regina Porter, which makes moderately priced women's wear. "Now they're starting with us again."
 
'A Little Pause'
 Melvin Jacobs, 64, Saks's chairman, acknowledged that sales of the costliest garments were slowing. "We're seeing a little pause in $9,000 ball gowns, but they haven't gone away," he said. "It's sort of slowed at a very high level, but it's still an important business and one we will continue to give a great deal of emphasis."
On the other hand, based on strong sales for DKNY, the designer Donna Karan's bridge line, Saks has added Anne Klein's new, less expensive label, A-Line, and similar labels to entice younger women.
"We tend to have a very mature, traditionally oriented customer from a fashion point of view," said Philip B. Miller, 54, who is Saks's other vice chairman, and who is responsible for merchandising strategy. "Now we'd like to be the store of choice for her daughter as well."
What that means, said Patrick M. Dunne, who teaches retailing at the College of Business Administration at Texas Tech University, is this: "The traditional Saks consumer has probably cut down on her spending. She may just not be interested in high fashion any more. But the younger consumer is still fashion-oriented, so it makes sense for the fashion-oriented retailer like Saks to focus there."
In other moves to raise more revenue, Saks is revamping its credit card business to squeeze more cash from interest payments and provide a more accessible source of capital. And it is investing in computer systems that will enable it to track its inventory more closely.
 
Progress Expected
 Retail analysts and consultants say Saks's new strategies are likely to have some success. But they have also left the company open to speculation that it is reaching out to new customers out of near desperation.
Adding to the unease about Saks is the remarkably low profile of its owner, Investcorp, a partnership of Arab investors that bought Saks from B.A.T. Industries P.L.C. Investcorp plowed about $600 million of equity into the company. Investcorp installed its own management team at Saks, including Mr. Martinez, who had been with the American subsidiary of B.A.T., and Mr. Miller, to back up Mr. Jacobs, whose contract runs through 1993.
Seventh Avenue seems to regard Mr. Martinez, who is responsible for financial operations, as something of a financial wizard and a well-rounded businessman. But some retailing experts say he lacks the training in merchandising so prized among merchants.
And while Mr. Miller mastered his trade in such vaunted retail laboratories as Lord & Taylor, Marshall Field and Neiman-Marcus, Saks's foremost competitor, many people interviewed felt that having two vice chairmen created the potential for divisiveness.
"Any time you change as many merchants as they have, you've got a different culture and everybody has to get used to it," said Nicholas A. Gallopo, a partner at Arthur Andersen. "So far they've done everything right except they got caught in this down retail climate and they're the new guys on the block."
 
Rumors on Late Payments
 Saks's luster was dulled a bit in late July, when, just before manufacturers began shipping fall merchandise, rumors swept through the garment district that the company was telling suppliers that its payments would be late -- rumors Saks vehemently denies.
Credit agencies, which have relied on scanty glimpses of Saks's financial statements for more than a decade, scrambled to rescind their favorable recommendations. Credit rating agencies, like Credit Clearing House and Sands Credit Consultants Inc., play a special role in retailing, where they act as independent auditors for thousands of small suppliers.
And Heller Financial Inc., a factor, or financial go-between for retailers and suppliers, said it would no longer guarantee shipments to Saks.
Heller's actions reminded many suppliers of a report in Women's Wear Daily that asserted Saks had lost $100 million during the first seven months of the year. Saks executives strongly denied any such loss, but would not be more specific. Still, analysts said they would be surprised if Saks had suffered no losses, given the lagging retail economy, particularly in New York, where Saks's flagship generates about 22 percent of sales.
In 1989, the last year for which figures are available, Saks had sales of $1.3 billion and earned $111 million before interest and taxes. according to an offering memorandum circulated to potential investors.
Despite Heller's statement, and their own doubts, manufacturers shipped to Saks anyway. All credit agencies have restored Saks's ratings and the furor has ended, although Heller has continued its embargo.
"It is my feeling that the firm will be here for long enough to satisfy its current obligations," said Richard Posner, executive vice president of Credit Exchange, a credit rating agency, adding that "long enough" was at the very least six months.
 
Private Labels Added
 The July jitters came on the heels of Saks's decision to increase sales of merchandise under its own labels, like the Works, A.S.A.P. and Fenton Last, a line of women's shoes. Many stores have added such private labels because they are more profitable.
Saks executives made the announcement at a Fashion Institute of Technology seminar on the issues the rag trade will confront in the 1990's. That they did so before an assemblage of Seventh Avenue notables whose goods will now face increased competition from Saks's own brands was taken as an affront by some.
Many people attending the meeting believed Mr. Martinez said 30 percent, or more than $300 million, of Saks's sales would ultimately come from private-label apparel. But in an interview, Mr. Miller said Saks labels accounted for about 12 percent of sales and would probably never amount to more than 15 percent.
Moreover, he said, Saks was working harder than ever to cultivate its relationship with suppliers, signing exclusive deals with manufacturers and inviting them to display special collections in its stores.
Some retailing executives say these new decisions put Saks's reputation for being on the cutting edge of fashion on the line. In the 1970's, Saks was the leading national source for the freshest designer fashions, fragrances and accessories. Its only rivals were regional specialty stores like Neiman-Marcus in Dallas or Bergdorf Goodman in New York.
 
Broad Expansion in 80's
 In the mid-1980's, veteran retailing experts say, Saks became preoccupied, maybe even obsessed, with a national rollout. Stores went up in every major metropolitan area and in many secondary cities, so that Saks's 48 stores extend from Portland, Ore., to Atlanta and from Minneapolis to New Orleans.
Its competitors have also expanded nationally, but mostly in the largest cities. Neiman-Marcus, which recently opened its 25th store, in Minneapolis, goes head to head with Saks in Chicago but not in Portland.
Saks executives say having a national presence is critical these days. "Each major market is an opportunity, but the secondary markets are also opportunities," Mr. Jacobs said. "They are very often underserved, and we have created, really, the only national specialty store."

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Health Nominee Is Advised to Kepp Silent

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Dr. Mark R. Chassin, the California physician nominated to be New York State's next health commissioner, has emerged as the David Souter of gubernatorial appointees, a man with little public record on major health issues and little freedom to stake out his positions.
In a reflection of the growing political sensitivity of health policy, Dr. Chassin has followed the instructions of the Cuomo administration to divulge little about his positions or agenda until his Senate confirmation hearings. Dr. Chassin was nominated by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo on Monday, and his confirmation hearings may not be held before November. 
 Doctors, hospital administrators and health-care lobbyists who participated in get-to-know-you meetings with Dr. Chassin in Albany and New York City this week said he was cordial but provided few details about his plans. In an interview today, he said he would have to "draw the line" at answering specific questions about AIDS, universal health care and no-fault malpractice insurance.
 
Clamp on News Questioned
 Dr. Chassin and aides to Mr. Cuomo said they did not want to subvert the confirmation process.
"We have a confirmation process to undergo with the Senate, at which time the policy issues will be fully discussed," said Michael J. Dowling, Mr. Cuomo's director of health, education and human services. "That's the prerogative of the Senate."
But a spokesman for the Republican majority in the Senate said Senate leaders were eager to learn more about Dr. Chassin and would not object to him speaking publicly.
"The more we know about Dr. Chassin at this point, the better, since we know very little about him," said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino. "We never have objections to the media being the conduit."
The recent nominations of public-health officials provide ample evidence of the political dangers of speaking too freely.
 
Early Dissent Feared
 Mayor David N. Dinkins's 1990 appointment of Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr. as New York City's health commissioner was delayed for several weeks as homosexual-rights groups objected to his previous positions on AIDS.
Similarly, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan's nomination as Secretary of Health and Human Services was nearly derailed in 1988 when he said in a newspaper interview that women should have a right to abortion, a position not shared by President-elect George Bush.
Several Cuomo aides said they hoped to avoid a repeat of such incidents. "We think this guy is going to be very, very good, and the fact that he can't be pinned down on a lot of things is actually good," said one administration official. "He can't be attacked. If positions get out there early, it can create a furor."
Adding to the sensitivity of Dr. Chassin's nomination is his $160,000 salary, a 60 percent increase over the salary received by his predecessor, Dr. David Axelrod. Senate officials said the salary offer had "raised eyebrows," and union officials have complained about such a large increase in a year when there were no raises for state workers.
Dr. Chassin said today that he was taking a pay cut to move to Albany because the health commissioner's job "verges on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to really have an impact on the delivery of real health care to real people." He declined to disclose his previous salary.
What is known about the 44-year-old physician is that his work for the last 12 years as a bureaucrat, researcher and businessman has been singularly dedicated to reducing health-care costs and eliminating unnecessary medical procedures.
From 1979 to 1981, Dr. Chassin served as deputy director of the Office of Professional Standards Review Organizations of the United States Health Care Financing Administration. In that job, he oversaw the development and application of Federal guidelines for determining which medical procedures might be inappropriate for the treatment of Medicare patients.
He then worked for the Rand Corporation directing research projects that revealed high levels of inappropriate use of various medical and surgical procedures. His most acclaimed study, which was reported in numerous medical journals in 1987, disclosed that a third of all carotid endarterectomies performed on Medicare patients in 1981 were unnecessary.
Nearly 11 percent of the patients who unnecessarily underwent the surgery, which clears blockages in an artery to the brain, either died within 30 days or suffered a stroke, he reported. At an average cost of $13,000, the unneeded procedures were both expensive and dangerous, the study concluded.
Dr. Chassin left Rand in 1988 to help found Value Health Sciences Inc., a Santa Monica, Calif., company that produces computer software to help insurers review the quality and cost of medical care.
Those familiar with Dr. Chassin's work in California said he represented a new type of policymaker who searched for solutions to health-care problems with computer models and financing plans.
"This is a very large business, and it's running amok," said Dr. Mark Blumberg, a health economist with Kaiser Permanente in Oakland. "Data is very helpful in shaping it. Dr. Chassin could contribute to that."
Dr. Chassin is described by friends and colleagues as intelligent, intense, reserved, demanding of those he works with and protective of his privacy.
He holds four degrees, including a medical degree and a master's in public policy from Harvard and a master's in public health from the University of California at Los Angeles. Certified as an internist, he spent 12 years practicing emergency medicine.
"He's a good listener, and yet he's not a patsy," said Dr. Steven A. Schroeder, president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the country's largest health-care philanthropy.
Dr. Kathleen N. Lohr, a former colleague of Dr. Chassin's at Rand and now an official with the National Academy of Sciences, said Dr. Chassin "won't waffle and be obtuse about the direction he wants to go."
But until Dr. Chassin sits before a panel of state senators, that direction may remain unclear.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Griffin Bacal Is Diversifying With New Marketing Unit

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
SEEKING to broaden its client base beyond consumer advertising, Griffin Bacal Inc. is creating an agency within the agency, headed by two executives experienced in business-to-business and high-technology accounts.
In keeping with the industry's increasingly popular practice of providing clients a full range of services, known as integrated marketing communications, the new group offers everything from print and broadcast ads to in-store displays to sales brochures. Called the Business Marketing Communications Group, the new unit operates as a separate subsidiary of Griffin Bacal, a New York shop with $180 million in billings from clients in markets like consumer electronics and toys. 
 Griffin Bacal's decision to diversify stems from a belief that "carving out niches in the market makes sense, instead of just banging on client doors," Paul Kurnit, president and chief operating officer, said in an interview yesterday at the agency's office in lower Manhattan. "What we saw was an ability to add a dimension to the company."
Sitting in on the discussion, the first Mr. Kurnit has had about the group since its formation, were its co-directors: Richard Conti, who previously ran his own agency, Conti Advertising, in Upper Saddle River, N.J., which specialized in business-to-business accounts, and Ned Clausen, a longtime advertising executive with high-tech expertise who most recently was executive vice president of Kameny Spitzer Felix, New York. Both are also becoming senior vice presidents and group directors of Griffin Bacal.
The creation of the group reflects two important trends reshaping the advertising industry as it copes with a three-year-old recession. One is the need for agencies like Griffin Bacal, known for creating campaigns for such clients as Sharp Electronics, Hasbro and Playskool, to be able to offer them -- as well as potential new clients -- more than television commercials or print advertisements.
"Whereas before, agencies sold creativity," said Mr. Conti, 48 years old, "today a viable agency must be able to offer a whole plethora of marketing services."
The other trend is the consolidation of small agencies, like Mr. Conti's, into larger ones, as also typified by the recent absorption of Buckley DeCerchio Cavalier into Frankfurt Gips Balkind.
"It's a no-win situation for the smaller agency," Mr. Conti said. "Long term, you must be able to have the strength of a Griffin Bacal to be effective." A key problem for "the small guys who go after $250,000 accounts," he added, is that "we found Jerry Della Femina and friends going after those accounts."
It was particularly appealing to Griffin Bacal to obtain expertise in these fields by bringing in executives, Mr. Kurnit said, because "I don't know, in this economy, whether I would have had the stomach to start something like this from scratch."
Mr. Conti and Mr. Clausen, 52, are bringing dowries with them as they join Griffin Bacal. The three employees and dozen-plus accounts that were at Conti Advertising are being absorbed by the new group. Those accounts, with stimated billings of $9 million, include Chipwich Inc.; Dial America Marketing, a telemarketing service; the Maxell Corporation of America, for its battery products, and Moxy Trucks of America, for heavy-duty trucks.
And Lambda Electronics, a $1 million to $1.5 million account that Mr. Clausen worked on at Kameny Spitzer, is coming with him.
The group is already at work on projects for Sharp, Mr. Conti said, including the creation of sales literature and direct-mail pieces. Mr. Kurnit said he hoped other current Griffin Bacal clients would consider the group for work "that they would have gone elsewhere for."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls as Coup Fizzles; Gold Prices Up in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar plunged against most major currencies yesterday as the currency returned to more normal levels after the failed three-day coup attempt in the Soviet Union.
Gold prices finished higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1 an ounce, to a late bid of $356.90. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted an after-hours bid of $356.85, up 85 cents from late Tuesday. 
 The dollar dipped even lower yesterday than its level last week, before a committee of Soviet hard-liners ousted President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The turmoil had pushed up the dollar, which is generally considered a safe currency in times of international distress.
But the coup, which faced resistance led by the Russian republic's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, fell apart and Mr. Gorbachev was returning to Moscow yesterday.
"I think a lot of people were surprised to see how Yeltsin and the military and the Russian people really stuck together," said James Maccario, vice president of foreign exchange at Shawmut Bank of Boston.
Mike Ballow, a market analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago, said the perception in the market is that the democratic movement in the Soviet Union is even more entrenched than people thought before the coup.
 
Mark Gathers Strength
 That perception has strengthened the German mark, he said. It revived considerably in New York trading, as the dollar dropped to 1.7408 marks, from 1.7985 late Tuesday.
For the dollar, Mr. Maccario said, "fundamentally nothing has changed."
"The dollar was going down before Sunday," he said. "There's no reason to hold on to the dollar right now. Interest rates still look like they're going lower."
Expectations of lower United States interest rates generally depress the dollar.
In New York, the British pound finished at $1.6885, up from $1.6440 late Tuesday. Earlier in London, the pound rose to $1.6735, from $1.6380 late Tuesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 137.18 yen, down 0.60 yen from Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 136.85 yen, and in New York, the dollar was quoted at 136.55, down from 137.20 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.5150 Swiss francs, down from 1.5432; 1.1442 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1417; 5.9190 French francs, down from 6.1140, and 1,302.75 Italian lire, down from 1,340.50.

HEADLINE: Vietnam, the Way It Might Have Been

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESTMINSTER, Calif.

 BODY:
Before the start of a recent concert of Vietnamese pop music here in the community known as Little Saigon, schoolchildren in smart blue uniforms marched onto the stage of a school auditorium carrying the yellow and red flag of South Vietnam, a country that ceased to exist 16 years ago. The audience, like a roomful of ghosts, rose and joined the singing of that country's national anthem.
Then the performers in their extravagant outfits, mostly aging refugees themselves, sang the familiar ballads of two decades past, of love and loneliness and of weariness with a war that is long since over. 
 Here in Little Saigon, as in other Vietnamese refugee communities throughout the country, people are still struggling to come to terms with history. Many are adapting only halfway to their new country, taking on the ways and pace of American life but with their hearts still in Vietnam.
On weekdays, those who have jobs work in the weapons and computer industries that are prime employers here in Orange County, an hour's drive south of Los Angeles. On weekends they hold anti-Communist political meetings, sit through long afternoons of traditional Vietnamese opera, or stroll through the air-conditioned malls of Little Saigon.
These shopping centers, like the two-story Asian Garden Mall, are what much of Saigon might look like today if the North Vietnamese had not won the war in 1975 and imposed on it the stagnation of their economic system.
 
California Version of Saigon
 Up and down Bolsa Avenue, and for several blocks around, clusters of shops, offices, restaurants and cafes with their Vietnamese signs glitter in chrome and neon, a Southern California dream of Saigon. The centerpiece of this cluster is a pair of bustling indoor shopping malls where the usual staples of shops selling hamburgers and athletic shoes have been supplanted by Amerasia My-A Import Wholesale Retail, Van Hoi Xuan Chinese Herbs and Sai-Gon Color Lab.
While much of Southeast Asia has enjoyed some of the world's most rapid economic growth since the end of the Vietnam war, the Communist nations of Indochina have stagnated, and Saigon, renamed Ho Chi Minh City, has been left behind.
"If America had won the war over there, it would look like Singapore today," said Yen Nguyen, 34 years old, who fled Vietnam by boat after the fall of Saigon in 1975.
"Maybe the style would be a little bit different from here in the mall," he said. "Maybe over there they would put a little pond inside. Maybe it would be a little more romantic than here."
 
Economic Slump Hurts Buying
 Mr. Nguyen owns Kim Son Fabrics, where a refugee can buy a bolt of silk for direct delivery to relatives in Vietnam. But now, he said, along with the rest of the American economy, the Vietnamese community here is in a slump. Many of the weekend strollers in the mall buy little more than a plastic cup of French coffee sweetened with condensed milk.
Since the end of the war, half a million Vietnamese refugees have come to the United States. Those here inspire others; new arrivals soon send for family members, who either make a dangerous escape from Vietnam by boat or join the long list of people petitioning the State Department to come this country.
Mai Cong, a community leader who was one of the first Vietnamese refugees to settle here, in 1975, said: "When I first came here there were very few Vietnamese, and very few Asians. Many of us had to go to Los Angeles Chinatown for our groceries."
Now, Ms. Cong said, more than 20,000 Vietnamese live in Westminster, primarily in an area that has acquired its own freeway exit, "Little Saigon." The Vietnamese now make up a quarter of the residents of Westminster, and the Vietnamese population in surrounding Orange County could be as high as 150,000, she said.
Many Vietnamese here describe Little Saigon as a cauldron of political intrigue, much like the Saigon of the past, with as many as 30 daily and weekly newspapers and an array of political antagonisms that sometime flare into violence. The major issue among Vietnamese in the United States is whether Washington should open diplomatic relations with Hanoi in the hope that the Communist government there will become more liberal or whether to continue to work for its collapse.
Some Vietnamese here called the town "the scam capital of the world," where lawyers fake traffic accidents to collect damages or charge refugees high fees for unnecessary official documents. He said some veterans' groups prey on arrivals, charging large sums for needless dealings with government agencies.
 
Crime Troubles Community
 The community is also the scene of a crime wave in which Vietnamese gangs extort payoffs from local businesses or terrorize refugees in their homes and steal their valuables.
As the years have passed, generational divisions have changed the character of Little Saigon, and a place like the Asian Garden Mall has become the scene of a culture clash that is purely Vietnamese.
Le Thi Thach, who is 81 and lives in San Diego, wore a silk blouse and a formal black hair band for a recent visit to the mall, where she was shopping for a gold wedding ring for a niece. "I come here to remember Saigon," she said. "Everything is Vietnamese here and everyone speaks Vietnamese."
But for 15-year-old Thai Pham, stylish in a black Oakland Raiders jacket who arrived in the United States as an infant, impressions of Vietnam come from photographs and from the mall itself. "No, it's too dirty over there," he said, when asked if he wanted to visit the land of his birth. "I've seen pictures. This is Vietnam for me here. Every Vietnamese comes here."
And for Sean To, just 18 months old, the perspective on the past will be still more distant, helped by the Irish name his father said he gave him to speed his Americanization. "To me, all this looks pretty much like Vietnam," said the father, Ken To. "But for Sean, Saigon will look pretty much like Westminster."
The shifting perspective of the generations is painful for Tran Van Ngoc, 45, a former helicopter pilot who now heads a Vietnamese veterans association and works as a computer technician.
"It hurts my feelings when my daughter asks me about my country," he said, explaining that her questions reflected the ignorance and the biases of her American schoolmates. "It's very hard to explain to the American generation."
Now 15, his daughter has begun to ask him about his role in the war and about the disdain that many Americans feel for the South Vietnamese soldiers who were their allies.
With the defensive tone that some American veterans also found themselves adopting over the years, he said. "I tell her I am proud that I fought that war," he said. "I fought with my heart and I did what I could."
 
Realization of Change
 Most difficult to accept, said Mr. Ngoc, is the realization that he himself has changed over the past 16 years and that the Vietnam of the past cannot be reclaimed.
"When people come here to find Vietnam like Saigon before 1975 they are making a mistake, because we are not the same," he said. "We are Vietnamese but we are not Vietnamese.
"Living in a new country, we change and we don't even know it. Our thoughts are different and we don't even know it. Sometimes I try to deny that I am Americanized, but I have changed."
All around him, people were speaking Vietnamese, eating Vietnamese food, listening to the Vietnamese music that filled the mall. Some shops displayed the yellow South Vietnamese flag with its three red stripes.
"The people walking around here," Mr. Ngoc said, "sometimes they don't realize that this is Little Saigon, but it is not Saigon."

HEADLINE: Inwood Journal;
Of Changing Enclaves And Unchanging Ways

BYLINE: By JOSH KURTZ

 BODY:
Like a lot of taverns in the Inwood section of Manhattan, Bakersfield has Irish flags draped on the wall and Irish beer on tap. When Representative Joseph P. Kennedy, son of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy, spoke at a conference on Irish-American affairs in the neighborhood earlier this year, he had breakfast at Bakersfield.
It is a neighborhood that clings proudly to its turf and its Irish roots. But as a swiftly growing Dominican population squeezes Inwood's Irish residents into tighter quarters, mostly north of 207th Street and west of Broadway, some Irish-American merchants have decided, in small measure at least, to adapt. 
 "I'm sure that the business leadership in Inwood understands the economics involved," said James Carney, president of the Washington Heights-Inwood Chamber of Commerce.
For a while, Bakersfield was at the forefront of that movement. But just as quickly in recent weeks the bar's owners have stepped back. Sociologists, take note.
Last winter the bar hired a disk jockey, Tom Moto, to play what he called "white rock" records on Thursday and Saturday nights. The crowds were dismal: usually, 20 or 30 people showed up. Mr. Moto, who lives in Yonkers and works as a D.J. in Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester, had another idea.
"We'd have a lot of Hispanic people coming in, checking it out, then taking off," he said. "I knew what they were looking for. So I told the owners we'd have to go with the neighborhood."
Mr. Moto started playing house music, reggae, freestyle and other dance tunes that appeal to a younger, and often darker crowd, than the bar's owners were first hoping to reach. But it paid off: within weeks, 400 people were going to Bakersfield on Thursday and Saturday nights.
"When I heard they were playing that kind of music there, I couldn't believe it," said Marilyn Rosario, 21 years old, an administrative assistant from the Bronx. "I went there because of the music. I wouldn't go there otherwise. The music first attracted me."
Everyone seemed happy. "The owners were making money, and people didn't have to go downtown on Thursday nights to go dancing," Mr. Moto said.
The 26-year-old D.J., a chunky, unassuming man who often wears baseball caps and T-shirts to work, became a hero to his Dominican customers. Every evening a parade of beautiful young women would run up to kiss him, and the men would pledge their loyalty.
"No one can match the quality of the music," said Pedro Sosa, a professional dancer who, inspired by Mr. Moto's beat, would practice his moves in the wee hours of Friday mornings.
Mr. Moto admitted there was a cultural gulf between himself and the young dancers at first. But because they shared a love for the same type of music, they soon became friends.
"It just goes to show the music is overcoming the difference," he said.
But it wasn't enough to overcome the bar owners' jitters about unknown cultures. One Thursday night in mid-July, a brawl broke out at Bakersfield. Bottles were broken. The police were called. The owners told Mr. Moto to forget about coming by. Perhaps, they said, the dancing could rfesume after Labor Day when things were cooler.
One of the bar's owners, Pat McCormick, was hesitant to talk about the situation.
Mr. Moto took his business elsewhere. He got a Thursday night gig at Tu Casa, a restaurant on 189th Street with a sizable dance floor. Without a single announcement, his customers followed, 80 of them the first week, twice as many the second, and even more the week after.
"Wherever he goes, I'm in there," Miss Rosario said.
Bakersfield, on a recent Thursday night, was almost empty. There were no Dominicans. Regulars slid into their barstools and were served drinks without having to order.
"This," said one patron who refused to give his name, "is what this place is all about."

Money Funds Are Mixed; Tax-Exempt Yields Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended yesterday. Tax-exempt funds struggled with supply, and taxable funds still showed the effects of the interest rate easing by the Federal Reserve in early August.
Tax-exempt money fund yields rose as supplies of new issues increased. The seven-day compounded average yield rose 7 basis points, to 4.10 percent, with the simple yield up a similar amount, to 4.02 percent. During the same period, the 30-day compounded yield rose 10 basis points, to 4.07 percent, and the simple yield was up similarly, to 3.99 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios rose one day, to 58.
Opposite Directions
Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist, said "there is a fair amount of supply of new issues, pushing yields in the opposite direction of Treasury securities and the general taxable money fund market, where the Fed has more of a direct impact on rates."
Analysts said total assets of tax-exempt funds fell $401 million, to $87.9 billion.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compunded yield is 5.69 percent, while the equivalent in the 31 percent tax bracket is 5.94 percrent.
Of the funds monitored by IBC/ Donoghue's with assets greater than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund, which buys securities that for some investors is subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax, continued as the best performer. The fund, distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. of Milwaukee, had a return of 5.09 percent, up 6 basis points from the previous week.
 
Flight to Safety
 Assets of taxable funds rose by $6.2 billion, to $460.2 billion. The sharp rise was attributed to a flight to safety that caused interest rates to drop sharply after the coup attempt early this week in Moscow.
Mr. Frank sees rates in the taxable funds moving up next week as confidence increases and money flow back toward settling market and currencies.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell by 4 basis points, to 5.50 percent, while the simple yield fell 5 basis points, to 5.35 percent. The 30-day compounded yield was 5.57 percent and the simple yield down 2 basis points, to 5.42 percent.
The taxable fund with the best return was Riverside Capital Money Mark fund, distributed by the Winsbury Company of Columbus, Ohio. The yield was 6.37 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, which compete with money market funds, were down 2 basis points to 5.16 percent, according to the Bank Rate Monitor's national index. The yield spread between bank money market accounts and money market funds has narrowed to 34 basis points, compared with more than a full percentage point at the start of the year.

Coup's End Lifts Short-Term Rates

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The abrupt end to the Soviet coup yesterday pushed short-term interest rates back up as quickly as they had fallen earlier in the week. Treasury bond prices also rose on the news.
The steep climb in short-term rates left traders scrambling to get out of positions established earlier in the week, when the Soviet crisis made it seem clear that foreign capital, particularly from Europe, would pour into safe dollar-denominated assets, and that short-term interest rates would therefore continue to fall. 
 "It's been a bad day on the Street," one Government securities trader said. "Since Monday, the approach has been to buy the short end of the yield curve, because everybody was convinced that if the Soviet Union totally broke down it would make Germany such a basket case that capital was going to flow like water into bills and short-term notes. People have gotten hurt."
Given the speed with which events unfolded yesterday, and the fact that dealers were unable to fully hedge short-term positions in the futures market until the opening of the Chicago Board of Trade, "most of the people with London offices" probably got clobbered, said James R. Capra, a principal at Moore Capital Management, a New York money management firm.
 
Yield Curve's Blip
 The rise in short-term interest rates left the yield curve, the difference between rates on two-year notes and 30-year bonds, in almost exactly the same shape it was late Friday.
"When we look back at this blip in the yield curve in a couple of years, we are going to scratch our heads and try to remember what caused it," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
The apparent end of the Soviet coup allowed credit market participants to refocus on the Federal Reserve Board. The Fed, which is widely expected to lower key short-term interest rates soon, gave market participants no such signal yesterday.
"As of right now, things are on hold," Mr. Liro said. "We'll just have to wait and see how long it stays that way."
Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Economics, said the quick end to the Soviet crisis left the "present predicament for the U.S. economy pretty much unchanged."
"Therefore," he said, "the presumed bias toward easier monetary policy remains. Now that equity markets around the world have recovered and are rallying, there is still the need for the Fed to ease, and probably more than once."
 
Bonds Climb
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 100 3/4, up 10/32, to yield 8.05 percent, down from 8.08 percent late Tuesday.
Mr. Capra, Mr. Fabbri and others said bond traders may view the apparent end of the Soviet crisis as reducing the risk of holding long-term securities.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 100 21/32, up 3/32, to yield 7.77 percent. But the 6 7/8 percent two-year notes fell by 6/32, to a price of 101 6/32, to yield 6.21 percent.
"A drop of that size in the price of a two-year note is the equivalent of a full point decline in bond prices," Mr. Capra said.
Late yesterday the Treasury announced it will sell $12.5 billion worth of two-year notes on Tuesday, and $9.25 billion worth of five-year notes on Wednesday.
In when-issued trading after the announcement, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.26 percent. The five-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.26 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved sharply higher. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.27 percent, up 17 basis points, or 17 one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose 13 basis points, to 5.26 percent. And one-year bill rates rose 12 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.27 percent.
Elsewhere, the State of California for the first time yesterday issued taxable securities. It offered $602 million worth of taxable general obligation bonds at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Brothers won the issue, which consists of serial bonds maturing from 1992 to 2001.
Coupons on the securities range from 7.70 percent on bonds maturing in 1992 to 8.15 percent on bonds that mature in 2001.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues rose by 1/8 of a point in fairly active trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities, prices of most widely quoted issues increased by 1/8 point, market participants said.

HEADLINE: For China, a Summer of Diplomatic Triumphs

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 21

 BODY:
During a visit to Beijing two months ago, a senior American official warned that any transfer of Chinese M-9 or M-11 missiles to other nations "would have the most profound consequences for our bilateral relations."
China appears to have ignored that warning and transferred the missiles to Pakistan and possibly to Syria as well. Yet there have been no consequences either profound or minor since Reginald Bartholomew, Undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs, issued his warning in June. 
 Beijing's success, at least so far, in evading punishment for its missile sales is characteristic of the success of Chinese diplomacy this summer. For the last two months or so, almost everything has seemed to go right for Prime Minister Li Peng and other top officials in charge of burnishing the nation's external image.
China's latest string of foreign policy triumphs began in early July with its landmark agreement with Britain over a new airport in Hong Kong. Then the United States Senate failed to muster a two-thirds vote to add conditions to China's most-favored-nation trade status, virtually ensuring that China will continue to enjoy its present trade benefits.
This month Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan became the first leader of an industrial country to visit China since the army crackdown on the pro-democracy movement two years ago. Prime Minister John Major of Britain is expected to visit on Sept. 2, also signifying that the Tiananmen crackdown is no longer a serious impediment to Chinese diplomacy.
The Chinese leadership has won praise for its announcement this month that it will sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and it has not been much criticized for the apparent missile sales to Pakistan, and perhaps to Syria as well.
Launchers for the M-11 have been seen in Pakistan, and after Mr. Bartholomew's visit China confirmed that it has sold "short-range" missiles to Islamabad. It refuses to say whether these are the M-11's.
There is less of a consensus among experts on whether the M-9's have been already transferred to Syria. But the Far Eastern Economic Review, a highly regarded Hong Kong magazine, reports in its Aug. 22 issue that up to 24 of the M-9 launchers have been seen in Syria. Asked for a comment, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said reports of the sale were groundless.
Mr. Bartholemew returned to Beijing early this month and was asked at a news conference why there had been no "profound consequences" after all.
"We are going to be pursuing, continuing to pursue, the questions that I raised the last time I was here," he said. "I don't think that we are at the point where there's anything more to be said, at least not during this visit, and I would leave the matter right there."
There are several reasons why the United States may not have followed up on its threats. Washington may want indisputable evidence that the missile transfers have taken place or it may suspect that any transfers involved only a small number of missiles.
In addition, Washington may believe that the M-9 and M-11 missiles are not as threatening as they originally appeared. They are thought to be more accurate than the Scud missiles used by Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, and to be launched more quickly and fly faster, making them less vulnerable to destruction on the ground or in the air. But it is conceivable that they do not exceed the 180-mile international definition for a short-range missile. That would make the M-11 useful for Pakistan primarily as a tactical weapon in the Kashmir region, although the M-9 could be used by Syria to threaten most or all of Israel. The Chinese missiles could carry nuclear warheads, but experts say that it would be technically very complex to build and attach a suitable nuclear warhead.
"They're proliferating more than we would like," said a Western military specialist. "But I don't think that this is having a strategic impact on the world."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Will MCI Always Play David?

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
THE Federal Government gave the MCI Communications Corporation a valuable breathing spell earlier this month. It delayed action on a potentially expensive increase in the costliest item in a long-distance call for MCI and other long-distance carriers. The item, known as "access fees," makes up nearly half the cost of a long-distance call.
The Federal Communications Commission said on Aug. 1 that it would study the situation further instead of allowing current fees to lapse, as scheduled, on Sept. 1. But the Government's lack of action did little to answer the question still bedeviling Wall Street analysts: Has MCI, about one-fourth the size of A.T.& T., gotten as big as it can get? 
 Whether MCI, one of Wall Street's most volatile stocks, will continue to be considered an attractive growth stock turns on whether investors view the American Telephone and Telegraph Company as a permanent Goliath to MCI's David, with United Telecommunications' Sprint and others bringing up the rear, or whether there is still large potential for gaining market share at A.T.& T.'s expense.
Investors are wary. MCI's stock price has limped along since it stumbled to about $18 a share when the recession and a big restructuring charge cut 1990 operating earnings by a third, to $620 million, despite a 19 percent rise in revenue, to $7.7 billion. Most analysts find the stock moderately attractive, yet seem to be constantly shaving their earnings projections by a penny or two. Yesterday, MCI closed at $29.625 a share, far from its 52-week high of $37. At about 13 times projected 1991 earnings, MCI's stock is seemingly undervalued compared with the Standard & Poor's 500, which is trading at around 16.
The shadow of higher access fees, or at least the uncertainty over them, has clouded MCI's luster. The recession, which has hurt the talkative white-collar class that makes many long-distance calls, and a surprisingly competitive A.T.& T., willing to match MCI discount for discount, have added to the doubts.
MCI argues that some securities analysts have misinterpreted the access-fees issue to its disadvantage. They acknowledge the potential for a run-up in MCI's operating costs, but contend that to a greater extent than Wall Street is willing to concede, A.T.& T. will also share the cost of new fees.
The fees themselves are simple. A customer who wants to make a long-distance call from New York to Atlanta, for example, needs a long-distance carrier and two local-telephone companies. New York Telephone and Southern Bell charge fees to the long-distance carrier for access to local lines. These fees cost MCI, on average, 43 cents or more of every dollar of revenue from a long-distance call, according to Charles W. Schelke, a telecommunications analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
A.T.& T., with an advanced network built over decades, qualified for so-called dedicated transport and cheaper fees. MCI and others with different equipment have been rushing to convert from "common transport" and potentially higher fees.
But United States District Judge Harold H. Greene, who oversaw the breakup of A.T.& T., wanted the smaller companies to be able to compete with A.T.& T. He required local phone companies to charge all carriers equal fees, at least for a grace period.
The grace period was to have expired on Sept. 1. But the F.C.C. said it would indefinitely freeze the current access fees, while studying the impact of moving to "cost based," i.e. more expensive, fees for MCI and others. It would also consider another plan that involved "interconnect" fees that tended to equalize fees for everyone.
The upshot, analysts say, is probably a year of F.C.C. study and then several years of gradual price increases or possibly no increase at all.
"But one could argue that MCI should have been getting ready for Sept. 1, but didn't," said Joel D. Gross, a telecommunications analyst at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation.
MCI, however, is nearly ready now, according to James L. Lewis, vice president of regulatory affairs. A "substantial majority" of its network qualifies for cheaper access fees. Moreover, Mr. Lewis contends, any rise in access fees would affect only a third of total access fees -- in other words, just 14 cents or so out of $1 of revenue, rather than the full 43 cents.
MCI is still far smaller than A.T.& T. In the quarter ended June 30, MCI had a 16.8 percent share of nearly $12.5 billion worth of long-distance calls, according to Mr. Schelke of Smith Barney, compared with 69.1 percent for A.T.& T.
But even relatively strong growth for MCI, some analysts say, translates to only a modest addition of 2.5 or more market-share points over the next five years, to about 20 percent or so. And that may not be anything to call home about.

British Air Chooses Boeing And Orders G.E. Engines (Boeing)

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 21

 BODY:
British Airways chose the Boeing Company today as its supplier for aircraft worth $6.85 billion. The decision was a strong confirmation of Boeing's new mid-size jet, the 777, and was a victory for the American company over the competing European Airbus Industrie consortium.
Airline industry analysts were not surprised, however, because British Airways has usually bought from Boeing. The surprising aspect of the decision was that British Airways, which has consistently flown its Boeing aircraft with Rolls-Royce engines, said it would power its 777's with a new engine from the General Electric Company. 
 The order, which General Electric valued at $1.4 billion, is the first for the GE90 engine. British Airways also said it was selling British Airways Engine Overhaul Ltd. to General Electric for 272 million, or $447.14 million at current rates.
 
15 Ordered Plus 15 Options
 British Airways ordered 15 of the 777 twin-engine jets and took options to buy 15 more for a total of $3.6 billion. The airline also said it intended to order 24 additional 747-400 jumbo jets, bringing the total value of its order, including service and support, to $6.85 billion.
The share prices of all three companies rose on the New York Stock Exchange today. Boeing closed up $2.375 at $48.25, British Airways up $1 at $28.75 and General Electric up $2.375 at $72.875.
The 777 has two large wing-mounted engines, providing greater fuel efficiency and simpler operation than comparably sized four-engine jets, and can carry a maximum of 360 passengers. The 777 also offers far greater flexibility of design for customers than had its predecessors. And as configured for British Airways, the first 777's will seat 313 passengers in three classes and have a range of 5,220 miles. The airline will later receive models that have a range of 6,800 miles.
Today's order "shows that Boeing has the marketing clout to launch a new airplane in a difficult economic environment," said Howard A. Rubel, a securities analyst with the brokerage C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell in New York. With three leading carriers in the three large markets -- British Airways, United Airlines and All Nippon Airways -- committed to the 777, "there will be follow-on orders from others," he said.
 
Collaborating With Airlines
 Boeing officials said the orders reflected the benefits of designing the 777 in partnerships with eight airlines, including British Airways, United and All Nippon. Consulting the airlines has been crucial to maintaining a competitive edge against increasingly strong competition from both Airbus Industrie consortium and McDonnell Douglas, the officials said.
"I don't think there's any question that every ounce of airline input is gold," Phil Condit, executive vice president and general manager of the 777 program, said in telephone interview. "It makes the airplane better."
Lord King, chairman of British Airways, said, "We looked very hard indeed at all the aircraft and engine combinations in this highly competitive market, and the outcome represents, by a clear margin, the best decision."
The British Airways order brings the total number of orders for the 777 to 72, with options taken on 65. Boeing said that for 1991 it had 163 firm orders for all commercial jetliners at a value of $14.3 billion.
Mr. Rubel, the securities analyst, noted that General Electric was paying a large premium for British Airways Engine Overhaul Ltd., more than 24 times the 11 million ($18.08 million) in earnings that the maintenance business received last year. "It was a strategic investment that opens the door for them to win the All Nippon order," he said. All Nippon will announce in September which engine it will use for its 777's.
"Bravo G. E.," said Terry Moulton, a principal with Airline Capital Associates in New York, an airline industry consulting firm, calling the selection of the plane's engines a coup for General Electric and a blow to Rolls-Royce. "How much better a launch customer could you get than British Airways?"

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP: OLD GUARD'S LAST GASP;
Communism as a Political Force Is Dead, And the Reformers Gain Strong Legitimacy

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The bungled takeover of the Soviet Government left the incumbents of the Communist past discredited, and hastened the demise of the old guard that had long been whispering caution in the ear of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Communism as an ideology was already so moribund that even the conspirators did not wave the Marxist-Leninist flag, claiming instead stability as their cause. 
 Communism as a political force was today's casualty, since the coup debunked Mr. Gorbachev's rationale for clinging to the Communist Party as his power base, in the hope that by doing so he could keep its diehard partisans in check.
The failed coup legitimized the claim of post-Communist reformers that they are the rightful heirs to power, and invigorated them for the mammoth task of civilizing their country. It also raised the possibility that those who have prevailed may now move against those pillars of the K.G.B. and the military who had conspired against them.
When the euphoria recedes, however, both Mr. Gorbachev and the radicals will still face a fundamental problem that the conspirators were banking on to carry their coup: the public's fear of anarchy, ethnic conflict and economic insecurity, which has eroded trust in all politicians.
"There was fertile soil for this action," said Arkady I. Volsky, a Gorbachev confidant who now heads an association of industrial enterprises. "People are demanding order. But that order should be established by forces elected by the people, by constitutional methods."
Along with their endangered democracy, Soviet citizens today recovered their sense of humor, and across the capital Muscovites shared the same relieved joke: "We knew the Communists couldn't do anything right."
The gibe seemed the perfect epitaph for that Communist machine that once knew how to impose its will on neighboring countries with ruthless efficiency, but now could not manage the hijacking of its own Government.
 
From Boor to Statesman
 The obvious winner, of course, is Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian republic, who rallied the public and kept his elected Government functioning by displaying strength and grace under pressure.
Besides enhancing his authority at home, Mr. Yeltsin at last won the international recognition long denied him.
Mr. Yeltsin, not long ago regarded as a troublesome boor in Washington and European capitals, fielded phone calls from President Bush, Prime Minister John Major of Britain, President Francois Mitterrand of France and other world leaders -- and made the most of this new stature in backing down the coup-masters.
His enhanced stature also strengthens the democrats in other republics, including the beleaguered Baltic states, whose sovereignty Mr. Yeltsin has unflaggingly supported along with Russia's.
Mr. Gorbachev emerges from his three-day captivity in a more ambiguous and shaky position.
The overt show of disloyalty has given him his best chance to purge the nettlesome reactionaries from his Government and extend reforms more forcefully into the military, the K.G.B. and the Interior Ministry, whose leaders all joined the conspiracy.
But his ability to govern is now more than ever dependent on the support of Mr. Yeltsin.
 
Wariness Toward Gorbachev
 In the West, the dramatic demonstration of Mr. Gorbachev's vulnerability, and the sense that the coup was a product of the Soviet leader's own indecisiveness, is likely to create a new wariness toward the hero of perestroika.
At home, the Soviet President will not be welcomed back as a martyr, but interrogated as a man with a lot of questions to answer. After all, he picked the men who tried to overthrow him, and disregarded repeated warnings of danger from close allies. Some liberals continued to speculate that he acquiesced in the coup -- a charge his spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, today fiercely denied -- or at very least was a fool for keeping his trust in the Communists.
At the Russian Parliament building today, a policeman standing guard summed up a common sentiment: "Gorbachev's problem all along was that he trusted the wrong people. He never had any trust in us."
Perhaps the first fundamental misjudgment of the men who led the feckless putsch was to think they could win over the public by disguising themselves as guardians of constitutional order.
The plotters' strategy has not been disclosed, but it appears that they hoped to keep the coup comparatively bloodless, and to give their declared state of emergency a legal gloss by winning approval of the Soviet Parliament next week.
They apparently devoted much effort to winning over centrists, such as the wily chairman of Parliament, Anatoly I. Lukyanov, a Gorbachev law school classmate who at first seemed inclined to go along with the conspirators.
The day after placing Mr. Gorbachev under house arrest, the self-proclaimed new leadership summoned the world press to a news conference as if convinced that their new order would meet with acceptance.
It is an open but intriguing question whether the takeover would have succeeded had it been accompanied by an act of brute force -- like the Chinese massacre of students in Tiananmen Square -- that might have terrorized the public into submission.
 
Why Wasn't Yeltsin Arrested?
 Indeed, the removal of Mr. Gorbachev, the shutdown of the independent news media and the initial parade of tanks into Moscow did inspire a wave of fear and confusion that held the city for the first day.
Why, for example, did the military and K.G.B. not move quickly to arrest Mr. Yeltsin and other potential resisters, before Muscovites had rallied to their defense?
"You have to consider that this circle of people came to the leadership in Gorbachev's time," replied Nikolai N. Vorontsov, the Soviet Minister of Environment and the only non-Communist in the Gorbachev Cabinet. "Maybe they understand that in 1991 you cannot behave the way you could in 1964, when the coup was conducted against Khrushchev."
One sign that a more brutal coup might have worked was the cautious reaction of centrist politicians, including Mr. Lukyanov, who played along, and the leaders of two key republics, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan, who withheld their public condemnation.
 
Conspirators Dawdled
 John Hewko, a Ukrainian-American who watched President Leonid I. Kravchuk of the Ukraine waffle for two days over how to respond to the putsch, said he was convinced that if the junta had moved more decisively, "Kravchuk would probably have gone along with the state of emergency."
Instead the conspirators dawdled, sending their tanks in aimless circles around Moscow. By Tuesday night Mr. Kravchuk worked up the courage to announce that he would not recognize the legality of the self-styled emergency committee, and this morning he warned Moscow that any show of force against his republic would be met in kind.
The coup was hampered, according to both liberals and hard-liners, by the personalities of the men who led it, uncharismatic apparatchiks closely identified with the legacy of Communist centralism.
"They couldn't even find a few quasi-democrats to dress up the list," Mr. Yeltsin said.
Even the devout law-and-order faction in the Soviet Communist Party -- called Soyuz, meaning Union -- could not bring itself to endorse the state of emergency in a meeting Tuesday night.
 
Even a Hard-liner Had Doubts
 Col. Viktor I. Alksnis, a Latvian hard-liner who has long advocated a state of emergency, said the group was divided over the blatant illegality of the conspiracy and the lackluster caliber of its leaders.
"We have argued that such an emergency committee should be created, but by constitutional methods, with the approval of the highest constitutional authority, the Congress of People's Deputies," he said, adding that the hard-line legislators were put off by "the group's complete lack of public credibility."
"When I first heard of it Monday, my personal reaction was positive," Colonel Alksnis conceded. "But as soon as I saw that it was constructed of decrees, all on paper, I quickly became disappointed. They displayed military incompetence, inconsistency, a lack of concrete actions."
The conspirators also gravely underrated the strength of the democratically elected officials, especially Mr. Yeltsin. From the moment on Monday morning when he strode confidently from his office into the crowd and delivered his denunciation of the coup atop a tank, Mr. Yeltsin never flinched. He heaped withering scorn on the eight men he referred to as "the junta."
 
Even the Name Was Ridiculed
 In the speeches of Mr. Yeltsin and his deputies, even the name of the State Committee for the State of Emergency was transformed into an object of public ridicule, since the Russian initials -- G.K.Ch.P. -- resemble the sound of a cat choking on a hairball.
"They underestimated the resolution of the Soviet people not to live the way they had lived for 70 years," said Oleg Kalugin, a renegade K.G.B. agent and liberal deputy in the Russian Parliament. "They simply did not know the mood of the people. That was their major miscalculation."
The public response to the coup was far less impressive than earlier anti-Communist uprisings in Eastern Europe, or even in tiny Lithuania, where at moments of danger it has sometimes seemed the entire population was in the streets.
Much of the public seemed intimidated, resigned, or even indifferent.
But by Tuesday Mr. Yeltsin's headquarters was surrounded by a protective crowd numbering in the tens of thousands. Almost by force of his own determination, Mr. Yeltsin amplified this group into a valiant defense, until it may have seemed just that to the plotters.
By Tuesday the coup showed signs of unraveling. State television and the official Tass news agency, which at first served as the mouthpieces of the emergency committee, began airing Mr. Yeltsin's side. Army units and officers began deserting the junta to defend Mr. Yeltsin.
And tonight, Mr. Yeltsin and his deputies were back on television, describing the week's events as the last gasp of the Communist beast.
Perhaps by then the conspirators were wondering if they had deposed the wrong president.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP: MAN IN THE NEWS;
Enigmatic Commander: Mikhail Alekseyevich Moiseyev

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, identified by Soviet television today as the acting head of the armed forces, has supported arms control agreements with the United States but in many ways remains an enigma to American officials.
General Moiseyev, the Soviet Chief of Staff, may have been lucky to be on vacation far from Moscow when hard-liners staged their ill-fated coup three days ago, according to American officials. They also suggested that he might have planned to be away to avoid being blamed if the coup failed. 
 As Chief of Staff, he was in a position to order troops into the fray or to refuse to take part in the attempt to overthrow President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. American analysts are not sure which side he took, if any, although some surmise that had he been in Moscow, he would have had to support his political patron, Gen. Dmitri T. Yazov, who was Defense Minister as the coup began and one of eight members of the junta.
It was not clear today whether Mr. Gorbachev, in the hours after regaining power, approved the elevation of General Moiseyev, who appears to have assumed control of the armed forces at some point during the coup.
 
Exchanges With Americans
 General Moiseyev has taken part in various exchanges with top American military officers and Administration officials in Washington and Moscow in the last two years. Western analysts believe that his strong support for the recently signed conventional forces treaty, providing for deep reductions in non-nuclear forces in Europe, helped Mr. Gorbachev overcome the potential hurdle of army opposition. But they also say that when Mr. Gorbachev was trying to cut military spending, he made speeches criticizing the Government for providing insufficient services and housing to officers and enlisted soldiers.
"I don't think he's apolitical, but he is not a far right-wing conservative either," said Stephen Meyer, a political scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies the Soviet military.
A Pentagon analyst said General Moiseyev and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had developed "a friendly, pleasant relationship" during several meetings in the United States and the Soviet Union that included a casual evening at the Moscow Circus last month. But he added: "I don't know how they would relate now. We don't know how he was involved in this mess."
In an article General Moiseyev wrote for Izvestia, the Government newspaper, on April 6, he bemoaned the fall of the Warsaw Pact and warned starkly that the Soviet Union now "remains alone against NATO without allies." Still, he argued that Moscow was justified in reducing military spending to "raise the Soviet people's living and everyday conditions."
 
Joined Party in 1962
 Born in 1939 into a working class family in the rural district of Amur in southeast Siberia and a graduate of a tank school in Soviet Asia, Mikhail Alekseyevich Moiseyev (pronounced moy-SAY-yeff) became a member of the Communist Party in 1962 and rose through the army ranks by attaching his star to successful senior officers. He married a Russian literature teacher, Galina, and they have one daughter.
His career progressed quickly when he served as General Yazov's deputy commander in the Far East Military District. When General Yazov was named Defense Minister in May 1987, General Moiseyev became the commander of the district. General Yazov eventually eased out Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev as Chief of Staff and replaced him with his loyal deputy in December 1988.
According to a United States Government biographical sketch of General Moiseyev, he is intelligent and cordial and relies heavily on his staff.
He is reportedly shy among foreigners, although he attended Fourth of July festivities at the American Embassy in Moscow last year.
 
His Stand on Gulf War
 But he publicly took a position at variance with Washington regarding the circumstances under which military force could be used against Iraq in the months leading up to the American-led assault in the Persian Gulf. He argued that economic sanctions against Iraq would have succeeded, a position he continued to promote even after the war.
Administration analysts are reviewing their intelligence reporting to evaluate what role General Moiseyev might have played in the planning of the coup. One official said that Soviet military communications were sometimes unsophisticated and that it was possible he remained uninformed during the initial stages of the coup.
"We don't know what he has been doing the last few days," a Pentagon official said. "He has been notably absent from public view. He hasn't made any statements."
The official said it was not even known who put General Moiseyev in charge of the military, assuming Soviet television reports are correct.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP: GERMANY;
Holding Back Aid Is 'Foolish Policy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Germany responded to the return of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with renewed appeals for Western nations to increase their aid to the Soviet Union.
"The most foolish possible policy now," Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a television audience, "would be for us simply to sit back as interested onlookers and say, 'So, what are they up to in Moscow?' " 
 For the last two years, German officials have warned that without large-scale Western aid, the Soviet Union would remain unstable and perhaps slide toward chaos.
Up to now, most recently at last month's economic summit in London, most Western governments, led by the United States, have been markedly less enthusiastic about extending asssitance on the scale that Germany said was necessary. In the wake of this week's events, however, officials in Bonn say their warnings have even more credence.
The Economics Minister, Jurgen Mollemann, said today that it was now urgent for the West "to give the Soviet Union more and faster help."
Another of Mr. Kohl's senior advisers, Rudolf Seiters, said that the courage with which Soviet citizens stood up against the attempted coup "gives them a right to a major aid program."
Such comments suggest that Germany is preparing to renew its campaign for large-scale Western aid to Mr. Gorbachev's Government. Chancellor Kohl had effectively given it up as hopeless, at least for the time being.
Mr. Kohl and his aides have argued that with a large infusion of Western help over the next few years, the Soviet Union can make the transition to a market economy and become a productive member of the world economic community.
Political leaders in the United States and some other Western countries have rejected that view as naive. They say that the Soviet Union is not ready to absorb large amounts of aid, and that Mr. Gorbachev has not shown true commitment to the idea of free markets.
It has been the first major difference of opinion between Bonn and Washington since German unification last year.
As soon as news of the coup was received on Monday, senior German officials began blaming it partly on the West's refusal to send more aid to Moscow.
The Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, while not mentioning the United States specifically, lamented that more countries had not supported Mr. Gorbachev "with deeds as well as with words, the way Germany did within the limits of its possibilities."
News of the coup's failure was greeted with special relief here. Germans fear that further upheaval in the Soviet Union could have dire consequences for them. Under some worst-case scenarios, large numbers of Soviet refugees could flood toward Germany, and Soviet troops stationed here could defect by the thousand.
Prominent politicians hailed today's turn of events as a victory for freedom over oppression. Many praised Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian federated republic, and officials said that Mr. Yeltsin may visit Germany soon.
German markets were closing as the news of Mr. Gorbachev's likely return flashed across news wires. There was a late rally.
The German government has been encouraging private businesses to invest in the Soviet Union, and has guaranteed billions of dollars worth of investments there.
On Monday, the day of the coup, fears for the value of those investments surged, and the German stock market suffered its largest one-day loss since 1989.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP: THE NEXT CHAPTER;
Bush Must Reassess U.S.-Soviet Relations

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The collapse of the Soviet coup, a breathtakingly rapid realization of what had seemed but a frail hope to the Bush Administration only 48 hours earlier, will require a comprehensive recalibration of American policy toward Moscow. It will confront President Bush with major challenges, even as he savors a personal victory and a triumph for democracy.
It also constitutes one of the most vivid demonstrations to date of the power of global communications to help shape contemporary history. 
 If the anti-totalitarian forces prevailed in part because of ineptitude on the part of the coup plotters, they were also aided by a vast constituency, assembled electronically inside the Soviet Union and outside it, that reached quick agreement that the coup should be resisted. Mr. Bush, Prime Minister John Major of Britain and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, whose position was ticklish because of the Soviet troops that remain on German soil, made the weight of their wealthy nations felt inside the Kremlin within hours.
That was reinforced by the image of Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian republic's president, spouting defiance from the top of a Soviet tank, like Lenin brandishing a fist at the barricades in a Soviet realist painting -- one of those emblematic moments that television can burn into the world's consciousness.
In addition, modern communications obviously played a major part over the last six years in planting the seeds of democracy, much more deeply than many had thought possible before this week, in the hitherto stony soil of Russia, with its thousand-year history of tyranny. When the test came, Soviet citizens in the hundreds of thousands willingly exposed themselves to danger to defend abstract ideals that many had learned of by radio and television.
The political panorama of Moscow was changed beyond recognition from the one Mikhail S. Gorbachev left earlier this month to go on vacation, and what the United States and its allies do now will have to reflect the new realities.
Will Washington cling to its policy of betting on Mr. Gorbachev as the best hope for democracy, or put its money on the triumphant leader of the counter-coup? Will it keep working to keep the Soviet Union united, or will it back the Baltic republics in their drives for independence? Will it see this as the moment when large-scale foreign aid can help entrench democracy, or will it continue to hold back pending comprehensive reform?
One thing is clear: President Bush will have a relatively free hand to do what he thinks best; in domestic political terms he has scored yet another foreign-policy triumph, having insisted upon and worked toward a turnaround in Moscow when skeptics thought him foolish. He looks more invulnerable than ever as the 1992 campaign approaches, and there was a certain symmetry in the fact that a potential Democratic challenger, Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee, chose today for his announcement that he would not be running for President.
 
Yeltsin Seen as Dominant Figure
 Although Mr. Bush, with his characteristic caution, spoke of Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin almost as partners for the months to come, politicians and experts here believe Mr. Yeltsin is now the dominant figure as the result of his dramatic stand against the tanks of the now-dissolved junta.
"It is clear that the Gorbachev era is over and the Yeltsin era has begun," said Representative Dave McCurdy, the Oklahoma Democrat who serves as chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence. Others, including Madeleine Albright and Robert Legvold, two leading experts in Soviet affairs, suggested that Mr. Gorbachev might have an important if diminished role as a transitional figure until national elections next year, or as a federal leader responsible for foreign affairs, or as a symbol of national unity.
Much depends on the shape of the new Soviet Union, and it seems evident that the failed coup -- "the last hurrah of the apparatchiks," as Jack Matlock, former American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, called it -- has accelerated rather than slowed one of the trends the hard-liners hoped to halt, that of ever-shrinking central power and ever-increasing autonomy for the republics. Mr. Yeltsin will presumably be strengthened by that, as the leader of the most important republic, a senior State Department official said.
Mr. Bush at first shrank from Mr. Yeltsin, believing that to embrace him would hurt Mr. Gorbachev. Although he moved closer after the burly Russian was elected President of the republic this spring, the White House still dragged its feet in arranging Mr. Yeltsin's visit to Washington, which was sponsored by Congressional leaders headed by Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas. Congressional officials who coordinated the trip said Mr. Bush adamantly refused to send any ranking official to the airport to greet the visitor.
 
Russian Earns Devoted Following
 In his comments today, Mr. Bush lavishly praised Mr. Yeltsin for his courage, saying he now had "a well-earned stature around the world that he might not have had," and the Russian leader has also earned himself a devoted following in other corners of Washington. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, urged much stronger United States support for the Russian president, with the comment, "If we can't help a man like that, what did we fight the cold war for?"
President Bush is likely to face renewed pressure from the supporters of Baltic independence in the wake of the coup's collapse. He and his advisers have argued in the past that backing the Baltic republics would endanger the relationship of the United States and Mr. Gorbachev; that contention will carry much less weight now that Mr. Gorbachev's right-wing foes are in flight and he has been rescued, in effect, by those who back self-determination.
Mr. Bush may yield some ground on that front. But he is highly likely to resist the suggestion, advanced today by many in Washington, that now is the time to increase exponentially Western aid to the Soviet Union. He insisted at the economic conference in London this summer that reform must go much further before aid would really help, and he is likely, despite the euphoria of the moment, to adhere to that position as the Soviets renew their struggle to reshape their national economy.
 
Baker Urges Reforms
 In Brussels today, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d pooh-poohed the idea of a major policy re-evaluation. He urged "fundamental free-market reforms" and added, "You're not going to see the Soviet Union succeed economically through the mechanism of free check-writing on the part of others."
Robert Blackwill, a former White House aide, now at Harvard University, said the first step should be to ascertain "whether Gorbachev's three-day sojourn in captivity has made him a free marketeer." If it has and reform flows quickly, Mr. Blackwill said, "then the West ought to engage big-time, but not before then, and not simply on the basis of this stupendous, thrilling moment."
The Europeans opposed Mr. Bush's stand in London, where Mr. Gorbachev appeared to appeal for more direct aid, and they may be ready to renew the battle now. The French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, suggested that the West may have missed a chance to avoid a coup by inaction at London and must now "examine its conscience."

HEADLINE: Dow Soars In Rebound Of Markets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
World financial markets did an about-face yesterday, rallying strongly as word spread from the Soviet Union that Monday's coup had collapsed and that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would be restored to power.
In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 88.10 points, up 3 percent, to close at 3,001.79, the largest one-day rise since the beginning of the allied bombing of Iraq in January. Together with Tuesday's 15-point rise, this surge more than wiped out Monday's 69-point plunge. [Page D8.] 
 In Europe, stock and bond markets also rallied, although leading markets did not regain all that was lost in the sometimes panicky reaction on Monday. But that was in part because these markets closed before the full extent of the Soviet turnabout was known.
Several analysts said the rallies should continue today. Indeed, in Tokyo early today, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks gained 464.17 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 22,515.77.
 
A Sigh of Relief
 The dollar fell sharply yesterday as the threat of chaos in the Soviet Union eased and investors who had fled to the haven of the American currency took their money back home. Against the German mark, the dollar ended down 3.2 percent and below where it was before the coup. The yields on Treasury bills rose sharply for the same reason. [Pages D17 and D16.]
There was an almost audible sigh of relief in the markets at the sudden turn of events, which many called the Yeltsin Rally, after Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian republic, who stood up to the coup leaders.
On Monday, analysts were wondering how far-reaching the impact of the coup would be and whether it could trip up economic recoveries in the United States and elsewhere.
But yesterday, John Lipsky of Salomon Brothers in London, said "never mind," echoing the famous refrain of Gilda Radner as Emily Litella on "Saturday Night Live." David Roche of Morgan Stanley, who had interrupted his vacation Monday to return to work, said he now would resume his holiday.
Mr. Lipsky and Mr. Roche said that the reversal of the coup would not just mean a return to the status quo, but that the outlook for the Soviet Union should be a little more optimistc because economic reform should move more quickly now.
In addition, they said, the lessening of further threats of political trouble in the Soviet Union makes the outlook brighter for the German stock market.
Analysts also reversed their feelings that the coup and its financial fallout would lead to a lowering of worldwide interest rates as part of an effort to contain any economic crisis. "The bias toward interest rates is more or less gone," said Kit Juckes, international economist for S. G. Warburg in London.
The rally actually began to take shape late Tuesday as markets stabilized and there were signs that the coup leaders were having problems.
When stock trading began yesterday in Tokyo, there was both positive and negative news: Three opponents to the coup had been reported killed in a clash with the military while unconfirmed reports said several leaders of the coup had been replaced or fallen ill. The Nikkei index gained 364.54 points yesterday, to 22,051.60, after rising 230.30 on Tuesday. With today's gain, the Nikkei has recovered 78 percent of the 1,357.61 loss that it suffered on Monday.
In Germany, where the impact of the coup was the strongest because of the huge numbers of Soviet troops stationed in the country's east, the DAX index of 30 leading shares rose 43.89 points, or 2.9 percent, to 1,570.82, after climbing 29 points on Tuesday. But the market is still 82.55 points, or 5.3 percent, below where it was last Friday. Mr. Roche said the rally should continue today as long as the positive news does not change.
The markets in Britain, France, Norway and Sweden, however, came closer to making up the losses caused by the coup. In Britain, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 shares rose 47.4 points, to 2,601.9, 19.1 points short of the pre-coup level. In Norway, the All Share index rose 17.23, to 510.44, just 10.18 points short. And in Sweden, the Affarsvarlden index rose 31.70 points, to 1,084.70, just 19.1 points below last Friday's close.
In the foreign exchange market, trading since Monday has been a rough up-and-down ride. Traders like volatility because it is an opportunity to make money. But the dollar's 3.4 percent move up on Monday, followed by the 3.2 percent drop yesterday, are also opportunties for traders to get caught in the wrong -- and losing -- position.
By the end of trading in New York yesterday, the dollar was at 1.7408 German marks, down from 1.7985 Tuesday and 1.8245 Monday. At that level, the dollar was lower against the mark than before the coup. But that is not unusual, since moves in the currrency market tend to be exaggerated.

HEADLINE: New Troubles for Salomon: Suits Grow, Clients Defect

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Salomon Brothers Inc. suffered several new blows yesterday in the growing Treasury markets scandal, as more clients suspended doing business with the firm, a state treasury announced it would stop buying the short-term debt the firm issues to finance itself, and more investors queued up to sue the firm.
The World Bank, one of the most valuable and blue-chip customers in the securities industry, also announced yesterday that it was suspending all business activities with Salomon through Sept. 30. 
 The action by the World Bank appeared to be a signal to Wall Street that the international lending agency would only deal with firms whose ethical standards were beyond question. In a communication to Salomon, released by the firm, the World Bank said that "if our Sept. 30 review indicates that you once again meet the high standards we set for our financial partners, we would expect to resume our normal business relationship."
The loss of business with the World Bank, whose global bond issues Salomon helped manage for the last several years, was the most stinging rebuke from a client of the firm since the Treasury markets scandal unfolded. The change in Salomon, which had a reputation for arrogance before the scandal, was visible in the firm's unusual apology to the bank.
"Salomon Brothers would like to apologize to the World Bank and its member governments for any embarrassment caused by our actions," the firm said in a statement.
Other customers also stopped important business. California officials, who the day before suspended trading with the firm's Government bond desk, said they would discontinue buying the firm's short-term commercial paper. The California treasury owns $230 million in Salomon commercial paper and will not renew those investments when they mature. Despite that decision, California said it would go ahead with a $602 million issue of taxable bonds that Salomon will co-manage with Goldman, Sachs.
The market's confidence has been shaken, Kathleen Brown, the California State Treasurer, said. "California must take every step to insure the safety of the fund," she added. But state officials said the decision to stop making short-term investments in Salomon's commercial paper did not have any bearing on the bond issue that Salomon helped underwrite because the firm was part of the group that submitted the best bid.
The move by California was the only public indication that any of the firm's sources of funds were being affected. Brokerage firms like Salomon are heavily dependent on being able to borrow huge sums of money cheaply to finance their inventories of securities, and they borrow from banks and other institutions and by selling their own securities, including commercial paper.
Salomon had previously said it had other financial options, including backup lines of credit from banks, to continue financing its operations.
In addition, two Massachusetts state pension funds also suspended their relationships with Salomon. The Massachusetts State Teachers and Employee Retirement Fund, and the Pension Reserve Investment Trust will halt doing business with the firm, the State Treasurer, Joseph Mallone, said, until he was assured that the firm had put controls in place to prevent more violations of the law.
As current clients suspended their business, some former customers brought new actions against the firm. In one of the suits filed against Salomon yesterday, the buyers of preferred securities that Salomon issued for itself in June said they had been defrauded.
That lawsuit, filed by Fred and Rita Schwartz in Federal District Court in Manhattan, charges that the June prospectus for the $100 million worth of preferred securities failed to disclose that the senior management of Salomon, including John H. Gutfreund, who resigned Sunday as chairman and chief executive, had been told two months earlier about illegal bidding on the investment house's Government securities desk. The suit said the misleading information kept the price of the securities above where it would have otherwise been.
The Schwartzes bought 400 of the 4.25 million depository preferred shares issued in that offering at $25 each. The complaint asks that it be granted class-action status.
 
Preferred Shares Fall
 The preferred shares fell $1.25 yesterday, to $22.75, in New York Stock Exchange trading. Since they were sold, they have traded as high as $25.875, and as low as $22.625 -- a low that was reached during yesterday's trading.
In the second suit filed in Federal court in Manhattan yesterday, a purchaser of $200,000 of two-year Treasury notes on May 22, said the price he had paid for the notes was inflated because of Salomon's misconduct.
The troubles for Salomon from civil litigation are not over, lawyers said. Robert N. Kaplan, a lawyer for the Schwartzes, said the complaint filed yesterday was going to become part of a broader complaint that he is working on with other lawyers.
In a sign of the significance the investigation has gained in Washington, William McLucas, the director of the enforcement division for the Securities and Exchange Commission, has decided to conduct the inquiry of Salomon personally, people involved in the case said. Mr. McLucas is said to have made a point of telling others in the case that he is handling the details of the Salomon inquiry himself, these sources said.
The widening investigation has brought a mini-boom to securities lawyers, who have been hired by the dozens of securities firms and Wall Street executives who have been contacted in the Government inquiry. "This is the full employment act for Wall Street lawyers," one securities lawyer involved in the case said yesterday.
 
Names Begin to Come Out
 New information about the illegal bidding scandal also emerged yesterday, as one of the firm's clients whose name was improperly used by former Salomon traders in its illegal bidding in several Treasury auctions stepped forward.
Mercury Asset Management, the largest pension fund manager in Britain, said yesterday that its name had been submitted on bids at two Treasury auctions, the four-year note auction in December and the five-year note auction in February, by former Salomon employees without authorization. Mercury said it was providing information to the American authorities.
In a statement, Salomon confirmed that Mercury's name had been used in the bidding. "We deeply regret this clear violation of a valued customer relationship and the new management of Salomon Brothers has already take steps to insure that it will not happen again," the firm said.
Salomon executives, meanwhile, are scrambling to reassure clients of the firm's integrity and to try to hold business. Among the clients they were visiting was British Telecom. The company had chosen Salomon earlier this month to underwrite its $8.5 billion offering.

HEADLINE: Now, Finish the Revolution;
What Mr. Gorbachev Owes His Defenders

 BODY:
The global village sighed with relief yesterday morning just as suddenly as it had gasped with shock Sunday night. People around the world who still find it hard to believe that the Persian Gulf war ended in 100 hours are gratefully incredulous that a power grab in the Soviet Union could be undone at all, let alone in 60 hours.
How could it happen? President Bush gave one explanation at his morning news conference yesterday when Peter Maer of Mutual-NBC Radio asked what message he had for Mikhail Gorbachev. "Stay with your principles, stay with your reforms," the President said -- and "stand shoulder to shoulder" with Boris Yeltsin, the president of Russia. 
 The Soviet people did all that this week, standing shoulder to shoulder against this last ominous outburst from old gray neoconservatives. If there was any doubt that new winds are sweeping across the Soviet Union, they are erased by this thrilling triumph for freedom.
Americans know that Mr. Gorbachev stirred those winds. The New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that his standing in this country has leaped to 66 percent popularity, almost up to Mr. Bush's 73 percent.
Americans also know how bravely Mr. Yeltsin stood for reform. With his neck at risk, he faced down tanks and kept open lines of communication to the world. "Clouds of terror and dictatorship are gathering over Russia, but this night will not be eternal," he said to wavering troops. His example emboldened leaders and citizens alike.
But with full respect for Mikhail Gorbachev's vision and Boris Yeltsin's courage, the larger lesson of the coup is not heroism. This triumph, if it is to last, cannot turn merely on electric personalities. It will have to become a triumph of dull -- dependable -- democratic process.
The coup plotters contended they were saving the system from chaos. Instead, in their desperation, they ended up destroying the old Soviet order. By the end, even the Communist Party renounced any connection to these old party stalwarts.
The plotters' rout shows how thoroughly the Gorbachev revolution has transformed the Soviet Union. Republic leaders like Kazakhstan's Nursultan Nazarbayev and the Ukraine's Leonid Kravchuk hesitated, then rallied to Mr. Yeltsin's side. And ordinary citizens overcame fear and fatalism to stand up for the rule of law and radical reform.
The early mottoes of the Gorbachev era were glasnost, openness; perestroika, reform; and a third, soon sunk by ridicule, uskoreniye, acceleration. Now the time for uskoreniye has truly arrived. The return of Mr. Gorbachev to the Soviet presidency will not in itself be sufficient.
The collapse of the coup betokens a transforming change in political power. The Soviet President will now be freed from dead hands of the past that have pulled him right, at times hard right. Now he is not only freer to pursue reform; he owes it to his brave reformist defenders to do so.
Accelerating radical reform is the best protection against further upheavals. The obvious starting point is the new Union treaty whose scheduled signing Tuesday probably incited the plotters.
The treaty does much more than regularize relations between Moscow and the various Soviet republics. It provides, among other things, for the early popular election of the next Soviet president. And by breaking the stranglehold of the central apparatus, it would open the way for economic reforms needed to justify important Western aid.
Other countries so far shrink from pouring billions into a black hole in which the word "market," let alone the fact, is barely understood. But they might gladly encourage investment and assistance if there were a credible Soviet economic program. So far, when presented with plausible programs, Mr. Gorbachev has repeatedly shied away at the last minute.
If he will now embrace such a program, this misbegotten mess of a coup can yet have a highly constructive legacy. The old guard's self-destruction can make it possible for him -- and future Soviet presidents -- to give the Soviet people the standard of living and of life that they stood up for this week. That process can start today.

To a Florida Congressman, the recession might be about to end, but an out-of-work New Yorker pounding the pavement in search of a job has a very different perception ("Let Unemployment Benefits Run Out," Op-Ed, Aug. 6). E. Clay Shaw Jr.'s Pollyanna view of a rebounding economy underscores a fundamental flaw in the unemployment insurance system, and he even points out -- unintentionally -- why it needs to be reformed: all recessions are not equal, especially region by region. 
 Business may be on the upswing in Florida, but New York City's recession is deeply entrenched, and prospects for a turnaround are bleak. Unofficially, about 28 percent of the city's 4.2 million potential work force is out of work. Mr. Shaw suggests these job seekers turn to "productive industries," but the metropolitan area lost more than 100,000 private-sector jobs last year and is expected to lose about 180,000 more public- and private-sector jobs through 1992. With recovery lagging behind the rest of the country, there are almost no growth industries and few jobs for laid-off workers.
Meanwhile, 42,463 city residents exhausted their 26 weeks of unemployment insurance in the first four months of 1991 alone. By year's end their numbers will tally 150,000. For many, welfare and even homelessness are just around the corner.
There are deeper concerns about the viability of the country's unemployment insurance system, which has been deteriorating steadily since 1975, when benefits were available for up to 65 weeks. Then, 70 percent of all workers were covered by the system, compared with 37 percent now, largely because of the trend toward part-time and temporary jobs.
Since extended benefits are triggered by a figure based on the number of jobs in the unemployment insurance system, the official unemployment rate has to be extremely high before additional benefits are given. Official unemployment would have to reach 11 percent in New York State to get additional help for beleaguered New York City, where rates are edging close to 9 percent.
The method for triggering additional benefits has to be revamped to reflect real unemployment levels, and there should be a method to allow extended benefits to regions that are especially hard hit by unemployment.
But an emergency extension is not enough: the entire unemployment system needs reworking, and New Yorkers should hold Congress to its promise to scrutinize and fix the system this fall.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP;
Bush Looks Ahead to Accelerated Soviet Reforms and Greater Stature for Yeltsin

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 21

 BODY:
Declaring today a "very fine day" for democracy, President Bush began looking ahead to a changed Soviet Union in which he expects democratic reform to leap forward and President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic to enjoy an "enormous" new stature in his own country and around the world.
Recounting his 12-minute conversation with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which he said had begun at 12:19 P.M. Eastern time, Mr. Bush said, "In his view the constitutional authorities are back in power and democracy and freedom have prevailed." 
 The President, who looked tired after monitoring the unsuccessful coup in the Soviet Union, which had interrupted his vacation, added: "He stated his sincere appreciation to the people of the United States and others around the world for their support for democracy and freedom. He sounded in good physical condition. Indeed, his voice was buoyant."
 
Delighted at the Outcome
 Mr. Bush, who has always been careful to observe diplomatic protocol with the other members of the club of world leaders he has assembled while in office, emphasized that his official dealings would continue to be with Mr. Gorbachev. He said the Soviet President "has certainly not been diminished by this at all."
"He will still be a force to be reckoned with," Mr. Bush told a group of reporters whom he called to his Walkers Point vacation home for his second news conference in less than two and a half hours. It capped a tumultuous day that began with restrained optimism after a phone call to Mr. Yeltsin and later included expressions of the President's "delight."
Before heading off for an afternoon round of golf in a chill drizzle, Mr. Bush reminded reporters of his "respect for Gorbachev."
Looking ahead, Mr. Bush said the vanquishing of the coup should change attitudes in the Soviet Union and abroad about the longevity of the reforms Mr. Gorbachev has undertaken. "What will be filtered out will be the fear of a right-wing military takeover, because the people will see that the power of the people to stand up against this illegality is pretty good, pretty strong," Mr. Bush said.
He also signaled that he might be more inclined to consider greater financial aid to Moscow in light of the events of the last few days. And his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said he believed that the vanquishing of the coup might also bolster public support for economic assistance to the Soviet Union and make American companies more willing to invest in that country.
 
Yeltsin's Gain in Stature
 But as Mr. Gorbachev prepared to return to the Kremlin, Mr. Bush said that Mr. Yeltsin "will have a well-earned stature around the world that he might not have had -- that he was on his way to having but might not have fully achieved before all this happened."
With Soviet power back in the hands of a constitutional authority and the risks that Mr. Bush took in backing Mr. Yeltsin seeming to be paying off, the President and his aides were free to begin pondering what one senior official said would be "inevitable changes" in the relations between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin and between Moscow and Washington in general.
Mr. Bush seemed to be addressing this in his conversations today with the two Soviet officials. Mr. Bush said he had told Mr. Gorbachev, "as I've told Yeltsin, that we're ready to talk to the leaders of the republics and certainly we'll be ready to talk and deal with the President of the Soviet Union itself."
While American officials said it was too early to draw sweeping conclusions, they suggested that the end of the coup could accelerate progress toward free-market policies, cement the Soviet Union's democratic reforms and radically alter the equation in the negotiations between Moscow and its constituent republics.
An Administration official said the United States would have to walk a delicate line while Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev sort out their own relationship.
 
'A Very Courageous Individual'
 But Mr. Bush's admiration of Mr. Yeltsin was vividly apparent today. He referred to "President Yeltsin" repeatedly, and White House aides said Mr. Bush had been deeply affected by the televised scenes of Mr. Yeltsin's mounting a tank in Moscow to hurl his defiance at the Kremlin junta that seized power for three days.
"It leaves the world looking at him as a very courageous individual, duly elected by the people, standing firmly and courageously for democracy and freedom with enormous stature as a result of that," he said.
Even Mr. Bush's response to a reporter who asked -- before Mr. Bush was able to speak to Mr. Gorbachev -- what message he would send to the Soviet President offered a subtle indication of the way the image of Mr. Yeltsin has changed in Mr. Bush's mind.
Mr. Bush said: "I would say: 'Stay with your principles. Stay with your reforms. Stay with your commitment to democratic process and constitutional law. Stand shoulder to shoulder with Yeltsin, as you have been, in seeing the evolution of democracy and perestroika and glasnost in the Soviet Union.' "
Mr. Bush said he was confident that there would not be a "Gorbachev-versus-Yeltsin battle" for power in the aftermath of the failed coup. "I think he is properly and with feeling expressing himself in total support of Mr. Gorbachev," Mr. Bush said.
A senior Administration official said Mr. Bush's attitude toward Mr. Yeltsin had undergone "a fairly steady evolution ever since his first, ill-fated visit" to the United States in 1989, when Mr. Bush refused to receive Mr. Yeltsin formally. White House aides recounted with some disdain the way Mr. Yeltsin simply turned up at the White House, refused to enter at first unless he saw Mr. Bush and then had to be cajoled into meeting with Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser.
At the time, Mr. Yeltsin was an unelected politician and a prime irritant to Mr. Gorbachev, with whom Mr. Bush was doing important business. On Mr. Yeltsin's second visit, as President of the Russian republic, he was received in the Oval Office.
"His election impressed people here," the official said.
He went on: "Yeltsin was the first popularly elected leader of Russia in history and got an enormous mandate. People who are engaged in electoral politics themselves take that kind of thing very seriously. His modus vivendi with Gorbachev and his turning into a partner, however fractious, in trying to reach a negotiated outcome to the country's problems impressed people that he had taken a very realistic turn.
"Then his last visit here was important. People saw a different kind of guy, somebody who was much more sophisticated, much more aware of himself and just a much more savvy player on the domestic and international scene. The President quoting him and the phone calls over the past few days were all the logical outcome of this process."

Illegal 'Subcontracting'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"New Rows to Hoe in the 'Harvest of Shame' " (Week in Review, July 28) attributes many of the problems afflicting migrant farm workers to "the growing practice of defining migrant laborers as independent subcontractors, rather than employees." 
 Unfortunately, farmers aren't the only employers who misclassify employees as "independent" subcontractors. More and more contractors in the construction industry are employing workers as independent subcontractors to avoid paying legally mandated benefits -- workers' compensation, unemployment insurance and Social Security -- to gain a competitive bidding advantage, according to industry witnesses who testified before Congress last April.
The General Accounting Office estimated that in 1984 alone the Federal Government lost $1.6 billion in tax revenues because of employee misclassification. The lost revenues represent nearly 10 percent of the entire Department of Housing and Urban Development budget for that year. This scheme not only cheats taxpayers, but also hurts employees who do not receive their benefits, and contractors, both union and nonunion, who lose jobs to unscrupulous employers who knowingly break the law.
Misclassifying employees is a national epidemic in the construction industry that involves an alarming number of large contractors who do business with major corporations and the Federal Government. Recently, for example, a large Massachusetts contractor, Total Property Services of New England, was convicted in Connecticut for labor violations related to employee misclassification while remodeling a General Mills Red Lobster restaurant. The contractor, which also does millions of dollars of business with the Federal Government, is under investigation by the General Services Administration.
Fortunately, in the last year several states have passed legislation allowing contractors to sue competitors who win bids by misclassifying employees as independent subcontractors. Congress has also held hearings on employee misclassification that are likely to generate legislative proposals.
If the practice of misclassifying employees as independent subcontractors continues to grow, more employees will lose their benefits and be exempted from Federal and state labor law protection; more employers who properly classify their employees will lose work to competitors who do not, and the taxpayers' burden will grow.

Extend Benefits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
E. Clay Shaw Jr.'s argument that unemployment benefits should not be extended because of the imminent demise of a mild recession (Op-Ed, Aug. 6) belies the situation in Massachusetts and probably much of the Northeast. The last published unemployment rate for this state was 9.1 percent, down from 9.7 percent. This does not include those who no longer qualify for benefits, those who have given up or who have taken part-time or marginal jobs just to keep afloat. 
 Mr. Shaw's denigrating depiction of the Democratic view of unemployment ("a worker laid off by declines in his industry, spending every day looking for a job, running out of money") is accurate here. Thousands of workers from every sector of society are at the point where they have run through their savings, severance and unemployment, and are losing their homes.
According to published reports, bankruptcies and foreclosures are at their greatest level since the Great Depression. As a psychotherapist, I can report firsthand that the numbers of unemployed people seeking help for severe emotional problems and stress-related medical illnesses, and the rate of suicide attempts among such people, have increased precipitously. This hardly sounds like the end of a mild recession.
For this reason, we should support unemployed workers for 20 more weeks. Economists disagree on whether or not the recession has bottomed out, but believe recovery will be slow. With eclonomic improvement will come more jobs and a chance for these normally productive members of society to recover. To deny them that chance would be unconscionable.

Bush Quotes Gorbachev: Leader 'Tells Me That Things Are Under Control'

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 21

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conferences here today at 10:36 A.M. and 1:20 P.M.:

 	 	 		10:36 A.M.	 		OPENING STATEMENT	 	 Well, I wanted to report to the American people on some of the latest developments related to the situation in the Soviet Union.
 I spoke at length this morning to President Boris Yeltsin. The call began at about 8:30, and I also talked to Ambassador Strauss, who is now in our embassy in Moscow, in position, and I also talked in the last, oh, 20 hours, to President Menem in Argentina, Prime Minister Mulroney, Prime Minister Major, and I will continue these kinds of consultative calls.
 President Yeltsin was clearly encouraged by the fact that he had survived another night in the Russian Parliament building without a major assault by the forces supporting his coup. He told me that tens of thousands of Muscovites had turned out to help guard the building from attack.
 Yeltsin said he was encouraged by indications that more and more military units and their commanders were abandoning support of the coup.

 	 	 		. . .	 		QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS	 	 Q. Mr. President, with Boris Yeltsin anchoring democratic opposition to this coup, where does that leave him if things do in fact resolve themselves satisfactorily?
 A. It leaves the world looking at him as a very courageous individual, duly elected by the people, standing firmly and courageously for democracy and freedom, with enormous stature as a result of that.
 
U.S.-Yeltsin Ties
 Q. Would that change the U.S. approach towards Mr. Yeltsin in any way?
 A. The U.S. approach towards Mr. Yeltsin, as you know, is to be supportive of those who were elected. Ever since he has been elected he has received total support and before he was elected he was received properly. But I must say, in terms of the respect level, I will join others all around the world, not just politicians or elected leaders of countries, in saying that he has shown tremendous courage and the people appear to be rallying behind him. And as I said earlier on, to some skepticism, 48 hours ago or more, that look, all these coups don't succeed and democracy, once unleashed, is a pretty powerful force.
 So I think he will have a well-earned stature around the world that he might not have had -- he was on his way to having but might not have fully achieved before all this happened, provided it works out the way certainly the United States wants it to work out.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Gorbachev's Future
 Q. Assuming that President Gorbachev does recover his authority, how will this affect his ability to keep the Soviet Union on a stable path? Will he be strengthened by it or weakened?
 A. I would say, a little hypothetical for me to get into, but given Yeltsin's support for him and given the respect with which he's held by leaders all around the world, and that has certainly not been diminished by this at all, he will still be a force to be reckoned with. And again, they can sort out inside their own matters. But what will be filtered away, should Gorbachev be reinstated, as we hope he will be, what will be filtered out will be the fear of a right-wing military takeover because the people will see that the power of the people to stand up against this illegality is pretty good, pretty strong.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Coup's Unraveling
 Q. Mr. President, given the, quote, unquote, leader of the coup leaders, are you surprised they sort of went halfway with their coup and were -- the incredible, apparently disorganization of it?
 A. I think it's too early to decree how disorganized it is, but I think they underestimated the power of the people, they underestimated what a taste of democracy and freedom brings, and everyone recognizes that there were serious economic problems, and I think they felt we'll come in there, promise food on the shelves, and to solve these problems, and then they saw that overriding all of that was a commitment by many, many people in Russia and in the Soviet Union, entirely to democracy, for democracy. So I think there, if this coup fails, that will be the serious miscalculation.

 	 	 		1:20 P.M.	 		OPENING STATEMENT	 	 Well, I just wanted to report that at 12:19 I had a phone conversation with Mikhail Gorbachev, and lasted about -- what, 20 minutes, I think. It was a good call. Gorbachev is still in the Crimea. He will return either tonight or tomorrow to Moscow. He tells me that things are under control.
 His first call, I believe, was with Boris Yeltsin. He stated his sincere appreciation to the people of the United States and others around the world for their support for democracy and reform, and he sounded in good physical condition -- indeed, his voice was buoyant. And Barbara was with me, and we both asked him to convey our respects to Raisa, which he -- and he, very kindly, made references to his friendship with Barbara and me on a personal basis.
 But it was good, it was a good talk. It's a good development. And now he will be going back to Moscow, and hopefully working with the Presidents of the republic -- Nazarbayev and Kraychuk, the Ukraine leader, staying with him, there's a good basis now for all of this.
 So we'll see what happens, but in his view, the constitutional authorities are back in power, and democracy and freedom and reform have prevailed. And that's his assessment. I hope it's not ahead of where things stand in Moscow. I've not talked again to President Yeltsin, but he believes that Moiseyev has ordered the forces back from -- to their bases, and all in all it's a very, very positive development.

 	 	 		QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS	 	 Q. Did he discuss the circumstances surrounding his confinement?
 A. No, he didn't, except that his guards, he did say, stayed very loyal to him.
 Q. Does that mean he was never under actual physical ----
 A. I have no idea. I didn't go into all of that.
 Q. Did you get any detail on the 10-plus-1 agreement today? What's the status of that?
 A. No, no. We just got a detail on the fact that freedom and democracy have prevailed, and he's expressing his sincere appreciation to us.
 
Fate of Coup
 Q. Had he talked to people from the coup that assured him that the coup was over? Have they given him ----
 A. I don't know, I don't know. There are all kinds of wild rumors about what's happened to people involved in the coup, but I don't want to go into that. Some of them may be accurate and some may not. But he was anticipating some of them coming to see him. He said that to me, but whether that proves to be the case or not, I don't know.
 
Gorbachev's Status
 Q. Will he be the President again? What's his status?
 A. He feels that way.
 Q. And did he say what happened in the last couple of hours?
 A. No. Just the fact that he was elated, and it sounded like for the last hour he was back fulfilling his duties and calling the shots.
 
Why Takeover Failed
 Q. What do you consider the main factor in the failure of the coup?
 A. The fact that they underestimated democracy and freedom and that you can't put it back in a box. These totalitarian systems, you can't have them come out and take over. You can't put freedom and democracy back into a box and keep it contained. And that's what happened, and as a matter of fact, that's one of the things Gorbachev said. And certainly Yeltsin feels that way.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Gorbachev-Yeltsin Ties
 Q. Does he intend to work with Mr. Yeltsin?
 A. Well, I think he is working with Mr. Yeltsin.
 
U.S.-Soviet Ties
 Q. Does this significantly change the U.S.-Soviet relationship?
 A. I think it's a good day for U.S.-Soviet relationship because I don't think that the fears that some of us have had about -- many people have had, actually, about right-wing takeovers will no longer be as extant.
 They tried and they failed. And democracy prevailed and reform prevailed. And that's what this is all about. So I think that -- I expect the relationship to be, if anything, even better. And we -- you know, you got to wait, you got to sort out some internal problems, but I explained to him, as I've told Yeltsin, that we're ready to talk to the leaders of the republic, and certainly we'll be ready to deal with the President of the Soviet Union itself.
 
Georgian's Comment
 Q. Mr. President, just now on CNN's air, the President of Georgia said that this was all a plot by Gorbachev himself. Now, whether that's true or not, what does that say to the state of the ----
 A. It says he needs to get a little work done on the kind of statements he's making. I mean, that's ridiculous. Here's a man who has been also swimming against the tide, it seems to me, a little bit. And I don't want to go overboard on this, but he ought to get with it and understand what's happening around the world.
 To suggest that this -- President Gorbachev would plot to put the people of the Soviet Union through this kind of trauma and the rest of the world through it just makes absolutely no sense at all. Now, I haven't heard him say that, so I want to hedge it. You've told me he said it, I haven't heard it -- so I've got to be very careful that I don't react to something that may not be true. I learned that one a long time ago.
 But if that's what the man said, I would just discount it one hundred percent. So, anyway, I got to go to work.
 Q. It's definitely over then, you're confident that the coup leaders ----
 A. I'm just telling you what I know here. I've not talked with people in Moscow -- I did talk to Jim Baker, and he's very upbeat from the contacts he's had. He had a long talk with Yakovlev a few minutes ago, who is confident that it's over. But it's not up to us to decree whether it's over or not. I'm telling you what these various leaders are saying about it, and it's a good day -- it's a very good day.

HEADLINE: Oregon's New Governor Is Tested by State's Split Personality

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALEM, Ore.

 BODY:
When Oregon voters went to the polls last fall, they sent a curious mixed message in this state known for its maverick politicians and pioneering laws.
 On one hand, they elected Barbara Roberts, a Democrat, as the state's first female governor, who promised change and new social programs. On the other hand, voters zippered the state pocketbook by passing an initiative that slashed property taxes and forced the state to cut its budget by nearly 15 percent. 
The question in Oregon was whether new ideas could exist on a severe financial diet. David Frohnmayer, the Republican defeated by Ms. Roberts, predicted that the tax-cutting measure would be "a nightmare" for the new Governor.
 
Praise for Approaches
 But with the close of the legislative session this summer, Oregon is basking in national attention for its novel approaches to education and health care, both of which survived the budget ax. Whether Governor Roberts had much to do with the new programs is an open question, but their success or failure is now largely on her shoulders.
 Ms. Roberts, 54 years old, once aspired to a seat in Congress. No more. She sees Washington as a quagmire of inaction and tired ideas -- and she has not been afraid of telling Federal dignitaries as much.
 "The states are where the action is," she said in a recent interview. "There is not a lot of movement at the Federal level. The governors are the innovators."
 A machinist's daughter, and fourth-generation Oregonian, Ms. Roberts campaigned as an underdog last fall and overcame a series of personal blows that included the death of her father, the prolonged illness of her husband and the problems of her son, who is autistic.
 
Defying Timber Industry
 She bucked the timber industry in this most-timber-dependent state and vowed to overhaul traditional education. In a state well-stocked with natural resources, but criticized for its primitive exploitation of forests and farm products, Ms. Roberts was fond of saying, "We don't grow onions anymore; we grow onion rings. We don't grow potatoes; we grow french fries."
 With help from Republican women who crossed party to lines to vote for her, and a conservative independent candidate who took votes away from Mr. Frohnmayer, the Attorney General, Ms. Roberts won the election by three percentage points. The independent candidate, Al Mobley, drew 13 percent of the vote.
 "We in the West have a unique problem," Ms. Roberts said. "This is the fast-growing area of the country. This is where new ideas and leadership are coming from. Yet, there is no Federal investment, as there was when the East was coming of age. So we have to fend for ourselves."
 Oregon, certainly, has followed its own path. It is now instituting a health plan that, by 1995, will make it the second state in the nation to have universal health coverage. Hawaii is the first. Oregon's educational system will be radically redesigned, after legislative action this year. The new system will force students to chose, by 10th grade, whether they want to pursue a course to college, or start learning about a particular trade.
 "The current education system has ceased to be relevant for so many students," Ms. Roberts said. "You have 12th graders working at McDonalds and maybe taking one class. We've got to give them something in the school system to keep their interest. Our goal is to have the best prepared work force in the country by the year 2000."
 Another new law, signed this month by the Governor, entitles all employees who work more than 25 hours a week to be given an unpaid family leave of up to 12 weeks every two years. The leave is to care for children, or ill spouses and relatives. Returning employees are guaranteed, by law, the same job when they return.
 Governor Roberts has benefited from an improving Oregon economy. The tax-cutting measure was expected to force the state to cut about $600 million from its two-year $5 billion budget. But it was able to restore much of that money because of taxes from the growing economy.
 Critics note that Ms. Roberts, while salvaging the budget for the major initiatives in health and education, had very little to do with the conception of either program, or with the family-leave bill. "She was not an active participant," said State Representative Greg Walden, a Republican who is majority leader of the State House. "Now she's wrapping herself around all the good press and good feelings about these programs."
 While many fresh ideas are coming out of the Oregon statehouse, Mr. Walden said very few of them are actually coming from the Governor.
 "She is your basic liberal, spend-and-spend social program Democrat," Mr. Walden said.
 But he gives her high marks for her personal style. "She has great charisma," he said. "She's very likeable, a very good speaker. They don't come much better in campaign style."
 Ms. Roberts got into politics as a citizen activist seeking help from the state for her autistic son. She was elected to the Oregon House in 1981, then went on to be elected Secretary of State in 1985, a job she held at the time of her election as Governor.
 
Taking Environmental Side
 On the environment, Governor Roberts has taken the opposite tack of the state's two Senators, Mark Hatfield and Robert Packwood, both Republicans who favor timber-industry-sponsored bills to allow high levels of tree-cutting in national forests.
 Court action initiated by environmentalists over the endangered northern spotted owl, which nests in forests that the timber industry wants to log, has brought most of the logging in Oregon national forests to a virtual standstill.
 The Governor, pointing to major environmental decisions of an earlier maverick Governor, Tom McCall, says Oregon has to build a future on more diversified industries rather than relying so heavily on logging. Rather than push for reopening huge sections of public land for logging, Ms. Roberts signed a bill giving money to depressed timber towns for job retraining and new industry.
 "I don't see this as a crisis, but as an opportunity," she said. "Oregonians have always been willing to take a long-term view to save their environment.
 Indeed, neighboring Washington State is glutted with new housing projects as the cities push into farm and forest land, while Oregon, restrained by a law limiting urban sprawl passed in the 1970's, has been able to preserve many of its rural areas.
 Ms. Roberts is now preparing to take on what may be her biggest headache -- overhauling the tax system. Oregon has an income tax but no sales tax. The Governor plans to travel around the state, sampling opinion, then propose an amendment to the state Constitution that will allow the change. She is withholding her plan until she believes she has a consensus of the people.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
From Baltics to Beijing

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The world rejoices about what happened in Moscow, and nobody more than Li Lu, who lies starving on a street in Washington, outside the Embassy of China.
Mr. Li was one of the thousands of young people at Tiananmen Square who went without food day after day, trying to shake the Communist rulers into surrendering a morsel of freedom. 
 Now, in America, he is on a hunger strike again, praying that this will make the world remember some of his comrades, lying in dark isolation in Communist cells. Although his heartbeat is dangerously low he is filled with zest. He feels that the triumph in the streets of Moscow will bring freedom closer for China.
That hope is not political emotionalism. Mr. Li and his friends have too much at stake -- liberty and life -- to waste time and energies with that.
The essence of political realism now is to understand that from the Baltics to Beijing new opportunities to advance freedom arise from the defeat of the coup. And it is just as important to understand that they will be attained more slowly and painfully unless two things happen.
One is that new leadership takes over in the Soviet Union. The other is that new thoughts take over in Washington.
Suddenly the whole world knows how important the opportunities are to so many Soviet people. That was made brilliantly clear by the swift fury with which the coup against change was smashed.
The dissolution of the Soviet Union, basically a jail for captured nationalities, is one of the opportunities. It is shamefully past time for the U.S. to become part of history, instead of an embarrassed bystander, by recognizing the independence of the three Baltic States. Just about the only important resistance anymore comes from Soviet black berets and American diplomacy.
In a new confederation of former Soviet republics, another goal can come rapidly: the disappearance of Communism, gone but never forgotten. Seventy-four years of Communism guarantee that the economic turnaround will need help and time.
The end of the centralized Soviet system will be the gift of the Soviet people to themselves. But it will also be pleasant news for those who happen to worry about nuclear war.
The huge Russian republic will eventually control the Soviet stockpile. That is an edgy thought. But it is not quite as nerve-racking as having them all these years under a centralized Soviet empire. The coup terrified us all, or should have. Nobody says life after the Kremlin will be perfect and safe -- just better, and safer.
Mr. Gorbachev seems to be telling the world himself that this cannot happen under his leadership. He emerged from his captivity to say he still believes that reform could come within the framework of the Communist Party, that he would not abandon it, that those who had left it were wrong, and that Socialism, as he put it, was his goal.
That, to a people sick of the stench of the Communist Party and of the Socialist economy, and to foreigners who will invest only when they see the death certificates of both. He did what the coup-makers could not -- make the President of the Soviet Union look just plain silly.
Important as he has been as a window opener for the Soviet Union, he returned to find his own credentials in question. He is on political trial by his countrymen to explain why he came to appoint those nasty coup-makers in the first place, and why he is appointing more like them.
So Boris Yeltsin will be the leader of the post-Gorbachev, post-Soviet era. Luckily for us all, he was around. Maybe Washington will even remember the lesson -- not to pin American foreign policy on any one person, not Mr. Gorbachev, not even Mr. Yeltsin.
But what Mr. Bush has learned from the coup we do not really know. He stood strong against it but now is annoyed at any criticism of Mr. Gorbachev: peculiar politesse certainly not shared by the Soviet people.
Meanwhile Li Lu is still out there on a sidewalk in Washington, starving -- and smiling. He smiles because he knows that the men who sent out the tanks in Moscow are in jail while their brothers in Beijing are not only in power but courted and fawned over by the U.S. He thinks that now Americans will find that strange. He thinks maybe Americans will not again turn away if Chinese have to face the tanks again. Maybe Li Lu is right.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Again Supported The Wrong Side, Israelis Say

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 22

 BODY:
The Israeli authorities, pursuing their campaign to discredit the Palestine Liberation Organization, poured scorn on Palestinian attitudes toward the failed Soviet coup today and summoned two leading Palestinians for questioning about contacts with P.L.O. officials.
In the occupied territories, a mood of hope kindled by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's brief ouster returned to despondency. 
 "I am very sad and frustrated," said Fraih Abu Middain, a prominent lawyer in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, echoing a common sentiment about the collapse of the hard-line coup in Moscow. "This incident will concentrate the U.S. domination. The Soviet people must revolt again in order to be a superpower to compete with the United States."
Many Palestinians and radical Arabs, notably in Iraq and Libya, resent Mr. Gorbachev for reducing the Soviet Union's long support for them while the United States has continued to back Israel. Moreover, they oppose Mr. Gorbachev's agreement to the free emigration a Soviet Jews to Israel, fearing that the influx will lead to increased Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank.
 
Support for the Coup
 When the Soviet leader was overthrown on Monday, thus, many ordinary Palestinians and some P.L.O. officials came out in support of the coup leaders in the hope that their cause had won a new champion.
Israeli officials seized on Palestinian utterances today and presented them as further evidence that the P.L.O.'s misjudgments and attitudes disqualify the organization as an interlocutor.
"In times of international crisis, the P.L.O. has time and again hurried to align itself against the free-world democracy and to reveal its true nature," the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement. "This is one of those times."
In comments to reporters, Foreign Minister David Levy also took issue with Palestinian arguments that the Soviet coup would restore the superpower balance.
"Does a balance of power mean a return of the world to a state of tension and fear of war, and to a race between the two blocs?" he asked. "Only those whose eyes are blinded and who are unable to see the future can talk about this sort of balance of power. Only those who are themselves unbalanced can call this balance."
 
Defense by Palestinian
 Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian in East Jerusalem, sought today to rebut the latest Israeli assault. "What really alarms me is that people are interpreing popular reaction as meaning that there was a consensus," she said, referring to the attidtude in the Palestinian leadership to the coup.
"Many Palestinians made very responsible statements," she said. "But I suppose Israeli memory and propaganda is very selective about that."
Both she and Faisal al-Husseini, another leading East Jerusalem Palestinian, were ordered today to appear before the police on Monday for questioning about talks they held last weekend in London with P.L.O. officials, Palestinian officials said. Israel outlaws all contact with the P.L.O., which it calls a terrorist organization.

HEADLINE: Weekly Jobless Claims Are Highest Since June

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits jumped in early August to its highest level in almost two months, the Labor Department said today, underlining the tentative nature of the economic recovery.
The surge prompted some analysts to suggest that the Federal Reserve must cut interest rates further to invigorate the economy. 
 First-time claims for jobless benefits rose to 430,000 in the week that ended Aug. 10, up 22,000 from 408,000 in the previous week, the department said. It was the second consecutive week that the claims had risen, and the new increase was larger than the 412,000 anticipated.
"It says the economy is moving at a snail's pace," said Don Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University. "It doesn't yet throw the recovery into question. But this is a borderline number."
 
Recovery 'on the Edge'
 Robert McGee, chief economist at the Tokai Bank in New York, said the figure backs the notion that the recovery "is on the edge between growth and stumbling back into recession."
The number of claims, the highest since June 22, when the figure reached 431,000, suggests that the jobless rate is likely to edge up to 6.9 percent in August from 6.8 percent in July, economists said.
Unemployment usually rises for about six months after a recovery has begun because employers delay rehiring until they are convinced that the upturn is firmly in place.
Since March, when initial claims totaled more than 500,000, there have been gradual signs that the labor market was improving, albeit in fits and starts.
But Jean Sundrla at Evans Economics Inc. said the trend might have halted. She pointed to the four-week average of first-time unemployment claims, which economists consider a more reliable indicator of the job market's health. It rose to 410,500 in the week ending Aug. 10, its fourth straight rise after reaching a low of 403,000 in the week ending July 20.
 
'Does Not Bode Well'
 Ms. Sundrla said these figures added fuel to the argument that the economy needed another lift from lower interest rates. "For the outlook on the economy, this does not bode well," she said of the jobless claims.
She said she expected the Federal Reserve, after moving to cut the Federal funds rate earlier this month, to take a firmer stance in the next few weeks and cut its high-profile discount rate.
The discount rate is the interest charged on the Fed's short-term loans to banks and underpins all other rates. The Federal funds rate is the overnight rate at which banks lend each other short-term money.
Other economists said they expected that before the Fed made a decision on interest rates it would seek new data on durable goods orders, a clearer trend on money supply figures, and the August unemployment data, to be released on Sept. 6.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed as Traders React to Events in U.S.S.R.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against major currencies yesterday as traders continued moving away from the American currency after the failure of the Soviet coup.
"The rapid disintegration of the coup led directly to a rapid deterioration of the dollar," said Frank Pusateri, a vice president with the Bank of Boston. The dollar is generally considered a safe currency in times of international turmoil. 
 But the German mark has continued to make gains since the coup crumbled. In New York, the dollar fell to 1.7295 German marks, from 1.7408 marks on Wednesday; in London, it was quoted at 1.7320 marks, down from 1.7535.
"There was some feeling in the market that with the coup failing, the pace of economic reform in the Soviet Union could possibly accelerate, which could be good for the German economy," said Carl Forcheski, a Chemical Bank trader.
In New York, the British pound finished at $1.6935, up from 1.6885 late Wednesday. Earlier in London, the pound rose to $1.6975, from $1.6735 late Wednesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 136.75 yen, down 0.43 yen from Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 136.70 yen, and in New York, the dollar was quoted at 136.60, up from 136.55 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.5090 Swiss francs, down from 1.5150; 5.8795 French francs, down from 5.9190; 1,293.75 Italian lire, down from 1,302.75, and 1.1433 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1442.
Selected late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.5035 Swiss francs, down from 1.5285; 5.8680 French francs, down from 5.9675; 1.9445 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9805; 1,295.85 Italian lire, down from 1,311.25, and 1.1432 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1437.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Platinum Prices Plummet On Fear of Soviet Dumping

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Platinum futures prices fell sharply yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as Japanese selling and fears of Soviet dumping pressed the market to 5 1/2-year lows.
Gold and silver futures also fell, but many other commodity prices rose, including grains and soybeans and oil. 
 Platinum for delivery in October fell $9.20 a troy ounce, to $336.20, the lowest settlement of a near-term platinum contract since Dec. 26, 1985.
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for August delivery fell $2.60 an ounce, to $354.30; September silver dropped 2.8 cents, to $3.91 an ounce.
 
Selling by Japanese
 Signs of new platinum sales by the Japanese, the world's largest platinum investors and jewelry makers, started the sell-off, said James Steel, metals analyst in New York with the commodities trading company Refco Inc.
He said some traders believed the Japanese were selling platinum on behalf of the Soviet Union, which has few other ways to raise hard currency.
"No matter which way the coup turned out, the Soviets are still in a weak economic state and have to step up precious metal sales," Mr. Steel said.
Jacques Luben, executive director of investments for the trade group Platinum Guild International, said the decline reflected selling by individual speculators in a thin market. He called the metal a good buy for long-term investors but said the market was unlikely to rally until the fears of large-scale Soviet selling subside.
Corn, wheat and soybean futures ended sharply higher on the Chicago Board of Trade following a surge late in the session after President Bush lifted a freeze on economic aid to the Soviet Union.
The move frees Moscow to pursue new American grain purchases with $900 million in export credit-guarantees granted earlier this year by the Bush Adminstration.
Wheat for delivery in September settled 3 cents higher, at $2.99 1/4 a bushel; September corn rose 7 cents, to $2.50 1/2 a bushel; September oats fell 1 cent, to $1.26 a bushel, and September soybeans rose 9 cents, to $5.71 1/4 a bushel.
Petroleum futures rose moderately on the New York Merc as traders consolidated their positions after three days of volatile trading. Oil prices were roiled this week by fears the failed Soviet coup would disrupt crude oil supplies from the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer.
Crude oil for October delivery rose 17 cents, to $21.72 a barrel; September home heating oil rose .42 cent, to 62.22 cents a gallon; September unleaded gasoline rose .70 cent, to 68.63 cents a gallon; September natural gas rose 10.8 cents, to $1.42 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The unusually sharp gain in natural gas was prompted by position-squaring ahead of the contract's expiration yesterday.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Discount Corp. of New York Appoints a Vice Chairman

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Discount Corporation of New York, an old-line government securities firm and the only primary dealer in the Treasury market not affiliated with a larger parent company, yesterday named Denis P. Coleman Jr. as vice chairman.
The announcement comes as the Treasury securities business is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the wake of the Salomon Brothers scandal. There are calls in Washington for tighter oversight of Treasury securities firms than is now provided by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 Mr. Coleman said Salomon's acknowledgment of bidding abuses at Treasury auctions should not lead to quick conclusions that the market is rife with similar activities.
"As far as distributing securities at a good price for the Government, this market has been pretty efficient and done a credible job," he said. "Before you act to improve deficiencies, I think you first have to make sure the problems are there and then be thoughtful in making changes."
"If new regulation creates inefficiencies," he added, "the Treasury will pay for it" in terms of higher interest rates when it auctions new securities.
Mr. Coleman, who had spent the last two years managing his private investments and working with local charities, was previously a senior executive at Bear, Stearns & Company, where he had broad exposure to the fixed-income markets.
After graduating from Georgetown University in 1967, he started at Bear, Stearns as a clerk and rose to manager of the municipal bond department. During the 1980's, he was in charge of the firm's expansion into the Treasury and mortgage securities departments.
Mr. Coleman, 45, said he was re-entering the securities business because Rafe de la Gueronniere, the Discount Corporation's chairman since July 1, "was an old friend and asked me." He and Mr. de la Gueronniere have been friends for nearly 20 years ago.
At the Discount Corporation, Mr. Coleman said, the scope of his duties is not yet clear. But he expects to be more involved in the administrative side of the business than the minute-to-minute trading activities.
Mr. Coleman lives in New York City and will remain active with such local charities as Covenant House, where he is vice chairman.

Brady's Message On the Scandals

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE Salomon Brothers' misconduct in the Treasuries market -- coming after such scandals as the fall and bailout of hundreds of savings and loans, the drug and money-laundering and bribing activities of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the junk bond debacle of Drexel Burnham Lambert and the assorted frauds in the Japanese stock market -- has further stirred anxieties about the integrity of financial markets. Unless they are quelled, such anxieties could hurt saving and investment all around the world.
In cracking down hard on Salomon Brothers for exceeding the 35 percent quota for primary dealers in the auction markets for Government securities, the Treasury was sending a message to the other 39 primary dealers in that market that conduct like Salomon's would be dealt with harshly. With $2.3 trillion in Federal debt to be marketed and rolled over ad infinitum -- a debt total that is expected to increase by $279 billion in the fiscal year 1991 and by $362 billion in 1992 -- any loss of faith in the integrity of the Government securities market might be extremely costly. 
 Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in an interview on Tuesday, said he did not know how "deep" the problems in the Government securities market went. The Treasury, he said, was not an investigative agency; the S.E.C. and the Federal Reserve, on which the Treasury depends, are now "collecting information." But Mr. Brady is clearly warning every house that might be acting as Salomon was to clean up its act fast.
He was asked why the Treasury, having first announced, at 10:30 Sunday morning, that Salomon had been barred from bidding in the primary Treasury auction market, said five hours later, following a telephone conversation between Mr. Brady and Warren E. Buffett, the firm's new chairman, that Salomon could bid for its own account but not for its customers. Mr. Brady replied, "In substance, that changed the situation only marginally."
At the time of the first announcement Sunday morning, he said, there had been only "a lot of talk about what might happen," but no concrete action. By the time of the second announcement, said a Treasury official, who requested anonymity, the Salomon board had taken four actions: (1) Dismissed the top three executives -- John H. Gutfreund, the chairman; Thomas W. Strauss, president, and John W. Meriwether, vice chairman; (2) discharged the head of the Government trading desk, Paul Mozer, and his No. 2, Thomas Murphy; (3) announced other administrative and management changes, and (4) pledged, through Mr. Buffett, to cooperate fully with the Treasury, S.E.C. and Fed, to "right the wrongs." Mr. Buffett gave Mr. Brady his personal assurance that the situation at Salomon would be cleared up.
Mr. Brady denies that confidence in United States securities has been shaken. He said that the Federal deficit was "too big" but that the United States was able to sell its obligations to the world. "The enormous amount of our bonds people buy," he said, "imply confidence not only in United States securities but in the method by which we distribute them, directly and with dispatch."
Instead of damage to the United States resulting from the Salomon scandal, he said, the way it was being handled would "enhance everybody's confidence." The United States financial market, he said, is "deep and liquid -- I'm not sure whose exceeds it."
But with financial markets having gone global on a 24-hour-a-day basis, don't investors need better international regulation? "Good question," Mr. Brady said. But he added, "We have to rely on the individual countries." Every country, he noted, has its own rules and codes. He conceded that it might be desirable to negotiate standard regulations at least for the principal financial markets.
He cautioned against overregulating financial markets, contending that "the cure can be worse than the disease being cured." The United States, he said, now has the opportunity to "do it right" and show that "our market is the safest in the world."
Did he have any new thoughts on how to bring the climbing budget deficit down? He said the worsening of the projected deficit for 1992 was the result of to the "vagaries of the S.& L. bailout and Desert Storm," but he had "confidence that in the long run -- that is, the next five years -- the outlook was for the deficit to slope downward."
Official projections support that view. The Congressional Budget Office projects the deficit will peak at $362 billion in the fiscal year 1992 and fall to $156 billion by 1996.
The Administration's Office of Management and Budget sees a peak deficit of $348 billion in 1992 and expects a surplus of $20 billion in 1996.
Herbert Simon, Carnegie-Mellon's Nobel laureate in economics, says, "If you can't forecast, stay flexible." And Treasury Secretary Brady, the nation's premier bond salesman, seems to be saying, in the wake of the Salomon scandal: If you can't forecast the public debt, just be sure you can sell it to the world.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Star Vehicle For Taylor: A Scent Spot

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
IF you plan to catch Elizabeth Taylor's new film, don't buy a very big bag of popcorn; it runs only two minutes and 45 seconds.
The film is a commercial for White Diamonds, the second fragrance that the Elizabeth Arden division of Parfums International is introducing with the collaboration of the actress. The spot, shot in Acapulco in black and white and styled to resemble a theatrical movie, will be shown at department stores' fragrance counters; a 60-second version will be broadcast on television. 
 The commercial is the centerpiece of an estimated $20 million campaign for the new fragrance, which joins Elizabeth Taylor's Passion, a four-year-old brand that ranks in the top 10 fragrances sold through department stores.
White Diamonds is only one of several significant product introductions in what looks like the $5 billion fragrance industry's most frantic round of marketing activity ever. To prepare consumers for the Christmas scent-shopping season, there are elaborately produced commercials, promotional videotapes and enough magazine scent strips that a newsstand might be taken for a perfume counter.
Among the other new brands, joining the more than 500 already on store shelves, are Escape, from Calvin Klein; Spellbound, from Estee Lauder Inc., and Tresor from Lancome.
A key factor in fueling the intense competition for market share is the recession. Fragrance sales tend to hold up during an economic downturn, because shoppers who deny themselves big-ticket items will splurge on a new scent. Another is the increasing concentration of industry ownership by giant consumer-product marketers that spend lavishly on product introductions and advertising; Parfums International and Calvin Klein are owned by the Unilever Group, while Lancome is owned by L'Oreal S.A.
"It's a busy time," said Paulette Dufault, vice president of advertising for Elizabeth Arden in New York, "but we hope all the excitement of all the fragrance launches will pique the interest of consumers to get into stores and see what's going on."
To help stir excitement for White Diamonds, said Tom Moloney, vice president of marketing for Parfums International, Ms. Taylor will begin a national promotional tour on Sept. 12. By that time, consumers in major metropolitan markets will have had the chance to visit local department stores and watch the commercial, which is called "White Diamonds Starring Elizabeth Taylor."
"We're going to set it up as a 'theater' event, as her latest movie," Mr. Moloney said. "We're going to hand out tickets and serve little bags of popcorn." The shorter version of the commercial will appear on television stations in major markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
The commercial is styled like a film "because Elizabeth Taylor is a great movie star," said Mindy Goldberg, executive producer and co-owner of Epoch Films, New York, the production company that created it for Elizabeth Arden. "Rather than just see her posing, we wanted to give her a scene and see her acting."
In the spot, directed by Epoch's Terry Bedford, Ms. Taylor, who is drenched in diamonds -- some really hers, some borrowed -- watches a high-stakes poker game being played by a mysterious group of men. The youngest and handsomest is about to fold his hand when she takes off her earrings and drops them in the pot on his behalf. "These have always brought me luck," she says.
Lest Ms. Taylor's first celebrity scent be forgotten amid the hoopla for White Diamonds, Ms. Dufault said that new spots for Elizabeth Taylor's Passion are due soon. Those spots intersperse color shots of the Passion bottle with black-and-white clips from Ms. Taylor's films, including "Butterfield 8" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP;
Bush Restores Some Aid to Soviets but Holds Back on Big Projects

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 22

 BODY:
In a day of deliberately mixed signals, President Bush today reinstated the limited assistance to the Soviet Union that he suspended during the Kremlin coup but said he was still not prepared to support major financial aid until President Mikhail S. Gorbachev enacts significant economic reforms.
The White House's somewhat tentative approach seemed intended to buy time for Mr. Bush and his aides to assess developments in the Soviet Union, particularly whether the failed coup has signficantly shifted the balance of power between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin. 
While the Administration is clearly putting some pressure on Mr. Gorbachev, it is also waiting to see whether he will move decisively toward reform now that the constraints that the United States assumed were imposed by Communist hard-liners seem to have been removed.
As a senior official put it today, the White House wants a look at the "true Gorbachev." It was surprised, he said, by some of the Soviet leader's initial personnel decisions and by his defense today at a news conference of the Soviet Communist Party.
 
Allies See It Differently
 The cautious policy puts the Administration somewhat at odds with its allies. Britain's Prime Minister, John Major, said an increase in economic aid might be in order now. Germany, which has long pressed for greater Western generosity for Moscow, said it was preparing to recognize the three Baltic republics as independent states, as soon as they reached a secession agreement with Moscow.
Mr. Bush said he would not interfere in Soviet politics and made it clear that he was not ready to do what Germany suggested. But he called on Mr. Gorbachev to speed negotiations on independence for the three Baltic states. "In my view, that would do more to enhance good will in the United States than almost any other single thing that could be done," Mr. Bush said.
In public, Mr. Bush praised Mr. Gorbachev, refused to speculate about whether the failed coup had damaged him politically and avoided taking sides between Mr. Gorbachev, still a commited Communist, and Mr. Yeltsin, who has rejected Communism and resigned from the Party. Mr. Bush also said it was not up to the United States to pass judgment on Mr. Gorbachev's new Cabinet.
But at the same time, the White House sent a senior Administration official to brief reporters in the press room, where he offered a significantly more reserved, even skeptical view.
 
Criticism of Defense Choice
 Speaking on the condition that he not be identified by name, the official called on Mr. Gorbachev to rein in the K.G.B. and the other internal Soviet security organs.
He spoke with some disdain about Soviet officials who "weren't heard from for a couple of days" -- an apparent reference to Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh -- and criticized Mr. Gorbachev's decision to retain Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev as Minister of Defense.
"I wouldn't want that guy behind me in a dark hall now," the official said. "Moiseyev, to put it generously, was ambivalent" during the coup, he added.
Another senior official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, Mr. Gorbachev's former right-hand man, had called Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d on Wednesday while Mr. Baker was in Brussels and told him that General Moiseyev was involved in deploying troops during the coup.
By the time Mr. Bush spoke to Mr. Gorbachev on Wednesday, the Soviet leader said the general was obeying his orders to pull the troops back.
 
'Let Them Sort That Out'
 During a brief news conference at his vacation home after meeting with Mr. Baker, Mr. Bush took a more circumspect approach than the senior official, saying that General Moiseyev had helped negotiate the recent treaty on reducing long-range nuclear weapons and that the United States should not comment on personnel choices by Mr. Gorbachev.
"Let them sort that out," Mr. Bush said, though he added, "We will hold back a little on military-to-military contacts until we see this sort out."
White House aides said Mr. Bush had been annoyed by news articles reporting the senior official's comments and pointing out the differences between the Administration's public and private positions. The White House said the senior official was expressing "personal views" and that Mr. Bush was articulating public policy.
But the remarks today at the summer White House reflect a practice commonly used by the Administration when it wants to express views publicly but is not willing to put them on the record. By offering the remarks on "background," the White House is in a position to say later that the remarks of a particular official, no matter how senior, do not represent official policy.
 
Groping for a New Policy
 The strategy is clearly intended to permit Mr. Bush himself to observe the diplomatic niceties and bolster Mr. Gorbachev as the Administration gropes for a new policy toward the Soviet Union.
At the same time, the private statements signaled that the United States is resisting pressure to make sharp changes in American policy toward the Soviet Union as a result of the coup's failure. The senior official's remarks also made it clear to Mr. Gorbachev that he must repay his country and the outside world for their support by making real strides toward political and economic reform.
The official emphasized that the United States would not "try to rush into final decisions on policy in every case in a situation which is as rapidly moving as this." He added, "It is not the right time to nail oneself to the mast."
The White House seemed especially anxious to respond to mounting pressure from Mr. Major and others for Washington to increase its economic aid to Moscow. "I don't see anything new right now on that," Mr. Bush said.
The senior official said that if Mr. Gorbachev rapidly accelerated economic reforms, the United States could respond with greater aid. But he said that as far as the Bush Administration was concerned, nothing has changed substantively since Mr. Gorbachev met with the leaders of the seven leading industrial democracies in London last month.
"I think we're back to where we were at the time really of the economic summit," the official said, "and that is a program in place that is demonstrably able to absorb and use aid in order to further reform, not simply that it will be swallowed up in an economic morass."
Administration officials said they would be willing to consider humanitarian relief assistance, especially in food, if the Soviet harvests are as bad as currently predicted and the country experiences shortages this winter. But they said no such request had been received from Moscow.
As the coup unfolded, Mr. Bush announced that he was "putting on hold" all Soviet-American economic programs. Those projects, primarily technical assistance programs, are extremely limited but included $900 million in agricultural loan guarantees.
But Mr. Bush's order presumably would also have blocked enactment of favorable tariff treatment for the Soviet Union, along with a new trade treaty and associate membership in the Western world's financial institutions. The decision today to lift the suspension was a sign that the United States considers the coup to have finally been put down.
 
Watching Gorbachev and Yeltsin
 The senior official said the United States was waiting to see how Mr. Gorbachev proceeded in his new relationship with Mr. Yeltsin and in other areas.
"Gorbachev has by and large operated in the middle between the more radical reformers and the conservatives," he said. "And as you recall, last winter when the reformers were in considerable disarray, the pressure was all from the conservatives. Then when he and Yeltsin got together and they started working on the union treaty and so on, he got his maneuvering room back.
"Now he's in a sense lost it, because he can't point to the conservatives and say, 'Hey, we can't do any more than we are.' So, I think, you know, we may in a sense see the true Gorbachev coming out more."
Asked what the American assessment is of the true Mr. Gorbachev, the official replied, "We'll wait and see."

Gorbachev and Yeltsin at Work
 
BOON FOR DEMOCRACY Mikhail S. Gorbachev said his rescue from the failed coup has taught him that he must join more closely with "democratic forces" and speed the pace of reform. Page A1. 

A NEW RELATIONSHIP It was perhaps the greatest irony of the coup's failure that Mr. Gorbachev's presidency was saved by the one man he had done his most to destroy, Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian federation president. News Analysis, page A1.
JOY IN THE STREETS Thousands of jubilant Muscovites took to the streets in triumph, removing a statue of Feliks Dzerzhinksy, founder of the Soviet secret police, in front of K.G.B. headquarters. And 50,000 people cheered Mr. Yeltsin in front of the Russian government building. Page A9.
 
New Team and Perhaps New Borders
 
TAKING OVER AT THE K.G.B. Leonid V. Shebarshin, 56 years old, is taking over as the head of the K.G.B. international espionage operations and Lieut. Gen. Vasily P. Truskin replaces Boris Pugo, who committed suicide, as head of the Interior Ministry. Page A8.
BUSH AND THE BALTICS The Bush Administration and a number of other Western governments renewed calls for the Soviet Union to permit the full independence of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Page A9.
A BLOW FOR COMMUNISM The Parliament in Latvia outlawed the Communist Party, and the republic's government said it was seeking the arrest of the republic's hard-line party leader, Alfred Rubiks. Page A9.
 
Reactions at Home and Abroad
 
EUROPEAN AID IS BACK Relieved and delighted, European Community governments resumed economic aid to the Soviet Union and expressed hope that Mr. Gorbachev woiuld speed efforts to introduce a full market economy. Page A15.
SALUTE FROM JAPAN Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu hailed the collapse of the coup and lifted a freeze on Japan's aid to the Soviet Union. Page A15.
KINDRED SPIRITS Attitudes of people in the United States toward the Soviet Union have warmed, especially since the crisis, and interviews across the country show a wave of affection for a nation long an object of suspicion and hatred. Page A14.

HEADLINE: Giant Banks: Will Little Guy Pay?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The proposed merger of BankAmerica and Security Pacific, the two largest banking companies in California, is the latest in a series of big-bank betrothals that promise cost savings, great riches for shareholders and power for the executives.
Consolidation in the banking industry is all the rage because everyone seems to win -- except, perhaps, the consumer and small-business borrowers. 
 As mergers cause banking power to be concentrated in fewer hands, particularly in states like California where the market is already more concentrated than elsewhere, depositors tend to get lower interest rates, according to recent Federal Reserve Board studies. And borrowers, particularly small businesses, are charged higher rates, the studies indicate.
Timothy H. Hannan, a Federal Reserve economist, concluded in an article earlier this year in the Journal of Banking and Finance that borrowers in markets with a highly concentrated banking system pay interest rates that range from half a percentage point to 2.2 percentage points higher than borrowers in the least concentrated markets, depending on the type of loan. The presence of nonbank competitors -- such as commercial lending companies, loan offices of out-of-state banks, and so-called "800"-number loan services from financial service companies -- are not enough, Mr. Hannan said, to prevent banks in concentrated markets from charging stiff interest rates.
Another study, by Donald T. Savage, a senior economist at the Fed, contends that bankers may be exaggerating the cost savings of mergers. What does cut costs, the study said, is the loss of some customers when a branch closes.
A merger can result in the type of routine cost cutting that a bank can do whether or not it is trying to complete a merger. Citicorp, for example, is halfway through a $1.5 billion cost-cutting program that involves no merger.
Although the Justice Department and Federal Reserve Board have been increasingly tolerant of large bank mergers during the 1980's, the proposed combination of the two big California banks, which would form the nation's second largest, is large enough to raise questions about whether it would concentrate power to the detriment of consumers.
 
Creating a Behemoth
 In California and Washington state, where Bank of America and Security Pacific rank first and second, respectively in terms of deposits, their merger would not simply eliminate competition between the two largest banking companies, it would create a behemoth with even more power to set prices.
"There is no doubt this merger would restucture the competitive environment in many markets," said Kenneth H. Thomas, a bank consultant in Miami and a lecturer at the Wharton Business School. "What bankers call excess capacity, the public sees as competition.
"If regulators have decided that we have too many banks and consolidation would be good for the health of the industry," Mr. Thomas said, "wouldn't it be better if the consolidation occurred by California banks' expanding into New England or Florida instead of combining with each other?"
 
California Interest Rates
 Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor in North Palm Beach, Fla., noted that recent surveys show that California banks already pay lower interest rates on deposits and charge higher interest rates on loans than do banks in other parts of the country.
In Los Angeles, for example, the average interest rate for unsecured two-year personal loans, excluding credit cards, is 20.25 percent -- about 1.9 percentage points more than in New York, 3.11 percentage points above the national average and 5.6 percentage points higher than the average rate in Philadelphia. Interest-bearing checking accounts in Los Angeles, meanwhile, pay an average yield of 4.11 percent, well below the national average of 4.65 percent.
"You can't prove that the cause of high prices in California is the power of the four biggest banks in the state," Mr. Heady said. "But the end result is clear."
 
Antitrust Concerns Cited
 Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at New York University and formerly a member of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said the condition of the California market and the size of the two banking companies indicates that "this merger will not be approved so easily as some expect." He predicted that "the antitrust division of the Justice Department will weigh in and require the sale of some branches in markets where the concentration is too high."
Peter Magnani, a BankAmerica spokesman, said that higher prices "might be explained by the fact that costs of doing business in California are higher than other parts of the country." He said the company would not comment on any aspect of its merger related to antitrust questions until after Federal regulators had looked at the issue.
 
A Defense of the Merger
 H. Rodgin Cohen, a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell in New York who has represented BankAmerica in recent merger attempts, said the one justification of the merger is that "it makes for a stronger bank, and stronger banks are in a better position to make more loans and provide better service."
Banking analysts agree that financially strong banks are best positioned to make more loans, because they have less reason to worry about falling below the minimum capital standards set by regulators. But in the case of Bank of America, its capital strength and profitability are already high enough that it has been increasing its lending more rapidly than the national average.
Over the last 10 years, Security Pacific has also been one of the country's fastest-growing large banks and profitable enough to earn high marks from Wall Street. Despite its losses in the last year from foreign lending and commercial real estate loans outside California, Security Pacific has been strong enough to continue expanding its consumer lending businesses.
 
The Impact of Market Share
 A study published in the spring 1990 issue of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank's Economic Review found that the tendency of California banks to pay lower interest rates on deposits, particularly interest-bearing checking accounts, could not be fully explained by high operating costs in California and the sluggish growth rate of deposits during the mid-1980's.
The study said that market clout produced lower interest rates on interest-bearing checking accounts. It estimated that a 10 percentage point increase in the combined market share of the top three banks in a local market could reduce deposit interest rates by roughly 1.5 perentage points.
Big bank mergers are raising other concerns as well. Some economists have questioned bankers' claims that mergers will yield huge cost savings and better profits and make the new bank more profitable and financially stronger. Such claims by bankers are are not supported by studies, which tend to show that big bank expansions have not resulted in any efficiencies that resulted in greater profits.
Mr. Savage, the Fed senior economist, concluded that the greatest opportunities for cost savings came from other efficiency gains, not the closing of duplicated branches after a merger.
In a hypothetical example involving the merger of a bank with $20 billion in assets and a bank with $10 billion in assets and the closing of 100 branches, Mr. Savage found that operating costs at the new bank rose 4.3 percent if there was no loss of customers. If the acquired bank lost 20 percent of its assets, and closed 100 branches, however, the cost savings amounted to only 2.2 percent of the combined costs of the two banks before their merger.
In one of the two largest mergers proposed recently, BankAmerica and Security Pacific forecast cost savings of $1 billion annually, or 29 percent of Security Pacific's costs. In the other, between the Chemical Banking Corporation and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Corporation, the partners forecast savings of $650 million annually, or 32 percent of Manufacturers Hanover's expenses.
At the Minneapolis Federal Reserve bank, an article in the spring issue of the Quarterly Review by two economists, John H. Boyd and Stanley L. Graham, noted there are several studies showing that banks do not become more efficient as they grow.
Mr. Boyd and Mr. Graham said mergers of large banks in the same market might improve profits for reasons unrelated to closing of branches.
The merger "will necessarily reduce competiton and may render the survivor more profitable," they said, "simply beause of its enhanced ability to earn monopoly rents."

HEADLINE: Coup's Failure May Bring More Investment

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The failed coup in the Soviet Union caused a few hiccups in Moscow's business ties to the United States, but it may well lead to a more rapid expansion of Western investment in the long run.
The hazy consensus among many Western business executives is that the coup attempt was too short-lived to increase concerns about Soviet instability that much. At the same time, many executives said, the coup's collapse left Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian Republic's President, and other advocates of radical economic change in a better position to clear away some hurdles to Western investment and trade. 
 "We think it will speed up change and may allow us to accelerate some of our projects," said Thomas Polski, a spokesman for the Carlson Hospitality Group, the Minneapolis-based parent of Radisson Hotels, which owns what it says is the only American-managed hotel in the Soviet Union. Radisson has been pushing Intourist, its Soviet partner, to build hotels in other Soviet cities to go along with the 430-room Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel Moscow.
For many companies, the most heartening aspect of the week was how painlessly the coup attempt ended for them. "Operations are back to normal and were never disturbed in a major way," said Karl Nigl, the Vienna-based manager of Pepsico Inc.'s soft-drink and Pizza Hut operations in the Soviet Union.
Mr. Nigl left no doubt about how delighted he was with the outcome. He said Pepsico had sent soft drinks and pizza to Russians who spent the night in front of the Russian Parliament building to repel a possible Army attack. He recounted with relish yesterday that a can of Diet Pepsi had been clearly visible in front of Mr. Yeltsin during the broadcast of his press conference Wednesday.
But emphasizing how little had changed so far, Mr. Nigl added, "The economic difficulties remain and that's what impacts us."
Some Soviet scholars say the reshuffling of authority is likely to open new avenues for business. "The instability of the past three days is far from over, but there is more green light," said John E. Mroz, president of the Institute for East-West Security Studies in New York. "The republics will certainly end up with more economic autonomy and there will be some very positive investment opportunities in regions like Russia, the Ukraine and Kazahkstan."
Some experts, including Peter Pettibone, the chairman of the New York Bar Committee on Soviet Affairs and legal adviser to companies with Soviet operations or technology-transfer agreements, said the coup attempt could lead to a short lull in American business activity.
But that will not last, he added. The conservatives' failure will speed efforts to determine who has authority over what decisions at various levels of the Government, clearing away the uncertainty that has long discouraged investment.
 
'It's Much Too Early to Tell'
 The Commerce Department said yesterday that it was taking a wait-and-see position on questions about the Soviet business climate. But the department has no plans to cancel trips in the fall to improve trade relations, a spokeswoman, Patricia Woodward, said.
Many companies are also noncommittal. "It's much too early to tell whether things will change for the better," said Jack Batty, a spokesman for the General Electric Company. The Fairfield, Conn.-based conglomerate, which sells medical equipment, plastics and some electrical equipment to the Soviet Union, said the coup began and ended too quickly to affect any of its operations.
"We are basically where we were," agreed Ron Roberts, a spokesman for the Eastman Kodak Company. "We didn't rush out and do anything during the coup and we aren't rushing out and doing anything now." Kodak sells some film to the Soviet Union but is nowhere near completing any joint venture to make products there, Mr. Roberts said.
Some disruptions occurred, but they typically were minor. Rama Rao, president of Excel Technology Inc., a start-up laser company in Holbrook, L.I., put off plans to travel to Minsk tomorrow to meet with his joint-venture partners at the Byelorussian Polytechnic Institute. But the visit has already been rescheduled to Sept. 21.
 
Emotional Turmoil
 Businesses in Moscow went through more emotional turmoil but remained unscathed. Radisson offered to remove its 18 managers at the Moscow hotel, including 14 Americans, but all of them chose to stay, Mr. Polski said. The hotel received only a handful of cancellations.
In fact, some companies may have emerged from the crisis with their reputations enhanced among Soviet business partners. Mr. Polski said Radisson demonstrated to Intourist that it would be a good partner "through thick and thin."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COUP;
Europeans Look at Costs of the Coup

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Amid expressions of relief and delight at the failure of the Moscow coup, European Community governments resumed economic aid to the Soviet Union today and expressed hope that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will now accelerate moves to introduce a full market economy.
But behind the euphoria, Western European governments began totting up how much the dramatic events of the last few days will cost them in terms of new economic assistance and trading opportunities for both the Soviet Union and the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe. 
 They also recognized that deep uncertainty still surrounds the political future of the Soviet Union, not least because the balance of power has been transformed by the emergence of the President of the Russian federation, Boris N. Yeltsin, as the savior of the country's developing democracy.
The immediate question facing major European capitals, as well as Washington and Tokyo, is whether the West should now step up economic aid to Moscow, a move that some European officials fear could imply recognition that Monday's coup might have been averted had they acted sooner.
 
More Aid Is Urged
 Indeed, this is the view of the leaders of Germany, France and Italy. They argued in favor of greater aid at the London summit meeting last month of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies and have now renewed their calls for more Western involvement in Moscow's long-debated economic reform program.
Though the leaders diplomatically urged an across-the-board increase and speedup of aid from all Western donors, their implicit message was that those countries that have been most reluctant about offering aid, including the United States and Japan, should now become markedly more generous.
"Whoever wants to support change and guard against danger must now help more and more quickly than before," Germany's Economy Minister, Jurgen Mollemann, said today. Germany is the Soviet Union's largest Western backer, having pledged $35 billion in credits since 1989.
President Francois Mitterrand of France said, "Now we have to make a bigger effort than we have so far made." His Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, added: "We must, all of us, think about the West's attitude to Gorbachev. Do we want to make the means available to fulfill certain aims?"
 
Others Resist Calls
 But other European leaders share the American and Japanese view that the Soviet Union must act first to modernize its economy. Britain's Prime Minister, John Major, said the Soviet Union needs "not just cash but assistance in how to do things, how to establish private enterprises, how to set up a stock exchange, how to operate a market."
Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek of the Netherlands, which holds the rotating presidency of the 12-nation Community, warned against "throwing money" at the Soviet Union. "Unless the system is changed, our money would be like a drop of water on a hot stove," he told the European Parliament.
The Community already has a $1.5 billion aid program with the Soviet Union, but this involves technical assistance and food credits rather than direct financial support. Most of the package was suspended Tuesday in reaction to the coup, but it was restored today along with an $80 million British technical assistance program.
For the moment, there is at least consensus that moves to associate the Soviet Union with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should be sped up. "We'll be pushing to get them into the Fund as soon as possible," Italy's Foreign Minister, Gianni De Michelis, said today.
There are also signs that Community leaders are willing to consider greater aid to Moscow. They canceled a summit meeting scheduled for Friday to discuss the Soviet crisis. They instead proposed an early meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, and officials said such a meeting would be pointless unless the Community had more to offer.
The shock of the abortive Soviet coup has made itself felt on the Community's relations with Eastern Europe, with Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia pointing to it as evidence of the risks posed to their own new democracies unless they receive greater Western economic aid.
The Community is negotiating association agreements with the three countries, but until now it has resisted lowering protectionist barriers to their most competitive exports -- food, textiles, steel and coal -- and is reluctant to give them greater access to Western European credits.
 
Calling for Concessions
 Calling for such concessions, Jacques Delors, the president of the Community's Executive Commission, said this week, "It's no good making fine speeches about solidarity with Eastern Europe on Sunday and the next day refusing their demands to import more of their goods."
European governments that in the past paid scant attention to Mr. Yeltsin are also now busily adjusting to his new importance. Today he received official invitations to visit Germany, France and Italy, while European newspapers universally hailed him as the man of the hour.
After talking by telephone to Mr. Gorbachev today, Mr. Major had nothing but praise for the Soviet leader. "I don't know why you seem so keen to write him off," the Prime Minister told reporters. "He sounded like a man who was very fit, very confident and raring to get on with the job."

HEADLINE: BUDGET IS PASSED FOR CONNECTICUT WITH INCOME TAX

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 22

 BODY:
After six months of anguished budget deadlock, capped by a 36-hour marathon of deal making and brinkmanship, the Connecticut legislature today approved Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s income tax plan and gave the state a budget for the fiscal year that began more than seven weeks ago.
The income tax, which was signed into law by Mr. Weicker at 4 P.M., less than an hour after the final vote in the House of Representatives, will take effect on Sept. 1, thus shortening to only nine the list of states without an income tax. Residents will feel the new tax in their paychecks by early October. The income tax has a nominal rate of 4.5 percent, but it is somewhat graduated through a system of standard deductions and credits. 
 The plan was a victory for Mr. Weicker, a former Republican who abandoned his party last year to run for governor as an independent anti-party politician and who after being elected made the establishment of an income tax the centerpiece of his first year in office.
 
Political Drama
 True to the form established over a summer of budget cliffhangers and false starts that included three full-year budget vetoes by Mr. Weicker and a partial shutdown of the state government last month, the race to the finish was political drama at its highest and lowest forms.
In the State Senate, the plan passed when Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark broke an 18-to-18 tie.
Five and a half hours later, in a vote that brought many exhausted lawmakers to tears, the House killed the plan, 81 to 69. But it was revived and finally was passed by a 75-to-73 vote later in the day after several hours of open bargaining on the floor of the House. Legislators sought to trade their votes for everything from promises about local property tax relief to pledges by the Governor to try to bring down the size of government.
 
Particularly High Stakes
 "When I sign this budget Connecticut will be closing the book on its past and it'll be facing toward the future," Mr. Weicker said at a signing ceremony.
But some legislators contended that the Weicker administration had simply pressured or bought out opponents with promises of local tax disbursements and pledges to consider pet projects.
Mr. Weicker denied that the budget was the result of any improperly applied pressure tactics. The Governor said his very lack of any party support in the legislature made it impossible for him to employ the kinds of party plums and other tools that are the ordinary give and take in traditional two-party politics.
But it was also clear as the dust settled over what has been at times a harsh and personal contest between Mr. Weicker and the General Assembly that Mr. Weicker's status outside the traditional political system did have an impact on Connecticut's struggles. It may also have some lingering consequences, especially if the income tax provokes the sort of public outcry that some lawmakers predict it will eventually draw.
For the majority Democrats, who have ruled Connecticut in both the legislative and executive branches of government for most of the last four decades and who led the charge to support Mr. Weicker's budget, the stakes are particularly high. Republicans, who remained largely united against Mr. Weicker's budget, have already vowed to use the Democrats' ties to the Weicker income tax like a bludgeon in next year's General Assembly elections.
Some Democrats said that with Mr. Weicker vetoing any budget that did not contain an income tax, as he did on three occasions since May, majority status simply required leadership, however people felt on the income tax issue.
"The time has come to act," said Representative Richard T. Mulready, a West Hartford Democrat, in arguing early this morning that statesmanship required a budget, like it or not. "If this bill doesn't go, we have genuine stalemate," he said.
Other lawmakers wrestled, sometimes in emotional terms, to express their concerns that passing an income tax into law would also clearly mark the end of an era in Connecticut.
Since at least the early 1950's, when Gov. Chester Bowles ran for re-election on an income tax platform and lost badly, through 1971, when the state briefly passed an income tax that lasted all of six weeks before being repealed under a howl of protest, the income tax has persisted as a symbol in the state's public vocabulary. To opponents it has meant grasping government growth, and to supporters, fairness in making those with the most means pay the most tax.
Representative Peter J. Fusscas, a Republican from Marlborough, said the passage of an income tax would bloat state government with new money and new spending. "It lets the genie out of the bottle," he said. "Once it's out, it ain't never going back in."
Now that Connecticut is getting an income tax, the nine states that still do not have an income tax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.
Mr. Weicker, who took office in January and proposed his budget overhaul plan only a month later, argued that the recession and a huge revenue shortfall from the two main existing tax sources had forced the state's hand in throwing out the old system. He proposed cutting those two taxes -- the 8 percent sales tax and the 13.8 percent corporate profits tax -- and making up the difference with an income tax.
The Senate, especially, stood across the barricades during much of the 53 days that the state struggled since July 1 without a budget. The senators found they could block every attempt to pass Mr. Weicker's income tax, but they were also unable to prevail in overriding the Governor's vetoes of non-income-tax plans or to impose any vision of their own.
The result for much of the summer was a deepening gulf of bitterness and frustration that left lawmakers and residents alike fed up and exhausted.
Often the news seemed like a soap opera: In the House, where a majority was reached last month on an income tax plan, members broke a longstanding taboo by openly criticizing their Senate colleagues in floor debates. The Senate, which had a two-thirds majority ready to override Mr. Weicker's budget vetoes, bridled at the House's failure to muster the same majority needed to impose the non-income-tax budget.
The votes this morning came only about 30 hours after three previous holdout Democratic senators broke the deadlock by announcing their support for an income tax plan.
"People ask me if I'm committing political suicide," said Senator Steven Spellman, a Democrat from Pawcatuck, one of the swing-vote senators. "My answer is, I don't know."
 
Other Significant Changes
 The budget, while overshadowed by the introduction of the income tax, would also bring about significant changes in most other state taxes. The 8 percent sales tax would be lowered to 6 percent but extended to many new transactions, including lower-priced clothing, home repairs and tax preparation services.
The 13.8 percent corporate tax would be lowered to 10.5 percent over two years. The existing taxes on income from dividends and interest, which peak at 14 percent, and the 7 percent capital gains tax would both be eliminated entirely, with all income treated equally under the new 4.5 percent rate.
The income tax would be applied to all adjusted gross income over $12,000 a year for an individual, $19,000 for a head of household and $24,000 for a couple filing jointly. But the effective rates are also colored by an interlocking system of tax credits and phased-out deductions that would affect about 76 percent of all taxpayers, according to the bill's sponsors.
 
Spreading the Burden
 The tax credits would reduce the burden of the income tax on poor and middle-class families, while the phased-out deductions would increase tax payments by those at higher income levels. A couple earning $40,000, for example, would not pay any tax on the first $24,000 and would also receive a $252 tax credit, resulting in a net effective tax rate of 1.17 percent, owing $468.
A family earning $80,000, by contrast, would pay the income tax on the full amount, with no deduction allowed at all, and would get a tax credit of $360, resulting in an effective tax rate of 4.05 percent and a tax bill of $3,240.
State income taxes are deductible from Federal tax liability at lower incomes, which means that people who itemize on their Federal tax returns would get a part of their state income tax payments back in the form of a larger Federal tax refund.
 
Separate Package
 The budget was also tied to a separate package of government consolidation plans and spending controls that many lawmakers had insisted upon in return for their votes.
Both chambers also passed earlier in the evening a proposed amendment to the State Constitution that would provide further restraints.
That bill, which would require approval by residents at the next general election -- in November 1992 -- would prohibit some categories of state spending from growing any faster than the rate of inflation or the growth in personal income.
