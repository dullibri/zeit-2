HEADLINE: Mortgage Woes Push UBS to Its First Loss in 5 Years

BYLINE: By NICK CUMMING-BRUCE

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
The Swiss bank UBS reported its first quarterly loss in five years on Tuesday as a result of bad investments tied to subprime mortgages in the United States. And although it also predicted a return to group profits in the fourth quarter, the news left analysts uneasily considering the likelihood of further big write-offs.
 Marcel Rohner, who became chief executive of UBS four months ago, said the third quarter was ''unquestionably disappointing.'' The bank posted a net loss of 830 million Swiss francs ($716 million), in contrast to a net profit of 2.2 billion francs a year earlier. 
 The result reflected a loss of 3.68 billion francs at the bank's securities unit because of subprime investments. 
 Despite the positive fourth-quarter outlook, UBS warned that its fixed-income business ''remains exposed to further deterioration'' in the American housing and mortgage markets. UBS said it did not expect its investment bank to return to profitability in the last three months of the year.
 Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Bear Stearns in London, said he expected more bad news. ''I don't think everything is done and dusted,'' he said. ''They are going to take a big hit in the fourth quarter.''
 Shares of UBS closed at $53.11 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Fears that other European banks may follow UBS in marking down debt securities helped hurt the euro against the dollar on Tuesday as well, ending a five-day climb.
 Subprime losses at UBS overshadowed healthy growth in other areas of the bank's business.
 Its wealth management operations, the world's biggest, attracted 40.2 billion francs in new money and generated net profit of 2.4 billion francs. Equity underwriting and corporate advisory services delivered big gains in net fee and commission income.
 But the big concern for UBS remains the extent of its exposure to the shaky housing market in the United States.
 UBS reported that it had $16.8 billion invested directly in residential mortgage-backed securities and $20.2 billion worth of supersenior securities, which are paid back ahead of other similarly rated securities in the case of a default.
 In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Rohner declined to speculate on the possibility of further write-downs other than saying ''the range of possible outcomes is widening.''
 Mr. Wheeler, the Bear Stearns analyst, predicted that UBS would have to make further write-downs of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in the fourth quarter. ''A large chunk of fourth-quarter earnings are going to get wiped out,'' he said.
 Analysts also questioned whether UBS had been aggressive enough in dealing with its exposure to the American housing and mortgage market, comparing its response unfavorably with that of Merrill Lynch, which last week wrote down $8.4 billion, its biggest loss ever.
 UBS had twice the exposure of Merrill but had marked down barely half as much, said Kinner Lakhani , an ABN Amro analyst. ''The impression they left the market at the start of the month was that we were unlikely to see further major markdowns,'' Mr. Lakhani said, but the third-quarter results did not ''leave a high level of confidence that this is it.''
 Reserves at Bank of China
 HONG KONG, Oct. 30 (Reuters) -- Bank of China, the country's flagship foreign exchange lender, posted a 23 percent rise in third-quarter profit Tuesday as the mainland economy boomed, but also booked $643 million in provisions and reserves to account for its exposure to American subprime mortgage-backed bonds.
 The state-run lender's share price has lagged that of its peers after it reported on Aug. 23 that it held $9.65 billion worth of subprime-related bonds and collateralized debt obligations, the largest exposure revealed by a Chinese bank.
 A smaller rival, Bank of Communications, which has not reported any subprime-related exposure, said third-quarter net profit nearly doubled to 5.93 billion yuan ($794 million), from 2.98 billion yuan a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Talking About Fear, Real and Imagined

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Trash Talking World War III'' (editorial, Oct. 29):
 Reading your editorial was a disquieting experience for anyone who is a veteran of World War II because that war ended with hopes that America and the world would be at peace for an eternity. If we have learned one lesson, it is that relying on military aggression as was staged four years ago in Iraq was foolhardy. 
 To be talking about using military force to curtail Iran's building of a nuclear weapon would be compounding the error sizably. If ever diplomacy was needed, now is the time, before President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney recklessly set the stage to ensnare us for yet another war before their terms are over. Cy Shain 
 San Francisco, Oct. 29, 2007
 To the Editor:
 You write that ''the world should not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.'' How does The New York Times suggest that ''the world'' prevent it? 
 Diplomacy, you say, although years of diplomatic efforts by our European allies, with the full support of the United States, have accomplished nothing. Sanctions, you write, wishing away the fact that Russian and Chinese cooperation will be unattainable with the suggestion that Condoleezza Rice give those countries a good talking to.
 Our best chance of avoiding the necessity of military action is to convince the Iranian regime that we are prepared to take it, with the hope that this, together with such diplomatic and economic pressures as we are able to muster, will persuade more cautious regime elements to change course.
 The statements of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney that you deride as ''trash talk'' -- and that are in fact well within traditional diplomatic bounds -- are therefore a necessary part of any realistic strategy to avoid war. 
 Howard F. Jaeckel
 New York, Oct. 30, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 ''Trash Talking World War III'' lists cogent reasons why it is not in the world's or the United States' interests to bomb Iran, including ''the disastrous diplomatic and economic costs.''
 You point out that a bombing campaign is unlikely to set back Iran's efforts for more than a few years, nor is such an attack likely to cause Iranians to rise up against their current government.
 What you do not mention, however, are the huge humanitarian costs as well. There are thousands of Iranians -- men, women, children, grandchildren, grandparents, doctors, lawyers, teachers and so on -- living near the sites where we would use our bombing power. Are we again willing, as we were in Iraq, to disrupt a population, cause a new refugee crisis, watch bodies collected from homes and streets, create a civil war and destroy an ancient civilization? 
 These are the questions that we must ask the Bush administration, questions that go beyond expediency and economic costs to us. We have done enough damage and destroyed and disrupted enough lives in Iraq. We should not add Iran to our list of horrors.

 To the Editor:
 Re ''Fearing Fear Itself,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Oct. 29), and ''Trash Talking World War III'' (editorial, Oct. 29):
 The points of view in these articles do not recognize the reality of the threat. Consider the bombings that have shaken London, Spain, Bali, Pakistan and Israel since 2001. They are all related through the Islamic orientation of the perpetrators. This is not mere coincidence; rather the Muslim identity of the murderers represents the very impetus for the attacks. 
 This religious clarion call is certainly an ideology, and to call it Islamofascism simply connotes that it endangers the world as much as Hitler's Nazism. Iran poses a particular danger since it openly seeks hegemony, at any cost, in the Middle East. Its pursuit of nuclear weapons portends a cataclysm that will affect the entire world.
 The international community should prevent Iran from obtaining such weapons by every means possible, including a military campaign.
 Sheryl Gura Rosenberg
 New York, Oct. 29, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman's column is on target. The hate-mongering and fear-peddling campaign by leading Republican candidates for president, who continue to use the war on terror as one against ''Islamofascism,'' a fictitious ideology as Mr. Krugman points out, is not only irresponsible but also dangerous. 
 This shameless strategy of attaching ''fascism'' to Islam to win votes by exploiting our fears and anxieties is offensive to more than a billion peaceful God-fearing Muslims. The fanning of anti-Muslim sentiment inherent in the demagogy that passes for political discourse is likely to add to the bigotry of some who may feel compelled to act on it.
 This is not an issue for American Muslims only, but it affects all of us and we need to speak out if we are to maintain this ''best hope for mankind,'' the American experiment in democracy, tolerance and diversity.
 Mohammed A. Nurhussein
 Brooklyn, Oct. 29, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman's column ''Fearing Fear Itself'' is a lightning bolt of truth and insight in a political dialogue gone awry. The use of language by the right is very calculated and in point of fact very clever. It frames issues by the labels it chooses. Thus, an escalation of troops became the ''surge.'' Surge has connotations of strength and vigor; escalation brings back the bad memories of Vietnam. 
 The same technique is being used before a confrontation with Iran. ''Islamofascism'' taps into the tapestry of themes that have been woven into our consciousness concerning our participation in World War II. Hitler was a fascist; look what we had to do to him. Just by using the term ''Islamofascism'' we are playing into the hands of those seeking a violent confrontation with Iran and the Muslim world. Mark E. Ferris
 St. Louis, Oct. 29, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman says that he fears ''unreasoning fear'' more than anything Al Qaeda or Iran might do to the United States. So a nuclear bomb smuggled into an American city by Al Qaeda or another sympathetic group doesn't frighten him? It scares me to death.

HEADLINE: Securing Russian Nuclear Missiles? U.S. Is Set to Say 'Done'

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
With a final inspection planned for Wednesday at a secret nuclear missile base in the Ural Mountains, the United States expects to complete a program of security improvements for Russia's network of strategic nuclear rocket forces, according to two American officials involved in the effort.
 The program to improve the security at 25 classified sites on 12 Russian bases, agreed to by President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin at a meeting in Slovakia in 2005, will have been finished two years ahead of schedule. 
 It includes measures that have long been part of American efforts to ensure that none of Russia's nuclear weapons or materials, poorly secured after the Soviet Union collapsed, fall out of government control. They include alarm and motion-detection systems, modern gates, guardhouses and fighting positions, as well as detectors for explosives, radiation and metal. 
 The program's completion ahead of schedule appeared to have political as well as security significance at a time when relations between the countries have been strained.
 Two American nonproliferation officials said the new round of nuclear security upgrades shows that even in times of renewed tension between Washington and the Kremlin, American teams have been working closely with Russian officials at some of the country's most classified sites.
 In a telephone interview, William H. Tobey, a senior nonproliferation official at the National Nuclear Security Administration, said the program had reduced the chance of unauthorized access at the nuclear weapon sites and that it was ''continued evidence of this bright spot in U.S.-Russian relations.''
 Relations between Russia and the United States have soured on a number of issues, including the Iranian nuclear program and the Bush administration's insistence on the need to build missile defenses in Europe, a proposal that has alarmed the Kremlin.
 As recently as last week, Mr. Putin publicly compared the disagreement over the need for a missile defense system, and the United States' plans to build it near Russia, to the Cuban missile crisis. On Monday, the Russian military claimed to have conducted more than 20 long-range flights with its aging fleet of strategic nuclear bombers, and said a similar number of flights were planned for this week. 
 Russia has also taken to broadcasting state-controlled news reports of tests of cruise missiles and powerful conventional weapons, drawing comparisons to American systems and suggesting that the tests are necessary because of threats from the West.
 Russian and American politicians and security analysts have suggested that some of Mr. Putin's statements, and the nationalist content on Kremlin-controlled television networks, have been tied to the election season here. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for early December, and a presidential election to select Mr. Putin's successor is planned for the spring. 
 The election season has arrived against a backdrop of rising inflation and steeply climbing living costs. At the same time, Russia is facing criticism from the West about its behavior, including its record of nondemocratic elections and the use of energy and trade levers, in the West's view, to punish governments that have challenged its authority.
 The continuing work at the missile bases, however, belies the intensity of some of the Kremlin's statements, showing that Mr. Putin's government continues to collaborate on strategically delicate nonproliferation programs.
 Mr. Tobey and another official at the security administration, a semiautonomous arm of the Department of Energy, declined to provide many details of the final inspection and work, saying that under the agreement with Russia many elements of the program remain classified.
 But he said the security upgrades had been conducted at bunkers, rail transfer points and so-called mating facilities, where warheads are joined to rocket systems. In all, he said, the work cost about $150 million, and was paid for by the United States.
 He said work on other security and nonproliferation programs was also ahead of schedule. Among them are plans to install radiation detectors at all Russian border crossings by 2011 and an effort to finish construction in 2009 of fossil-fuel power plants in Siberia to replace the last three nuclear power plants in Russia that produce plutonium.

HEADLINE: Hillary la Francaise, Cherchez la Femme?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 It's an odd cultural inversion.
 The French first lady, the one in a role where wives traditionally ignored and overlooked their husbands' peccadilloes for the greater gain of keeping their marriages intact and running the Elysee Palace, has fled her gilded perch, acting all-American and brimming over with feelings and feminist impulses.
 The former American first lady, the one who's supposed to be brimming over with feminist impulses, has ignored and overlooked her husband's peccadilloes for the greater gain of keeping her marriage intact, as she tries to return to the gilded perch and run the White House. 
 Cecilia Sarkozy acts so American, while Hillary Clinton acts so French.
 Cecilia at one point left her marriage to go to New York and seek love American-style, while Hillary lost the public love in the '90s when she tried French-style health care reform.
 In Essence magazine, Hillary sounded tres French, tres laissez-faire, talking about her marriage. ''Now obviously we've had challenges as everybody in the world knows,'' she said. ''But I never doubted that it was a marriage worth investing in even in the midst of those challenges. And I'm really happy that I made that decision. Again, not a decision for everybody. And I think it's so important for women to stand up for the right of women to make a decision that is best for them.''
 In addition to the warrior strategy, the one that led Hillary to back President Bush on the Iraq war and the Iran drumbeat, the senator has a girlfriend strategy.
 Hillary recently told an interviewer that they should talk like ''two girlfriends,'' and last week her campaign theme was: ''Women Changing America.'' She returns to Wellesley tomorrow to launch Hillblazers, a bid to attract young Hillarys to the campaign. She will be back in the setting of her 1969 feminist triumph as the commencement speaker who described her class's desire for a ''more immediate, ecstatic and penetrating mode of living'' and who spoke truth to power, chastising Edward Brooke for being out of touch.
 Hillary doesn't speak truth to power any more. Now that Mark Penn believes women can carry her to victory, Hillary speaks girlfriend to girlfriend. 
 That tack, Caitlin Flanagan writes in The Atlantic, would only work if she were ''willing to let us women in on the big, underlying struggle of her life that is front and center in our understanding of who she is as a woman. Her husband's sexual behavior, quite apart from the private pain that it has caused her, has also sullied her deepest -- and most womanly -- ideals and convictions, for the Clintons' political partnership has demanded that she defend actions she knows to be indefensible. To call her husband a philanderer is almost to whitewash him, for he's used women far less sophisticated, educated and powerful than he -- women particularly susceptible to the rake's characteristic blend of cajolery and deceit -- for his sexual gratification. 
 ''In glossing over her husband's actions and abetting his efforts to squirm away from the scrutiny and judgment they provoke, Hillary has too often lapsed into her customary hauteur and self-righteousness and added to the pain delivered upon these women.''
 That's French hauteur, of course, the kind Nicolas Sarkozy showed when he called his press secretary an ''imbecile'' and refused to answer Lesley Stahl's question on ''60 Minutes'' about his marriage and ripped off his microphone. He may have failed to realize that, unlike in France, he can't call his powerful buddies and simply get the story killed.
 Hillary surely hopes there is a harbinger in Argentina, where voters just rewarded their former president for his economic prosperity by electing his wife to succeed him.
 ''And why not?,'' former first lady Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said about Hillary yesterday. ''Another woman wouldn't be bad.''
 Ms. Flanagan is not so sure. She was particularly bothered by Hillary's callousness in dumping Socks, the beloved White House cat and best-selling author, on Bill's former secretary Betty Currie.
 But maybe the qualities that many find off-putting in Hillary -- her opportunism, her triangulation, her ethical corner-cutting, her shifting convictions from pro-war to anti-war, her secrecy, her ruthlessness -- are the same ones that make people willing to vote for a woman.
 Few are concerned that Hillary is strong enough for the job. She is cold-eyed about wanting power and raising money and turning everything about her life into a commodity. Yet, the characteristics that are somewhat troubling are the same ones that convincingly show she will do what it takes to beat Obama and Rudy. She will not be soft or vulnerable. She will not melt in a crisis.
 And, unlike Obama, she doesn't need to talk herself into manning up. Obama whiffed in the debate last night when Brian Williams and Tim Russert teed up the first question for him to take on Hillary -- something the debate dominatrix never would have done.

HEADLINE: A Top House Democrat Offers Tax Overhaul Plan and a Juicy Political Target

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
When the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee proposed a sweeping overhaul of the tax code last week, aimed at shifting more of the burden of taxation to the wealthy, Democrats were lukewarm and Republicans loosed a fusillade of attacks.
 But even as Democrats ran for cover and Republicans fired away, the proposal by the chairman, Charles B. Rangel of New York, gave shape to the debate over one of the biggest issues facing the next administration: whether to keep President Bush's tax cuts in place or roll them back.
 ''What Rangel has done is put out a coherent plan,'' said Robert E. Rubin, who was Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and is now chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup. ''You may like it, you may not like it. But it starts a discussion.''
 In general, the Democratic presidential candidates have made clear that they intend to reverse Mr. Bush's income tax reductions for upper-income people and use the additional revenue to pay for health care and other domestic programs. But they have not put forward detailed tax plans of the sort offered by Mr. Rangel. 
 His bill would increase tax rates on the wealthy; eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which is increasingly raising tax bills for many middle- and upper-income people; provide additional breaks for low- and middle-income households; and overhaul corporate taxes by reducing rates while tightening tax breaks.
 By making Democratic ideas concrete, Mr. Rangel set up a target for opponents, from the White House to Congressional leaders to Republican presidential candidates to conservative commentators and editorial writers -- all of whom portrayed it as a warning of the dangers Democrats pose to taxpayers and the economy.
 Former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts called Mr. Rangel's proposal the ''largest increase in the history of America,'' and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York said, ''We certainly shouldn't raise taxes the way Charlie Rangel wants to.''
 Democrats have distanced themselves from the Rangel bill even while expressing approval of its general objectives of making the tax system more progressive, with the burden rising on those with the highest incomes.
 Asked if she endorsed the plan, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said simply, ''no.'' But she added that the Rangel bill would be presented to Democratic House members, and without sounding like she was relishing the prospect, predicted that ''we will have our usual exciting, dynamic, give-and-take on the subject.''
 Also sounding noncommittal, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York said she shared with Mr. Rangel ''the goal of tax fairness'' and ''welcomes his leadership,'' according to her spokesman, Howard Wolfson.
 ''I think Charlie's being very courageous in moving forward,'' Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday night at the Democratic debate in Philadelphia. ''I don't agree with all the details, but he's on the right track to say we've got to do something about the A.M.T.,'' she said, referring to the alternative minimum tax. 
 But if Democratic politicians have been reticent, liberal economists said Mr. Rangel was right to put on the table a statement that tax policy under Mr. Bush had become too tilted toward benefiting the wealthy and the government could not afford to let its long-term financial condition continue to deteriorate.
 ''His bill is both brave and well designed,'' said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center for Budget Policy and Priorities, a liberal policy institute. ''The level of taxes owed by Americans under the Rangel bill is still lower than what they owed when Bush came in. The charge that it's the biggest tax increase in history is nonsense.''
 Mr. Rangel, in an interview, said he savored the controversy he had stirred up, especially when the ranking Republican on his Ways and Means Committee, Jim McCrery of Louisiana, labeled his proposal ''the mother of all tax hikes.'' 
 ''The mother of all tax hikes?'' he asked, laughing. ''I love it! I'm excited about having a debate. What I'm doing is putting out a score card, and people can agree or disagree. But all those people who claim they're going to be adversely affected by tax increases should now come forward and make their case.''
 Mr. Rangel acknowledged that his proposal had little chance of passage this year or next, or of overcoming a veto by Mr. Bush if it did. But he said he was at least addressing what most specialists say are fiscal problems that would grow harder over time. 
 In an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Mr. Rangel portrayed his plan as a way to help the middle class by rescuing them from the alternative minimum tax, which was originally intended to ensure that the wealthy could not escape income taxes by using deductions and loopholes. In recent years it has increased the tax bills of less affluent households and if left unaddressed, would affect more middle-income people.
 His plan, Mr. Rangel said in the article, would ''put money back in the pockets of working families,'' a formulation similar to the language long used by Republicans to justify their tax cuts.
 The congressman argues that eliminating some breaks and letting taxes go up in coming years for some taxpayers making more than $200,000 -- and especially for those above $500,000 -- will ensure that 90 million Americans will pay lower taxes than under the current system.
 Of particular significance, he does not envision using the revenue for spending programs, which is what many Democratic presidential candidates say they have in mind. 
 In that sense, the proposal implicitly challenges the thinking of some Democrats that their spending proposals can be easily paid for by taxing the rich.
 But Republicans who are critical of the Rangel proposal said that although it was framed as providing a tax cut to 90 million Americans (and a tax increase on 1.7 million), it would ''cut'' only taxes that they are not yet paying but would pay if current law governing the alternative minimum tax was not changed. 
 ''Look at the real Democratic priorities,'' said Mr. McCrery, the ranking committee Republican. ''Look at their appropriations bills. Look at children's health. What they need is more tax revenue. Boy, does this bill give them more revenue.''
 While criticizing Mr. Rangel's priorities, some Republican tax specialists give him credit for laying out priorities. ''I'm not a big fan of this proposal,'' said Kevin A. Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative research group.
 ''But the thing he's done that makes Democrats uncomfortable is that he's exposed the fallacy of their position,'' Mr. Hassett added. ''He's made it uncomfortable for them to blame all the world's problems on the Bush tax cuts, and to say if you just repeal the tax cuts on the wealthy, you'll have heaven on earth.''

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Approves Beefing Up Safety Agency

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Over the objections of the Bush administration, a Senate committee unanimously adopted sweeping legislation on Tuesday that would extend the authority of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and sharply increase its budget and staff.
 House and Senate Democrats also called for the resignation of the acting chairwoman of the agency, Nancy A. Nord, criticizing her for raising many of the same objections to the legislation that have been made by the manufacturers the agency regulates.
 The bill would increase the maximum penalties for safety violations and make it easier for the government to make public reports of faulty products, protect industry whistle-blowers and prosecute executives of companies that willfully violate safety laws. It would ban lead in toys and give state prosecutors the authority to enforce federal consumer safety rules. Ms. Nord has objected to those and other provisions in the measure. 
 The legislation is a response to a series of recent disclosures of major product defects, most notably dangerously high levels of lead in millions of toys. The measure was sponsored by Senator Daniel K. Inouye, the Democrat of Hawaii who heads the committee, and Senator Mark Pryor, the Democrat of Arkansas who heads the consumer affairs subcommittee. A consensus has emerged among Democrats that the safety commission, whose budget and staffing have been repeatedly cut, is unable to police the marketplace adequately. 
 ''It is very clear to me, as well as millions of moms and dads around the country, that the C.P.S.C. is failing to keep dangerous toys and products out of the marketplace,'' Mr. Pryor said. He said the legislation ''infuses the agency with the resources and authority it needs to keep dangerous toys and products out of our homes.''
 The handful of Republicans who attended the Senate committee session on the bill Tuesday afternoon sat silently as the Democrats moved to adopt the measure. A coalition of business trade groups is hoping that its allies, particularly among the Republicans, will derail the measure as it heads to the Senate floor. Lawmakers in the House said they were preparing to consider similar legislation.
 Ms. Nord, a former lawyer at Eastman Kodak and a former official at the United States Chamber of Commerce, recently sent lawmakers letters attacking the legislation as unworkable and counterproductive, mirroring concerns raised by manufacturers. Those complaints have been rebutted by the agency's Democratic commissioner, Thomas H. Moore, who generally supports the Senate bill.
 Nancy Pelosi of California, the House speaker, joined other senior Democrats in the House in calling for Ms. Nord's resignation, as did Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio.
 Given the recent problems, any commission chairman who declines added authority or resources ''does not understand the gravity of the situation,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''I call on the president of the United States to ask for her resignation.''
 Julie Vallese, a spokeswoman for Ms. Nord, said Ms. Nord did not have plans to resign. Ms. Vallese said that Ms. Nord ''would welcome additional resources'' but had not requested any specific increases for staff and budget. 
 ''She would welcome new resources but she wants them to be the right resources,'' Ms. Vallese said. She said that Ms. Nord preferred that the agency, rather than Congress, determine how to use any increase in budget and staff.
 She said that one of Ms. Nord's primary objections to the legislation was that it imposed new requirements on the agency that ''would not strengthen enforcement'' but instead ''would put the agency in court.''
 ''The resources the agency needs to live up to our mission are scientists and safety inspectors, not lawyers,'' she said.
 Ms. Vallese said that Ms. Nord thought that the proposed increase in the maximum penalty for violations, to $100 million from $1.8 million ''would inundate the agency with paperwork and reports that will need to be reviewed and would not improve product safety.'' Ms. Vallese said the provision protecting and rewarding industry whistle-blowers ''is one that the chairman sees as creating litigation rather than dealing with product safety.''
 Emily Lawrimore, a White House spokeswoman, said the president continued to support Ms. Nord.
 ''We believe it's important for Democrats to stop politicizing the important issue of consumer product safety and work with us on meaningful reform,'' Ms. Lawrimore said.
 Allan B. Hubbard, the president's top economic adviser at the White House, said in a letter Tuesday that the administration would disclose next month its own legislative and regulatory plan to improve consumer safety. In a letter to Mr. Inouye, Mr. Hubbard criticized the legislation for providing huge potential compensation for industry whistle-blowers. He said that compensation could ''produce a serious risk of meritless claims by 'bounty hunters,' with an adverse impact on our economy.''

HEADLINE: Pension Fund Sues Countrywide Officers

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
The chief executive of Countrywide Financial, Angelo R. Mozilo, has been sued by a pension fund that accused the company of helping executives pocket improper gains by artificially inflating its stock price through share buybacks. 
 The pension fund, the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund, accused Mr. Mozilo, other Countrywide executives and its board of gross mismanagement for improperly using $2 billion in cash to repurchase stock.
 It said the move allowed executives to sell shares of Countrywide worth $842 million at artificially high prices from April 2004 to October 2007, at the expense of ordinary shareholders.
 Countrywide had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.
 The lawsuit, filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, cited news reports that insider share sales at Countrywide reached a five-year peak in March, four months before the company posted a 33 percent drop in second-quarter earnings and cut its full-year earnings forecast.
 On Oct. 26, Countrywide posted a $1.2 billion third-quarter loss, but projected a fourth-quarter profit. The company's shares have fallen by about 60 percent this year.
 Countrywide, based in Calabasas, Calif., is at the center of the subprime mortgage crisis in which rising interest rates have caused tens of thousands of homeowners nationwide to default on adjustable-rate mortgages.
 The shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed by the securities class-action specialist Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins. Shareholder derivative actions allow a shareholder to bring claims of mismanagement on behalf of the company.
 The lawsuit names six executives in addition to Mr. Mozilo, eight directors, five former directors and Countrywide's auditor, KPMG.

HEADLINE: Law Firm Is Giving Its Associates Two Year-End Bonuses

BYLINE: By ELLEN ROSEN

 BODY:
Cravath, Swaine & Moore has raised the salary bar for law firm associates in Manhattan.
 The firm has announced that it will award a special one-time bonus for associates in addition to the traditional year-end bonus that the firm, like most others, already pays. All but the newest associates will receive $10,000 to $50,000, depending on seniority, which was first reported by Abovethelaw.com.
 The first firm to announce bonuses usually sets the tone for the other law firms. Cravath's announcement also came early because law-firm bonuses are typically decided later in the year. 
 Evan R. Chesler, Cravath's presiding partner, said there was no particular significance to the timing. He said the announcement was not tied to recruiting, which is in full swing. Instead, he said, the firm wanted to ''thank our lawyers for the hard work this year and the good year we've had.''
 ''It's a one-time event based on the performance of the firm and the contribution,'' Mr. Chesler said. ''We had decided it now and since we made the decision, there was no reason not to tell people and give them the money.'' 
 At the same time, Cravath associates learned that annual bonuses would remain at last year's levels, meaning that a current third-year associate, for example, would receive the same annual bonus as a third-year associate in 2006.
 An associate who graduated in 2006 will receive total compensation of $205,000: $160,000 in base salary with the $35,000 year-end bonus and the additional payment announced this week. Both base and bonus increase each year that an associate works at a firm.
 If previous salary increases are any indication, once one firm announces an increase, in whatever form, others usually follow within short order.
 Surprisingly, several partners at other firms said they had not yet heard about the increases -- either from other partners or their associates, who are not shy about mentioning what other firms pay. But a spokesman at Shearman & Sterling said, ''We're aware of recent developments, but are not prepared to comment.'' 
 Martin F. Evans, Debevoise & Plimpton's presiding partner, said in an e-mail message that the firm expected ''to announce this week fully competitive annual and special bonuses.''
 This year, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, raised first-year associate salaries from $145,000 to $160,000. Other firms quickly matched that. Whether Simpson will follow Cravath this time is not known; Philip T. Ruegger III, the chairman of Simpson's executive committee, could not be reached for comment. 
 But Sullivan & Cromwell, which began a round of salary wars in 2006 when it increased first year pay to $145,000, is likely to match soon. A law firm partner, Gandolfo V. DiBlasi, said, ''We've always paid at the top and we intend to this year.'' He declined, however, to say whether Sullivan & Cromwell would bifurcate its bonuses like Cravath or increase the total year-end bonus.
 The structure matters. By awarding a special bonus, Cravath is not tied to the amount for next year. Mr. Chesler said that ''it's an uncertain economy,'' and said that unlike a corporation that had retained earnings, law firm partnerships ''distribute net income above expenses, and part of that is what we pay our employees.''
