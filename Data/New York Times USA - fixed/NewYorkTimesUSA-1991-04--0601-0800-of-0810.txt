HEADLINE: OBJECTIONS MOUNT OVER VALDEZ PACT

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
Prompted by new studies on the damage to Prince William Sound and annoyed that scientific and economic information is being kept secret, lawmakers, environmental groups and many Alaskans are raising increasing objections to the $1.1 billion civil and criminal settlement of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
In hearings this month held by a state House committee, hundreds of fishermen and native Alaskan villagers urged the panel to reject the proposed settlement, contending that $1 billion was neither enough money to pay for damage to the environment from the spill nor a severe penalty for the Exxon Corporation. 
 The House committee and a separate panel of the state Senate met in Juneau today to consider the comments and decide whether to recommend accepting the settlement arising from the 11-million-gallon spill on March 14, 1989. After the panels decide, the issue will go to the full Legislature.
 
Opponents in Washington
 Opponents of the settlement include Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who is acting chairman of the House Interior Committee. He has asked Federal District Judge H. Russel Holland in Alaska to reject the agreement made with Exxon to settle criminal violations.
Four other House Democrats urged the judge last week to postpone a decision on the settlement until scientific and economic studies on the condition of Prince William Sound are made public.
National environmental groups today also withdrew their earlier support, and officials from native Alaskan villages are pressing a court case in Federal District Court here aimed at scuttling the pact.
By far the largest settlement ever for damage caused by an environmental disaster, the agreement between the Justice Department, Alaska and Exxon calls for the company to pay up to $1 billion over the next 14 years to reimburse the state and Federal governments for scientific studies and environmental restoration projects. The pact also calls on Exxon and its shipping subsidiary to plead guilty to four criminal violations of environmental law and pay a fine of $100 million.
Lawyers for the Justice Department and the Alaska Attorney General, Charles E. Cole, have warned that any changes in the agreement could lead to its collapse. In an interview today, Mr. Cole said more Alaskans now appeared to oppose the agreement, but he said support for the pact was also strong in the state. A poll by an independent company commissioned by the Governor last week showed Alaskans supported the agreement by two to one, Mr. Cole said.
"What's happened is that as more people understand the settlement, they realize that $1 billion paid out over a decade is not enough to make up for the damages caused by the oil spill," Representative Miller said. "The people in Alaska have every reason to be concerned."
Mr. Miller complained this month in two letters to Judge Holland the agreement would immunize the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, the owner of the Trans-Alaska pipeline and the Valdez oil terminal, from prosecution by the Government. Alyeska is owned by Exxon and seven other companies.
He said the protection for Alyeska was not in the public interest because documents his staff uncovered showed the company knew it was unable to respond to a major oil spill but misrepresented its abilities in documents it filed with the state.
 
Studies Remain Secret
 Opponents are also angry that scientific studies on damage to Prince William Sound, and economic studies that show how much the damage will cost, remain secret.
Earlier this month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a summary of 58 scientific studies that said the oil spill killed hundreds of thousands of birds, thousands of otters and caused extensive damage to shorelines and tidal zones that will persist for years. Economists under contract to the state and the Federal Government said in interviews that in separate reports they estimated the damage at $3 billion to $5 billion.
Fishermen in Prince William Sound and Representative Gerry E. Studds, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of a House Merchant Marine and Fisheries subcommittee, have asked Judge Holland to delay ruling on the settlement until the studies are made public.
 
'It's Made People Really Mad'
 "This is the big thing that caught everybody's attention," said Marilyn Leland, executive director of Cordova District Fishermen United, an association in Cordova, Alaska. "The state decides it is going to withhold the damage assessment data. We're the ones who bought this information the state says we can't get. We can't tell if the settlement is worth it because we don't know what the damages are. It's made people really mad."
Mr. Studds added: "The Federal and state governments and Exxon are essentially asking us to take on faith the fact this is a fair settlement. I hope it is. I would hate to see some of the procedures used in this case repeated elsewhere."
Native Alaskan villages are also seeking to bar the settlement in a District Court here. In February, the villagers filed suit against the Government, seeking to prevent the settlement from being signed. Lawyers for the native groups said the settlement would prevent the villagers from gaining damages from Exxon. District Judge Stanley Sporkin agreed to review the settlement and a hearing on the suit is scheduled for next Monday.
Exxon said through a spokesman today that it would not respond to questions about the settlement.
Amy Casner, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said, "We'll be addressing the court Wednesday and anything more we have to say we'll say there."

HEADLINE: Battle Lines Drawn in Sand As Las Vegas Covets Water

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS

 BODY:
This desert fantasy land of gambling casinos, lush lawns and fake lakes that is the fastest-growing major city in the United States will outstrip its water supplies by 1995 unless it soon finds new sources and conserves what it has.
Now Las Vegas is looking north to secure its future by harvesting water underneath vast, sparsely populated rural Nevada. The multibillion-dollar undertaking would pump water from an ancient aquifer in an area nearly as large as West Virginia and ship it south through more than 1,000 miles of pipelines. 
 Seventy years after the City of Los Angeles grabbed control of the water rights in the Owens Valley of California, with raw chicanery chronicled in the film "Chinatown," rural Nevadans say history is about to repeat itself. They fear that their land, like the Owens Valley, will become a dust bowl, its water diverted to build a vast city in an arid basin.
 
Reminder of Deeper Problem
 The move by Las Vegas exemplifies the growing problem of the West, where cities are beginning to confront limits to growth, limits set by the shortage of water, a commodity as scarce in the West as sun, land and optimism are plentiful.
The five-year drought that has gripped the Southwest has only hastened the day of reckoning that many experts said was inevitable. Four water districts in Southern California have stopped accepting new customers. Home construction in Lake Elsinore, a fast-growing city north of San Diego, has been halted, and many communities along the parched central coast of California have imposed limits on new water connections, as has Marin County north of San Francisco.
The angry accusations of a "water grab" by Las Vegas are being argued over four days ending Thursday as Las Vegas water officials hold a series of meetings around Nevada to explain why the city should have the water. It is a debate about the kind of growth wanted in the West, about whether water-profligate cities like Las Vegas deserve more water, and about fears that Las Vegas's thirst might destroy rare animal and bird species and wetlands hundreds of miles away.
"The way you hold on to the future in the West is to take control of the water -- that draws the political, economic and demographic landscape," said Stephen T. Bradhurst, a Reno planning consultant engaged by rural Nye County. Nye has formed an alliance with Lincoln and White Pine counties in Nevada, Inyo County in California and others to fight Las Vegas.
Southern Nevada's power in the State Legislature, and a state law that allows outside parties to claim any water not being used, give Las Vegas the upper hand in the dispute. But opponents hope that the complicated interests of the Federal Government, which owns the vast majority of land in the state, will push the issue into Federal courts, where Las Vegas may be at more of a disadvantage.
The Las Vegas Valley Water District, the agency that has applied for the new water, supplies most of the water in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. Leaders of the agency say that they only want to tap unused water that is replenished every year and that the continued prosperity of Las Vegas, the largest city in the fastest-growing state, is essential to all Nevadans. "If Southern Nevada dies, Nevada dies," said Patricia Mulroy, general manager of the water district.
 
An Odd Alliance Against Las Vegas
 In their opposition to Las Vegas, the state's ranchers and farmers have found themselves in an odd alliance with their traditional foes, environmentalists and Federal agencies. The state water engineer, R. Michael Turnipseed, who must approve the Las Vegas proposal, has received more than 3,600 protests from groups and individuals, including the National Park Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the Moapa Band of Paiute Indians and the Sierra Club.
Federal officials say the plan could endanger the Ash Meadows, Moapa Valley, Desert and Pahranagat Lakes national wildlife refuges, as well as the fragile life that clings to the 364 springs in Death Valley National Monument 125 miles away in California.
Paced by migrants from California and the East drawn by its desert climate and low prices, Clark County's population grew by an astonishing 62 percent between the 1980 and 1990 censuses, to 741,459 from 463,087. The newcomers have been wooed to this desert valley, which had only two inches of rain all last year, with water.
Until they were halted by a recent new law, developers used drinking water to build artificial lakes for new communities with names like The Lakes, Desert Shores and Lake Las Vegas, a resort with a 320-acre lake planned near Henderson that was approved before the moratorium. Seven miles west of the famed Strip, The Lakes development has a 30-acre lake, where residents of million-dollar homes even have a sailing club.
 
Torrents of Waste Flow Into Gutters
 Sprinklers send small rivers of water into the gutters daily all over Las Vegas. Acres of grass surround the new Citicorp Nevada building, a credit-card processing operation, on West Sahara Avenue. Huge sprinklers spray water during hot daylight hours into the air and, on a recent windy day, thousands of gallons drained into the streets. When questioned, Citicorp officials said they planned to replace half the lawn with desert plants soon.
Water is also the illusion that helps draw 20.3 million tourists a year to the gambling strip. The new $611 million Mirage Hotel, which describes itself as a "South Seas oasis," is set behind a 4.5-acre lagoon with 54-foot waterfalls and has a 1.3 million-gallon pool for its dolphins and a 20,000-gallon aquarium with more than 1,000 fish just behind the registration desk.
If it seems like water is wasted here, that is because it is dirt cheap. Until November, the district charged only 73 cents for 1,000 gallons. Last November, rates went up to 91 cents for the first 1,500 gallons a day and $1.01 above that, but even so water remains a huge bargain, less than a third of the $3.23 per 1,000 paid in Los Angeles.
Southern Nevada gets 80 percent of its water from Lake Mead, behind the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. Seven states draw water from the river, and this region's allotment of 300,000 acre-feet a year will be used up by 1995. (An acre-foot, 325,850 gallons, is about enough to supply two typical families for a year.) By achieving 20 percent conservation and returning treated effluent to Lake Mead, Ms. Mulroy of the water district said the region could get to the year 2006 -- but no further -- if present projections for population growth hold true.
The district has enraged rural Nevadans by applying to drill 146 wells in 28 basins in four counties, some nearly 300 miles away from Las Vegas. The district applied for 840,000 acre-feet a year, but says now it really expects about 200,000 acre-feet, enough to permit Las Vegas and its suburbs to double in population by the year 2030. Under Nevada law, unused water belongs to the state, and it can be appropriated by any party that can put it to "beneficial use." The district has at least 20 years to demonstrate that it can use the claimed water before losing it, meaning that others cannot take the water in the meantime.
"The growth of rural Nevada is dead now because of Las Vegas," said Richard L. Carver, a rancher in the Smoky Valley about 200 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Mr. Carver is also a Nye County Commissioner. He said Nye, with only about 17,000 people, was poised to develop industry and recreational businesses because of its proximity to California, but could not do so without adequate water.
 
Nightmare Images Of Growing City
 Further, he said, Las Vegas is plagued with intensifying urban problems of smog, traffic, drug gangs and the like. "How are they going to clean up and bring in another million people?" he asked. "Nobody in Las Vegas wants growth except the county commissioners and the gaming industry."
Ranchers and farmers across a vast region fear that the pumping will lower the water table. They say they have husbanded a precious resource for years and are appalled at the waste they see in Las Vegas. Hank H. Records, for one, homesteaded the Amargosa Valley 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas 41 years ago. Though Las Vegas has proposed no wells in the water-rich valley, geological studies show that water flows toward it through the aquifer into which the wells would be drilled.
"This is our livelihood," Mr. Records, now 73, said as he looked out over the flat valley toward the Funeral Mountains in California. "Why don't they stop those golf courses before they stop our fields of green?" he said. "Let them conserve a little bit."
Mr. Bradhurst, the Nye County consultant, said Las Vegas's contention that it needed the water to maintain the gaming and tourist industry was specious because only 8 percent of its water went to casinos and hotels. Well over 60 percent, he said, goes to watering lawns and golf courses. "So there is not a lot of water used to support people who gamble," Mr. Bradhurst said, adding that he thought Clark County wanted to create a "dead zone" around it.
 
Two Wests Collide: The Old and New
 Ms. Mulroy said that Las Vegas intended to harvest only a "safe yield" of perennial water -- meaning water that is replenished through rain and snow annually -- and that it intended to give some of it to the rural counties to help them develop. "They do not want that opportunity," she said. "They want to maintain a rural life style. This is forcing rural Nevada to address an issue they never wanted to address. We have a colliding of the new and old West."
She pointed to figures showing that agriculture uses 90.3 percent of water but produced only 6,010 jobs and $168 million in revenue per year, while the remainder of the economy, mainly tourism and gaming, used 9.7 percent of available water and produced 547,100 jobs and $19.4 billion in revenue. "We are not asking for it all; we are not touching the 90 percent," she said. Gaming and tourism, she went on, provide half the state Government's income, relieving Nevadans of paying income taxes and other burdensome levies. "They are biting that hand that feeds them," she said of the rural counties.
Stephen A. Wynn, chairman of the board of Golden Nugget Inc., which owns the Mirage Hotel, said this one hotel, with 7,200 employees, generated a larger payroll, $180 million a year, than all the ranching and farming in Nevada. Water, he said, provided the essential "tension" between fantasy and reality that made Las Vegas what it is. He said any restrictions that slowed hotel building would "put an imaginative damper on the future of the place."
It is 125 miles from the watery glitter of the Strip to Death Valley in California. The park lies at the southern end of the vast aquifer under Southern Nevada, whose waters generally flow south. While studies are not conclusive, the park's superintendent, Edwin L. Rothfuss, said he feared that if Las Vegas tapped the aquifer, water would stop flowing out of the springs there.
 
Will Death Valley Live Up to Name?
 Mel Essington, a park service geologist, took a visitor to Naverres Springs, a typical oasis in the searing valley. For about 200 feet, a trickle of water fills a narrow wash, supporting a vast array of desert life -- native palms, sage, arrow weed, bighorn sheep, bobcats and reptiles. "The situation is roughly analogous to a bathtub," he said. "You remove only a small amount of water, and it no longer flows over the edge."
Just across the border in Nevada is the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, where numerous seeps support 26 plants and animals found nowhere else in the world, including such endangered species as the Ash Meadows speckled dace, a fish, and the Devil's Hole pupfish, an inch-long fish whose entire population is found in one water hole. It is protected by a 1976 ruling by the United States Supreme Court. Douglas L. Threloff, a biologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, called it the "American version of the Galapagos Islands," an irreplacable laboratory for the study of evolution in harsh environments.
Ms. Mulroy said the district would stop pumping if it caused any environmental damage to Federal lands. But Federal officials, asking for an environmental impact study, have asked the state water engineer to postpone making a decision on the Las Vegas request for 18 months. If he does not grant the delay requested by the Federal officials, he is expected to hold hearings later this year before making a decision.

Two children stand on a rubble-strewn street in front of bricked-up houses. The big headline reads: "Whose Life, Whose Future?" A smaller headline accompanying a photograph of Margaret Thatcher, then the Prime Minister, reads: "She doesn't care for them. Do you?"
That front page tells a lot about The Daily Mirror, the 88-year-old mass-circulation tabloid newspaper that is the flagship of Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group P.L.C., whose holdings now include The Daily News in New York.
 
'Not Frightened of Anyone'
 The front page reveals the paper's deep disdain for Conservative governments, its penchant for the one-two punch and its unflinching embrace of crusade journalism. 
 "We are an aggressive, left-of-center, caring newspaper that is not frightened of anyone and that tells the truth, however unpalatable," said Richard Stott, editor of The Daily Mirror.
According to Mr. Maxwell, the paths of The Daily Mirror and The Daily News have converged in a "most uncanny" way. The Mirror was, according to Mr. Maxwell and others, the model for The Daily News. They share another link, Mr. Maxwell said: like The Daily News's founder, Joseph Medill Patterson, Mr. Maxwell is also "a socialist millionaire."
Mr. Stott is beginning his second stint as editor of The Daily Mirror, replacing Roy Greenslade, who left last month. In an interview that was granted only after Mr. Maxwell had approved it, Mr. Stott outlined his newspaper's editorial policy.
The editor said the paper was very pro-Europe. Mr. Stott also called the paper pro-royalty, which has something to do with the photo opportunities provided by the Princess of Wales. It is virtually alone among the British newspapers in calling for the British Army to leave Northern Ireland.
But The Daily Mirror's editorials oppose what the newspaper sees as the excesses of trade unionism. The paper is also vigorously against the Conservative Government's cutbacks in social spending, but it supports a nuclear deterrent.
Its political agenda and campaigning style is tempered by its devotion to soft features, like a recent long interview with the actor Mel Gibson.
"The whole secret of tabloid newspapers is a balance," Mr. Stott said, "between the heavy, the light, the funny and the sad." The Mirror's readers, the editor said, include a "fair smattering of people all the way up" the social scale. For the most part, however, its readers are members of the working class, albeit "the more liberal-minded ones as opposed to the red-necked ones who tend to read The Sun," Mr. Stott added, referring to the tabloid controlled by Rupert Murdoch. The Sun is The Mirror's chief rival.
While The Mirror may be the grandfather of the tabloids, Mr. Maxwell said The Daily News had little to learn from his British paper; rather, Mr. Maxwell said, The Daily Mirror could learn some things from the New York paper, like headline writing.
As for The Daily News, Mr. Maxwell said it was a "newspaper unique in the world" that needs "the unions to give it a chance." Editorially, he would like to see improved coverage of New York State government and the New York City boroughs. On the production front, he plans to make the same innovations at The Daily News that he made when he took charge of The Mirror, like high-quality color presses, machinery to insert supplements and regionalized advertising sections.
 
A Women's Publication
 When it was started in 1903 as a women's newspaper by the brothers Harold and Alfred Harmsworth, who later became Lord Rothermere and Lord Northcliffe, respectively, the editor of The Mirror was a woman and its title was chosen to appeal to women. Hand mirrors were given away as promotions.
A year later, Lord Northcliffe, having concluded from poor sales figures that "women can't write and don't want to read," made The Mirror a general-interest "picture newspaper."
In the 1930's, The Mirror was among the first of the Fleet Street newspapers to condemn the British Government's appeasment of Hitler. In the 1940's, the editorial director and chairman, Harry Guy Bartholomew, turned The Mirror into "the rather aggressive working-class paper" it is today.
By 1964, The Daily Mirror's circulation reached five million, but the paper's heyday was ending. In 1969, the International Publishing Corporation, owner of both The Daily Mirror and The Sun, sold The Sun to Mr. Murdoch, who captured the bottom of The Mirror's market, Mr. Stott said.
According to figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations, The Daily Mirror's average circulation for the period from last October to March was more than three million, off about 2.3 percent from October 1989 to March 1990. The circulation figures at The Sun had a shaper drop. While it continued to maintain its lead over The Mirror, The Sun's circulation in the October-March period averaged 3.77 million, down 4.8 percent from the similar period a year earlier.
Mr. Stott said The Mirror's "dark days" ended in 1986 when Mr. Maxwell, having acquired Mirror Group Newspapers from Reed International, P.L.C., the parent of International Publishing, sharply cut the work force and introduced color presses. When Mr. Maxwell bought The Mirror in 1984, Mr. Stott said, the profits of the Mirror Group from its London papers were about $1.4 million. For 1990, Mirror's pretax profits were £88.3 million, or about $170 million under year-end exchange rates.
Mr. Maxwell said last week that a 45 to 49 percent stake in the newspaper group, which also includes The Sunday Mirror and The Daily Record, would be offered to the public.
Geoffrey Goodman, a former assistant editor at The Mirror, credited Mr. Maxwell for making some necessary changes, but added that the newspaper had "lost its edge, its credibility, largely because of Mr. Maxwell," whom he accused of interfering with editorial policy.
Mr. Stott denied that Mr. Maxwell's involvement was interference. "All proprietors are involved in matters of high newspaper policy," he said, adding that Mr. Maxwell left day-to-day operations to him.
In a telephone interview last week, Mr. Greenslade, whom Mr. Stott replaced in March, said he had an agreement with Mr. Maxwell not to discuss "the reasons for his departure. He added, however: "I wasn't fired, and I didn't resign. I left by mutual agreement -- Robert Maxwell's mutual agreement."
Tony Loynes, publisher and editor of the UK Press Gazette, a trade weekly, said The Mirror might recapture the lead in the daily tabloid market. But, he added, "the public is so besieged with soft material" that The Mirror may have to reassess its balance of hard news and features.
As for Mr. Stott, he says that only a slightly more aggressive style is needed. It is not only a "newspaper for the 90's," as The Mirror's banner proclaims, Mr. Stott said, "it is a newspaper for well into the 21st century."

HEADLINE: Moynihan Accuses Bush Of Scare Ploy on Elderly

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan accused the White House today of trying to frighten the elderly as part of its strategy to defeat his proposed cut in the Social Security payroll tax.
The New York Democrat released copies of what he said was a White House briefing memorandum he received over the weekend outlining points for the measure's opponents to use when arguing against it in Congress. The Bush Administration contends that cutting the payroll tax would drain the Social Security trust fund. 
 "Senator Moynihan argues that his goal is to make the tax code more fair," the memorandum stated. "Don't be fooled by the rhetoric. He promises a tax cut today and forces a series of major tax hikes on tomorrow's workers and their employers. This is nothing more than a shell game with Social Security."
The two-page memorandum was attached to a sheet of stationery imprinted with the logo and heading of the President's Office of Management and Budget. Its contents, Senator Moynihan said, misrepresent his proposal for gradual tax cuts over the next six years. He says the proposal would save more than $160 billion for wage earners.
 
Obstacle to Consideration
 He predicted the Senate would quickly approve an amendment to allow his bill to be considered this session. A similar measure was defeated late last year when it fell six votes short of the 60-vote majority needed to consider any measure that results in a drop in revenue.
Since then, Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, has helped revive the measure by quietly changing the rules to allow the measure to be considered if it is approved with a simple majority.
The Administration and some leading members of Congress have opposed the plan, saying that it would bankrupt the Social Security system by 2005 and sharply increase the Federal deficit as soon as next year.
Mr. Moynihan defended his plan in a Capitol Hill news conference today, asserting that it would stabilize, rather than drain, Social Security surpluses that are now being used to mask the size of the Federal budget deficit. He said the White House strategy as detailed in the briefing memorandum was "pretty chilling, and not very seemly."
 
Charge and Countercharge
 "I mean, slash and burn is one thing," Senator Moynihan said. "But terrorizing and terrifying older people is another."
In response, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, "People have a right to be afraid of his scheme."
The memorandum, dated April 15, cites reports by the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office and the Treasury Department to support its contention that a payroll tax cut is a bad idea.
The Administration says in the memorandum that the economy would be hurt by the tax cut and that future generations would pay for any tax cuts that benefit their parents today.
It concluded that the Moynihan plan "delivers a weakened Social Security system whose future solvency depends on a series of tax hikes on working Americans and businesses."
"These large tax increases may not be sustainable," it continued. "So, cutting Social Security benefits for disabled Americans, retirees and their families may become the only alternative to insolvency."
Senator Moynihan said the measure would eventually win approval, even though its immediate future appears bleak. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, have opposed the tax cut proposal.
Mr. Moynihan said he did not know how he would overcome the force of such bipartisan opposition, adding: "And I don't know if I will be able to."
But he said election-year politics would change the outcome.

HEADLINE: Mobil Net Jumps 77.5% In Quarter

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, April 22

 BODY:
With huge profit increases in Europe and Asia resulting mainly from the Persian Gulf war, the Mobil Corporation said today that net income in the first quarter soared 77.5 percent, to $710 million, or $1.73 a share, from $400 million, or 94 cents a share.
Two other large oil companies also reported big gains for the period, but in their cases the increases came from financial procedures, not improvements in operations. Net income rose by 72.3 percent at the Amoco Corporation and by 25.9 percent at the Occidental Petroleum Corporation. 
 Ashland Oil Inc., a large refiner, said profits rose sharply, to $27 million, or 48 cents a share, from $913,000, or 2 cents a share, because costs for crude oil fell faster in the first three months than prices for refined products like gasoline and home heating oil.
 The reports provided the first detailed view of how varied oil industry profits were during the first quarter. In general, analysts expected that earnings from operations would be far stronger for refiners in Europe and Asia than in the United States.
Demand for kerosene, used by the allied military forces for jet fuel, kept Singapore refineries operating at high rates and, on some days, profits were more than double the level of refiners' costs. Mobil, for one, completed a major expansion of its Singapore refinery last year.
 
Plunge in Oil Prices
 But profits for exploration and recovery units were little changed worldwide because crude-oil prices, which started the year near $30 a barrel, plunged after the United States and its allies began bombing Iraq on Jan. 17.
Mobil said that during the quarter it was paid an average of $20.93 a barrel abroad and $17.18 in the United States for crude, compared with $19.68 and $18.30, respectively, in the corresponding period a year ago.
Chemical manufacturing operations were less profitable in the quarter than a year ago. Recession in the United States curbed profit margins, and costs for crude and other raw materials were higher than a year ago even though they declined throughout the quarter.
Bernard J. Picchi, managing director and senior oil analyst at Salomon Brothers, said the huge profit generated by international oil giants in Europe and Asia was a rare episode directly related to big military demands for jet fuel and diesel.
"Today, the international refining and marketing units are operating at a huge disadvantage" in those regions, he said. "Kerosene prices dropped by $20 a barrel in the last six to eight weeks. We calculate that 30 percent of the internationals' earnings has come and gone."
Following are the oil companies' results:
 
Mobil
The nation's second-largest oil company, after Exxon, said revenues rose 10.3 percent, to $16.58 billion, from $15.03 billion. International refining and marketing contributed most of the profit gain, with profits in that sector rising to $342 million, from $81 million a year ago. Worldwide profits for refining and marketing rose to $442 million, from $120 million.
Profits in exploration and production were little changed from the corresponding quarter last year, rising to $371 million from $369 million. Sales of natural gas fell 6 percent in the United States, but rose 9 percent worldwide because of increased buying and higher prices in Europe and Japan.
Allen E. Murray, the chairman of Mobil, which is based in New York, said that profit margins in refining had declined but remained strong. The profitability rates "should continue to support good earnings, although below first-quarter levels," he said. Mobil's shares fell 62.5 cents, to $67.75, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange today.
 
Amoco
The nation's fifth-largest oil company said it earned $803 million, or $1.60 a share, compared with $466 million, or 91 cents, in the period last year. Revenues of the Chicago-based company rose by 3.2 percent, to $7.3 billion, from $7.07 billion.
Nearly all of the higher profit came from a change in accounting methods, to Rule 96 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which allows companies to use a lower tax rate to determine the value of deferred taxes. Excluding that change and a restatement of last year's earnings, operating earnings rose 5.6 percent, to $492 million from $466 million.
Earnings from exploration and production declined, falling 11.7 percent in the United States and 9.5 percent abroad. Refining profits soared 65.9 percent, to $214 million from $129 million, and profits in chemicals fell slightly, to $85 million.
Amoco's shares gained 25 cents today, to $53.75, on the Big Board.
 
Occidental Petroleum
Net income was $136 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $108 million, or 37 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Revenues rose 2.7 percent, to $5.3 billion.
A $53 million tax reduction in the quarter accounted for most of the higher profits. It was the first use of a portion of the $1.74 billion in future tax benefits accumulated last year when Ray R. Irani, chairman and chief executive of the Los Angeles-based company, wrote off $2.17 billion in an extensive revamping of the company.
Excluding the lower tax provision and other factors, earnings from operations rose 1.5 percent, to $404 million, from $398 million. Profits in oil and gas production increased to $122 million, from $100 million; the natural-gas pipeline unit, had profits of $126 million, up from $94 million. But chemical earnings fell to $139 million, from $186 million.
Occidental's shares rose 25 cents, to $19.25, on the Big Board today.
 
Ashland Oil
Revenues of the refiner, based in Ashland, Ky., were essentially flat, at $2.05 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in the 1990 quarter. John R. Hall, chairman and chief executive, said profit margins increased during the quarter as costs for crude and other refining raw materials fell and the nation's stocks of gasoline fell to unusually low levels.
Mr. Hall said refining profits remained strong and were likely to improve "as we approach the driving season." Profits in the chemical unit rose 35 percent in the quarter, to $23 million, but earnings from oil exploration fell slightly, to $11 million.
Ashland's shares rose $1.625 today, to $34.50, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Council Agrees to a Delay Of Two Weeks for Budget

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
After a prolonged standoff, Mayor David N. Dinkins reached agreement with the City Council yesterday on a two-week delay in submitting a budget mapping plans to cut city services in the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
The City Charter requires the Mayor to submit his budget by this Friday. But after the state failed to pass its budget on time and as the Mayor confronted difficulties in making deep cuts in city spending, he sought a delay of a month. 
 After weeks of brinksmanship and 40 minutes of negotiation by the Mayor and Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, the Council agreed yesterday to pass a measure delaying the deadline but only for two weeks, until May 10.
The negotiation in delaying the deadline shows some of the political and practical difficulties the Mayor faces as he struggles to balance the city's budget this year and to close a gap of more than $3.1 billion in the $29 billion budget for the next fiscal year.
 
Possible Measures
 City officials acknowledge that they will soon report that the $3.1 billion gap has already worsened by at least $100 million. Outside analysts say the gap could grow by as much as $500 million, but the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, discounted that. 
Yesterday, city officials released a list of possible measures that could be used to close the gap of $465 million for the fiscal year that ends June 30, ranging from freezing spending to furloughing city workers. If the city cannot close the gap and ends the year with a deficit of more than $100 million, the State Financial Control Board could take control of the city's finances.
The $3.1 billion deficit for next year represents total increases in spending and reductions in revenue forecast since last November, when the city first conceded it was facing deep fiscal problems because of the recession.
City officials already have plans to close $2.2 billion of this gap, mainly through tax increases and service cuts, and they are developing plans to cut an additional $910 million in city services. But critics, including the Council Speaker, Mr. Vallone, have questioned whether the Dinkins administration will be able to carry out the ambitious program it has made public.
 
Meeting Postponed
 Others have questioned whether the administration is moving quickly enough to make the additional cuts needed to balance next year's budget. Yesterday, the budget director postponed a City Hall meeting called to review $910 million in cuts to give his staff more time to prepare documents outlining their recommendations.
While the administration believed it should be allowed a month's delay as a routine courtesy, Mr. Vallone at first refused to grant any delay, arguing that such a delay would only postpone difficult decision-making.
Behind the dispute is a simmering political rivalry between the two leaders at a time when Council districts are being withdrawn, as well as a complaint by Mr. Vallone that the administration was not doing enough to consult with the Council on its fiscal problems.
Yesterday, city officials gave more details about this year's budget gap after meeting with Standard & Poor's to discuss plans to sell about $1 billion in short-term notes to make up for delayed state aid payments.
In all, they listed nine options that could provide the city between $500 million and $700 million to close the gap. Included were delaying subsidies the city pays to outside entities, like the Transit Authority, and asking the Municipal Assistance Corporation to turn over some surplus funds to the city.

HEADLINE: REGULATORS PICK BUYER TO OPERATE NEW ENGLAND BANK

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
The Government today selected Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc., a Rhode Island banking company, along with Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the big corporate buyout concern, to buy the failed Bank of New England and two affiliated banks that collapsed in January.
L. William Seidman, the nation's senior banking regulator, said Fleet/Norstar's bid had been selected because it represented "the lowest cost" to the program that insures bank deposits. Officials acknowledged that as part of the deal, Fleet, which has a comparatively healthy capital base for a Northeast bank, would have to raise money to satisfy Federal regulations on its financial health.
 
Outlay of $5 Billion
 Mr. Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, also said the bailout would require an initial outlay of about $5 billion from the bank fund and would ultimately cost the sharply deteriorating fund that insures deposits as much as $2.5 billion. 
 Some of the initial outlay will need to be borrowed from the Treasury, Mr. Seidman said, because the bank fund is running so low. It had $8.4 billion at the end of 1990 after deductions for expected Bank of New England losses.
The takeover of the Bank of New England was the third-largest Government rescue in history, one that had been expected to cost about $2.3 billion ultimately. The 1988 collapse of the Republicbank Corporation of Dallas is expected to cost $2.9 billion, and the 1989 failure of Mcorp, also of Dallas, has been projected to amount to $2.7 billion.
 
Branches in Several States
 Fleet, which is based in Providence, has banks in several Northeast states including New York, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine. It has no banking institutions in Massachusetts, where the Bank of New England is based. Besides its flagship bank in Boston, the Bank of New England owns the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company of Hartford and the Maine National Bank of Portland.
The bidding for the Bank of New England was hotly contested because the bank represented a potentially lucrative banking territory once its loan portfolio was stripped of its worst loans. Also, the bank's fate has become a focal point in Washington as it has become apparent that the industry may ultimately need to rely upon taxpayer money to continue to operate successfully.
On Capitol Hill, the collapse and rescue of the Bank of New England, once the region's second-largest banking company, after the Bank of Boston Corporation, has heightened the sensitivity of lawmakers to the deteriorating condition of the bank insurance fund and has raised questions about the adequacy of the Government's supervision of banks. In the financial community, it has also prompted new concerns about the stability of the banking system.
A controversial proposal in the Bush Admistration's plan to strengthen the industry would permit industrial enterprises to own banks. While Kohlberg, Kravis is not expected to manage the Bank of New England, the fact that it controls such companies as RJR Nabisco recently prompted Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, to urge regulators to reject the Fleet/Norstar bid, with which it is a partner.
Kohlberg, Kravis is also the most visible of the powerful New York concerns that came to be identified with the corporate buyout binge in the 1980's. Much of its money comes from pension funds and its takeovers have included Safeway Stores as well as the Beatrice Companies. Henry Kravis, its most prominent partner, is a highly visible financier and philanthropist in Manhattan.
Fleet edged out bids from the Bank of Boston and the Bank of America, the San Francisco-based bank that is the nation's second largest. Citicorp is the country's largest banking company.
 
Widely Admired by Bankers
 Fleet, which merged with Norstar Bancorp of Albany in 1988, was widely admired by bankers and analysts during the 1980's because of its strategy of diversifying into areas many banks did not enter, like servicing home mortgages; factoring, which provides credit to merchandise suppliers, and consumer finance. J. Terrence Murray, 50, who is Fleet's chairman, president and chief executive, led the company's expansion, fashioned the Norstar merger and has built a bank that has successfully held down costs and generated profits.
At the end of last year, Fleet/Norstar had about $33 billion in assets, ranking it among the nation's top 25 banks.
In 1990, however, it stumbled, and reported a $48.5 million loss. The loss reflected the weakness of the Northeastern economy, which caused problems for its borrowers.
Some analysts said the selection of Fleet was a vote of confidence by bank regulators in the eventual recovery of the New England economy. But other experts said the Bank of Boston's bid was probably not chosen because of concerns about that bank's ability to operate with the capital needed to absorb the Bank of New England. Mr. Seidman said all of the bidders were qualified.
 
Scrutiny by Congress
 The deal proposed today will almost inevitably be scrutinized by members of Congress, who in a series of hearings have already been exploring the Bank of New England failure, charging that regulators moved too slowly to head off its collapse.
"The perspective that has to be applied is not who gets what, but who gets socked," said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa and a member of the House Banking Committee. "The real issue is just how much it's going to cost the taxpayer."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said tonight: "I am pleased that at least a bank in our region has prevailed. Massachusetts and New England are still in the grip of a painful credit crunch, and I urge the new owners to move as rapidly as possible to extend credit to strong firms and shore up our depressed economy."
Under the deal, the F.D.I.C. will receive $100 million in preferred stock from the new banking company and $25 million in cash from the purchasers. The insurance corporation will also purchase another $50 million in preferred stock of the Bank of New England.
 
$683 Million in New Funds
 The transaction requires Fleet to raise $400 million in new funds and Kohlberg, Kravis to raise an additional $283 million. The $683 million will be injected into both the Bank of New England and Fleet. Officials said that without the additional funds, Fleet would not be in compliance with Federal regulations on its own capital.
The deal gives Fleet three years to return to the Government all but about $1 billion of the assets that it has acquired. Mr. Seidman estimated that ultimately about $5.5 billion in assets, most of which are nonperforming or troubled loans, would not be held by Fleet.
Analysts said the deal was structured to give the winning bidder one of the healthiest banks in New England. Shortly after the bank was seized, the Government decided to hold onto the bad assets, including nonperforming commercial and consumer loans. The winning bidder will receive a fee to manage and sell these assets.
 
Corporation Not Involved
 The announcement today did not involve the Bank of New England Corporation, the company that had controlled the banks until January, when they were seized by the Government. Shortly after the regulators took control of the banks, the holding company filed for protection from its creditors in Federal Bankruptcy Court.
Mr. Seidman said that Kohlberg, Kravis, which will own about 15 percent of the Bank of New England, would be a "passive investor." He said the firm had assured regulators that it would not exert control over the bank's operations.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said the decision to rely on Kohlberg, Kravis demonstrated that "regulators are reaching out to nontraditional sources for new bank capital."
In 1989, Kohlberg, Kravis made an unsuccessful bid for Mcorp, the second-largest bank in Texas, but lost out to the Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio.
The announcement of the winning bid for the bank had been scheduled for Wednesday. Mr. Seidman said the F.D.I.C. decided to make the announcement today, shortly after the winner was selected, because of concerns that the decision might be leaked to the press.
 
Fall Began in 1980's
 The fall of the Bank of New England began in the 1980's, as it aggressively expanded its lending for office buildings, hotels, shopping malls and condominiums that could not pay back their loans when the New England economy collapsed. Today it has $16 billion in assets and 320 branches in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine.
The Bank of New England seizure also marked one of the increasing number of instances in which the Government justified protecting all depositors, including those with accounts larger than $100,000. In exercising the "too big to fail" approach, Government officials said they had averted a possible ripple effect that would likely have brought down other institutions in the economically shaky region.
An investor group led by Marco F. DeSalle, an executive in Portland, Me., who is a former banker, offered to buy the smallest of the three banks offered for sale, the failed Maine bank, which has $1 billion of assets.
In the Senate, the resistance of regulators to a request for Government documents about their handling of the Bank of New England matter has led the chairman of the Senate banking committee, Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, to delay the confirmation proceeding for Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency and the primary regulator of all nationally chartered banks, to a second term.

HEADLINE: Birth Control Safer Than Unprotected Sex

BYLINE: By PHILIP HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
Contrary to popular opinion, using birth control is safer and healthier than not using it, according to a report released today.
"The average woman who has ever used the pill is less likely to get cancer and die as a result before age 55 than a woman who has never used the pill," the report said. 
 When the risk of death is set against deaths prevented, using contraception, including the pill, saves 120 to 150 lives per 100,000 women, the report said. Contraception also prevents about 1,500 hospitalizations per 100,000 women per year, it said.
Figures published today by the Alan Guttmacher Institute indicate that on balance the protective effects of contraception -- including prevention of at least two kinds of cancer, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease and, of course, the health hazards of pregnancy -- far outweigh the danger of its side effects.
 
Doubt Over Breast Cancer
 The only doubtful case is that of breast cancer. Over all, it appears that the pill prevents breast cancer. But some studies have shown that women in their 30's and early 40's who have used the pill for many years may have an increased incidence of cancer. At the same time, women in their late 40's and early 50's who have been long-term users have fewer breast cancers than those who have never used the pill.
The Guttmacher report, a 129-page statistical picture of contraception in America, says that on balance, other methods also protect against disease. Use of spermicides and barrier methods like the condom and diaphragm prevent cervical cancer and pelvic inflammatory disease.
"One reason this book is important," said Dr. Jacqueline Forrest, vice president for research at the institute, "is that Americans, both men and women, seem to have a lot of misinformation about the effectiveness and the safety of methods. Most think using no method is safer than using a method, but the data show it's the reverse. The riskiest thing to do for your health, if you are sexually active, is to use no method."
Dr. Forrest said that in a 1985 random survey of 1,500 men and women by the Gallup Organization, 58 percent incorrectly thought that taking the pill was more dangerous than giving birth, and 23 percent incorrectly thought the risks were about the same.
The Guttmacher Institute is a private, nonprofit organization specializes in research on contraception, and this report is the first of its kind since the institute published a more limited version of the statistics in 1983.
Nine of 10 women who are 20 to 44 years old are sexually active, the study said, and three-quarters have had sex in the last three months. But most of these sexually active women, about two-thirds, are trying to avoid pregnancy and many are failing. Of the six million pregnancies in the United States annually, about 57 percent are unintended.
The book also lists the latest count, from 1988, of what contraceptives are most widely used. About 35 percent of women capable of becoming pregnant depend on sterilization, either their own or their partner's, while 28 percent take the pill, 13 percent use condoms, 10 percent use no method at all, 5 percent use diaphragms, 4 percent use withdrawal or periodic abstinence such as the rhythm method, and fewer than 2 percent use the intrauterine device.
The methods vary greatly in effectiveness. In the first year of sexual activity, 85 percent of women using no method become pregnant. With periodic abstinence, depending on how consistently it is used, 14 to 19 percent of women become pregnant in one year. Using condoms, 10 to 18 percent become pregnant. Using diaphragms or cervical caps, 12 to 39 percent become pregnant. Using a sponge containing spermicide, 16 to 52 percent become pregnant.
The most effective methods are the pill, with a pregnancy rate of 4 percent to 9 percent; intrauterine devices, 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent; sterilization and vasectomy, 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent; injectable contraceptives, about 0.4 percent, and implants, the most effective, with a pregnancy rate of 0.05 percent to 0.5 percent.
The report notes that some women have higher risks than average when using some methods, and those women should avoid using the riskier methods. For example, the pill should not be used by women 35 and older who smoke more than 15 cigarettes a day, or women 25 and older who smoke 25 cigarettes a day, because of a higher risk of heart disease or blot clots.
The report is available for $22 from the Alan Guttmacher Institute, 111 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10003.

HEADLINE: After the Ghetto

 BODY:
The ghetto, many Americans have come to believe, is forever. Frightened by crime and frustrated by seemingly intractable poverty, they grope for answers and settle for racial stereotypes: To give "them" welfare is to pour money down a rat hole . . . "They" are crime-prone and lazy . . . "They" know only childish instant gratification like sex and drugs . . .
These rationales proceed from profound ignorance, presuming that poor blacks somehow want the danger and squalor of central city enclaves. Blacks want to escape the ghetto. Indeed, thousands are succeeding. 
 The black movement outward noted by William Julius Wilson during the 70's continued in the 80's. Studies of 12 major metropolitan areas by Kathryn Nelson, an economist at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, show that better-off black families have been streaming out of the poorest central city areas.
The outmovement leaves behind an ever more concentrated distillation of misery. Even so, the lesson is powerfully positive: the ghetto is not a hopeless, unchanging fact of urban life. If comfortable citizens can only come to see how much even the poorest blacks want to escape, America can start making the ghetto disappear.
 That's why two new books, coincidentally published within weeks of each other, possess such a potential punch. Taken together, they have the power to educate America.
One is "The Promised Land," by Nicholas Lemann, an ambitious analysis of the tidal changes brought by the northward movement of black sharecroppers from the cotton fields of the South. The other is "There Are No Children Here," by Alex Kotlowitz, an intimately illuminating look at one such family in Chicago.
As Mr. Lemann's book shows, the useful word is not "blacks" but black sharecroppers. They lived for most of a century in conditions not much different than slavery. Just as the agricultural underpinning of their lives disappeared in the rural South, so did the manufacturing jobs that drew them to the North. Cotton-picking poverty soon turned into welfare poverty, in harsh ghettos of public housing.
Where this historical analysis addresses the head, Alex Kotlowitz's story informs the heart. His meticulous portrait of two boys in a Chicago housing project shows how much heroism is required to survive, let alone escape.
No less anxiously than Israelis or Saudis under Scud missile attacks, streetwise students in the projects slide off their chairs and huddle under their desks "when the powerful sounds of .357 Magnums and sawed-off shotguns" echo off the school walls.
On a rare trip downtown to see Christmas windows, Pharoah, one of the brothers, is amazed, first off, by the sight of clean window glass. One day, Pharoah, then 11, told a friend: " 'I worry about dying, dying at a young age, while you're little. . . . I want to get out of the 'jects.' "
Pharoah struggles to succeed in school, in spelling bees, in Upward Bound. He may yet find a future and a way out. Meanwhile others, no less than he, want a future; want a way out.
Will power alone hoists few bootstraps, and more children are born daily into lives short of either will or hope. But that's no justification for Americans to recoil in resignation and despair. Society knows a hundred ways to break down the ghetto walls.
Program after program shows that young women can be taught to defer childbearing until they are old enough to manage. Government knows how to give their babies a fair chance and a Head Start. Law enforcement knows how to search out the .357 Magnums and contain the violence that terrifies neighborhoods.
Most important, society knows how to capitalize on people's determination, given half an opportunity, to work, scratch and squeeze their way into the mainstream.
 The poor may always be with us, but it is not inevitable that so many poor black people, rooted in the same rural culture, must be herded into the same bullet-pocked projects. One day, all black Americans who want to will disperse themselves into the general population, just as many are doing now. One day the ghetto will be gone, and America's children, black and white, will look up and ask us: Why? What took so long?

HEADLINE: Why Economy Pinches the College-Educated

 BODY:
To the Editor:
One cannot help feeling sorry for Julia Carlisle ("Young, Privileged and Unemployed," Op-Ed, April 4). Unfortunately, she is just one representative of a generation of college graduates who have been marginalized by our educational system. 
 The stress we, as a nation, have laid on a college education as a passport to a better life has had consequences that will haunt all of us for years to come.
A college education was always oriented to a career in the service sector -- law, medicine, banking, management, accounting and teaching. On the other hand, a good high school education was mainly a preparation for a trade career.
After World War II there was a vast demand for service professionals, as the American economy shifted to a service orientation. However, the stress on service careers siphoned people off from careers in industrial production. A career in trade or industry was regarded as a badge of inferiority, decreasing the supply of skilled workers and raising production costs.
But the demand for service skills had to dwindle as the service economy matured, at the same time that demand for skilled workers had to increase. Ms. Carlisle and others have now become expendable.
As college costs increase and our high schools deteriorate, we should begin to reallocate our dwindling resources to a rejuvenation of skilled work by increasing funds for high schools and vocational training, at the same time substantially raising academic standards at the college level, as suggested by W. Ann Reynolds, the new chancellor of City University.
This may have the salutary effect of providing the country with tomorrow's producers, who can build and maintain, for example, a videocassette recorder or even a decent automobile. The imbalance between supply and demand in the service sector will not soon abate, but better high schools and vocational training may restore the standing of the blue-collar worker to what it was before World War II. It may also keep a lot of unqualified time servers out of college classrooms.

Reagan Youth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
If I had to depend on your occasional "Voices of a New Generation" series for a glimpse into the minds of those younger than 30, I would write off the whole lot as incapable of harboring an honest thought (let alone an original one). This series seems devoted to the complaints of well-heeled Reagan youth. 
 Julia Carlisle's "Young, Privileged and Unemployed" (April 4) is a case in point. Ms. Carlisle was recently laid off as a news writer for CBS, and her article attempts to document her generation's suffering in the corporate purges of the 1990's. In one of the less comic passages she states: "We worked hard and we feel we deserved something. But we've learned an awful, preposterous truth -- that we are expendable."
Like every New Yorker, Ms. Carlisle walks past 10 to 20 people a day begging for money for something to eat; that it would suddenly dawn on her that people are expendable is a crime against maturity. What suddenly dawned on her is that she's expendable.
I do not wish to mock Ms. Carlisle; my beef is with you. If you are truly interested in publishing distinctly young perspectives, you'll have to dig deeper.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
On Horse Farms, a Season of Distress Lingers

SERIES: Hard Times In the Bluegrass - First of two articles.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ky.

 BODY:
It is springtime in Kentucky, less than two weeks before the superstars of thoroughbred racing meet in the 117th Kentucky Derby, and as always there is excitement in the air and splendor in the bluegrass. But it is also reckoning time in Kentucky, and there is also trouble in the air and bankruptcy in the bluegrass.
As many as 150 of the 400 horse farms in central Kentucky are for sale. The cash flow at most of the others has been dragging for five years. The great stallion Nijinsky, reigning at Claiborne Farm at the advanced age of 24, fetches a $150,000 breeding fee instead of the $450,000 he once commanded. And princes from Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf emirates, who spent $250 million in the 1980's at the Keeneland sales here, have stopped spending big money to buy American horses for breeding and racing. 
 "We were in a fairyland and rolling in the 1980's, and now we're paying the price," said D. Wayne Lukas, the most successful trainer of horses in modern times and one of the major figures in the market. "The horse business was like oil and real estate. The banks were willing to lend; people were pouring in off the street to borrow and breed and sell horses. Guys came along and said, 'How long has this been going on?'
"Everybody had this false sense of security. You were certain you could always get your money back."
But as the decade ended, many people had learned that they couldn't get their money back. And now, the most startling sign of the times for the thoroughbred industry is this: Calumet Farm, for decades the reigning symbol of success in the horse business, is mired in debt, and racing people openly wonder if it is going broke.
Once the home of champions like Bull Lea, Citation, Coaltown and Whirlaway, Calumet Farm was among the biggest spenders in the big-spending years of the 1980's. Among its purchases were two stallions whose total price tag came to $55 million and who failed to return even a fraction of the investment.
Calumet officials deny that the farm will be forced into bankruptcy. Yet it has between $65 million and $75 million in outstanding mortgages; it recently sold 60 horses and 77 acres of land to raise money, and it executed a change in command two weeks ago when J. T. Lundy resigned as president and John T. Ward Jr. took charge.
Bertha Wright, the matriarch of the Calumet empire and the mother-in-law of Lundy, came out of what she called "a family meeting" at the farm the other day and said in a telephone interview: "I'd like the world to know we're standing together. It's an uphill course, but we're working on it. We're trying to see if we can work as a family together."
One stark indicator of the state of the horse industry was the January 1991 sale here at the Keeneland track, whose auctions produced an amazing run-up in the price of horses in the mid-1980's. This January, 1,384 horses were auctioned at an average price of $16,050, and only two went home with Arab royalty.
Three years ago, the average price was more than $50,000. And horse people have no trouble remembering the day in July six years ago when Warner Jones, who is based at Churchill Downs, the Louisville home of the Derby, sold the yearling Seattle Dancer at Keeneland to British buyers for $13.1 million.
"We went to the Keeneland horse sale in January," said Lyle Robey, Calumet's lawyer and the chairman of the Kentucky State Racing Commission. "We brought 96 horses to sell. We figured to get $15 million that week. But the very day we put them up at auction, the air war in the Middle East broke out.
"How's that for timing? It put a brake on the horse business. Calumet went home with only $6 million and with 30 horses nobody bought."
 
Gambling Glut
 In addition to war and recession, the thoroughbred industry has been under growing pressure from various other forms of legal gambling, from the new casinos in Atlantic City, to the exposion in state lotteries, to the latest gimmick, riverboat casinos.
On top of all that, the bloodstock business suffered a series of setbacks in the last two years when several elite stallions died unexpectedly within months of one another. They were an all-star team: Alydar, 15 years old and still going strong; Secretariat, racing's superstar; Roberto, Fappiano and Northern Dancer, the senior hero of the breeding business.
When he died, Alydar was being bred 70 to 80 times a year at fees ranging up to $250,000 and generating close to $20 million a year in business for his owner: Calumet Farm.
The result of all these factors has been a general losing streak for the industry, and it shows no sign of letting up.
"We still haven't hit bottom," said Seth Hancock, president of the Claiborne Farm, long renowned as a leader in the breeding business. "We're maybe 20 percent from reaching the bottom. It's a time of great change. We really don't know where we're going in this business."
"There's a cash-flow problem in all horse farms," Robey said. "Every one of them has a cash problem."
"There certainly is a great malaise," said John Gaines, longtime master of the scientific breeding farm Gainesway. "The breeding industry has never been an economically sound investment, and never will be. If you take the total purses and divide them by the total number of horses, you come up with a number that doesn't even pay their training bills."
 
Back on the Farm
Before the Betting, Foals Are Born
Horse racing may be a way of life or a livelihood or maybe just a $2 bet, but it draws nearly 60 million people to tracks in 36 states every year. They bet $10 billion a year, and $3.5 billion more is bet at offtrack parlors.
"Everything starts and ends at the parimutuel window," Gaines said.
But in fact the business really starts on the horse farms, where 48,000 foals are born each year.
Situated primarily in five counties in central Kentucky, the farms stretch for hundreds of acres behind white or brown board fences along the Paris Pike and Iron Works Road, in elegant country towns like Lexington and Paris and Versailles. But Calumet is not the only great horse farm to have been transformed in the last 10 years.
 
Series of Sales
 Spendthrift, once the home of the stallions Nashua, Seattle Slew and Affirmed, went public and sold stock to raise money. Gainesway was sold two years ago to Graham Beck of South Africa. Elmendorf Farm, owned for more than 30 years by Maxwell Gluck, was sold after his death six years ago to Jack Kent Cooke, owner of the Washington Redskins football team, but has never approached its past rank as a major winner.
The Bunker Hunt holdings were dispersed after the Hunts got into financial straits over dealings in the silver market. North Ridge Farm was sold by Franklin Groves after he suffered other losses in other business. Hamburg Place, for generations a family breeding and racing farm, was leased out by Preston Madden.
The future of the Darby Dan Farm became uncertain after a series of real-estate reversals that wiped out the $250 million fortune of the Galbreath family.
But the slide has been the steepest for Calumet.
That farm was established as a thoroughbred farm in the 1930's by Warren Wright after he had sold his family's Calumet Baking Company for $60 million during the Depression. He took a giant stride forward one day in August 1939 when he and his wife invited a celebrated Midwest trainer to breakfast at the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
Warren Wright said, "We want you to be our trainer."
Lucille Wright said, "We want to win the Kentucky Derby."
The trainer, Plain Ben Jones, said, "O.K."
The Wrights didn't have to wait long. In 1941, Calumet not only had a Derby winner but also a Triple Crown champion after Whirlaway also took the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes. Three years later, Pensive won the Derby. And four years later, Citation swept the Triple Crown with the legendary Eddie Arcaro on his back. More Derby winners followed: Ponder in 1949, Hill Gail in 1952, Iron Liege in 1957 and Tim Tam in 1958.
 
After Bull Lea
 Jones set the stage for this runaway success by buying Bull Lea as a yearling in 1940 and later sending him to the breeding barn to help establish an empire. Citation was Bull Lea's son, as were Hill Gail and Iron Liege. Bull Lea became the No. 1 sire, Calumet the No. 1 farm. At its peak, the farm won eight Kentucky Derbies, two Triple Crowns and hundreds of stakes races.
Warren Wright died in 1952, leaving the farm's fortunes to his wife, Lucille. When she died in 1982 the farm passed to her daughter-in-law, Bertha Wright, and her four children. Mrs. Wright then named son-in-law J.T. Lundy as president.
Some horse people say that Lundy headed the farm back toward its old success; others say he became part of the problem, not the solution.
Either way, he was there as the bloodstock market took its tumble. When he left two weeks ago, he said only: "I'd rather be out of it. I'd rather have a little peace and quiet."
 
Uneasy Analysis
Calumet Magnified General Malaise?
 Why did the bloodstock business, including that at Calumet, plunge in the last half-dozen years?
"It seems to me every business is on its back, and the breeding business is one of them," Hancock said. "Nobody knows what's real. Five or six years from now, people may be saying, 'Remember when Roger Clemens was making $5 million a year?'
"We're also facing challenges for the entertainment dollar: riverboat gambling, casino gambling, offtrack betting parlors, state lotteries. Someday you'll be able to sit home and flip on cable Channel 103 and get Aqueduct and make your bets."
But one of the top executives in the racing business, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, said that Calumet's downfall may have been caused by more than just a bad economy or increasing competition from other gambling enterprises.
"You have to ask how a farm with the richest land in Kentucky and the richest record of success in the past and with three Eclipse Awards last year, how could a farm like that get leveraged into $75 million in debt," he said. "You have to ask if it was mismanaged."
Other racing people suggested that Calumet had yielded to the mania of the 1980's and overspent for horses that did not produce. The farm spent $30 million to buy Mogambo and $25 million to buy Secreto as stallions.
"But both horses bombed sensationally," another racing executive said. "That was a $55 million investment totally out of character for Calumet. They traditionally bred their own, like Alydar, bred and raced by Calumet and a great sire. Vintage Calumet.
"In the 80's, they got into the same swivet as the come-latelies, and their race production fell to zilch. The factory turned out the foals, but the foals never won. And the overhead expenses continued. They were honest mistakes. But that's management. It's like oil. Everybody was punching holes in the ground in Texas and Oklahoma, too."
The questions about Calumet's management have led to speculation on Lundy's departure as farm president earlier this month. Lundy did not respond to several telephone requests for an interview, but Robey, Calumet's lawyer, denied that he had been forced out of his job because of the farm's financial problems.
"J.T. wasn't shaken out," he said. "He was just burned out. This is a farm that won three Eclipse Awards last year. The farm was voted breeder of the year, and Criminal Type was voted best older horse and horse of the year. Yes, Calumet took out a mortgage last year, but compare it to the value of the assets. Yes, Calumet lost money last year. But there's no bankruptcy.
"Calumet Farm is sitting on 800 or 900 acres of prime land across the road from the Lexington Airport and next to Keeneland, bounded on three sides by four-lane highways. It's a highly valuable resource. If the economy goes to hell, Calumet is still a farm. The family has no desire to change it or to lose it."
 
A Safer Route
Claiborne Strategy Looks Wise Now
Robey and many other horse people see broader reasons for the financial plunge on the farms.
"First, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 wasn't reform," he said. "It was a tax penalty act. It took away incentives in depreciating horse and in capital gains.
"Second, no effort was made by the Commerce Department to influence the Japanese and Arabs to come in and do business. Trade embargos were applied by the Japanese on purchasing our horses.
"Third, the recession. It happened, and the money just wasn't there.
"And fourth, the war in the Middle East. It kept the Arabs home, and it made everybody wary."
But there are many farms that are weathering the financial storm. And many people in horse country point to Claiborne Farm as the best example.
"They didn't strain to find studs," said one racing executive. "They used homebreds. They dealt with the same customers as in generations past. They didn't try to compete with the Arabs in the marketplace. They didn't finance."
"I'm a conservative person," Seth Hancock of Claiborne said. "If the boom of the 1980's had kept going, I'd have been left in the dust. But it didn't."
 Next: Selling racing to the public.

HEADLINE: Net Off 14.4% At Monsanto

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, April 23

 BODY:
The Monsanto Company reported today that it had a 14.4 percent drop in first-quarter net earnings, in part because of the recession's effect on its chemical business.
The company reported net earnings of $166 million, or $1.31 a share, on revenue of $2.22 billion in the three months ended March 31. A year ago, Monsanto said it earned $194 million, or $1.47 a share, on revenue of $2.29 billion. The company's stock rose by $1.125, to $62.75, on the New York Stock Exchange today. 
 "Given a much weaker U.S. economy compared with a year ago, we expected that we would have a tough time matching last year's first-quarter earnings," said Richard J. Mahoney, Monsanto's chairman and chief executive.
He said that although the chemical unit's results suffered during the first quarter, strong showings in other businesses and the company's cost-control efforts made him confident that year-end earnings would exceed last year's.
The company also makes pesticides and animal feed supplements, owns a pharmaceutical subsidiary and sells Nutrasweet, an artificial sweetener.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The 'No Regrets' Greenhouse Fix

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE latest word on the greenhouse effect, from a National Academy of Sciences panel headed by Daniel Evans, a former Governor of Washington, will surely not be the last. But the panel's report, somnolently titled "Policy Implications of Global Warming," is surely a breakthrough -- the first to bridge the canyon between alarmist science and what-me-worry economics.
The academy's synthesis can be summed up briefly as concluding that human adaption to warmer weather will likely be relatively painless. Outlined in 113 reader-friendly pages, the argument won't quite convince end-of-nature types to bed down with those looking forward to palm trees in Buffalo. Still, it is a safe bet that the report's approach, which one Bush Administration analyst dubbed a "no regrets" policy, will carry the establishment's imprimatur for some time to come. 
 Reduced to its journalistic essence, "no regrets" goes something like this:
Atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, CFC refrigeration chemicals) are rising rapidly; projecting current trends, concentrations will be double their pre-industrial level by the year 2050. That virtually guarantees the planet will trap more solar energy and the earth will grow warmer.
But the plausible range of temperature change is as little as 2 degrees Fahrenheit to as much as 9. And even if the figure could be pinned down, it would not tell us much about the ensuing environmental and economic damage or the difficulty of adaptation. In agriculture, for example, hard-to-predict shifts in rainfall are likely to have far greater consequences than the direct effect of hotter summers.
Gradual weather change would probably prove only an expensive headache for humans. Tens of millions of Americans, after all, have coped with far more dramatic shifts in their voluntary move to the Sun Belt. But there is some possibility of discontinuous, catastrophic change -- for example, a huge release of methane from the melting Arctic tundra that turned the cornfields of Iowa into a desert in a single generation. And there is little doubt that thousands of marine and plant species would be decimated by even a gradual warming.
What to do? The panel's "no regrets" strategy starts with emissions-reducing initiatives that would pay for themselves in greater economic efficiency. High on this list is energy conservation for buildings, vehicles and industrial processes.
But the panel, which included experts ranging from Stephen Schneider, a Government climatologist, to William Nordhaus, a Yale economist, would go further, buying a little insurance against an unexpectedly rainy (or, more likely, a very dry) day. This would surely include spending money to develop greenhouse-benevolent energy technologies that will be on the shelf and relatively affordable if they are needed. And it would probably also include reducing greenhouse emissions where there are only modest net costs. Prime targets: an accelerated phase-out of CFC's, which are damaging the ozone layer as well as warming the planet; a big effort to save tropical rain forests, which support diverse life forms as well as storing carbon.
"No regrets" looks like good politics as well as good policy. While every politician wants a piece of the righteous turf on this biggest of all environmental causes, few are eager to ask the voters to take the bus to work or shiver in their sweaters until the dangers are much clearer. But the approach may not prove as uncontroversial as it first appears.
Much of the energy-saving that the panel believes would pay for itself would require a fairly heavy regulatory hand. The report, for example, calls for higher mileage standards for cars -- a move the Bush Administration has already declared to be veto bait. One must wonder, too, how the idea of testing a new generation of nuclear reactors would appeal to Congress.
But the panel's most problematic recommendations may be those it treats most lightly: the imperative for international cooperation. At very least that translates as aggressive support for population control in the third world. But it could also take money -- lots of money -- to induce poor countries to think greenhouse when they think economic development.
China, for example, now emits just 7 percent of the greenhouse gas created by human activity. But it emits six times as much the United States per dollar's worth of G.N.P. and a remarkable 18 times as much as Japan. Thus if Chinese living standards ever approach those of the West without radical improvements in energy efficiency and a technological overhaul of agriculture, the greenhouse game will be as good as lost.

HEADLINE: Bank Funds And C.D.'s Are Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts were down for the eighth straight week, but the declines in the week ended yesterday were not as large as those in the previous week.
Analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor, say the end of the recession is still not in sight, as savings yields continue to fall, particularly for certificates of deposit. 
 Yields on C.D.'s with shorter maturities are falling at a faster pace than those with maturities of more than one year, the analysts said. Big Yields Are Harder to Find
Also, the number of banks and savings institutions with a one-year certificate that yields 7 percent or more has dwindled to 13, from 19 the previous week, making longer maturities more attractive, analysts said.
At the Treasury's weekly auction on Monday, the average discount rates rose, after three straight weeks of decline. The results of the bill auction often indicate what many banks may eventually pay on money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
The rate on three-month bills increased by 12 basis points, to 5.69 percent, and the six-month bills rose a similar amount, to 5.79 percent, its highest since the beginning of the month. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In The Bank Rate Monitor's weekly survey of the New York area, the declines in yield were similar at the commercial banks and the savings insitutions.
The largest yield changes in the New York area this week were recorded at Chase Manhattan, which cut its money market account by 10 basis points, to 5.34 percent, and Marine Midland, which cut its three-month and six-month certificates each by 21 basis points, to 5.76 percent and 5.97 percent, respectively.
The yield on the average money market account at commercial banks was unchanged at 5.39 percent, but three-month certificates were down by 3 basis points, to 5.81 percent, and the sixth-month C.D. was off 4 basis points, to 5.97 percent.
At savings institutions, the average money market account was down a basis point, to 5.75 percent, while three-month and sixth-month certificates were cut by 5 basis points each, to 6.20 percent and 6.44 percent, repectively.
Yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area show the average yield on money market accounts down 3 basis points, to 5.38 percent, and the average yield for a six-month certificate down 4 basis points, to 5.99 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Moves Downward As Some Traders Cash In

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended lower yesterday in foreign exchange trading as dealers cashed in on the currency's recent strength and the Government reported that orders for durable goods plunged in March.
Gold prices slipped after rising in Asia. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold settled at $357.10 an ounce, 80 cents lower than Monday's close. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid of $356.50 an ounce, off 70 cents. 
 The dollar started out lower in Tokyo and continued in that direction in Europe after a round of dollar-selling by central banks, led by the Bundesbank of Germany.
Currency dealers said the decline accelerated after the Government reported that orders for durable goods in March were weaker than had been expected. In addition, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, made comments that currency traders interpreted as suggesting interest rates could ease further since the economy remains sluggish. Lower interest rates in the United States generally make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer for Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said some dealers might have been looking for an excuse to sell dollars after the currency's recent upswing.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that factory orders for durable goods fell a seasonally adjusted 6.2 percent last month, to the lowest level in four years. Many economists had expected a slight gain in orders in March, supporting the view of the Bush Administration that the economic recovery would begin in the current quarter.
The dollar fell in New York trading to 137.64 Japanese yen, down from 139.49. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 138.45 yen, down 0.25 from Monday. It stood at 137.90 yen in London.
The dollar was weaker against the British pound. A pound cost $1.6925 in London and $1.7130 in New York, up from $1.6955 late Monday.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.7415 marks from 1.7645.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
NEC May Acquire Stake In Ailing Bull of France

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 23

 BODY:
The NEC Corporation, one of Japan's largest computer makers, said today that it was negotiating with Compagnie des Machines Bull about buying shares in the faltering French computer giant.
NEC offered few details, but a spokesman said that if an agreement was reached NEC would acquire no more than 10 percent of Bull. It would be the second Japanese investment in a major European computer company in less than a year. Bull is mostly owned by the French Government. 
 In Paris, a spokesman for Bull said the Tokyo talks were aimed at "accommodating" the stake that NEC already has in a Bull subsidiary based in the United States after recent shifts in Bull's corporate structure. He refused to say whether fresh money would also be involved.
Bull, France's largest computer maker, is among the hardest-hit of Europe's computer and electronics makers. A selloff of part of the company has been considered all but inevitable.
Bull lost $1.2 billion in 1990, and has grown increasingly dependent on NEC for its most critical mainframe computer technology. For months, French officials have been urging Bull's management to seek help from abroad, chiefly from NEC.
NEC said that it had "not yet decided" how to respond to Bull's request for an equity investment. But there seems little doubt that NEC -- in its effort to assure that Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer maker, does not gain too large a lead in the European market -- will take a stake.
Bull's economic condition is so severe that France recently pledged more than $1 billion to shore up the company and pay for its research. But computer industry experts say that money will barely scratch the surface. To try to broaden its product line in the 1980's, the company bought the computer businesses of Honeywell Inc. and the personal computer business of Zenith Electronics.
NEC and Bull have long had technical agreements, and in the United States they operate a venture to sell NEC supercomputers. NEC owns about 15 percent of Bull HN, which controls Bull's overseas operations. The Italian and British operations, previously attached to this American subsidiary, have been transferred to Bull's European division. As a result, the Bull spokesman in Paris said, it was necessary to "accommodate" NEC's stake in Bull HN in the company's new structure.

HEADLINE: Regan Says City Economy Will Still Be Weak in '92

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
New York City's economy will probably continue to falter next year as a deep recession presses all sectors of the local economy, State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said yesterday.
Mr. Regan released figures showing that a local recession that is already two years old continued to worsen during the first few months of 1991. 
 A report issued by the Comptroller said that retail sales, which slipped by 1.5 percent in 1990, fell by 5.1 percent in January and February compared with a year earlier. And during the first quarter of this year, as the local unemployment rate reached its highest level in five years, 8.1 percent, the number of jobs in the city fell by 75,000 compared with the same period a year earlier.
The report showed that job losses, once concentrated in the financial industries of Manhattan, had spread to other boroughs and to service businesses, with 10,300 fewer restaurant jobs in the city in December 1990 compared with a year earlier.
"New York City -- well into the second year of its own severe recession -- should not count on any relief from this in coping with its financial burdens," Mr. Regan said.
He noted that one of the major imponderables was whether poor economic opportunities would induce New Yorkers to move out of the city in large numbers, which could further erode the possibilities of economic recovery. In the 1970's, a time of economic retrenchment in New York, the city lost almost 1 million people, he said.
The Comptroller's forecast is somewhat more pessimistic than other local economic forecasts, including the forecast that the Dinkins administration is using to predict tax revenue, and less pessimistic than a forecast by by City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman.
While the State Comptroller is forecasting a net loss of 65,000 jobs in 1991, the City Comptroller is predicting a loss of 110,000. The Dinkins administration's forecast predicts a decline of 55,000 jobs in the same period.
City budget officials said they too were considering whether to take a more pessimistic view, especially after an unexpectedly deep decline in sales and income tax revenues reported earlier this month. But they declined comment on yesterday's report, saying they had not had a chance to study it.
Mr. Regan's report said the quick end to the war in the Persian Gulf, a stronger stock market, a rebound in real-estate prices, and lower interest rates were raising expectations that the national economy was beginning to improve.
 
Large Debt Burdens
 But he said recovery in New York from a local recession that dates back to retrenchment in financial services after the October 1987 stock market collapse could be delayed further.
The report cited large debt burdens by both private industry, particularly the city's financial institutions, and government, and expectations that this would translate into further reductions in the financial industries, particularly for back office employees.
In 1990, the report noted, the local economy lost 44,700 jobs, the worst annual lost of jobs since the 1970's, including 24,700 jobs in the service trades, especially department stores and restaurants.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Bond Prices Rise Moderately

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds posted a moderate recovery yesterday, pushing interest rates down slightly, while the shorter maturities had smaller gains.
Dealers attributed the modest improvement to some bargain-hunting by retail buyers who had been largely absent from the market during the sharp price declines of the last three trading sessions. 
 Late in the session, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue maturing in February 2021, were being offered at 95 21.32, up by 10/32, which caused the yield to fall to 8.26 percent from 8.29 percent the day before. The Treasury's long notes, the 7 3/4 percent issue of February 2001, rose 7/32, to 97 19/32, as the yield fell to 8.10 percent from 8.14 percent the day before.
 
Not Overly Aggressive
 But the dealers were quick to add that the retail buyers, a trade euphemism for large institutions like pension and mutual funds, were not overly aggressive. Most retail buyers preferred to stay on the sidelines until the auctions of Treasury notes today and tomorrow.
Today the Treasury will auction $12 billion of two-year notes, with $9 billion of four-year notes scheduled for sale tomorrow. The two-year notes traded on a when-issued basis to yield 7.03 percent, off three basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, while the yield on the four-year notes fell four basis points, to 7.77 percent.
"One indication of the malaise that has enveloped the market is that the retail buyers only appeared hours after the bond market received its best news of the day," said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief financial economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities.
 
Thrives on Negative News
 The "good news" for investors in fixed-income debt was that orders for durable goods in March fell 6.2 percent, to the lowest level since August 1987. The bond market thrives on negative economic news because it lessens both inflationary pressures and reduces the pressure for higher interest rates on future debt offerings. A rise in interest rates tends to lower the value of existing issues carrying lower yields.
"The positive impact of the durable goods numbers was diluted by the fact that much of the decline was in orders for aircraft and military hardware," Mr. Ricchiuto said. "It was also apparent that the supply of new Treasury debt facing the market remains a major concern."
Testimony by the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday was largely ignored by the credit markets because, dealers said, his remarks gave no clear indication of the central bank's intentions regarding interest rates. He reiterated his view that while the economy was declining, it was doing so at an ever slower pace.
 
Reserves Drained by Fed
 The shorter end of the Treasury market came under some pressure after the Fed once again drained reserves from the banking system. The move was apparently aimed at pushing up the key interest rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans. Although the Fed does not disclose where it prefers this pivotal lending rate to be, credit market analysts believe it has been at 6 percent since early February.
In any case, the draining of reserves was followed by a rise in the funds rate from 5 13/16 percent to 5 15/16 percent at the close. Normally, the discount rates on the longer Treasury bills, which are most heavily influenced by the funds rate, would have risen. But they did not, several bill dealers said, because of fading expectations that the Fed will soon act to reduce interest rates.
Thus, late trading found the rate on the six-month bills down four basis points, to 5.74 percent, and the rate on the one-year bills off two basis points, at 5.89 percent. The discount rate on the 90-day bills rose a basis point, to 5.70 percent.
In the corporate debt market, meanwhile, the Chrysler Financial Corporation offered $528.98 million of asset-backed securities through Merrill Lynch & Company, which is acting as sole underwriter. The two-part Chrysler offering of certificates backed by domestic home equity loans include $486.7 million of class A certificates, due in 2001, that carry an 8.5 percent coupon and are priced at 99 24/32 to yield 8.616 percent. The securities are expected to have a life of 8.7 years.
The class B part of the Chrysler offering consists of $42.32 million of subordinated debt that carries a 9.5 percent coupon and was priced to yield investors 9.243 percent.
Also, Champion International priced $200 million of notes, due in 2003, at par to yield 9.70 percent. The noncallable notes are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Is Cautious On Easing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today that the economy's slide was drawing to an end and that the central bank needed to be especially cautious before deciding to try to hasten recovery through another round of interest-rate cuts.
"The evidence suggests that the economy is still modestly moving lower, but moving at a reduced rate," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee. "We do expect the bottom to occur within a reasonably short period ahead," he added. "Week by week, the daily numbers still indicate that there is a modest decline."
 
Sign of Economic Weakness
 Mr. Greenspan's comments came shortly after the Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured durable goods tumbled 6.2 percent in March, a considerably worse decline than expected. This was the fourth decline in five months and the biggest since an 11.2 percent plunge in November.
The drop in orders for durables -- goods from bicycles to bombers that are expected to last at least three years -- was widespread. When military orders, a volatile category, are excluded, the decline was still a steep 5.4 percent. Shipments and order backlogs also fell.
Mr. Greenspan, appearing before the committee to discuss banking and deposit insurance issues, was not asked specifically about the durable goods figures, which he presumably had seen.
 
'Our Options Are Open'
 But when asked by Donald W. Riegle Jr., a Michigan Democrat who heads the committee, whether interest rates would fall further, Mr. Greenspan, shunning direct comment, said, "We're looking at the economy on a day-by-day basis -- and I would say our options are open."
At another point, he seemed to hint at the possibility of lower rates in response to a question about inflation, which ran at a relatively rapid pace early this year before subsiding in March. "Do I see inflationary pressures in price levels and wage levels? I think we're doing rather well in that respect," he said.
On the other hand, Mr. Greenspan warned that the risks of a wrong monetary policy decision are magnified at economic turning points, implying it would take more than poor durable-goods orders to prompt another rate cut. "The issue of inflation is that it never surfaces visibly until it is well advanced," the chairman said.
In sharp contrast to the guarded statements of Mr. Greenspan, some private analysts used strong language to characterize the latest drop in durables orders, which have fallen to the lowest point since August 1987.
Douglas P. Handler, manager of economic analysis at Dun & Bradstreet, called the figures "a horrible setback" to those who believe the economy has already begun to revive, based mainly on some housing data. "The magnitude of this drop-off is usually associated with the beginning of a recession rather than the end," Mr. Handler said.
 
$110.3 Billion Annual Rate
 At an annual rate of $110.3 billion, which is adjusted for seasonal variation but not for inflation, orders for durables stand $7.3 billion, or 6.2 percent, below the February pace. The negligible February decline was revised to two-tenths of 1 percent from three-tenths of 1 percent.
Among major industries, the biggest loss was a 10.8 percent drop in transportation equipment, with orders weakest for aircraft and parts. Electronic and other electrical machinery dropped 11.8 percent, roughly offsetting a February advance, while primary metals fell 2.6 percent. The exception was industrial machinery and equipment, which edged up seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Within capital goods industries, new orders for nonmilitary goods fell 10.3 percent -- 5.5 percent not counting aircraft and parts. New orders for military capital goods fell 16.9 percent, the Commerce Department report also showed.
 
Shipments Also Decline
Meanwhile, shipments of durables fell for the fifth straight month, the 2.4 percent decline, to $114.7 billion, dragging them to the lowest level since February 1988. All major industries posted declines, the biggest a 3.9 percent drop for transportation equipment.
Unfilled orders, a particularly good economic predictor, fell nine-tenths of 1 percent in March, to $502.3 billion, with all major industries declining here as well.
New durables orders last month were 15.4 percent lower than in March 1990, the department also said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.S.-Iraqi Standoff Hinders Kurd Relief at Camp

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: IN IRAQ, April 23

 BODY:
Iraqi and United States forces continued their wary standoff today in Zakho, the main town near the site of the first proposed American-built haven for Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq.
The impasse is frustrating efforts by relief officials to coax the Kurds down from the mountains and back to their ancestral lands. 
 Carrying machine guns and sidearms, the Iraqis patrolled the sidewalks as United States Marines moved through the streets in military convoys. Some stood behind and observed residents of Zakho as the local towspeople tried to speak with Western journalists.
The authorities in Baghdad say that the men are police officers and that their presence does not violate the accord under which the United States has begun to set up tent cities for the Kurds in northern Iraq.
 
'They Will Kill Us'
 American officials disagree, and the issue has caused a standoff not just between the Americans and the Iraqis but between relief officials and the hundreds of thousands of Kurds who fled for the hills last month from Zakho and other cities and villages here in northern Iraq.
"Saddam's soldiers, 2,000 of them, are there," said Sayed Daruish Abdullah, a Kurdish refugee who said he was asked to join a caravan that officials want to send to Zakho. "They wear Kurdish clothes and police clothes. We are afraid. If we go there, they will kill us."
Townspeople in Zakho said the Iraqis were listing the names of those who had fled the town for the nearby mountains after the smashing of the Kurdish revolt. And word of their presence spread quickly to leaders of the Kurds mired in misery along the jagged border with Turkey, leaving the kurds still unconvinced that they will be safe from retribution if they leave their mountain refuges for the camps below.
"The leadership on the mountain, it's as if they are on another end of a phone line," said Gordon Murchie, a spokesman for the Agency for International Development. "They seem to know everything going on. They are worried about the Iraqi military. The question is, 'Are they really police and do they really need that many?' "
 
Iraqi Armed Contingents
 Col. Dick Naab of the Marines, a liaison officer to the Iraqi Army, also said the presence of the Iraqis in Zakho was frightening the refugees.
"The Iraqis say they want to cooperate," he said. "This is not cooperation, this is threatening. We are making certain demands. I'd rather not go into that, but we have options."
Iraq has pledged to cooperate in relief efforts, but it condemns the allied plan as interference in its internal affairs and insists that the United Nations oversee the care and protection of the Kurds.
The armed Iraqis arrived in Zakho on Sunday after contingents of the Iraqi Army abandoned a division headquarters, barracks and outposts and left in compliance with the American withdrawal demand.
 
'These Aren't the Police'
 But the issue of whether paramilitary forces could stay was not addressed when the commander of the relief effort, Lieut. Gen. John Shalikashvili of the Army, outlined the agreement with the Iraqi authorities on Friday.
"My interpretation of his statement in that meeting was that he wanted them to start pulling back immediately," said Staff Sgt. Lee Tibbets, spokesman for the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, who was at the meeting. "Let's get one thing straight. These aren't the police, these are Iraqi soldiers with AK-47's. The generals are working on why there are people walking around in green uniforms with AK-47's."
Kurdish clan chiefs, who hold sway over families ranging from 100 to several thousand, have told American officials that they will not order their kinsmen out of the mountains unless President Saddam Hussein falls or the allies give absolute assurances that the Kurds who return to northern Iraq will be indefinitely protected from the Iraqi Army.
Washington has stressed that its military presence in northern Iraq is a short-term humanitarian operation, although it has set no time limit for it. The United States hopes to turn over the relief operation to the United Nations and private aid organizations.
 
Recruiting Kurds for Camps
 The United Nations has said that it is not equipped to cope with the huge undertaking.
Journalists saw members of the Kurdish rebels in the tent city at Zakho this afternoon, and clan chiefs are supposed to tour the site on Wednesday. American officials hope to recruit Kurds to help build the camp and want to begin moving people into tents in the next few days.
"There is nothing wrong with a police force to help restore civilian authority in a town," said Mr. Murchie, the relief official. "But now there are so few people that when you bring in this many police they almost outnumber the inhabitants."
The Iraqis "are going to keep on playing games," he said, adding, "Right now they are trying to see how far they can go."

HEADLINE: Oregon Literacy Test Shows Many Lag in Basics

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALEM, Ore., April 23

 BODY:
In what is being called the nation's first comprehensive statewide survey of adult literacy, Oregon has found that 97 percent of adults can read at some level, but only a small percentage can interpret a poem, use a bus schedule or determine correct change from a lunch bill.
The survey results, announced today by Gov. Barbara Roberts of Oregon, offer the first preview of what a national adult literacy survey is likely to show when it is conducted next year. 
 The national survey will use the same test as was used here, one administered by the Education Testing Service of Princeton, N.J. The test used a random sampling of 2,000 people.
Some Oregon educators and political leaders were surprised at the large number of people who could not perform basic tasks.
"I didn't realize that a bus schedule could be so difficult to read," Governor Roberts said.
The survey broke the reading test down into three basic categories: prose literacy, or understanding information in a basic text; document literacy, or the comprehension of maps, graphs or technical information; and quantitative literacy, the ability to follow and apply simple mathematics.
In the prose category, 78 percent of those surveyed were classified as reading at the basic, or lowest level, 41 percent were intermediate, and 8.7 percent were classified as master.
When asked to locate specific information in a sports article, 97 percent could do so. But when asked to find information that the columnist Tom Wicker of The New York Times used to support an argument made in his essay, only 47 percent correctly answered the question.

 In testing for document literacy, the survey found that 95 percent could determine the due date for payment of a bill; 84 percent could find the year-to-date gross pay on a payroll stub; 35 percent could determine the correct dosage of medicine using a chart of a child's age and weight; 18 percent could use a bus schedule to find the time of departure, and only 4 percent could read a bar graph well enough to determine economic recovery.
The quantitative section found that 96 percent of adults could tabulate two entries on a bank deposit slip; 60 percent could use an advertisement to determine the least costly product; only 37 percent could determine the correct change from $3 after purchasing two items from a lunch menu, and only 5 percent could correctly figure out which sort of investment, from a table comparing monthly to weekly returns, would be the most beneficial.
Those tested ranged from 16 to 65 years of age, and were selected as a scientific sample of the adult population. The test was conducted in their homes and lasted an hour. In a previous, smaller survey, Oregonians tested slightly higher than the national average.
Adults 21 to 25 years old were tested in 1985 nationwide, but no comprehensive literacy survey of all age levels has yet been conducted.
Robert Silvanik, director of state literacy programs for the National Governors' Association in Washington, D.C., said estimates of adult illiteracy in the United States range from 25 million to 70 million people. But he said the definition of illiteracy had changed dramatically in the last 25 years.
The survey in Oregon and the nationwide test scheduled for next year will be used to determine how many people are not responding to basic communication demands in an increasingly complex society.
"It's a mistake to measure literacy by grade level, or whether somebody can read their name," Mr. Silvanik said. "The meaning of illiteracy is much broader than ever before. We have high school and even college graduates who cannot comprehend their functioning level."
 
Answering the Basic Demands
 The Oregon tests indicate that educators should be doing more testing on how well people can answer the basic demands of society, and less on right and wrong academic questions, said Matthew Prophet, superintendent of schools in Portland.
Governor Roberts said Oregon would use its survey as a tool to help the displaced and the poor.
"How can an unemployed woman get to a job interview on time if she can't read the bus schedule?" the Governor asked. "How can a father care for his sick daughter if he can't tell how much medicine to give her?"
President Bush has made improvement of adult literacy one of the four planks in his recent education program. Two bills in Congress would also promote education of adults who cannot read at a functioning level.

3 Media Companies Report Large Declines

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Times Mirror Corporation, the Tribune Company and the Washington Post Company yesterday reported large declines in their first-quarter earnings, reflecting the added costs of covering the war in the Persian Gulf and the impact of the recession on advertising revenue.
Times Mirror said earnings fell 49 percent; Tribune reported a 37 percent decline, and Washington Post a 65 percent decline. 
 Following are the media companies' results:
 
Times Mirror
Times Mirror, based in Los Angeles, earned $23.3 million, or 18 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31, down from $46 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell about 1 percent, to $864 million from $875.2 million. The decline would have been greater except for a gain of 5 cents a share this year from sales of a cable television system investment.
The company said advertising volume dropped at its newspapers, magazines and television operations. Also contributing to the lower results were higher costs related to circulation growth at The Los Angeles Times and Newsday, said Robert F. Erburu, the chief executive.
Despite higher newspaper circulation revenue, newspaper publishing revenue was down 7 percent and operating profit fell 73.4 percent.
Broadcast television revenue fell 15.1 percent, while operating profit tumbled 87.8 percent because of reduced advertising and higher program costs.
But revenue rose 8.2 percent in the book, magazine and other publishing groups as operating profit rose 17.2 percent. The cable television division had increases of 21.3 percent in revenue and 94.2 percent in operating profit.
Times Mirror's shares gained 12.5 cents, to $30.25, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Tribune
Tribune, based in Chicago, earned $21.1 million, or 26 cents a share, in the first quarter, down from $33.5 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 20 percent, to $467.6 million from $583.6 million.
The company attributed the drop to lower operating profit from its three lines of business -- newspaper publishing, broadcasting and entertainment, and newsprint operations -- as well as higher interest expenses and higher income-tax rates.
Operating profit in the newspaper division fell 18 percent as revenue fell 31 percent, reflecting a sharp decline in ad revenue.
The latest results exclude any contribution from The Daily News, which was sold in March to Robert Maxwell. Operating losses for The News were reflected in Tribune's 1990 results.
Broadcasting and entertainment's operating profit fell 39 percent, to $3.8 million, on a 4 percent revenue decline because of fewer shows in syndication and lower ad levels.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Tribune shares were unchanged at $45.50.
 
Washington Post
Washington Post said earnings in the first quarter fell to $13.6 million, or $1.15 a share, from $39 million, or $3.16 a share, in the corresponding period in 1990. Revenue declined 7 percent, to $317 million, from $341 million a year earlier.
Newspaper division revenue fell 13.5 percent, as ad volume tumbled 22.5 percent at The Washington Post.
Revenues at Newsweek magazine fell 3.5 percent. Revenues at the broadcast division dropped 11 percent, while cable division revenue rose 12.5 percent.
Washington Post's share price fell $6 yesterday, to $220, on the Big Board.

RJR Posts Small Profit For Quarter

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In a surprise to analysts, RJR Nabisco announced a small profit for the first quarter yesterday, its first since going private in 1989 in history's largest leveraged buyout. It posted net income of $5 million, compared with a loss of $222 million in the comparable period last year.
Despite sluggish domestic cigarette sales, quarterly sales for the company over all rose 8.4 percent, to $3.47 billion from $3.2 billion, largely because of foreign cigarette sales and higher sales of food, like Oreo cookies and Grey Poupon mustard. 
 Earnings before interest, taxes and other charges totaled $800 million, up 6 percent from $754 million. But interest and other costs dropped by a quarter, to $637 million from $846 million, largely because of refinancing and swapping debt for common shares. The $209 million drop in such costs nearly equaled the loss in the 1990 period.
 
Stock Up 12.5 Cents
 The stock of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation rose 12.5 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $11.75. The issue was the Big Board's most active, with a volume of 3.8 million shares.
Analysts were quick to reduce their estimates of interest expense sharply, a crucial factor for leveraged buyouts, from about $2.5 billion to $2 billion this year. "For any company," said John C. McMillin of Prudential Securities Inc., "$500 million is a lot of cookies."
Last week, RJR Nabisco successfully sold $1.5 billion in new "junk bonds," double what it once thought it could sell, at an interest rate, 10.5 percent, just above that of investment-grade issues.
Mr. McMillin said the quarter was helped by the end of the Persian Gulf war, which increased cigarette sales in the Mideast, where RJR Nabisco has a relatively strong presence.
"But Nabisco knocked the cover off the ball" with strong sales and profits for food, he said, partly by moving sales of certain grocery products to independent brokers rather than Nabisco's own sales force. The shift cut overhead and enhanced profits.
 
Losses Peaked in '89 Period
 The tobacco-and-food giant's previous seven quarters of losses peaked in the third quarter of 1989 at $447 million. The losses resulted from RJR Nabisco's huge and expensive debt, $29 billion at its peak and costing 17 percent for some of the bonds, which the company accumulated when it went private in the $25 billion buyout.
RJR Nabisco's crucial cigarette business, which accounted for more than half the company's sales and 80 percent of operating profit, posted a rise in operating profit, to $648 million from $637 million. Cigarette revenues rose 5 percent, to $1.96 billion from $1.86 billion.
But the improved cigarette performance resulted mainly from foreign gains, especially in Europe and Asia, rather than in the United States, where unit sales are declining by about 3 percent a year. The figures include part of the 14 billion cigarettes scheduled to be sold to the Russian republic from October 1990 to December 1991.
RJR Nabisco said its domestic decline was "larger than trend," but did not have an immediate estimate.
 
Lower Cigarette Volume
 RJR Nabisco acknowledged lower unit volumes in cigarettes for the first quarter, as well as a more than 12 percent increase in marketing expenditures, for advertising and promotions like contests and discount coupons. The strategy is in line with the company's heavier investment in its full-price cigarettes, which are declining in unit sales, like Winston and Salem, rather than the growing but less profitable discount brands like Doral and Sterling.
RJR Nabisco's food business posted a 21 percent rise in operating profits, to $171 million, from $141 million in the 1990 period. Quarterly revenues increased 12 percent, to $1.5 billion from $1.34 billion.
But excluding sales for the Baby Ruth/Butterfinger candy business, which was sold last year, RJR's food sales rose only 3 percent and operating net about 22 percent.

HEADLINE: M.I.T. to Repay $731,000, Including Lobbyist Fees

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced today that it would pay back $731,000 to the Government, including $27,000 it used to pay Washington lawyers to lobby the Government on M.I.T.'s behalf, university officials said.
The lobbying was intended to dissuade a Congressional committee from investigating fraud allegations in a research paper signed by Dr. David Baltimore, then affiliated with M.I.T. and now president of Rockefeller University. 
 M.I.T.'s decision was preceded by a similar action last week by an affiliated research laboratory, the Whitehead Institute, which agreed to repay $69,000, also in lobbying expenses incurred in the investigation of the research article signed by Dr. Baltimore.
The announcement by M.I.T. combines two issues that have recently given science a black eye. One is the issue of overhead expenses that universities may properly charge to the research grants received from the Government. The other is the five-year-long furor over charges of scientific fraud in an article prepared by a research colleague of Dr. Baltimore.
M.I.T. says the $731,000 figure it has said it will repay is less than 1 percent of the $482 million in overhead costs the university billed to the Federal Government over the last five fiscal years.
The charges being withdrawn included $1,500 for a trip to Barbados; $13,750 for a party, and $27,300 in expenses it was billed by the Washington law firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart to aid three M.I.T. officials in testifying on questions of scientific fraud before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.
The university had billed the Government for the charges and had already received reimbursement for some of the total.
M.I.T. made its announcement at a hearing today by the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.
"We have a responsibility to American taxpayers, including ourselves, our own faculty and employees, to make sure that scientific research in the non-profit university environment is being conducted economically," M.I.T.'s president, Charles Vest, said today. "M.I.T. has a long history of cooperation with the Federal Government," he added. "And such a cooperative situation mandates a sense of fairness and a sense of responsibility."
Mr. Vest said M.I.T. was withdrawing charges that are now considered inappropriate but that were allowed under regulations that existed at the time. Most of the expenses withdrawn were "in the allowable but inappropriate category, such as receptions, functions, memorabilia or gifts, flowers, and catering charges," he said. Other claims were not intended as charges to be billed to the Government but were billed through a bookkeeping error, he added.
M.I.T. reviewed its overhead charges after the unfavorable public attention given to Stanford University, which had the Federal Government pick up as overhead on research grants items like a yacht, fresh flowers and cedar closets in the President's residence. Stanford, the California Institute of Technology and Harvard's Medical School have each withdrawn about $500,000 in such charges.
Other universities' accounts are also under scrutiny, and this week the Office of Management and Budget listed expenses that universities may not charge to the Government as part of the overhead costs of scientific research.
The repayments by the Whitehead Institute, first reported in The Boston Globe on April 17, included money that was used to pay for the services of several Washington lawyers, including Joel Jankowsky of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld.
Mr. Jankowsky is a registered lobbyist who, Congressional aides said, lobbied various members of Congress before a hearing by the Energy and Commerce oversight committee, headed by Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan.
Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said today that Mr. Jankowsky had met with him to raise concerns about the hearing and about whether Dr. Baltimore would be treated fairly.

 
Assertions About Research
 The lobbying by the Whitehead Institute also concerned the investigation by Mr. Dingell's panel. The committee was looking into an article based on work by Dr. Thereza Imanishi-Kari and signed by Dr. Baltimore. Since 1986, Dr. Baltimore has persistently repudiated charges of fraud in Dr. Imanishi-Kari's work.
He and scientists supporting him conducted a campaign of writing and speaking to defend Dr. Imanishi-Kari and what they felt was the integrity of science. He said Congress should not be involved in such matters.
Last month, a draft report written by the Office of Scientific Integrity at the National Institutes of Health concluded that Dr. Imanishi-Kari's work was not in error, but was intentionally faked.
Now, critics have begun to question details of Dr. Baltimore's campaign, including the use of Whitehead Institute funds to lobby the Congress. Until recently, Dr. Baltimore was director of the Whitehead Institute.
Officials of the institute said that at least $196,000 was spent in 1988 and 1989 for legal fees in the defense of the 1986 research paper.
Dr. John Sawhill, chairman of the board of the Whitehead Institute, today said the money had been approved by the board of directors at Dr. Baltimore's request "to retain counsel to help Dr. Baltimore deal in an adversarial environment with the N.I.H. and the Congress."
He said: "We felt it was appropriate to pay some portion of the legal fees because he was director. I don't think we'd change our decision, because at the time, we didn't think fraud was involved. We felt Dr. Baltimore had done a wonderful job in building the institute."
John Pratt, associate director of the institute, said that Dr. Baltimore had asked that those legal fees not be charged to the Government, but that the fees for 1988 were forwarded through an error of the accounting department.

Profits Up 6.6% At McDonald's

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporation, the world's largest fast- food chain, said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings rose 6.6 percent, to $168.5 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with $158.1 million, or 43 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago.
Revenues rose 3.3 percent, to $1.56 billion from $1.51 billion. 
 But its core business, restaurant sales in the United States, continued to be sluggish. Foreign sales, which account for more than half of McDonald's business, were strong, despite the fact that overseas outlets make up only about one-quarter of its 11,800 restaurants.
Currency translations favored McDonald's. If first- quarter currency values had stayed at 1990 levels, McDonald's said, earnings would have been lower by $3 million.
Like other fast-food restaurants, McDonald's has had to cope with a sluggish United States economy that has chilled customers' willingness to eat out, even at inexpensive fast- food outlets. While the nation's population has grown only 1 percent or so a year, burger, chicken, pizza and other chains have grown far faster.
McDonald's share price slipped 12.5 cents yesterday, to $34.875.

HEADLINE: LATIN QUAKE TOLL PUT AS HIGH AS 70

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMON, Costa Rica, April 23

 BODY:
An international relief effort began delivering assistance to Costa Rica today, a day after a severe earthquake struck a broad area of Costa Rica and Panama.
A Costa Rican Government official said that "no more than 20" had been killed by the quake in this country, but an official of the Costa Rican Red Cross said that at least 50 people had died. Reuters reported 23 killed in Panama. Reports from both countries indicated that at least 500 had been injured. 
 United States, United Nations and Latin American relief workers said they had evacuated about 200 of the most seriously injured Costa Ricans to hospitals in San Jose, the capital.
Costa Rica's President, Rafael A. Calderon Jr., said in an impromptu news conference at the Limon airport that damaged bridges and roads threatened the delivery of relief supplies, but that the medical effort had gone well.
"The first stage is completed," he said. "We have saved lives. The second stage is food."
 
Loan From the World Bank
 Mr. Calderon announced that he had received a $60 million loan from the World Bank for emergency road and bridge repair, and he appealed for more aid. He said he feared a cholera outbreak unless sanitation could be rapidly improved.
In Limon, thousands of residents who slept in the streets, parks and fields Monday night remained there today, afraid to return to sagging houses that continued to be rattled by strong aftershocks. In one neighborhood two miles north of the city center, young children held plastic soda bottles up to passing cars and trucks, begging for water.
Power and water supplies were restored to some neighborhoods in Limon by nightfall, however.
American diplomats said no Americans were injured.
One group of Americans said they were cruising on a river several miles north of Limon when suddenly the channel shook and the river reversed its course, nearly swamping their two boats. "The river banks exploded," said Ronald Greek, a member of the group. "The trees fell in."
Limon, a Caribbean port of 65,000 people that handles 80 percent of Costa Rica's exports, was the city closest to the epicenter of the quake, which was measured at 7.4 on the Richter scale of ground motion.
It was the worst quake in Costa Rica since 1910, when 600 died in the city of Cartago.
Rodolfo Rojas, the customs administrator for Limon, said that the Caribbean Sea receded 100 yards after the quake, beaching an American container vessel that was loading bananas. As he toured the collapsed customs building, he said that the water had returned far enough this morning to allow the ship to depart.
The oil refinery in Limon was badly damaged in the quake, and Costa Rican officials said that it might take months to repair it.
The main road into Limon from San Jose was severed, with two bridges severely damaged. President Calderon said 10 trucks with relief supplies were backed up on the highway. His aides said they hoped to reopen the road in one or two days.
Officials offered differing estimates of the number of casualties. Eduardo Sanchez of the Costa Rican Red Cross estimated that 50 had died and 500 had been injured in Costa Rica because of the quake, but Gerardo Fernandez, the operations director of the Costa Rican National Emergency Commission, said that there were "no more than 20 dead and 200 injured."

HEADLINE: Fleet's Big Bet on New England

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
In one fell swoop, J. Terrence Murray, Rhode Island born and Harvard bred, is turning the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group into New England's biggest bank at a time of one of the region's worst economic downturns.
His $625 million bet for the assets of the failed Bank of New England will give his operation hundreds of new branches, billions in new deposits and loans and a presence in Massachusetts, where Fleet does not operate. It will also make Fleet, based in Providence, R.I., the clear banking leader in New England -- toppling the venerable Bank of Boston and putting Fleet among the 10 biggest banks in the nation. 
 But this is not a riskless proposition. And Mr. Murray, Fleet's 52-year old chief executive, is counting on an aggressive cost-reduction plan and an eventual turnaround in the New England economy to make it pay off. On the day after the acquisition was announced, Mr. Murray conceded that he expected to lose money on the deal initially, and he warned not to expect quick profits of the kind that occured in Texas when failed banks were sold by the Government to healthy bidders like the NCNB Corporation of Charlotte, N.C.
"This is a very strategic move for us," said Mr. Murray, who started at Fleet as an $85-a week trainee in 1962. "It fills holes we have in our franchise, and will make us the region's best-capitalized bank. The key is not what happens in the first 12 months, but realization of real returns in the subsequent periods."
On Wall Street, Fleet's stock rose $3.625 a share on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $21.50, one of the day's biggest gainers.
Fleet, along with Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Company, the Wall Street buyout firm, was selcted by the Government on Monday to buy the failed bank. The acquisition increases Fleet's assets -- primarily its loan portfolio -- by about $15 billion, to $46 billion. It adds 12,000 employees to its payroll of 18,000 and it brings its branches to 837, of which 474 are in New England and 363 are in upstate New York. And it thrusts Fleet, a hybrid institution that is half bank and half financial services company, more deeply into traditional banking.
Many analysts see the deal as an opportunity that Fleet can ill afford to pass up. They point out that the agreement with Federal regulators gives Fleet up to three years to transfer bad loans back to the Government. This means Fleet is acquiring a bank unencumbered by the bad real estate loans that have cut profits at so many other New England banks. And they note that Fleet has had a history of effective cost-cutting as it snapped up local New England banks in the last several years and engineered the acquisition of the Norstar Bancorp, based in Albany, in 1988.
"It's not a big risk," said David S. Berry, vice president at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, which analyzes the banking industry. "The real risk is operational -- if they don't get the cost savings. But that's a manageable risk. And they are in good shape, barring a total downturn in the New England economy, because they have three years to put bad loans back to the Government."
 
Bostonians Are Relieved
 Bankers in Boston are relieved that the Bank of New England, once the region's second largest, is finally sold. It will bring certainty to the region's banking scene and eliminate a wounded institution whose aggressive lending once put pressure on other banks to fall into increasingly risky ventures. Fleet's arrival means that the Bank of New England is still in local hands -- Fleet traces its history back to 1791.
The possible presence in the region of the BankAmerica Corporation of San Francisco, the rival bidder, was feared by local bankers because of its unfamiliarity and size -- it is the nation's second-largest bank, after Citicorp. "The real fear was that players would come in from out of the region and knock people around," said Gerard S. Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker, Anthony in Portland, Me.
William Crozier, president of the BayBanks in Boston, said: "We can return to stability. Bank of New England was like a wounded whale thrashing around. Now we have a vigorous competitor and one we know."
Charles Peabody, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody, said that for Fleet, "the rewards are quite substantial." The risk, he added, is "to get a real return on their investment, since a considerable piece of their capital is now infused in Bank of New England."
Mr. Peabody said that Fleet was getting a $14 billion bank with asset protection. "We think this acquisition can earn $140 million in 1993 and generate upward of $200 million a year by the end of the decade," he said. "This acquisition makes Fleet the dominant player in New England banking."
John W. Flynn, Fleet's chief financial officer, estimated that Fleet would lose about $20 million in the first six months after the acquisition and expected to save about $350 million in expenses in the first year. Given the poor state of the New England economy, returns for the acquisition will come more from cost savings than from making loans. "We don't expect to get the full benefits for at least 18 months," Mr. Flynn said.
When asked about cost reductions, Mr. Murray specifically declined to estimate the number of Bank of New England employees to be laid off. But, he said that in the last nine years Fleet had acquired more than 49 banks and was skilled at the delicate task of bank consolidation.
Fleet, which takes over Bank of New England on Monday, said it had not yet decided whether it would change the acquired bank's name.
"The consolidation process is complicated," Mr. Murray said. "We have parallel back-room operations and product lines and we will have to pay escape bonuses to people to phase them out."
 
Merger Experience
 He said that when Fleet and Norstar merged, 12 data centers were reduced to 1, and 16 operation centers were cut to 3. "So you can see the magnitude of consolidation, and this has implications for Bank of New England," he added. "We haven't made any definitive decisions, but we are looking at overlapping branches and redundant functions in two large independent organizations."
Fleet/Norstar is an unusually diversified bank, both geographically and in its services. Among its non-bank operations are a California-based student-loan processing operation, the nation's largest non-bank equipment leasing operation, a Milwaukee-based mortgage-brokerage firm with more than $52 billion outstanding and a municipal securities dealer with branches in New York and New England.
The revenues from these operations, along with a strict policy against lending to New England condominium developments and a $50 million limit on loans to any one borrower, have created a healthy bank in a region littered with troubled institutions.
The earnings from its non-New England operations have more than offset the downturn in Fleet's New England banking. In 1990, the financial services group earned $125.6 million and the New York Banking Group earned $78.2 million, while the New England Banking Group lost $195 million. Combined with the rest of the company, Fleet as a whole had a 1990 net loss of $48.5 million.
In Providence, depositors at the bank's 26-story Art Deco headquarters hailed the acquisition. "This place is a symbol of strength," said Charles Pasqualetti, a retired salesman, in the bank's lobby, which has 32-foot-high columns of black marble. "You know this place is going to be here tomorrow."

HEADLINE: As Crime Drops in Midtown, Even Criminals Credit Police

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
New York's citywide crime statistics have not been especially encouraging lately, but there is good news about the streets and subway stations at the core of Manhattan. Crime in midtown, like so much else there, seems to be in a severe recession.
The number of reported felonies, which range from purse-snatching and pickpocketing to murder, began dropping in midtown last summer and is still declining this spring. Since July the number of reported robberies, considered the best gauge of overall street violence, is 18 percent lower than for the same period a year earlier. 
 The muggers' economic slump might be partly related to the city's, since there are fewer workers and shoppers to rob in midtown. But many observers -- criminologists, local merchants, street criminals -- believe the decline is chiefly due to extra police officers on foot patrol, and some experts think the success of the police in midtown augurs well for the rest of the city.
 
'Unsafe for Bad Guys'
 For years criminologists have debated the effectiveness of putting more police on foot patrol, a policy that is gradually being adopted citywide. Extra officers were added in July around Times Square and Pennsylvania Station, and in the fall more officers began patrolling northern midtown.
"We made it unsafe for the bad guys, and the robberies dropped right away," said Assistant Chief Thomas P. Walsh, the commander for all the precincts in Manhattan below 59th Street. "I'm very excited about the results. I've never seen such a sharp decrease in robbery anywhere in the city before."
All other common felonies have also declined in midtown since last summer, compared with the same period a year earlier. The three midtown precincts include most of the area between 29th Street and 59th Street.
Although the police had feared that the extra officers in midtown would simply divert criminals to adjacent neighborhoods, Chief Walsh said that apparently did not happen.
"We're not sure where they've gone," he said.
Some of them could still be found yesterday outside the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 42d Street and Eighth Avenue, where they were offering to sell drugs and telephone credit-card numbers. They generally agreed, regretfully, with the police's statistical picture.
"Too many cops in sight -- it's intimidating," said a 28-year-old man from Brooklyn who declined to give his name but described himself as a former convict and current street hustler.
"They're tightening the bolts, and crime is definitely down," he said. "People are saying, 'Damn! How am I going to get paid?' It's still going on -- the folks smoking that crazy stuff will do anything -- but most people are going other places or sticking to small hustles. I wouldn't try to rob anyone. Well, I might if I saw they had a lot of money, but I'd follow them out of midtown to do it away from these cops."
Dan Biederman, the president of the Grand Central Partnership, said the number of crimes reported near the train station had been dropping since 1989. He attributed this partly to increased patrolling by the city police, and partly to the force of 53 private security guards hired by his organization, a coalition of local property owners and businesses.
 
Crime Down in Subway
 "It used to be that five or six times a year I'd see a thief running down the street with someone's purse," Mr. Biederman said. "I haven't seen that in the last year and a half. There's also been a decline in shoplifting. We've created an atmosphere where criminals know they're going to get caught."
Crime has also been declining in the subway stations at Grand Central, Times Square and Pennsylvania Station. From July through the end of March, the number of felonies fell 19 percent from that period a year earlier. The number of robberies in those subway stations was down 32 percent.
In the Times Square stations, for instance, reported felonies dropped to 362 from 450. At Penn Station, the number of reported robberies fell to 71 from 95.
"One reason for the drop is that we've had a lot more transit cops on patrol," said Albert W. O'Leary, a spokesman for the transit police. "By paying overtime, we've had the equivalent of 200 additional officers a day on the subway, and we've also changed our paperwork procedures so that a lot more officers can stay on patrol after making an arrest."
Another reason for the drop in crime, both above and below ground, might be the smaller crowds in midtown. Since July, the number of commuters using the midtown subway stations has been about 6 percent below the previous year. But this difference is smaller than the drop in crime, and some observers doubt that it would have much impact on the crime rate anyway.
"A guy going to commit a crime doesn't care if there are 10,000 people using a subway station or 9,200 -- the opportunity is still there," said Frank McLoughlin, a former deputy city police commissioner who is now director of government relations for the New York Telephone Company, at 42d Street and Avenue of the Americas. "I think an increased number of cops is the reason that crime is down. I've noticed a lot more officers on 42d Street, and I haven't heard many of our employees complaining about mugging in the past six months."
That view was shared by Lee Silver, a spokesman for the Shubert Organization, which owns 17 Broadway theaters.
"We haven't heard any complaints about pickpocketing or purse-snatchings at any of our theaters the last couple of months," he said. "The cops have been doing a great job, and we're seeing the results."
Thomas Reppetto, a criminologist who is executive director of the Citizens Crime Commission, a private group that monitors crime, also credited the additional officers in midtown for helping reduce crime. "I expect this trend to continue and expand citywide, because the police are planning similar programs in other areas," he said.
The redevelopment of West 42d Street may be another factor in the midtown crime drop, said William H. Daly, director of the Office of Midtown Enforcement, a branch of Mayor David N. Dinkins's office working to clean up the area around Times Square. He said the closing last spring of several action-movie theaters had reduced crowds on the notorious block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
 
Combination of Factors
 "In some ways 42d Street is the great engine that drives crime in midtown," Mr. Daly said, "and some of the activities that brought in criminals have been closed. The combination of the redevelopment and the added police has brought a decline that's unique in the 15 years I've been working here. Right now 42d Street is in the best shape I've ever seen it."
Still another apparent factor in the crime drop, cited by Mr. Daly and others, was the presence of a police Tactical Narcotics Team in midtown starting last July. The team made more than 2,600 arrests in the nine months ending March 31, and its presence was well known to the men standing outside the Port Authority bus terminal yesterday.
"T.N.T. has been everywhere," said the 28-year-old self-described hustler. "You see the van going around, you see them undercover, you see them in uniform. They're making it hard for us, but we'll survive.
"As long as those Jersey boys are getting off the buses looking for drugs and I.D.'s and switchblades, we'll figure a way to get over."

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
$39.2 Million Loss Posted By Bethlehem

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the nation's No. 2 steel producer, reported a first-quarter loss of $39.2 million yesterday, saying the recession had diminished demand for steel sheet products that go into automobiles and appliances.
Bethlehem's loss compares with income of $21.3 million, or 20 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1990. Sales fell 13.2 percent, to $1.05 billion, from $1.21 billion in the period a year earlier. 
 The company, like others in the industry, has been battered in the last year by falling demand and bitter price competition among the leading steelmakers and the smaller minimill producers. But analysts said the company was also heavily tied to the construction industry and that it might be hurt less by the slowdown than many of its competitors.
The company said its steel business had an operating loss of $26 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $29 million in the period last year. Bethlehem said its steel shipments were 7 percent lower and attributed the decline to weak demand from the automotive and light construction markets.
 
Higher Labor Costs
 The company said its non-steel operations, which include ship-repair and freight-car producing operations, had a $7 million operating loss, compared with an operating loss of $4 million in the quarter last year. The deeper loss was a result of lower volume and costs of a feasibility study on a joint venture with British Steel on a structural steel plant. Bethlehem also said its labor costs were higher because of a labor agreement that went into effect three years ago. Under the agreement, wages increase at the beginning of each year.
"While there are some signs of stability and potential recovery for the economy from the current recession, the outlook remains uncertain because of high unemployment, credit constraints and the recent strengthening of the dollar," said Walter L. Williams, the company's chairman and chief executive. "Even with a general economic recovery that is expected to start midyear, we do not expect a meaningful rebound in our business until later this year," Mr. Williams said.
Mr. Williams also said he remained optimistic about the prospects of talks with British Steel on establishing a joint venture in the United States to produce structural steel.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Bethlehem Steel's stock closed yesterday at $13.875, down 37.5 cents.
 
'Worse Than We Expected'
 Charles Bradford, a steel analyst with UBS Securities Inc., said that the earnings were in line with his predictions. "However, the non-steel business came in worse than we expected," Mr. Bradford said. "We expect that among all the majors Bethlehem will have performed the best. They will lose money in the second and third quarter and a lot of this has to do with equipment outages because they are doing a lot of modernization."
Mr. Bradford said that the cost of those temporarily idled operations might reach $60 million this year. "And that's over and above what the recession will cost them," he added. "But coming out of it, they will be a much stronger company with better products."

HEADLINE: Audit Disputes F.D.I.C. Fund's Value

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
The nation's senior auditor has found that the fund that protects bank deposits is in substantially worse shape than has been reported and may be worth only about half of the $8.4 billion that regulators previously calculated, a top banking official said today.
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said today in an interview that the General Accounting Office's annual audit of the bank insurance fund, to be released on Friday, would show that the fund might be worth only about $4 billion to $5 billion. Unaudited figures presented by the F.D.I.C. at the end of 1990 indicated it was worth about $8.4 billion. 
 The F.D.I.C. stands behind its unaudited net worth figure of $8.4 billion. That figure already accounts for the $2.5 billion expected cost of the failure of the Bank of New England and two affiliated banks that were sold yesterday to the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group and Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company.
While details of the two agencies' disagreement remain sketchy, Mr. Seidman said that the F.D.I.C. had been trying to persuade auditors from the General Accounting Office to revise their results in an attempt to persuade them that their estimate was too pessimistic.
He said the G.A.O. had come up with a substantially lower net worth figure for the fund than the F.D.I.C. had computed, because the G.A.O. found much higher liabilities. He said the accounting office had come up with the larger figure because it concluded that many more banks were already effectively insolvent than the F.D.I.C. had found.
The insurance fund, created in 1934, after many banks collapsed in the Great Depression, is financed through bank premiums and protects depositors when institutions fail. The number of failures of big banks in recent years has left the fund in its worst condition since it was created, and some Government economists have predicted that it could become insolvent within two years.
The G.A.O., the investigative arm of Congress, is required by law to audit many Government agencies. Its auditors have often disagreed with agencies' leaders and accountants. In the past, it has painted a more negative picture of the F.D.I.C. than the insurance corporation's officials have presented, and its assessments have generally been proved correct.
The accounting office is a nonpartisan organization headed by Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General. Mr. Bowsher commands significant respect on Capitol Hill for his thorough and candid assessments, but he is at times considered a thorn by the Bush Administration. Last month, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady criticized Mr. Bowsher for often taking critical positions. Mr. Bowsher had said the Administration's plan to fix the bank insurance fund concealed the magnitude of the fund's problems and failed to tackle its problems head-on.
 
'Below the Safety Level'
 Mr. Seidman said the G.A.O. figures could push Congress to act more quickly to address the problems of the fund and the banking industry.
"I don't think it will change our view that we'll need a recapitalization by the end of the fiscal year," he said, referring to this fall. Earlier in the day, he said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee that the bank insurance fund was "down below the safety level" and that only about $7 billion of its resources was in cash. Another $1.4 billion is in other assets.
The Bush Administration is proposing that the the bank insurance fund be refinanced by increasing the borrowing authority of the fund by $70 billion, $25 billion of which would be lent by the Federal Reserve.
But Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, who also testified before the Senate Banking Committee today, made clear that the central bank did not see itself as a lender of last resort for the bank fund. There is "no sound economic reason" to use the Fed instead of the Treasury, he said.
 
Greenspan Sees Bad Precedent
 Mr. Greenspan said that the proposal, by itself, would not inhibit the Fed's ability to conduct monetary policy by changing interest rates, but that it would set a bad precedent, which if followed for future borrowings would substantially reduce the Fed's liquidity and ultimately "create concerns" about its ability to change interest rates.
Treasury Under Secretary Robert R. Glauber took issue with Mr. Greenspan's assessment.
"Recapitalizing the bank insurance fund is a liquidity issue," he said. "Providing liquidity to the banking system is one of the primary traditional responsibilities of the Federal Reserve."
The chairman of the House Banking Committee, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, said today that he expected to have legislation to recapitalize the insurance fund through his committee and onto the House floor by the end of May.
Mr. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, said he thought an increase in borrowing authority of $25 billion would be enough to "meet immediate needs." He also said he would propose that the borrowing be done through the Treasury "rather than back-door borrowings through the Federal Reserve, or other gimmicks."
 
Computer Analysis of Banks
 Precise details of the differences between the F.D.I.C. and its auditors on the worth of the fund remain unclear. Mr. Seidman said the General Accounting Office had based its results on a computer analysis of insured banks that had failed to meet reserve requirements, based on the banks' confidential financial reports filed quarterly with the F.D.I.C.
"They applied the reserve requirements, figured out how much it would cost to put them in compliance, and then, based on that, decided ipso facto which banks would be insolvent," he said. "Our argument is that generally accepted accounting principles only require us to count losses that are definitely ascertainable, and the use of an economic model is not definitely ascertainable."
He added that the F.D.I.C. had recently retained Arthur Andersen & Company to review the audit results and that the accounting firm had not yet reached any conclusions.
Cleve E. Corlett, a G.A.O. spokesman, said auditors had been relying upon generally accepted accounting principles, which require them to account for all contingent liabilities.
 
'Highly Significant' Testimony
 Mr. Bowsher was out of Washington today and could not be reached for comment. In an interview last week, he declined to discuss the audit of the F.D.I.C., but said his appearance this Friday before the Senate Banking Committee, when he would discuss the figures, would be "highly significant."
Mr. Corlett of the G.A.O. confirmed that auditors from the two agencies had been in discussions over disagreements in the audit reports, but he declined to say how far apart they were.
In a report delivered to Congress today, the G.A.O. found that many bank failures could have been anticipated, and possibly averted, had accounting standards been stronger and reports to regulators more comprehensive.
The accounting office said the system of quarterly reporting by banks to regulators was "seriously flawed" and often failed to provide adequate warnings of troubles at many banks.
G.A.O. officials called upon the organizations that set standards -- the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the American Institute of Certified Public Accoutants -- to come up with more accurate measurements of problem assets at banks.
The report was based on an examination of 39 bank failures in 1988 and 1989. The banks accounted for 87 percent of the total assets of banks that failed during those two years and $8.9 billion of the $11 billion of costs incurred during 1988 and 1989 by the bank insurance fund.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 2.73, Ending a Three-Day Slide

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
After what looked much like another poor day on Wall Street, stock prices moved slightly higher late yesterday, ending a three-day losing streak.
"What we've seen here is a short-term selloff," said Kenneth M. Spence, director of technical analysis for Salomon Brothers. "The market is now trying to stabilize around 2,920." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average shot ahead 16 points at the opening bell but quickly faded, dropping close to 30 from its high and ending the day at 2,930.45, ahead 2.73.
 
Volume Up to 167.8 Million
 Pushed ahead strongly by a last-minute flood of bargain hunting, Big Board trading rose to 167.8 million shares, from 164.4 million the day before. But advances narrowly led declines, 830 to 794. Still, while 7 stocks slid to new 52-week lows, 57 rose to new highs.
One was Fleet/Norstar, the winner in the bidding for the failed Bank of New England. One of the best Big Board gainers of the day, it rose to 22 1/4 before ending at 21 1/2, up 3 5/8, in heavy trading.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said that heavy computerized selling clipped the Dow almost 8 points but that none of the late recovery in the blue chips appeared to come from program buying.
Analyzing the Dow's movements from a technical standpoint, Mr. Spence said that when the Dow dropped to 2,920 on Monday, it bounced back as bargain hunters moved in. Then yesterday, it climbed to 2,945, dropped again but again moved up easily through 2,920 to close somewhat higher.
"That's where the market will be stabilizing," he said.
 
'Treading Water'
 Asked what it was telling clients, Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said: "We're telling them the market for the time being is nervous and treading water and that investors are worried that economic recovery and profit recovery isn't here yet.
"At the same time, investors are worried that the Federal Reserve may become less friendly. Some investors are unhappy that the Fed has done nothing recently to cut rates or expand money growth."
Mrs. Cohen said the market was "bouncing all day because investors aren't quite sure whether they should be buying at this point."
But when asked what Goldman, Sachs was saying, she replied, "We're telling clients the bull market is still intact."
She gave these reasons:
*The Fed is still following an easy money stance.
*Central banks in other countries will be providing money stimulus to their economies, which in turn will help the American economy.
*When the American economy recovers from the recession, growth will be "modest" and "unlikely to push inflation up."
Explaining the close relationship between the United States and foreign economies, Mrs. Cohen said that if foreign growth in money supply was faster than economic growth, the excess money supply there "tends to boost stock prices" here. Moreover, she said, a rise in foreign money supply means higher American exports.
 
Takeover Stocks Active
 Besides the Fleet/Norstar deal, the takeover front was busy yesterday. Square D climbed 2 1/2, to 81 1/4, in heavy trading after the electrical equipment producer said it was still considering a proposal by Groupe Schneider of France to raise its $78-a-share bid. It added that it was also "pursuing a full range of alternatives," including "discussions of some of these alternatives with commercial banks."
NCR, target of a $110-a-share takeover bid, fell 1/8, to 101 7/8, after a new high of 102 1/4. Showing he was receptive, NCR's chairman, Charles E. Exley Jr., said he would recommend the offer if A.T.& T. guaranteed $110 regardless of its own stock price.
After the market closed, the Air Force said a team headed by Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics won a $65 billion Stealth fighter contract over a group headed by McDonnell Douglas and Northrop. Except for General Dynamics, which rose 1 7/8, to 36 7/8, the others changed little, but bigger moves are expected today.

HEADLINE: CUNY Protest Frustrating Even Students Who Agree

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

 BODY:
Ask Mario Rodriguez, a 36-year-old father of four from the Bronx, why he became a student leader at the City University of New York and he talks about what would happen if student aid was cut and tuition was raised by $500 a year. A lot of students -- poor New Yorkers, many of them single mothers -- would have to leave school, he says.
With protests against the proposed tuition increases and budget cuts in their third week and no solution in sight, there is a growing sense of frustration and tension among the students throughout the 21-campus system. 
 In interviews at several campuses over the last few days, most students agreed that proposals for the City University would be devastating: in addition to the tuition increase, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposals call for $52 million in cuts in student aid, staffing and several programs. Many said thousands of students would not be able to absorb the double blow of $1,950-a-year tuition and less financial aid. But more and more students are questioning the use of strikes as a protest, wondering if keeping students out of school is the best way to keep them in school.
 
'Certainly Justified'
 "The protests are certainly justified," said James Butler, a 25-year-old senior in mechanical engineering at City College. "But the students should realize how many lives they're disrupting."
Mr. Butler transferred three years ago to City College, in Manhattan, where the protests began on April 8, after he graduated from Fordham University with a degree in biology. To pay for school, he tutors nursing students in biology at Hostos Community College in the Bronx, another campus embroiled in protests.
"Now I'm out of school," he said, "and out of work."
And Joseph Tosto, a 23-year-old senior at City College, also majoring in engineering, said, "What about our right not to protest?"
About 300 students have seized buildings at 12 of CUNY's 21 campuses, halting classes at 6 campuses and forcing 52,000 students out of school. Protesters agreed yesterday to release one building, the Graduate Center in Manhattan, at noon tomorrow. And today, student representatives are to take their case to Albany, where they plan to meet with the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller of Brooklyn.
The university administration, struggling with how to handle the impasse, has been seeking temporary restraining orders barring the students from occupying buildings.
Yesterday, students at Bronx Community College were ordered by Justice Alice Schlesinger of State Supreme Court in Manhattan to release the buildings by 8 A.M. today, university officials said. Students at Borough of Manhattan Community College defied a similar injunction last week. Students at Lehman College in the Bronx are to appear this morning at a hearing before Justice Schlesinger.
The students entrenched in campus buildings say the takeovers are the most dramatic way to force attention on the devastation that would be wrought by the proposed cuts and on how the proposals would destroy the once-free university's historic mission to educate the city's poorest students.
Like Mr. Rodriguez -- raised by working-class parents from Puerto Rico and the first in his family to go to college -- many are the children of the city's immigrant poor. Others are immigrants themselves, most often from the Caribbean. Most striking, the majority of the two dozen protesters interviewed over the last week said they could endure a tuition increase but were protesting to protect the thousands of students who could not.
Mr. Rodriguez, who is president of the Student Government Association at Hostos, is one of those. A former doorman for a Park Avenue building, he enrolled in Hostos partly because he could manage the $1,225-a-year tuition with loans. His wife, a parking-fine collector, supports him and their two children on $27,000 a year (his other two chidren live with his ex-wife most of the year).
 
'Here for the Duration'
 That makes him rich, he said, compared with the more than 80 percent of the 4,150 students at Hostos Community College who earn less than $8,000 a year. "So we're here for the duration," he said, sitting in the student cafeteria, which is housed in a garage-like classroom building on the Grand Concourse.
But there are other students, with similar backgrounds and similar dreams, who have reached very different conclusions.
Susan Jacob, an 18-year-old freshman at Hunter College, where students have taken over the administration building and library, said she could not condone their methods. "Everyone has a right to peaceful protest," said Ms. Jacob, who was raised in the Bronx by parents who moved here from India. "But it's not fair to students to not let them go to class."
Ms. Jacob receives full financial aid, as does her sister, a senior at Lehman College. But she said her father, an unemployed factory worker, struggled to pay for her books. "I know that my parents will pay for my education if they have to," she said.
 
'You Work Harder'
 Mr. Tosto, who lives in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn with his parents and plans to become a mechanical engineer like his father, received a full four-year scholarship to attend City College. Now in his fifth year there, he said he works full time to pay his tuition.
"If the tuition goes up, you work harder," said Mr. Tosto, who works as a computer software consultant at a Wall Street firm. He is also captain of the college's swim team and president of its mechanical engineering club. "I don't agree with the increase, either," he said. "But I offered the protesters another way to do it and they didn't want it." He said he suggested that the students hold protest rallies on and off campus instead of seizing buildings.

HEADLINE: Thousands, Doing Without, Make Do in Apartment Strike

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
On its third day, the strike by 30,000 building service workers in the New York City region settled into a pattern yesterday. Deliverers, repairers, cable television workers and city garbage collectors generally honored picket lines, forcing hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers to devise creative ways to perform ordinarily simple tasks like having a package delivered or taking out the trash.
Even so, striking workers at dozens of buildings in Manhattan said residents had remained cordial and even supportive. Striking porters, handymen and doormen outside several buildings on the Upper West Side were treated to homemade cookies, doughnuts, coffee and other goodies from tenants in what, superficially at least, may be among the most amiable strikes in the city's recent history.
 
Difference Over Wages
 "The strike had better stop soon or I'm going to gain weight," said Danny Rodriguez, a striking concierge at Sofia condominium apartments at 43 West 61st Street. He had received coffee, bagels and cookies from sympathetic condo owners by early afternoon. 
 But all the good-luck wishes and expressions of sympathy by residents -- many of whom have known the striking workers for years and consider them a vital part of their building's extended family -- did not disguise the fundamental economic issues that caused the strike. The union is proposing a wage increase of about 5 percent a year for three years, a union representative said, and the owners' representatives are offering 2 percent. That means that about $14 a week separates the two sides.
Doormen, elevator operators, porters and other service workers receive $462.73 a week under the contract that expired Sunday, according to the management's bargaining agent, the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations. Handymen make $503.
Many of the same cooperative and condominium owners who are expressing solidarity with their striking service workers on the sidewalk picket lines will have to pay for any wage and benefit increases that are eventually won.
 
Owners Cite Higher Costs
 Their representatives insist that substantial wage increases are not feasible when maintenance costs are already soaring because of huge increases in property taxes and water and sewer costs.
The strike is affecting all boroughs except the Bronx, where workers are represented by another union, and Suffolk and Nassau Counties on Long Island. A repre sentative of the striking union -- Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union -- broke nearly two days of silence yesterday to discuss the union's position with a reporter.
Ronald Raab, a lawyer representing the union, said the board, representing the owners of 2,800 buildings, and the union were divided chiefly over the size of a wage increase when talks broke down early Sunday.
The Realty Advisory Board characterized the dispute slightly differently at a news conference on Monday; it included proposed increases in benefits. The gap between the two offers, as stated by the realty board, was also 3 percentage points.
 
Lower Entry Wage
 Other issues also cloud the negotiations, Mr. Raab said. The building owners' representatives are seeking to create a new entry wage for service workers -- 70 percent of the general union wage. Under the proposal, new workers would be brought up to the full wage over three years. In addition, new workers would not receive consecutive days off, which is guaranteed to current employees.
These proposals "are something that the members couldn't possibly tolerate," Mr. Raab said.
James F. Berg, executive vice president of the Realty Advisory Board, said the owners needed such concessions "because costs across the board have been escalating very rapidly."
Management is seeking other changes, Mr. Raab said, including a reduction from 10 paid sick days to 5, a weakening of job-security provisions and the right to replace full-time workers with part-time employees.
The owners' representatives said some provisions sought by the union were particularly troublesome, including a demand to double sick pay and another to shorten the workweek from 40 hours to 35.
Many buildings where the owners want the front doors attended 24 hours a day would have to hire additional workers if the workday was cut an hour -- to seven from eight hours. Three shifts of eight hours each now provide the service.
Mr. Raab said the union has dropped that demand.
Even so, no new talks are scheduled as each side waits for the impact of the strike to be felt. "Nothing lasts forever, so I'm sure we'll be back together," Mr. Raab said.
On the streets yesterday, both sides made accommodations to ease potential disruptions. Drivers from United Parcel Service avoided crossing the picket lines at some buildings by giving lists of people for whom they had packages to security guards, who then notified the recipients. The residents had to go to the U.P.S. trucks to claim their packages.
The Sanitation Department began acting on health emergency complaints and announced that beginning today, its trucks would pick up refuse at 51 sites on the East and West Sides of Manhattan. Sanitation workers have refused to cross picket lines except in health emergencies.
Reporters surveying parts of the Upper East Side and Upper West Side found more than 20 apartment buildings that had reached separate agreements with the union, ending the strike. Union and management officials say the wage increases in these agreements are similar to those proposed by the union.
Mr. Raab said about 150 buildings had reached separate agreements. That would be about 5 percent of all buildings covered by the strike.
Overall, residents of buildings with workers on strike appeared to chip in yesterday without much complaint. The residents "are taking it pretty good," said Tom Southwick, a striking concierge at 710 Park Avenue, at 70th Street.
"But it's early yet," he added. 'Give them a week and come back and ask me."

Damning a President With Fairness

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

President Reagan
The Role of a Lifetime
By Lou Cannon
948 pages. Illustrated. Simon & Schuster. $24.95.
By being eminently fair, Lou Cannon has written a devastating account of Ronald Reagan's Presidency. Try as he does to be even-handed, and he is so almost to a fault, the conclusion of "President Reagan" is best summed up in the apt subtitle of his book: "The Role of a Lifetime." 
 It's a phrase that can be interpreted without rancor by Mr. Reagan and his admirers; of course being President of the United States is the most important event in anyone's life, ex-actor or ex-anything else. But by the end of this exhaustive 948-page Presidential biography, Mr. Cannon leaves the reader with a decidedly negative assessment: that while Mr. Reagan may have been qualified to play the part of a President in Hollywood, he was unqualified to be the President in Washington.
The author, now the Western correspondent for The Washington Post, covered Ronald Reagan for more than 25 years in California and Washington and interviewed him and Nancy Reagan several times for this book. He delivers his judgment in temperate language:
"Because of his ability to reflect and give voice to the aspirations of his fellow citizens, Reagan succeeded in reviving national confidence at a time when there was a great need for inspiration. This was his great contribution as President. But because he believed in happy endings obtained with too little sacrifice, this revived confidence became an end in itself that Reagan rarely sought to focus on higher goals. He aged little in the Presidency and took his role too lightly. In the end, it proved too big for his talents."
Mr. Cannon's book is a very solid piece of work. While it touches upon Mr. Reagan's life, its main focus is on his performance in office. He gives Mr. Reagan good marks for the intangibles -- inspiring confidence in the American system, showing friendship and leadership in his foreign dealings, being what his critics called a "Dr. Feelgood," a calumny that Mr. Reagan took as a compliment.
But on the tangibles, Mr. Reagan comes off in the book as a sincere incompetent, who sometimes actually snoozed on the job and whose vision for Americans followed the starry-eyed scenarios of old movies. The author says Mr. Reagan often exaggerated for the sake of a story, confusing real life with reel life. As others have written, Mr. Reagan told world leaders that he had seen the concentration camps in Europe when, in fact, he did so only on film in Hollywood, where he spent the war years.
One of the highlights of the author's analytical reporting is that he looks closely at the numbers during Mr. Reagan's two terms; in the best tradition of investigative journalism, he follows the money. Measuring the scripted campaign rhetoric against the Federal Government's bottom line, he shows that while Mr. Reagan promised to balance the budget, his policies led to the largest national debt and worst foreign trade deficit in American history. In this respect, the author quotes a pungent comment about the legacy of Mr. Reagan and Reaganomics by Walt Rostow, a special assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson and a history professor at the University of Texas: "He's been a good-time Charlie. Nothing bad's going to happen on my watch."
Mr. Cannon properly devotes two powerful chapters -- which he calls "Darkness at Noon" and "Struggle at Twilight" -- to the Iran-contra affair. It was the nadir of Mr. Reagan's style of governance, when a military and intelligence sub-government illegally defied Congress and secretly ran the nation's foreign policy. How much did the President know and when did he know about the diversion of Iran arms-sales proceeds to the Nicaraguan contras? Mr. Cannon is no potted palm when he questions the President's convenient forgetfulness. He writes:
"Reagan has consistently denied knowledge of the diversion -- a denial he repeated to me for this book and in his memoirs. But such denials can hardly be regarded as conclusive, even by those who believe Reagan is telling the truth as he remembers it. As has often been observed in these pages, Reagan long ago learned to accept as the truth whatever version of events he used to explain things."
The author doesn't always slam-dunk his points. For example, he uses such euphemisms as "ethical insensitivity," "ethical embarrassments" and "ethical impropriety" for the plain corruption of some of Mr. Reagan's closest aides and Cabinet members, including those at the head of the Justice, Labor, Interior and the Housing and Urban Development departments. Yet he does score with unsensational outside shots at the Presidency when he gets down to the specifics of such things as the courts, the environment and the regulatory agencies. "Overall," he says, "Reagan left a ruinous regulatory legacy."
"President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime" is the second book by a Washington Post writer to appear in the last few weeks in which the former President is found not to have been up to the job. In "Sleepwalking Through History: America in the Reagan Years" ( W. W. Norton ), Haynes Johnson concludes that the country is now paying for the Reagan legacy with lowered ideals and a debtor economy. Both books are on the same wavelength, with Mr. Johnson's taking a broader look at the social history of the nation and Mr. Cannon's concentrating more on the Reagan Presidency itself. It's noteworthy that Simon & Schuster is the publisher not only of Mr. Cannon's serious book about the President but also of Kitty Kelley's scandal-filled book about the First Lady.
Inevitably, Mr. Cannon also mentions the opulence of the White House under the regal Reagans. But the main value of his well-documented Presidential biography is his evidence that Mr. Reagan's Oval Office too often was out to lunch.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
To Lessen Malaise, Industry Looks to Up The Purse for Promotion

SERIES: Hard Times In the Bluegrass - Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ky.

 BODY:
After a five-year economic free fall that has wiped out scores of horse farms and sent breeding fees plunging, many people in the thoroughbred industry say its best bet is to launch a national campaign to glorify and advertise the industry's ultimate product: the race horse.
They predict that if they do not do this, the racing business will be decimated by competition from casinos, state lotteries and even the new riverboat gaming operations that several states have instituted to grab a share of the gambling dollar. 
 And they warn that the runaway production of race horses that caused a crash in prices in the 1980's must be replaced by more selective breeding, and that there must be more unified leadership in a fragmented business largely peopled by rugged individualists.
"No industry in America spends less on advertising its own product," said John Gaines, former owner of the Gainesway scientific breeding farm here, and the man who created the Breeders' Cup series of championship races. "You see what national advertising has done for basketball and baseball. Even the meat industry. If this industry can't come up with $50 million and the leadership to spend it wisely, it's going nowhere."
"But," he added, "the industry is so fragmented that it needs leadership. It needs to sell itself as an industry."
Fred Pope, whose agency in Lexington handles advertising for much of the thoroughbred industry, said he was astounded three years ago when he looked into what the racing business was spending on advertising.
"All the race tracks in North America were spending $8 million on advertising," he said. "I had figured it was $100 million. The entertainment industry spends 5 percent of its sales on advertising. Racing, 1.5 percent. In the last five years, attendance fell 11 percent at Santa Anita in California, 12 percent at Aqueduct in New York, 17 percent at Del Mar in California, 18 percent at Belmont Park in New York and 23 percent at Gulfstream Park in Florida.
"How long can you go? Do you want 5,000 people at Belmont on a summer afternoon? We've got to get together before race tracks start closing."
 
From Taxes to 'Product'
 The industry is also clamoring for relief from Federal laws that eroded depreciation allowances and increased taxes on capital gains, and it is searching for ways to bring Arab and Japanese investors back into the horse market. Those are the factors most often cited in explanations of the breeding industry's decline.
But some leading figures in the business, seeking a cure, are shifting their emphasis to the "product," the race horse, and the role the horse might play as the link to the public's pocketbook.
"We no longer have a monopoly on the entertainment dollar or the betting dollar," Gaines said. "Everything starts and ends at the parimutuel window. Racing needs to go where the people are. It must create a whole new fan base."
Gaines said the industry should aim its message to a wider audience, particularly those people already receptive to gambling. "We need to go to the TV audience," he said, "to Disneyland, where 25 million people go each year, to Atlantic City, also 25 million visitors on a hard-core betting basis."
Seth Hancock, president of the Claiborne Farm near Paris, Ky., pointed out that an example of the threat to the business might be found next door to horse racing's most famous site, Churchill Downs in Louisville, home of the Kentucky Derby.
"There's a big river that runs within five miles of Churchill Downs," he said, referring to the Ohio. "People can say, 'I'd like to take that nice gambling cruise on a riverboat.' "
He added: "We've got to find reasons for them to come to the race track and watch the horses run. We've got to have purses high enough to attract horses good enough to attract people as big entertainment."
How would that help the breeding, or bloodstock, business revive?
"It would restore logic to the whole system," Gaines said. "In the 1980's, it was all very exotic. The business attracted large numbers of people who wanted to get on the bandwagon and make a killing. Players were entering, trying to breed and sell yearlings; the market was doubling every two years. And all of a sudden, we were running out of people who could buy those horses."
 
Back to the Race
 "It was like real estate," said the prominent trainer and horse owner D. Wayne Lukas. "Guys didn't have the expertise to stay for the long haul. It was an era when we went through plan A, which was raising horses, and skipped plan B, which was racing horses, and went straight into plan C, which was breeding horses. The horse would have a couple of races, and they'd say, 'Breed him.'
"That's why we need to go back to the race horse in order to revive the whole system. High purses induce you to race your horse."
Lukas probably knows, and works, the system better than anybody else. As an owner, in 12 years, he spent $90 million to buy 280 horses at the Keeneland sales in Kentucky. And as a trainer, he has saddled 13 champions, including Criminal Type, who won the Eclipse Award as the Horse of the Year in 1990.
In a recent telephone interview from the Oaklawn Park race track in Hot Springs, Ark., Lukas said that he saw signs that plan B was already coming to the rescue of plan C.
"Actually, the horse economy is becoming strong again," he said. "Our purse structure has become strong. We simulcast races to other tracks; we put on the Breeders' Cup series with million-dollar purses; we've started the new American Championship Racing Series for older horses; we've got high purses in the Kentucky Derby and the other classic races.
"In fact, now is probably the best time to get into horses. Horse flesh is cheaper than it's been in 15 years, and the purses are higher than ever. Look, the house of cards in the bloodstock market tumbled when race horses couldn't go out on the track and win back the money they cost."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
China Ties About To Snap

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Beijing and Washington soon will mark the 20th anniversary of Henry Kissinger's secret journey of reconciliation to China. Only there is nothing to celebrate. In a drama barely noticed, Chinese actions are tearing apart ties with the U.S.
 China no longer matters much strategically as Soviet-American rivalry recedes. Its tired leaders cruelly clutch on to power. They flout American concerns in shady trade practices and huge trade surpluses, slave labor camps, Tibet, human rights violations and sales of particularly dangerous weapons.
 
 Congress is fed up with China's performance and seems poised to impose trade sanctions. President Bush, micromanager of policy toward the Middle Kingdom, fought fiercely and prevented Congressional retaliation last year. Beijing is obviously hoping he will rescue it again. But it is far from clear that he will or can -- or should.
 China's leaders had almost two years to shape up since their bloody crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Yet they threw Mr. Bush, their great protector, only a few bones: an abstention in the U.N. vote to authorize force against Iraq, and the release of political prisoners (though providing no list).
 Bones aside, Chinese exporters brought on a trade crisis. They refused to protect U.S. patents and copyrights and resisted American access to their markets. They transshipped goods through Hong Kong to hide their origin. They continued to use prisoners and "ex-prisoners" as slave labor to lower the price of exports.
 By such means, they overcame years of modest U.S. surpluses. But in 1990, China's trade surplus with the U.S. leaped to $10.4 billion. This year experts predict that gap will jump to at least $15 billion, ranking China's trade advantage over the U.S. behind only Japan and Taiwan.
 Meanwhile, Chairman Li Peng and associates meted out harsh sentences to student democratic leaders. They also continued to execute workers demanding political rights, while Westerners hardly raised a murmur compared with their outrage over jailed intellectuals.
 The old gang went on with the systematic destruction of Tibetan identity. Mr. Bush, to the chagrin of Chinese leaders, broke recent precedent and met with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader and national symbol. Mr. Bush may have been aiming at Americans charging him with insensitivity about the Kurds, but Beijing got the message anyway.
 Chinese leaders also startled Washington by secretly helping Algeria to build a nuclear reactor. Like North Korea's, it is too small to generate electricity profitably and too large for research, but just right to make material for nuclear weapons.
 Pressured to explain, Beijing announced that the reactor would be for "peaceful uses" and subject to international inspection. But Chinese leaders still have not honored a months- old Administration request for a thorough private explanation.
 China also persisted in playing games with missile sales. U.S. intelligence recently found that Pakistan has started constructing mobile launchers apparently for the Chinese M-11 missile. Its range falls short of agreed international limits, but could be extended. China has not signed on to these limits, but has indicated it would comply with them.
 While Administration officials are unhappy about all these subterfuges, they are loath to slap down China hard. They do not quite know what their boss in the White House wants. So, their inclination is to stress quiet diplomacy and a long-term process of rebuilding relations.
 To Senator Joe Biden, a key player in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that is not nearly tough enough. He calls China "a rogue elephant on weapons proliferation" and threatens to take away what China needs most from America -- its trading privileges as a most favored nation.
 It would be foolish to isolate China as Washington did from 1950 until the fateful Kissinger trip of August 1971. But strong action along the lines of the Biden approach, perhaps a conditional extension of trading status, is called for.
 Mr. Bush should have learned one thing from his experience with Saddam Hussein and with Chinese leaders: Coddling dictators to moderate their behavior does not work. Better for the U.S. to vehemently defend its interests, and let diplomatic contacts and trade slip to lower levels -- until new and more promising leaders gain power in Beijing.

HEADLINE: Let the City College Strikers Take Their Protest to Albany

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Some students at City College, CUNY, protesting proposed tuition increases and financial aid cutbacks, have shut down the North Academic Center, a building where the majority of classes is held. As a City College student, I am both frustrated and outraged by this action.
What is the good this strike is designed to serve? It does not relieve this student's financial burden; I work 20 hours a week, in addition to taking six courses, and each day that I am prevented from taking classes threatens the investment in time and money I've put into my education. 
 Does this strike send the right message to the right people? The professors and on-campus administrators have no say about tuition rates or whether students will receive more or less financial aid from the state. Preventing the professors from teaching and the administrators from taking care of nuts and bolts does not reduce student financial burdens.
Although the education I receive at City College is a steal (and I mean grand larceny, for its quality is tremendous) at $725 a semester, it is very hard for me to support myself in New York City and attend school full time. I therefore sympathize with anyone despairing over a greater financial load. But New York City and New York State are suffering a financial crisis, and everyone will have to give something up, including students at public universities.
It will be a challenge to come up with $900 more a year, if it comes to that. But if there are things worth a little blood, sweat and tears, isn't a college education one of them?
The strikers' demands are not those of every student at City College. Yet every student at City College, on strike or no, is being kept out of the classroom. Albany is the source of the strikers' woes, not Convent Avenue. Let the strikers take their protest to Albany.

HEADLINE: Let the City College Strikers Take Their Protest to Albany;
Only Path for Many

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Uncivil Disobedience" (editorial, April 12), your criticism of the striking City University of New York students, suggests they are neglecting other means of heading off the stunning tuition increases that promise to devastate their finances -- indeed, their educational aspirations. The alternatives you offer, however, betray the hypocrisy of law-and-order liberalism in the post-Reagan era.
There have been peaceful demonstrations: nobody noticed. Meetings with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo have been suggested and sought: he has indicated that he is actively uninterested in any such meeting or in alleviating the dire financial situation of these thousands of students. 
 More than half of CUNY students are from households of less than $22,000 yearly income; however, come August, they are going to be asked to find about $700 more to attend college. I wonder how many readers understand what this means in human terms. Throttling the CUNY system is among the most short-sighted of economizing measures imaginable, for it is almost the only path by which many young citizens of this troubled city can escape the tragic circumstances of the urban underclass, the waste and pointless suffering to which their childhoods have been witness.
Cutting budgets will hurt primarily the have-nots among us. This nation is sinking, sinking into self-impoverishment because we are not investing in ourselves.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell

 BODY:

'Nancy Reagan'
 Kitty Kelley's "Nancy Reagan" is still the best-selling book in the United States, but the rate of sale last week plummeted by almost two-thirds compared with the week before. It will still be No. 1 on the hard-cover nonfiction list in The New York Times Book Review on May 5, reflecting sales through April 20, but it is no longer selling several times faster than every other best-selling book. 
 The falloff is not unexpected, after the buying frenzy that followed the book's publication, by Simon & Schuster and the initial news accounts two weeks ago. In fact, some booksellers said sales also fell last week because they had pretty much sold it out during the first week of sales. This was said to be true at the B. Dalton/ Barnes & Noble chain, where sales "dropped substantially," a spokeswoman said, but largely because many stores in the chain were out of stock.
 
Pictures From the Gulf
 Two photographic records of the Persian Gulf war are in production for publication in the next few months.
"Triumph in the Desert," which Random House plans to publish on Memorial Day, May 27, will contain a foreword by Gen. Colin L. Powell, theChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The foreword will represent General Powell's first written appreciation to those who served in the Persian Gulf.
The book, a photographic record of the war, was conceived by Harold Evans, the publisher of Random House adult-trade books. He arranged for General Powell to write the foreword, and arranged for the main text to be written by Peter David, the international editor of The Economist in London, who supervised his magazine's coverage of the war in the Persian Gulf.
 Mr. Evans also assembled much of the art and the production team that has been working on an accelerated schedule. And he chose Ray Cave, a former managing editor of Time magazine, and Pat Ryan, former editor in chief of Life, to select and edit the 200 or so photographs, from photojournalists around the world.
Many suppliers for the $25 hard-cover book have reduced their fees, and Random House to pledge 50 percent of the net proceeds from its sale to the Gulf Crisis Fund of the American Red Cross.
Harry N. Abrams, the art publisher, and the professional photography division of the Eastman Kodak Company will co-publish "In the Eye of Desert Storm," a book with more than 180 color photographs of the gulf war by 25 photographers from Sygma, the international photo agency. The book is to be published in July ($24.95 paperback, $39.95 hard cover) and is to be edited by Eliane Laffont, the president of Sygma.
The introduction to the book is by C. D. B. Bryan, the author of "Friendly Fire." Mr. Bryan also contributed a short profile of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf to the "Triumph in the Desert," the Random House book.
 
Will He or Won't He?
 General Schwarzkopf himself has apparently not yet made up his mind whether to write a book, or he is not yet willing to say whether he will write one. While publishers and agents say the General could pretty well write his own ticket and while some acknowledge having approached him with offers, they say he has said only that he has not yet made a decision.
 
Books by Booksellers
 Most book awards are chosen by writers or librarians, but the $5,000 Abby Award is chosen by booksellers -- specifically, the members of the American Booksellers Association.
Early this year, each member bookstore was asked to nominate five books they enjoyed selling during the previous year, regardless of subject matter or publication date.
 "With this award we wish to focus attention on the so-called midlist books of quality, in hopes that they will achieve the recognition they deserve," said Bernard Rather, executive director of the association.
The winner is "The Little Tree," by Forrest Carter, the autobiographical account of its author's boyhood in the 1930's with his Eastern Cherokee Hill country grandparents. Published by Delacorte Press in 1976, three years before the author's death, it was reprinted in trade paperback by the University of New Mexico Press in 1986 and has since sold almost 250,000 copies -- making it one of the biggest selling books in that press's history.
Runners-up for the Abby award were "The Civil War" by Geoffrey Ward with Ric Burns and Ken Burns (Alfred A. Knopf), "Cold Sassy Tree" by Olive Ann Burns (Ticknor & Fields and Dell), "The Shell Seekers" by Rosamunde Pilcher (Thomas Dunne/ St. Martin's Press and Dell) and "When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple," edited by Sandra K. Martz ( Papier-Mache Press ). "When I Am an Old Woman," an anthology of stories, poems and photographs about growing old, has sold 150,000 copies since its publication three years ago by Papier-Mache, a small press in Watsonville, Calif.

New York Fed Official Takes No. 2 Job in Boston

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Cathy E. Minehan, the official who has been responsible for the nerve center of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- its electronic payments system -- has been appointed first vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, effective July 1. In her new position, she will be the second-highest officer of the Boston bank, in charge of all of its affairs except for helping to formulate monetary policy, a job reserved for the bank's president, Richard F. Syron.
If New York is the crossroads of American financial markets, then the electronic payment system of the New York Fed is clearly the middle of the intersection. Its computers and phone lines are the heart of a system through which New York banks send or receive more than $1 trillion each day in more than 100,000 transactions with other American banks. At the same time, payments are made through the system for another $1 trillion of foreign currency trades. 
 In her 23 years at the New York bank, Mrs. Minehan worked in the budgeting, check processing and planning departments. Since 1987 she has been in charge of the accounting and electronic payments group. That group includes the operation of the "Fed wire," which is used to execute large transactions. Quick, reliable service on the Fed wire is crucial to banks and securities firms, which need to send and receive funds that will be immediately available for spending or investment.
As the Fed has pushed banks in the last few years to change their use of the payments system to avoid overdrafts during the day on their Fed accounts, Mrs. Minehan has emerged as a national expert on the subject. "Banks are now taking steps to control their intraday risk, though the concept still needs refining," she said.
Another matter receiving more attention, she said, is the danger of mechanical failures, especially since a fire last summer cut off power to parts of Manhattan's financial district, including the New York Fed, for several days.
After a burst water-cooling pipe disabled two of its three emergency generators, the New York Fed managed to avoid declaring a bank holiday by shifting its payment system operations to a backup operation in Pearl River, N.Y. Mrs. Minehan said the experience was serious enough to prompt consideration of a third backup system, beyond the emergency generators and the Pearl River operation.
Mrs. Minehan is also hopeful that moves will be made to eliminate, or at least reduce, the physical handling of billions of checks a year. "I was hearing about the coming of the checkless society more than 20 years ago," she said, noting that the Boston Fed now has a pilot program for recording the information on checks by computer and electronically forwarding the information.
Mrs. Minehan and her husband, Gerald, who is in charge of examiners for multinational banks at the New York Fed, plan to relocate to the Boston area.
"We love Montauk, and I expect we will learn to love the Cape," she said. She enjoys downhill skiing, but says she spends much of her free time transporting her 8-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter to soccer matches.

HEADLINE: White House Details Flights by Sununu

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
Under pressure to account for John H. Sununu's use of Government airplanes, the White House today released documents showing that it paid for 49 flights by the chief of staff over the last two years, including four trips to mountain resorts where he made speeches and also went skiing.
But the documents also showed that Mr. Sununu or Republican Party organizations were charged for 28 other trips by Mr. Sununu that were listed as political or personal business. 
 The White House released the documents at President Bush's personal order in an effort to back up its assertions that Mr. Sununu had followed Federal policy on using military airplanes. That policy allows him the use of a military plane so he can be in constant, secure voice contact with the White House, but that payment must be made for all non-official flights at the going commercial rate for a coach-class ticket, plus $1.
 
Criticism on Capitol Hill
 In one case, Mr. Sununu paid $167 for a flight on April 20, 1990, from Key Largo, Fla., where Mr. Bush was staying, to West Palm Beach, to visit Mr. Sununu's parents. The airplane had to be flown from Washington to pick him up. From West Palm Beach, the plane flew him at goverment expense to New York, where he was interviewed by CBS News and spoke at a police breakfast, and then flew him back to Washington. The price tag for the trip, at the rate the Air Force calculates the cost of his airplane: $23,670.
The expense of Mr. Sununu's trips has stirred strong criticism on Capitol Hill and has vexed Mr. Bush because it involves the head of a Presidential staff that is under strict orders to avoid even the suggestion of impropriety.
 
Inquiry Begun by Democrats
 Democratic lawmakers have begun an investigation to review, on economic and security grounds, the practice of having the White House chief of staff and the national security adviser fly on Government planes. From an ethical standpoint, lawmakers want to know whether Mr. Sununu has billed Washington for trips whose official function might be debatable.
"I don't think that anybody inside or outside of the White House can help but be distressed at the use of Government equipment in this fashion," said Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Committee on Government Operations, which asked for the inquiry.
"On the face of it, it raises serious questions of judgment," Mr. Conyers said, citing among other things the trips to ski resorts.
Mr. Sununu's flights have become especially controversial in Washington because they involve a man whose unyielding management techniques and abrasive negotiating style have left him with a stock of ill will and without many willing defenders on the White House staff and on Capitol Hill.
 
The Flights Hit a Nerve
 Nationally, interviews on television in recent days suggest that it has hit a nerve with ordinary travelers who have been forced to deal with delays caused by congestions, travel disruptions from failing airlines and security measures prompted by the Persian Gulf war.
So far, the documents showed that Mr. Sununu has paid $14,391 for non-official flights, including four listed as personal, and tickets for his family on political and official trips. Party organizations have paid $32,653 more and still owe the Federal Government nearly $21,000 for airplane trips in the past six weeks, the documents show.
The documents do not say when the payments were made. Mr. Sununu's office said there had "never been a backlog" and that none of the payments had been made after the articles on his traveling first appeared.
The White House also documented about 45 flights by Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, who has made classified trips that were not listed. The list included missions abroad, trips to brief former Presidents and an official trip to New York for a dinner at which the host was Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State and a former colleague of Mr. Scowcroft.
There was one personal trip, an eight-day skiing vacation in March with his daughter, for which Mr. Scowcroft paid $1,052.
Mr. Scowcroft's office said he was involved in negotiations on the unification of Germany and preparations for a NATO summit at the time and needed to stay in contact with Mr. Bush during his flights.
 
Appearance a Consideration
 The Federal policy, as released today by the White House, says that when officials plan a vacation "for a period of time which makes their immediate return unlikely, the travelers should evaluate the use of military air transportation on the basis of appearance or impropriety."
Mr. Scowcroft's trips have not been at issue, but the White House released a list of them because he is the only other official authorized to use military planes on non-government business.
According to the documents, Mr. Sununu has not paid for any of several trips to his home state of New Hampshire, all of which were billed as official or party business. Most recently, Mr. Sununu flew up on Friday to address the Manchester Republican Party's Robert Frost Award Dinner and spend the weekend, returning to Washington on Monday.
The White House pays for Mr. Sununu's official trips from its travel budget.
At the $3,945 hourly rate that the Air Force assigns to the modified Gulstream jet that Mr. Sununu uses, and figuring flying time of two and a half hours, that trip was worth $9,862. The party organization was billed $519, the going rate for a coach-class ticket on that route.
 
Comparisons Called Distorted
 The White House argued that such comparisons were distorted. Officials said the far larger sum did not actually leave the Federal coffers at that rate since the airplanes are rarely idle; they carry other officials and dignitaries and go on training and maintenance flights.
The documents showed that Mr. Sununu and his wife, Nancy, traveled to Vail, Colo., in December 1989. Mr. Sununu flew at Government expense to address a Ski Magazine conference and The Times-Mirror newspaper organization. He also went skiing.
Last December, he made a similar trip to Aspen and flew to New Hampshire in February 1990 and February 1991 for a fund-raiser at a ski resort for a foundation named for Christa McAuliffe, one of the Challenger crew. Mr. Sununu spoke at both events and went skiing, his office said.
 
Trips to Boston Dentist
 According to the documents, Mr. Sununu went to Boston to visit his dentist twice. His office said they were follow-up visits to continue work started earlier.
Official explanations of the policy on military flights have been contradictory.
At first, the White House said Mr. Sununu and Mr. Scowcroft were required to use military aircraft at all times. On Monday, Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's press secretary, said they were "authorized" to do so.
The documents today include an Aug. 4, 1987, memorandum from then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz to President Ronald Reagan in which he said the national security adviser and chief of staff "should always travel on Air Force planes."
"I agreed with your reaction that they should be told to do it this way and not to be given an option," Mr. Shultz wrote.
Accompanying documents spelling out the policy do not say whether the officials should or must use military aircraft.

HEADLINE: Collector Is in Line To Head Modern

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
Agnes Gund, a collector, art educator and vice president of the Museum of Modern Art, is expected to be named president of the Modern in June, when Donald B. Marron, the current president, steps down after a five-year term.
Museum officials would not confirm reports that Ms. Gund will be elected when the board meets on June 12. "I've heard the rumors," is all Mr. Marron would say. 
 Richard Oldenburg, director of the museum, said, "Obviously, she's a leading possibility, but the election won't be until June, and the trustees will make the decision." A secretary in Ms. Gund's office in New York said she was out of town and could not be reached for comment. But others close to the museum said Ms. Gund was an odds-on favorite for the nonpaying job, one of the most prestigious in the world of cultural volunteerism.
"Sure, she's going to get the job, if the trustees elect her," said Philip Johnson, the architect, who is a longtime trustee of the Modern. "And why shouldn't they? She's done great work at the museum, she has a wonderful eye for art, and she's extraordinarily energetic, strong and able to cope."
 
Financial Ups and Downs
 Whoever takes the post will do so in an era of strong financial gain for the museum, but also of problems. The Modern has not had one of its best years. It will announce a substantial deficit for the fiscal year that ends June 30. In recent months attendance, membership and bookstore sales have dropped, a decline officials attribute to the impact of the recession and the war in the Persian Gulf, which has affected tourism. The museum has also lost $200,000 in state aid. "We are in the same boat as other museums," Mr. Oldenburg said yesterday. "It's a disturbing trend around the country, but particularly true in New York."
But the longer-term picture is encouraging, museum officials say. Under Mr. Marron's stewardship, the endowment has increased significantly, from $26 million in 1985 to $59 million in 1990. The museum's annual fund, supported by donors every year, has also increased from $2.5 milli0n to $3.8 million, contributing to an operating budget of $46 million a year. And the Modern has initiated a chairman's council, under the leadership of David Rockefeller, its chairman, aimed at increasing corporate and personal donations.
Overall, the new president will have the continuing fiscal concerns "of most museums," Mr. Oldenburg said. Another problem is the Modern's urgent need to expand its space for contemporary art, which has had officials considering the possibility of digging under the its famous sculpture garden to provide additional exhibition areas.
Another long-range goal, Mr. Oldenburg said, is the expansion of the museum's audience "in terms of the multi-cultural world around us, through education and other means."
He praised Ms. Gund as "a very important and effective person at the museum" for her "deep commitment to contemporary art, as a major collector and generous donor of works," and for her "belief that museums have a significant role to play in art education." And he added, "She likes and respects artists and enjoys their company and has been very good for the museum as an ambassador and interpreter of that world."
In the art world, Ms. Gund, who is married to Daniel Shapiro, a lawyer, is known not only as a major collector of contemporary art but also as the founder, in 1977, and president of the innovative Studio in a School Association. A nonprofit organization that brings artists into New York City public schools to work with children and teachers, the association has also helped re-establish art programming curtailed in the 1970's by financial strictures.
In 1988, Ms. Gund and the Studio in a School Association won the Governor's Art Award, an honor conferred annually by the Governor of New York on individuals who have made the most significant contributions to the art life of the state.
Ms. Gund, who is 52 years old, was born and raised in Cleveland, where her father was a prominent banker. A brother, Graham Gund, a leading architect in Boston, is also well known as a collector of contemporary art and a patron of the Museum of Fine Arts there.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Aboard the Persian Gulf Bandwagon

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
If their only clue to Senator Barbara A. Mikulski's stand on the use of force in Persian Gulf were the 1992 fund-raising appeal they recently received, thousands of women around the country would be in the dark.
"As I write this letter," the Maryland Democrat said, "Americans are rejoicing that our military men and women have defeated a deadly challenge in the Persian Gulf." 
 Without reference to the way she or 46 colleagues had voted -- against the use of force -- Ms. Mikulski wrote, "Women filled an unprecedented role in facing the military challenge in the Persian Gulf" and now "have a new role in facing economic and social challenges at home."
All the talk about domestic policy notwithstanding, the hot issue on Capitol Hill is still the Persian Gulf. Everyone is indignant at the suggestion that they would use matters of war and peace for political gain. But everyone wants a piece of it.
The posturing began with last month's bidding war on benefits for Persian Gulf veterans. Now the gulf is turning up in fund-raising pitches, in stirring passages in floor speeches and on agendas of obscure subcommittees that normally have nothing to do with military affairs. The House Committee on Government Operations, for instance, has suddenly taken great interest in the export of high-tech equipment to Iraq.
"To have a variety and mix of experts on defense matters suddenly develop all around the Congress is evidence of not just cynical but how even arrogant the process has become," Jerry Lewis of California, the House Republican whip, said Tuesday.
In her letter, Ms. Mikulski used the war as an attention grabber, then moved on to her record on domestic issues and the need for women in Congress. Insisting the Senator was not using the war for political purposes, Mike Morrill, her spokesman, said, "You can't send out a letter immediately following the war and not acknowledge there was a war."
Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee is also making the issue a tool to raise money. His twist is that his vote for the use of force hurt him.
"Now the war is over," he wrote to potential donors. "And the political aftershocks are being felt. The personal cost of my decision has been high. As I write to you this evening, I find myself a political target of those who opposed American involvement in the gulf conflict."
In a recent report, the Democratic Study Group, an organization of liberal Democrats in the House, told lawmakers that many Republicans had "taken partisanship well beyond the water's edge." But it went on to advise Democrats to remind the public that many weapons successfully used in the gulf "had their origins in Democratic Administrations."
Lawmakers do risk running into political danger when they seize on the war issue, as happened with Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican. In the aftermath of a fund-raising letter in February that made prominent mention of his support for the war, he was attacked by Republicans at home for exploiting the crisis.
As the afterglow of the war has diminished with reports of starving Kurdish refugees, Democrats have become particularly vocal in attacks on the President Bush's policy in the gulf.
Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, accused the Democrats of pressing the Kurdish issue in "a desperate search for cover for having been on the wrong side of one of the most critical votes of the post-World War II period."
One Democrat who made the rounds on the television talk shows this week, discussing the Kurds, was Representative Tony P. Hall of Ohio, chairman of the Select Committee on Hunger. Mr. Hall, back from visiting Kurdish refugee camp, said he resents Republicans who question his motives.
"It's amazing that they would try to bring a political issue into a situation in which there is a tremendous amount of malnutrition and death occurring, especially among children," Mr. Hall said. If his critics saw what he and others in his bipartisan group saw, he added, "I don't think a political word or phrase would ever come out of their mouth."

HEADLINE: Decline in U.S. Sales Pushes Du Pont Earnings Down 4%

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company reported yesterday that its earnings declined 4 percent in the first quarter. The company said declines in its domestic chemicals-based business more than offset increased earnings from sales of petroleum products.
Net income fell to $590 million, or 88 cents a share, from $615 million, or 90 cents a share. 
 Despite the decline, the Du Pont Company's results exceeded the expectations of analysts, who had been predicting earnings ranging from 75 cents to 85 cents a share. Du Pont stock closed at $41.125 yesterday, up 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Petroleum Earnings Rise 63%
 Sales for the period totaled $9.7 billion, an increase of 3 percent from $9.4 billion, largely attributable to petroleum sales by the company's Conoco Inc. subsidiary. Sales in other segments declined 2 percent, the company said, primarily because of a 6 percent drop in sales in the United States.
Edgar S. Woolard Jr., Du Pont's chairman, said the company's diversity prevented "dramatic downswings" in earnings while some segments of the business were depressed. He said the company expects to report increased profits "as the world economies recover."
Earnings attributed to petroleum operations rose 63 percent, to $322 million, as a result of a 15 percent increase in sales and higher prices. Earnings from chemicals declined 39 percent, to $78 million, because of the costs of withdrawing chlorofluorocarbons from the market and developing environmentally safer substitutes.
Fibers earnings declined 49 percent, to $85 million, as a result of charges to close plants and a decline in sales of carpet fibers worldwide. Polymers earnings were down 17 percent, to $68 million, because of what the company termed "the severe slowdown" in the automotive and construction industries in North America.
High inventories at electric utilities and generally warm weather were cited for a 20 percent decline in coal operations, to $48 million.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Keeps Police Hiring While He Cuts Budget More

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that New York City would press ahead with plans to expand the police force and crime prevention programs for youth, even as he called for deeper cuts in other city agencies to cope with worsening city fiscal probems.
"In tough economic times, it is especially important that we recruit and train these grass-roots guardians of public safety so that we can prevent crime, insure the safety of our people and rebuild our community of pride," Mr. Dinkins said in a statement released yesterday. 
 By affirming his commitment to the police, Mr. Dinkins ended a debate in his administration and authorized the Police Department to go ahead with hiring a new class of 2,000 officers who are to report next week.
But his announcement came on the same day that city commissioners were called to City Hall and handed lists of detailed budget cuts prepared by the Mayor's budget office, including thousands of possible layoffs, that go far beyond any cuts disclosed earlier by the administration.
 
2 Frantic Exercises
 The decision to go ahead with the police class came as the Dinkins administration was in the midst of two frantic budget exercises.
It is racing to close an unexpected $465 million gap in the remaining weeks of the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, through a series of temporary measures, like furloughs and speeded-up state aid payments.
At the same time it is preparing deep spending cuts and seeking concessions from unions as part of a plan to slash city spending next year. The Mayor is to present next year's budget to the City Council on May 10.
Mr. Dinkins has put next year's gap at $3.1 billion and has said the city has developed plans to close two-thirds of it, mainly through tax increases and spending reductions. To make up the difference, the city is seeking another $810 million in cuts in services.
But yesterday City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman predicted that this gap had grown by $500 million, to a total of $3.6 billion. The administration stuck to its gap figures but disclosed that it was seeking far deeper cuts from city agencies.
 
Commissioners Get the Word
 Instead of $800 million in cuts, the administration is developing contingency plans to cut as much as $1.3 billion in city services if it is unable to get concessions from city unions, officials said. These cuts will probably mean less street cleaning, slashes in hospital services, and deeper cuts in libraries and other cultural institutions.
And while in the past city commissioners were asked to draft cuts that were later negotiated with budget officials, this time budget officials, disappointed with the cuts proposed by some commissioners and agencies, drafted the latest round of cuts after little consultation with them.
Like patients at a dentist's office, commissioners and their aides sat on a hard wooden bench in the basement of City Hall before entering the City Hall chapel, where the Mayor's aides and budget officials presented each with a budget-cutting plan. The commissioners were given a chance to return today to raise objections.
 
Commitment to the Police
 The city's worsening fiscal plight was reflected in another critical way in the last few days. Yield, or the effective interest rate earned by investors, rose by two percentage points on short-term city notes in the last few weeks, to 6.5 percent. That occurred just as the city was preparing to sell $1.2 billion in additional notes because of a delay in state aid payments caused by a delay in the adoption of a state budget.
Traders attributed the change, in part, to overall market trends. But at least a percentage point, they said, was due to concern over the city's finances and worry about the state's budget problems.
But despite the worsening news, Mr. Dinkins affirmed his commitment to an expensive plan, financed through property- and income-tax increases, to add 3,500 police officers over the next six years, expanding the criminal justice system and providing funds for services for youth and the elderly.
Under an agreement with the State Legislature, the city promised to continue to expand the police force or risk losing a portion of the tax increase.

HEADLINE: Soviet Excerpts: Accord With the Republics

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a joint statement by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and leaders of nine Soviet republics, issued yesterday and translated by Tass, the Soviet press agency:
The crisis of our society continues to intensify. Society is being torn asunder by social and interethnic conflicts. Production is plummeting. People's living standards decline, posing a threat to the provision of people with basic necessities. Law and order and discipline in the country have been seriously disrupted. Acute problems that have been piling up for decades and painful difficulties of the transitional period and errors made during perestroika have complemented one another. 
 The President of the U.S.S.R. and leaders of top state bodies of the union republics -- the Russian federation, the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Tadzhikistan, Kirghizia and Turkmenia -- upon having discussed the situation in the country at their meeting on April 23, 1991, deemed it necessary to take concerted actions without delay.
Participants in the meeting believe that taking resolute measures to restore the constitutional order everywhere and strict compliance with current laws, pending the adoption of a new union treaty and a constitution of the union, is an indispensable condition to stabilize the situation in the country. . . .
 
A New Treaty
Concluding a new treaty among sovereign tates, with an eye to the results of the recent all-union referendum, is top priority for overcoming the crisis. In this connection participants in the meeting regard the following as necessary:
*To finalize work on a draft new union treaty soon so that an agreed-upon document could be signed by delegations from the above-mentioned republics.
*Not later than six months after the treaty is signed, a new constitution of the U.S.S.R. based on the provisions of the treaty on the union of sovereign states should be prepared and brought up for adoption at a congress of the U.S.S.R. people's deputies.
*Following the adoption of a new constitution, the election of union power bodies, provided for by the treaty and the constitution, should be prepared and held.
*The normal functioning of the power bodies of the union and republics and councils of people's deputies of all levels should be insured throughout the transitional period.
*The top leaders of the union republics taking part in the meeting, while recognizing the right of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Moldavia, Georgia and Armenia to independently decide on the question of accession to the union treaty, at the same time consider it necessary to establish the most-favored-nation treatment for republics signing the union treaty, within the framework of a single economic space formed by them.
 
Limits on Sales Tax
Recognizing that all factors that have a negative effect on the living standards of the population were not taken into account during the reform of retail prices, participants in the meeting consider it necessary to take a number of additional measures for the social protection of citizens, particularly small-incomed ones. The measures are as follows in particular:
*Cancel the 5 percent tax on the sale of goods that are in everyday demand. The U.S.S.R. Cabinet of Ministers and the governments of republics shall determine a list of such goods within a week.
*The U.S.S.R. Cabinet of Ministers and the governments of republics within two weeks shall consider the real prices situation and take coordinated decisions on issues that heighten social tension most of all.
*To take measures to make up for price increases in student dining-rooms and school snack bars and reconsider new tariffs on railway and air transport with an eye to lowering them.
*To make a decision within a month on the indexation of incomes.
With due regard for the above-mentioned agreed-upon decisions, the leaders of the union and republics are calling on miners and all workers to call off strikes from economic and political motives and catch up on production shortfalls soon.
Taking into account the exceptionally acute crisis situation in the country, the leaders of the union and republics regard as intolerable any attempts to attain political ends through incitement to civil disobedience, strikes, or calls for the overthrow of the existing lawfully elected state power bodies.
Participants in the meeting are aware that all these measures to stabilize the situation and overcome the crisis are inconceivable without radical enhancement of the role of union republics.

HEADLINE: Judge Rejects $100 Million Fine For Exxon in Oil Spill as Too Low

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
A Federal district judge in Alaska today rejected a plea agreement the Exxon Corporation negotiated with the Justice Department in March, saying the $100 million criminal fine in the Exxon Valdez oil spill was too small.
The judge, H. Russel Holland, said his decision was partly in response to growing protests from Alaskans, members of Congress and prominent environmental groups. The ruling jeopardizes the separate $1 billion agreement Exxon reached with the Government and the state of Alaska to settle civil violations of environmental law stemming from the nation's worst oil spill on March 24, 1989. 
 "The fines that were proposed to me were simply not adequate," said Judge Holland. "They do not adequately achieve deterrence. I'm afraid these fines send the wrong message, suggesting that spills are a cost of business that can be absorbed."
He added, "There is no question that the Exxon Valdez oil spill was off the chart."
Exxon has done well recently, announcing today that it made $2.2 billion in the first quarter of the year, its highest quarterly profits since it was founded in 1882. [Business Day, Page C1.]
The judge's action, which cannot be appealed, throws into doubt the $1.1 billion agreement arrived at by the Government, Exxon's chairman, Lawrence G. Rawl, and Gov. Walter J. Hickel of Alaska. Divided into civil and criminal sections, the agreement was the largest ever proposed for an environmental disaster, and second in value only to the $1.25 billion the Government received in 1988 from Texaco Inc. to settle charges that the company set excessive prices for petroleum products in the 1970's.
While judges routinely accept plea bargains, a highly unusual provision of the arrangement was the chance for the public to express its views to Judge Holland as he decided whether to approve the plea agreement on the criminal charges. Judge Holland noted today that the letters he received criticizing the size of the penalty proved persuasive. The fine, he said, did not "adequately punish the defendant for the crime for which guilty pleas are offered."
 
Exxon's Options
 Judge Holland gave the company 30 days to decide whether to withdraw its guilty pleas to four criminal misdemeanor violations of Federal environmental law and face a criminal trial.
A Justice Department lawyer said today that if the company decides not to withdraw its guilty pleas, Judge Holland has the option of issuing a sentence, which could include fines of up to $700 million. The Justice Department also said there was a slim chance that Exxon and the Government would open negotiations to reach another criminal plea agreement.
A provision in the civil settlement allows Exxon to withdraw from that agreement within 10 days if a court rejects the criminal plea. Exxon's executives now must decide whether it wants to abide by the separate $1 billion civil settlement.
Both houses of the Alaska Legislature, whose approval is required for the civil settlement, have already expressed dissatisfaction with many of its main provisions. "The question is how does the Legislature now accept the settlement when a part of it has now been rejected," said Terence O'Malley, a spokesman for a special House committee considering the settlement.
Given the legal, economic and political uncertainties introduced today in the case, Federal lawyers who helped negotiate the settlement and Charles E. Cole, Alaska's Attorney General, said they feared the pact would collapse.
 
'A Lot of "Ifs" Now'
 "We have to await further developments," Mr. Cole said in an interview today. "There are a lot of 'ifs' now. If Exxon terminates the civil settlement, or if the State Legislature disapproves, it's going down the drain."
Negotiated over 57 daysJuneau, the $1.1 billion agreement was novel in almost every respect. The civil agreement called on Exxon to pay $900 million over the next 10 years to reimburse the state and Federal governments for scientific studies of Prince William Sound and to restore shorelines, tidal zones and animals harmed by the 11-million-gallon spill. If additional damage was found after 2001, the agreement also had a clause that required Exxon to pay $100 million more over four years for environmental restoration.
Completed in Washington before midnight on March 12, the pact was hailed the next day by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, and the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, William K. Reilly. They said the pact was the strongest message ever sent by the Government that pollution violations would be aggressively investigated and prosecuted.
Prominent national environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society and the Natural Resources Defense Council, also initially praised the agreement.
 
Rawl's Damaging Remarks
 But hours later, in a separate news conference at Exxon's headquarters in Irving, Tex., Mr. Rawl announced that the $1 billion settlement and the $100 million fine would "not have a significant effect on our earnings." Mr. Rawl expressed little regret over the spill, and said in the two years he had had to deal with the effects of the oil spill, his most painful moments were usually caused by bad publicity.
"Mr. Rawl's comments were incredibly arrogant," said Hope Babcock, the general counsel of the National Audubon Society. "In setting a tone for the company, he completely failed to acknowledge any culpability or responsibility for the damage that occurred. There was a total lack of remorse for what happened and that is a basic tenet of the criminal justice system."
Pressure to undo the agreement increased earlier this month when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a summary of 58 scientific studies conducted in Prince William Sound that showed the spill took a much greater toll on wildlife, shorelines, tidal zones and the valuable herring and salmon fisheries than previously suspected. Hundreds of thousands of birds died after the spill, thousands of otters drowned in the oil, and fish fry exhibited abnormally high rates of birth defects.
The new data upset many Alaskans, who became even more angry when they learned that the complete scientific studies, paid for by Federal and state taxpayers, would remain secret, along with studies of the value of the damage. In interviews, the economists who conducted the studies say the spill caused $3 billion to $5 billion in damage to Prince William Sound. Public hearings earlier this month in villages around the sound attracted hundreds of opponents.
In the last 10 days, disatisfaction with the agreement spread out of those villages, reaching Anchorage, Juneau, Washington and New York. In 1989, the Exxon Valdez spill came to represent more than a terrible soiling of the water, becoming a lasting and transcendant symbol of environmental destruction. Many Alaskans believed the penalties for Exxon should achieve a similar symbolism, sending a powerful message to all who cause ecological harm.

HEADLINE: Wang Loss at $48.9 Million

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass. April 24

 BODY:
Wang Laboratories Inc. said today that it had lost $48.9 million in its third fiscal quarter. The computer company blamed the sluggish economy for hindering efforts to turn around its finances.
The results for the three-month period ended March 31 compared with a loss of $146.6 million in the quarter a year earlier. 
 Revenue for the period was down significantly to $499.7 million, compared with $593.5 million during the quarter a year earlier.
Wang, which has been hurt by a computer market downturn that has hit other companies as well, has been struggling to rebound for more than a year.
Wang's chairman, Richard W. Miller, said that while his company was able to report a $2.6 million profit in its first fiscal quarter, "economic and industry conditions have slowed the momentum which the company had achieved through its turnaround programs."
While Wang has introduced products and strategies to generate new revenue, these sales have been outpaced by drops in the company's traditional businesses, Mr. Miller said.
Despite the losses, Mr. Miller said, Wang was in its strongest cash position in 18 months. In the most recent quarter, Wang had $194.1 million in cash or cash equivalents.
Wang, which has laid off thousands of workers in recent years, said it was considering further steps to control costs but declined to say whether more layoffs might be needed.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Report Forecasts 3% Growth

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund predicted today that the world's economies would rebound briskly in 1992 after weak growth this year -- but the rebound might never materialize if the United States recession fails to end soon.
The I.M.F., in its semiannual outlook report, said worldwide economic growth was likely to slow to an average of 1.2 percent in 1991 -- barely enough to avoid recession -- from 2.1 percent last year. But the fund predicted an average growth rate of nearly 3 percent next year, mainly on the strength of recoveries in the United States, Britain and Canada. All are now in recession. 
 "If the United States recession lasts longer than we anticipate, then, yes, the whole world will be adversely affected," Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, director of the outlook report, said at a news conference. "But I think the recession will be a short one. You can say you heard that here."
The fund attributed the 1991 slowdown, involving virtually every region of the world, to disruptions resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis, the North American and British recessions and sharply falling output in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
 
Recovery Expected Soon
 Economic growth in the United States will average only two-tenths of 1 percent this year, down from 1 percent last year, the fund estimated. But with a recovery starting this summer, the nation's gross national product, covering all of the goods and services produced each year, would rise to an average of 2.7 percent in 1992 -- a forecast roughly in line with the Bush Administration's projections and those of many private forecasters.
Indeed, as the basis for its optimism about the United States, the monetary fund cited many of the reasons that American economists have put forward to support a widely held view that the recession will end by this fall, roughly a year after it began. Interest rates have fallen sharply in recent months, encouraging consumers to borrow and spend again, and inflation is easing, the fund said.
Fund officials also noted that inventories in the United States are low, which means that production to restock shelves can resume almost as soon as consumers step up their buying. American exports, key to a recovery from the recession, are also likely to remain strong, the fund said, even though the economies of two major importers of American goods, Japan and Germany, are weakening a bit.
American exports fell in March, partly because of weakening overseas economies. "There is a slump in Europe," Mr. Hernandez-Cata acknowledged. "But these countries are still strong enough to absorb enough American exports."
 
Endorsement of Fed Policy
 Expecting an upturn, the Federal Reserve Board has become reluctant in recent weeks to continue pushing down interest rates as a means of stimulating the economy and insuring the expected upturn. Jacob Frenkel, the I.M.F.'s research director, in effect, endorsed the American central bank's monetary policy.
"This is not the time for an activist monetary policy," Mr. Frenkel said. He said the Fed should take its cue from the marketplace. If rates fall naturally because the American economy weakens unexpectedly or inflation becomes less and less of a problem, "then the Fed should not resist also lowering rates," he said.
The report said the currencies of the United States, Germany and Japan were roughly in the proper alignment. The report suggested that none of the three should alter interest rates to change the value of their curriences. "The dollar has recovered markedly since February, and this has alleviated concerns about the weakness of the dollar," the report said.
The report also included these major points:
*World trade will shrink this year because of the economic slowdown, and rebound strongly next year. The United States' share of total world output has declined, partly as a result of the recession, "while the shares of Japan, West Germany and the newly industrialized countries of Asia, where growth remains robust, have increased."
*The shifting growth rates are expected to reduce the United States trade deficit and also the trade surpluses in Germany and Japan -- in effect, narrowing the differences among these countries, not only in trade but also in their current accounts, which cover all international transactions, including trade.
*Oil prices, which averaged $16 a barrel last July, before the Persian Gulf crisis, and rose to as much as $40 a barrel in September, will average just over $17 a barrel in 1991, eliminating a source of inflation.
*Foreign debt among all of the developing countries rose by 6 percent in 1990, to a total of $1.3 trillion, and is likely to rise again this year and next, in every region of the world except, perhaps, the Western Hemisphere.
With Germany, Eastern Europe, and the Mideast drawing capital to rebuild, the developing world might have difficulty getting loans.

$90.1 Million Loss Posted By Goodyear

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, battered by intense price competition and deteriorating demand from auto makers, yesterday reported a first-quarter loss of $90.1 million. The company attributed the results to the downturn in the economy, special charges against earnings for costs associated with the layoffs of employees and the decision to abandon plans to establish a plant in South Korea.
In the first quarter of last year, the company reported net income of $20.9 million, or 36 cents a share. Sales for the quarter were down 7.3 percent, to $2.5 billion, from $2.73 billion in the quarter a year earlier. The results from the first quarter of this year include $65 million in pretax charges related to the furloughing of employees and the decision to discontinue efforts to establish a South Korea tire factory. 
 On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Goodyear shares were up 50 cents, closing at $21.50.
In March, Goodyear announced that it was eliminating 1,100 salaried jobs by the summer of next year. The giant tire company also announced at the time that it would take a pretax charge against earnings. Goodyear, which is based in Akron, Ohio, has eliminated thousands of salaried and hourly positions in the last two years, slashing its work force by about 9 percent in that period.
Like other major international tire companies, Goodyear has been bruised by a number of difficulties, including intense price competition, a sluggish automobile market and narrow margins. Goodyear has also suffered from operating an unprofitable 1,750-mile crude oil pipeline between California and Texas, which it bought in 1985 as a way to diversify. Although the pipeline is designed to carry more than 400,000 barrels of oil a day, it is now handling only about 100,000 barrels, a result of low customer demand.
In the tires and related segment of Goodyear, operating income for the first quarter fell to $62.8 million, from $129.9 million in the period a year earlier. The company attributed the decline to $46.9 million in unusual charges. The company said sales in that segment fell 5.7 percent, to $2 billion.
Goodyear said that, on a unit basis, global sales declined 7.5 percent. The company said the decline was primarily a result of sluggish demand in the United States from automobile makers and a soft market for replacement tires.
The company reported an operating loss of $25.1 million in its oil transportation segment, which includes the pipeline. That compares with an operating loss of $14.6 million in the first quarter of 1990. "Oil purchase costs exceeded oil sales and pipeline tariff revenues, resulting in negative sales," the company said.
Harry W. Millis, an independent tire analyst based in Cleveland, said that if all the non-recurring items were excluded "the company would only have had a $5 million loss. That tells me that the actual operating numbers were better than the reported numbers and that we should be looking at black ink, based on seasonal factors, in the second quarter." Mr. Millis said he expects second-quarter earnings to reach about $20 million.
Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear's chairman and chief executive, said the company is focusing its attention "on quality, service, cost reduction and other fundamentals so that it will come out of this recession a stronger company."

HEADLINE: Chores? Strike Gives Celebrities an Opening

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
Barbara Taylor Bradford, who writes best-selling romance novels, is storing empty bottles and cans in a spare bathtub of her luxurious apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. They do add up, especially the cans of dog food for her bichon frise, who eats a special brand of diet food suggested by the veterinarian. "I don't know if you know the bichon frise," she said, "but they are prone to gain weight."
Eventually, Mrs. Taylor and her housekeeper will drag the bottles and cans to the street, a task normally done by striking building-service workers. But, like many privileged New Yorkers who are doing some of their own dirty work during the walkout, she makes light of the inconvenience. "I've lived through worse things," she said, "being English." 
 In an era when the rich seem to understand that they could be poor tomorrow, or perhaps in talks with bankers, there is a great deal of sympathy for the striking workers. Like everybody else, many prominent New Yorkers who live in the affected buildings are standing guard in their lobbies, running elevators and carrying garbage even as they talk about the workers' rights to have better salaries. For now, less than a week into the strike, their new burdens still seem like fun.
"It's early," said Jonathan Hadary, the co-star of "Gypsy." "Hopefully, it won't go on long." Late yesterday afternoon, he was planning to deliver mail to everyone else on his floor, a task that now falls to the first person who arrives home. "I should be in a longer show, I guess," he said. Many buildings have already decided to maintain security by keeping out people who don't absolutely need to get in. Like decorators. Like contractors. Like partygoers.
Mario Buatta, a decorator who has many rich clients, said the disappearance of doormen was creating a work stoppage in his field. "I spoke to an architect who is spending his time in the library," he said.
Tim Zagat, publisher of guides to restaurants and hotels, said no parties are allowed in his building on Central Park West for the duration of the strike. But slightly to the west, David Halberstam, the writer, was expecting 150 people to descend on his home last night for a party in honor of Alex Kotlowitz, author of the new book, "There Are No Children Here."
Mr. Halberstam, who ran the elevator in his building for two hours yesterday after noon, admitted that the volunteer who was scheduled for night duty would have quite a bit of work. But the 40 people who live in his West Side cooperative had not yet complained about doing their share, he said. There were, however, some suggestions that their compatriots be summoned back to town to do their duty. "Jonas Salk has an apartment here," said Mr. Halberstam, "but he's in San Diego."
 
More Familiar Than Neighbors
 While there is much joking about playing doorman and sorting garbage, there is also sadness for workers who are out on strike in a bad economy. Alexander H. Cohen, the theatrical producer, was planning to picket yesterday for two hours with the workers and then zip back into his building to run the elvator from 6 P.M. to 8 P.M., prime time in any building as the occupants come home.
Mr. Cohen, who lives on the West Side, said the small wage increase offered to the workers was "inhumane." After 25 years in the same building he said, the doormen he sees several times a day are more familiar to him than most of his neighbors. Unfortunately, he said, they should be doormen in fake life, not the real world. "I pay $2,800 for three days to be an elevator man in a movie for TV," he said.
In many buildings, residents volunteer to spend time in the lobby, checking visitors to make sure they are legitimate. Peter Jennings, the ABC anchor, has been doing his share of sitting in the lobby of his West Side building.
 
'I'll Bet They Would Help'
 So has Faith Stewart-Gordon, owner of the Russian Tea Room. "It's kind of a friendly atmosphere," she said. "Everyone is chatting away." In her East Side building, she said, the residents seem very sympathetic to the strikers. "Everybody is so concerned about New York right now, we would like not to have any more ill feeling. We would like to look forward, rather than be divisive." Although she has done a turn in the lobby, her shift yesterday was being taken by her housekeeper, Patricia Fredes, while she worked. "A lot of people are doing that," she said.
Richard Heffner, producer and moderator of "The Open Mind," an interview show on public television, said he has signed up, with his wife, for the 10 P.M. to midnight session this Friday, before the temporary security guard arrives to protect the building.
Asked what he would do if a mean-looking person showed up, he seemed surprised by the question. "What are you trying to do, scare me?" In an emergency, Mr. Heffner said, he would probably turn to the picketing workers. "I'll bet they would help," he said.
Not all doormen in the city are on strike. Wendy Wasserstein, the playwright, said the workers in her building at 1 Fifth Avenue are not on strike, although she was not sure how she would know if they decided to have a stoppage. Doormen in downtown buildings are not always as rigid in their ways as their uptown counterparts. "They're always giving me my dry cleaning as I'm leaving," she said.
In some residential buildings, employees have already settled with management. Sylvia Miles, the actress, said the owners of her building on Central Park South had signed an agreement with the workers, apparently fearing that if services declined, they would have to refund rent money. But some preparations for a strike were made. "I was going to do the mail," she said. "Thank god I didn't. I would have had to wear my glasses."

Congressional committee hearings on important issues often star a Cabinet official. But a chorus of three Cabinet members turned up for today's hearing by the House Agriculture Committee on the Administration's authority to negotiate trade pacts.
Secretary of Agriculture Edward R. Madigan, Labor Secretary Lynn M. Martin and the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, sat shoulder to shoulder for more than two hours this morning, defending the Administration's position in an unexpectedly bitter domestic dispute over international trade policy. 
 The Bush Administration wants the authority to negotiate two international trade agreements over the next two years and submit each one to a special Congressional ratification process in which no amendments would be allowed.
 
Some Opposition
 While one of the two, a proposed pact to liberalize world trade, has drawn little opposition, organized labor and environmental groups have fought granting the so-called fast-track authority for the other agreement, a free-trade pact with Mexico.
The Administration has had trouble responding to critics because it has not yet negotiated an agreement with Mexico and so cannot point to specific clauses intended to allay American concerns. "Quite honestly, we are handicapped in quieting the fears raised," Mrs. Hills said yesterday.
She said the United States could not obtain good trade agreements without the ability to guarantee that Congress would not undo a trade pact by adding many amendments. "No negotiating partner will give its bottom line knowing the bargaining can be reopened," she added.
Opponents of fast-track authority have put the Administration on the defensive by suggesting that American companies will move factories and jobs to Mexico to take advantage of lax enforcement there of worker safety and environmental laws. Some of the testimony in support of this argument has been lurid.
A Mexican woman testified before a Senate panel on Tuesday that her son was killed last autumn when his head, throat and right arm were destroyed by a mechanical grinder in an American-owned windshield factory in Ciudad Juarez. The factory did not provide safety training or equipment, she said.
A free-trade agreement with Mexico would allow multinational companies in the United States to move their factories south and "pay their laborers slave-labor wages," said Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of upstate New York. He favored the free-trade agreement with Canada that went into effect at the start of 1989 but now opposes fast-track authority for a pact with Mexico because the two economies are so dissimilar and because it involves the surrender by Congress of considerable influence to the Administration over the final shape of the agreement.
Under an unusual legislative mechanism created by Congress, the Administration's fast-track authority is renewed automatically unless either house passes a resolution of disapproval by June 1. A simple majority is needed for passage.
 
Growing Support for Cancellation
 "If the vote were taken today, I suspect you would not get disapproval," Rep. LaFalce said. But testimony in recent weeks has produced growing support for canceling the fast-track authority, he added.
The Administration and many economists insist that the best way to improve conditions in Mexico is through the prosperity that a free-trade agreement could bring. And Mrs. Martin testified that wages, employment and economic output in the United States would rise slightly if a free-trade pact could be reached.
When two congressmen said most of the auto-parts and food-processing factories in their districts had moved to Mexico, Mrs. Hills replied that this demonstrated that businesses most suited to operating there have already moved, regardless of any free-trade agreement.

HEADLINE: Cabbies Come Out Swinging as Riders Get Scarce

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
When New York boomed in the 80's, getting a taxicab was a fight. Now it is the taxi drivers who are fighting -- and swerving and speeding and crashing -- to get ever-scarcer fares.
While hardly models of decorum in the best of times, cabdrivers are responding to the increased economic pressure with an increase in reckless driving and violent confrontations between cabbies, say taxi officials, passengers and the drivers themselves. 
On the other hand, judging at least by the complaints filed, the drivers seem to be nicer to passengers. And it is easier to get a cab.
Sometimes dangerously easy, as when a man wearing a dark business suit stepped from the curb at 81st Street and Columbus Avenue to flag down a taxi last week. Two yellow cabs immediately raced toward him, narrowly avoiding a collision before screeching to a halt.
As the drivers honked their horns and hurled obscenities, arguing over who had reached the man first and thus whose customer he was, the man, looking bewildered, jumped into a third cab whose driver had stopped to watch the melee.
 
Aggressive Driving Reported
 "You can be killed just getting a cab in this town," the man said as the cab he chose sped away.
Since 1987, when the stock market plunged, the number of customers complaining that taxi drivers are speeding, running red lights and violating other traffic rules has been steadily increasing, according to the Taxi and Limousine Commission, which licenses the industry's 40,000 drivers. At the same time, the total number of complaints against drivers, including verbal abuse, cheating and poor vehicle conditions, has been dropping, the commission says. While the commission's figures trace these twin trends over at least the last four years, industry and commission officials and drivers said it was their impression that in the last few months accidents had increased.
 
Some Rides Hard to Get
 Despite the hard times, it still can be tough to get a ride to Brooklyn, or for some non-white riders to catch a ride.
The taxi commission still receives a substantial number of complaints from passengers who say that some drivers refuse to stop for them or to take them to destinations in Brooklyn, upper Manhat tan, Queens and the Bronx.
Ronald Stoppelman, president of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents the owners of 2,500 medallion taxis, said the board had received a flood of complaints from drivers who say they are not making enough money because of the recession.
"When there is less money out there, drivers have shorter tempers and naturally are more aggressive in going after fares," Mr. Stoppelman said.
Healy Teppin, a taxi dispatcher at Grand Central Terminal, said that in recent weeks he had seen at least 10 fights between drivers over fares. Three involved collisions between drivers vying to pick up passengers who went out to the street to hail a cab because they did not want to wait in line.
 
'So Few Customers'
 "It's like a jungle out there, because there are so few customers during most of the day and night," Mr. Teppin said. "But it really gets crazy about 5 P.M., when a lot of people are coming from the train station, looking for cabs. I would advise people not to go out to the street to get a cab. The safest way is to wait on line."
Rebecca Bowser, a spokeswoman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, said that while she had no way of knowing if cabbies were driving unsafely, the commission had received reports in recent weeks from fleet owners and passengers that drivers were "more anxious" to get fares.
And while there are no official statistics on taxi ridership or revenues, dozens of fleet owners, drivers and taxi regulators said they had seen a decline in fares in the last two years.
The price of a taxi medallion has dropped to $125,000 from a record high of $144,000 in 1989, in part because of the economy but mainly because new regulations require new medallion owners to drive their own cabs.
Munwer Sayer, 40, who has been driving his own taxi for seven years, said that business had never been worse. "We are having to work so hard just to make ends meet that drivers have a very short fuse these days," Mr. Sayer said. "I saw a driver pull out a baseball bat the other day and threaten to hit another driver because he had cut him off."
Mr. Sayer said business was so slow that he now worked 16 hours a day instead of the 10 he put in a year ago to make the $200 he needs to cover costs and earn a decent profit. He said he paid $2,000 a month in mortgage fees for his medallion, $150 a month for gas, $300 a month for insurance and other costs.
"This is a tough business where drivers have to work very hard for every penny," said Mr. Stoppelman, who also owns a fleet of taxis, "It's not like they get a fixed paycheck every week. They get what they earn on the street."
Taxi drivers say that a 12 percent fare increase last year had been more than offset by increases in leasing rates and motor-vehicle taxes at a time when the economy is slow and fewer people are going out to restuarants and nightclubs.
As a result, Mr. Stoppleman estimates that for the last nine months, at least 20 percent of the 11,787 medallion cabs in the city have been idle at night because owners cannot find drivers to lease them.
"You just can't make enough at night because New York City's night life has all but died, and the taxi business is going with it," said Fared Dawat, who has been driving a fleet cab for 10 years. "During the 1980's you could always find a fare at the nightclubs and discos, but no one's going out anymore."
But Frank Mercado, a 28-year-old television producer, said he often was unable to get a cab late at night to take him from midtown Manhattan to his home in Harlem. Last Saturday, for instance, he tried. "I was dressed very nicely in a suit," he said, "but the driver said to me: 'I'm not going there. Period.' I had to get out in the pouring rain and look for another cab."
The number of complaints to the taxi commission that drivers refused to pick up some customers or take them to their destination increased to 1,467 in 1990 from 1,396 in 1989. Ms. Bowser, the commission spokeswoman, said most customers who were turned down were of darker skin color or wanted to go to places in northern Manhattan or the other boroughs.
But Mr. Stoppelman of the taxi trade board said: "Reality dictates that the driver's safety comes first, and nothing is worth a driver's life, even if it means passing up fares in these hard economic times.'
He called on the taxi commission to increase fares. Ms. Bowser, the taxi commission's spokeswoman, said the agency planned to conduct a fare review this summer to determine whether the driver's increased costs and decrease in revenue warranted a fare rise.

HEADLINE: For Remodelers, The Time Is Now

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
IF there is a silver lining in the recession and the sluggishness of the real-estate market in the Northeast, it may be that this is the moment to do long-postponed renovations. A buyer's market for houses is also a buyer's market for contractors who do remodeling jobs.
"It's the time to do something," said Linda Case, who heads Remodeling Consulting Services of Silver Spring, Md. 
 For one thing, prices have plummeted as contractors struggle to find something, anything, to see them through the recession.
"More contractors are sharpening their pencils and giving much better prices and much better value than in previous years," said Sandy Haft, the executive director of the chapter of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry that covers New York City and Long Island.
Douglas Peix, a Manhattan architect, said prices were 30 percent less than they were 18 months ago, and Richard Baronio, a Manhattan contractor, said supply houses had cut prices for lumber and hardware at least 20 percent. "And most labor has dropped, I would say, 25 percent," he said. "Maybe more."
Nationally, the recession's hit on the remodeling business has been erratic. Ms. Case said the East Coast had been hardest hit, the West Coast somewhat less affected and the Midwest virtually unscathed. In the New York area, architects say the drop in prices reflects the cautious mood of owners who no longer feel they can afford the ambitious, top-to-bottom home-improvement projects that were a kind of ritual in the 1980's.
"The thing that's hit remodeling is the fact that people's confidence in their house value is shaken," Ms. Case said. "In my memory, that's not been a factor before. We've lived with ever-rising house values, getting more and more valuable. That meant investing in remodeling allowed you to enjoy it and receive further return when you sold it."
Homeowners are doing only "the essential stuff," said Alan Lindenfeld, a Manhattan architect. "If it's a matter of doing a large project or just certain essential things, they'll do the essentials and say they'll do the rest next year," he said.
But contractors and trade associations say consumers can benefit from the lower prices and contractors' eagerness to keep work crews busy. Mr. Haft of the remodeling association said business had dropped 30 percent in the last two years.
"If you are in just the repair-replacement line, such as roofing, your business probably didn't suffer as much as contractors geared toward the upscale master bath and kitchen renovation work," said Alan J. Campbell, the executive director of the remodeling association. "Those were the types of purchasing decisions consumers could put off much more easily than repairing a leaky roof."
How different the remodeling business is from a couple of years ago, when people moving into new quarters were happy to pay the going rate and their only hope was that they could find a contractor who would complete the job and do it well. Now homeowners are no longer swapping stories of jobs abandoned in a shower of plaster dust by a contractor who left for more lucrative work. Instead, the talk is of contractors fighting to give the lowest bid and the earliest completion date.
But there are concerns that some homeowners are hiring unlicensed or unreputable contractors whose work will not measure up to building codes or fire laws. Customers should hire only licensed contractors and should not pay too much of their projected remodeling bills in advance, said a spokeswoman for the New York City Consumer Affairs Department, Linda Sachs.
 "It's hard to tell what the psychology is out there," said Vahe Tiryakian, a spokesman for the New York City Department of Buildings, which issues permits for renovations. "I personally would hazard the guess that smaller jobs are now coming to the fore."
Mr. Peix said he had estimated that a renovation in a three-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village would cost $210,000, but the bids came in at $150,000. The job involved redoing three bathrooms, gutting the kitchen and taking down the walls between the living and dining room.
Mr. Baronio told of a job in an apartment on Fifth Avenue at East 67th Street. "Had this been three years ago, it would have been $130,000," Mr. Baronio said. "In light of everything that's happened since then, I cut the price and came in around $100,000. Somebody else got the job for about $85,000."
Another of Mr. Peix's clients wanted to expand a Cape Cod-style house in West Islip, L.I. Mr. Peix sought five bids and accepted one for $160,000, $40,000 less than he had expected.
"It took this man 45 minutes to get there," Mr. Peix said. "That's a sign of the times, that he'd go that far." In the boom years of the 1980's, Mr. Peix said, contractors did not have to venture far from home base to find work.
The National Association of the Remodeling Industry estimated that consumer spending on renovation projects across the nation increased 10 to 15 percent a year in the 1980's. In New York City, Buildings Department officials say the value of renovation work declined from 1989 to 1990, and they expect the downward trend to continue in 1991.
Although the dollars spent on renovations are no longer increasing, the number of contractors seeking work is. The remodeling association attributes this to the slowdown that began with the stock market collapse in 1987. The New York City consumer affairs agency says it has granted 1,182 new licenses for contractors in the last year; on Long Island, Nassau County has 2,000 more contractors than a year ago and Suffolk 750.
Some are new-home builders who are trying their hands at remodeling because the recession put a dent in their primary line of work. Some contractors have been trying to drum up business by knocking on doors they would like to replace. A contractor in Maryland pulled out old estimates and called the prospective customers to see if the projects had a chance. That approach landed a $28,000 job that had been put on hold.
And sometimes no one gets the job. Mr. Baronio told of one nonprofit organization that was considering renovating the director's offices.
"They started with a budget of about $50,000," he said. "After several months of negotiations and back and forth, trying to figure out what they wanted to do, they call me to say their stocks had not performed as well as they had hoped, and they had $10,000 to spend, and what could we do for that. In the end, we did about $7,000 worth of work."
When business began to soften, Mr. Baronio said, most contractors hoped they could survive with the same prices they had charged in the 80's.
"As things continued to weaken," he said, "they slowly came around to the realization that they would have to charge less and cut down on whatever expenses they had."
The downward trend accelerated, many contractors said, in the weeks before the Persian Gulf war.
"I had clients with children who were verging on draftable ages," Mr. Peix said, "and they couldn't focus on improving the quality of the space they lived in. People are still a bit skittish, but they're beginning to talk more seriously."

Preventive Medicine

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
In the beginning, Sister Barbara Moran felt a little as if she'd been hit over the head with a board. She had the cubbies ready, the tiny tables and chairs, the cots for naptime, all the miniaturized impedimenta of the preschool. And then the children came.
Some of them had never owned a toy. 
 Some of them had never held a book.
Some of them had never sat at a table, or used a fork.
"I was thinking about reading stories," said Sister Barbara, looking back, "and we were dealing with kids who were not even socialized. They had been born and raised in welfare hotels where there were no tables and chairs. They had eaten all their meals with their hands. They had the quickest hands you've ever seen."
If you want to make a case for the importance of early childhood intervention in the lives of poor children, you can make it here, at The Nurturing Place. The staff graduated their first class last year, four kindergarteners who went out the door and into the public schools. All are doing well. Two made the honor roll.
The children who first arrived here 18 months ago, 2-year-olds with virtually no language, who hit and kicked and spit at anyone who tried to touch them, now introduce themselves to a visitor and try to palm off their lunchtime spinach. "It's a vegetable," says one little girl. A 5-year-old shows off by painstakingly printing his name. When he finishes the procession of tiddly letters, he looks up. How did I do? his eyes ask.
Some of the children here were lifelong residents of the hotels where the homeless were warehoused. Some had homes but lost them, and wound up with their mothers in the transitional housing at St. Joseph's Home. Some are the children of students at Kenmare, a high school for female dropouts. The home, the school and the child development center make up the York Street Project.
We are deeply dissatisfied with many of our social programs, if for no other reason than that they do not work. Education, welfare, crime have all come to seem like bottomless pits. Beneath them all is the dark sea of poverty.
There are lots of good programs that work with social ills, but at The Nurturing Place you see preventive medicine. The landmark study in this area was done in Michigan by the High/Scope Educational Research Foundation in 1984, and its results are staggering. It followed the progress of poor children who had been enrolled in a good early childhood education program at age 3. The dropout, teen-age pregnancy, arrest, unemployment and welfare statistics -- all were substantially lower for 20-year-olds who had been in the program.
Today a panel of experts is meeting to consider recommendations to the National Education Goals Panel, created after the 1989 Presidential education conference to chart the future of this country's kids. They will hear an updated High/Scope report that concludes: "Because we do not now spend enough tax dollars to provide all poor children with good early childhood programs, we wind up spending three times as much as the programs would have cost on largely ineffective responses to school failure, crime and unemployment."
There's been some debate about preschool programs, about the question of robbing children of childhood. That's an academic question at The Nurturing Place, where most of the children experience childhood for the first time. The biggest problem in the beginning was that the staff insisted on hugging and cuddling them. The mothers didn't like it. "My kids have to go back on those streets and survive," they would say. "They have to be tough." The kids in question were under the age of 4.
For some of these children, this all may be an oasis in a desert of a life. A few of the kids at The Nurturing Place have already disappeared into the nomadic migration of the urban poor, from shelter to shelter, from city to city. For a few months they began to blossom, to know Curious George, Big Bird and the feelings of security and stimulation. Then it was gone. Others are flowering still. "So smart, some of them," said Sister Barbara. "If we didn't have this, society would lose out on their talents." The High/Scope report says this is high yield for the taxpayers. And I believe it.

HEADLINE: Not the Best Census Ever

 BODY:
An embarrassed Commerce Department at last admits that far from "the best census ever," its 1990 enumeration missed more Americans than the 1980 census did. It's the first time in recent memory that a national headcount has been shoddier than its predecessor.
Instead of a nation of 249 million people, the department concedes after a follow-up survey, we number somewhere between 253 and 255 million. A uniform undercount involving all population groups would pose no special problem, but out of as many as six million uncounted, more than half are black or Hispanic Americans. They live in crowded cities, many refusing to cooperate out of poverty, ignorance or distrust. Whatever the reason, the failed census is an outrageous theft of power and economic benefits from those pockets of undercount. 
 That pledge of best ever was a weak answer to large cities and states demanding adjustment to the tally using the best statistical methods. The Bush Administration, still resistant, has until mid-July to decide whether an adjustment is feasible.
The decision, though technical, ought to begin with a sense of injustice. The miscount drains political strength and billions in population-based Federal benefits from the populous areas where uncounted poor people live. It robs states like New York, which already stands to lose seats in Congress, and California, the big population gainer for the decade. It stands to deprive the great cities of their fair representation in state legislatures.
The Commerce Department shows no sign of being moved by this injustice, but it frets openly about a cure. Officials wonder whether their survey data are accurate enough to apply at the local level across the land. The technical questions are not frivolous, but even if they can be solved, the department vows to cling to the miscount unless the adjustment is easy to explain and not politically disruptive.
That puts special pressure on Robert Mosbacher, the Secretary of Commerce, to allow some adjustment or come up with a very good explanation for not doing so. His position is especially delicate because he is expected to resume Republican fund-raising for the 1992 Bush re-election campaign, and census adjustment is an issue pressed primarily by Democrats.
So few states would gain or lose a House seat that the feared political disruption could be minimal. Meanwhile Congress can pass a law requiring an adjustment or at least disengage some categorical benefit programs from slavish reliance on an unadjusted, undercounted census.

HEADLINE: Don't Jump the Fast Track

BYLINE: By Lloyd Bentsen ;Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It seems inconceivable that the U.S. would deny itself the ability to negotiate the elimination of barriers to foreign trade. But that will happen if Congress derails the "fast track" authority for conducting trade negotiations.
Since 1974, fast-track procedures have been an effective mechanism for approving trade agreements. They require the President to consult with Congress during trade negotiations and Congress to accept or reject the agreement, with no amendments, when it is submitted for approval. 
 Why the fast track? We don't want a rerun of the problems of the 1960's. After Congress in 1968 rejected parts of an agreement reached in the so-called Kennedy Round of trade negotiations, our trading partners refused to come to the table until assured that any deal the President struck would be approved or disapproved by Congress, not amended unilaterally. For six years, progress in eliminating foreign trade barriers ground to a halt.
The immediate issue is whether we will disarm our negotiators at a crucial time. (The fast-track procedures will be automatically extended for two years unless the House or Senate votes by June 1 to discontinue them.) Killing this authority would doom the current Uruguay Round negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Today, GATT covers no more than one-third of world trade. The European Community spends more than $12 billion on agricultural export subsidies annually; international counterfeiters copy U.S. inventions with impunity; U.S. products face 100 percent tariffs in some foreign markets. These barriers might be eliminated or reduced in the Uruguay Round, but not if fast-track authority is revoked.
Eliminating the fast track would also prevent us from seizing the opportunity to reach a free-trade agreement with Mexico. Since 1986, Mexico has lowered its maximum tariffs from 100 percent to 20 percent, and scores of other restrictions have been lifted. As a result, our exports to Mexico have more than doubled since 1986, creating more than 400,000 new jobs for U.S. workers.
Free-trade negotiations provide an opportunity to build on that foundation. And free trade with Mexico can also keep and create good jobs in the U.S. Since 1979, 2.6 million U.S. manufacturing jobs have been lost to lower-cost operations, especially in the Pacific Rim countries. Companies that move there often relocate all of their production. By contrast, sharing production with Mexicans creates jobs in the U.S. In 1990, American-owned companies operating in Mexico bought $9 billion in components and other supplies made in the U.S.
Many members of Congress worry that the Uruguay Round and the negotiations with Mexico might wind up hurting important domestic constituencies.
That's why chairman Dan Rostenkowski of the House Ways and Means Committee and I wrote the President asking that he submit an action plan to Congress by May 1, telling us how he intends to address issues relating to potential U.S. job losses, Mexican labor standards and the effect on the environment. That response will be critical in determining whether the U.S.-Mexico (and GATT) negotiations proceed.
But let's keep one point in mind: Support for fast-track procedures does not commit anyone to vote for the final agreement.
Congress cannot afford to pass up any opportunity to boost U.S. exports. Last year, 88 percent of the nation's economic growth was attributable to increased sales to foreign countries. Exports offer the best chance to pull the U.S. out of the recession -- and to position us for the economic challenges of the 1990's and the next century. Negotiations offer our best hope to reduce trade barriers and increase U.S. exports. Let's keep them on track, the fast track.

HEADLINE: Rent Regulation Essential to Preserve New York's Middle Class

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Tap the Treasure in Rent Control" (editorial, April 9) is naive and one-sided. 
 Yes, by removing rent regulations, building owners and New York City would derive more revenue. And it is also true that some tenants pay less in rent than their incomes suggest they can afford.
Housing economists report that the allocation of about 25 percent of disposable income is the proper proportion to pay for housing. However, thousands of tenants pay in excess of 40 percent or even 50 percent of disposable income for rent. Would it be fair to raise their rents, without restrictions, or force their eviction because an owner can find someone willing to pay more?
How many more people would be rendered homeless or indigent if we lifted restrictions on an owner's avarice? Have we forgotten the bitter experience of vacancy decontrol in 1971-74, when rents and harassment of tenants both skyrocketed? In that period of precipitous rent increases, there was little recorded reinvestment of profits into the buildings.
Rent regulation and tenant protection are essential to protecting the endangered, middle class of New York.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Voters Sent a Message to Washington

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Tokyo Election Defeat Stuns Japan's Governing Party" (news article, April 9), you unfortunately missed an important political statement by the voters who overwhelmingly defeated Hisanori Isomura for Governor of Tokyo against the 80-year-old incumbent, Shunichi Suzuki. 
 Mr. Isomura was backed by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party national leadership, led by its general secretary, Ichiro Ozawa, and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. Mr. Suzuki was backed by the Liberal Democrats' Tokyo regional groups, defying their national leadership.
Behind the internal party struggle lay the Japanese public's festering resentment against high-handed Ozawa power politics and President Bush's humiliating treatment of Japan in the Persian Gulf crisis. Tokyo voters were merely registering their protest against the United States and the national leaders of the Liberal Democrats, whom they consider too subservient to Washington.
Last fall and again early this year, President Bush pushed Mr. Ozawa to circumvent the Japanese Constitution and send "noncombat" military forces to the gulf. Mr. Ozawa seized on America's push to establish the precedent of dispatching Japan's military personnel to a war overseas. His schemes were repeatedly rejected by the Japanese public.
However, the Liberal Democrats and the Government had agreed to pay $13 billion to the war costs of the United States-led allies, against the will of the majority of the Japanese (half of male adults and two-thirds of female adults were clearly opposed). Even those Japanese in the minority who grudgingly approved of the monetary contributions to the gulf war saw the payment as colonial taxes without representation levied by the United States.
To pass Japan's monetary contributions through the upper house of the Japanese Parliament, Prime Minister Kaifu and Mr. Ozawa needed the support of the conservative opposition parties, Komeito and the Democratic Socialists. Since these parties were opposed to Mr. Suzuki, the incumbent Governor of Tokyo, Mr. Ozawa hurriedly put up Mr. Isomura as a candidate of a Liberal Democrats-led coalition.
When the gulf war ended, President Bush invited the foreign ministers of Britain, France and even Germany to Washington for postwar consultation. Germany had pledged half as much in monetary contributions as Japan. But President Bush did not even go through the motions of inviting Japan. He even canceled his planned trip to Japan.
These political slights occurred when Mr. Ozawa and his candidate were gearing up for the campaign against Governor Suzuki. Suddenly, Mr. Suzuki, who had been written off as a lame duck, was revived by the strong sentiments of Tokyo voters for anybody but Mr. Isomura. Tokyo voters knew that Mr. Isomura's defeat would force Mr. Ozawa to resign as party general secretary and weaken the Kaifu Administration. At the same time, it would express their anger at United States diplomatic slights of Japan.
Mistakenly, Prime Minister Kaifu accepted President Bush's summons to California for a photo opportunity three days before the Tokyo governor election. Mr. Kaifu's subservient posture further fueled anti-Isomura sentiment among Tokyo voters.
Ichiro Ozawa got the message and resigned from his leadership position. Mr. Kaifu's days are numbered. For the first time in Japanese political history since the end of World War II, the closeness of Japanese politicians with the United States President became a political kiss of death. However, the Bush Administration does not yet grasp the serious diplomatic blunders that have unraveled United States-Japanese relations.
The United States and Japan need each other more than ever, now with the United States forced to tackle many economic, political, military and technological problems at home and abroad. The United States cannot afford to continue treating relations with Japan as if the United States dictates and Japan obeys. The United States must consult Japan fairly and seriously to put some substance into the new political and economic order of the world.

HEADLINE: TRUMP DISCUSSING EMPIRE'S BREAKUP TO PAY OFF BANKS

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
The empire that Trump built is about to be dismantled.
Less than nine months after signing a sweeping rescue package for Donald J. Trump, the banks that lent him nearly $2 billion to build his empire have abandoned the original agreement and are now close to signing tentative agreements that would give them some of his key properties. 
 In exchange, the banks, including Citicorp, Manufacturers Hanover and Bankers Trust, would release him from some of the hundreds of millions of dollars in loans that he personally guaranteed. Being released from these obligations reduces the prospect that Mr. Trump would have to file for personal bankruptcy if the loans soured and he had insufficient cash to make good on the guarantees.
Mr. Trump confirmed that tentative agreements were close.
"The negotiations are going very well," Mr. Trump said yesterday. "We've established excellent relationships with our lending institutions."
The new plan would effectively begin the unwinding of one of the largest and most visible financial empires built in the 1980's.
 
An Aura of Great Wealth
 Although Mr. Trump exuded an aura of great wealth, his empire was built largely on borrowed money. This has proved to be his undoing. Because he paid such high prices for many of his properties, many did not generate enough money to pay the interest on the loans underlying them. Although the banks allowed him to restructure his finances last summer in the hopes the arithmetic would work better, the sharp downturn in the economy that resulted from the Persian Gulf war, dashed those hopes.
According to bankers and confirmed by Mr. Trump, those agreements, as they stand now, would give almost all of his 50 percent interest in New York's Grand Hyatt Hotel to Bankers Trust. Citicorp would get his 27 percent stake in Alexander's, the department store chain. The Trump Shuttle airline would be taken over by NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, with several dozen banks getting an equity interest in the shuttle.
His 282-foot yacht would go to the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company, a subsidiary of American Express. And his Regency Hotel in Atlantic City would be put on the block, with most of the proceeds to go to Manufacturers Hanover.
Final terms on all of these arrangements are still being worked out, but the general outlines are expected to hold. The disposition of other properties, including the Plaza Hotel, has not yet been decided. It is possible that if Mr. Trump is not able to reach an agreement with one of the banks, he might throw one of the properties into bankruptcy and tie it up for several years. But the other transactions could still move forward.
One banker said yesterday that when the new agreements on the assets were completed, Mr. Trump's holdings would largely consist of equity in three Atlantic City casinos and in properties like the undeveloped Penn Central railroad yards on the West Side of Manhattan and commercial and residential space in the Trump Tower.
Last summer's plan gave Mr. Trump $65 million in new money and an agreement that revised nearly all his obligations and gave the banks new liens on his assets. Bankers said yesterday that that plan had been proved useless because even the assets that were expected to pay their own way had not met projections.
 
Collateral Was Put Up
 As part of the plan signed last summer, all of Mr. Trump's assets were put up as collateral for his outstanding loans. Before then, many of his loans carried little or no collateral, and had been granted on his signature alone. The rescue package gave Mr. Trump three to five years to sell or otherwise refinance the properties so the bank debts could be paid off. None of Mr. Trump's leading assets has been sold since the rescue plan was set up.
"That plan is dead," one of Mr. Trump's bankers said. "It was predicated on a lot of things like cash flow from the casinos, cash flow from the shuttle, and cash flow from the hotels. None of those cash flows have materialized."
Bankers in the talks said that with the recession and the rise in oil prices, the performance of Trump assets like the casinos in Atlantic City, the Trump Shuttle, and the Plaza Hotel had been hurt. Even without the overall economic turmoil, bankers openly doubted the valuation of many of the Trump assets.
According to the tentative plan, NWA would take a controlling equity stake in the Trump Shuttle. The senior and junior bank lenders, both led by Citicorp, will also get equity interest in the Shuttle in exchange for releasing Mr. Trump from his personal guarantees. The Trump Shuttle has a $245 million first mortgage on it and another $135 million that was borrowed with Mr. Trump's personal guarantee.
The Regency Hotel in Atlantic City would continue to be operated by Trump Plaza Casino, which leases it, but Manufacturers Hanover would have the right to sell it if the bank could find a buyer. The proceeds from the sale would then go to the bank to cover loans.
The Plaza Hotel in New York is one of the few big assets on which little has been agreed. Mr. Trump has plans to turn much of the hotel into condominiums, but no agreement has been reached yet on that property with Citicorp, the main lender.
 
Keeping a House in Palm Beach
 Mr. Trump says he is planning to subdivide his Palm Beach estate into something he will call The Mansions at Mar-a-Lago, which will feature eight large, adjacent developments. He also says he is planning to keep the 118-room main house for himself.
Mr. Trump and his chief financial officer, Stephen F. Bollenbach, are also negotiating to get the banks to pay the necessary operating expenses on many of the assets until the various restructuring plans are completed.
The banks are expected to finance not only the expenses of many of the properties, but also to provide additional extensions on many loans and to accept pieces of equity in the various assets in exchange for more lenient repayment terms on outstanding debt. The maturity of the $65 million loan that helped the developer escape bankruptcy last year is also likely to be extended.
 
Restrictions Flouted
 Bankers also say Mr. Trump regularly violated restrictions of last summer's agreement.
The bankers say Mr. Trump violated the terms of the rescue package within weeks of its signing. One proviso prohibited the developer from paying anyone more than $200,000 in a single year without the approval of the banks. Only weeks after the agreement was signed, Mr. Trump agreed to pay his wife, Ivana, whom he later divorced, $350,000 to run the Plaza Hotel. Last month, bankers said, he violated the agreement again by paying Mrs. Trump $10 million as part of the divorce settlement. In neither case, however, did the banks take any action against Mr. Trump.
 
Some Potential for Profit
 Two assets that Mr. Trump is retaining for now seem to have potential for future profit: the West Side railroad yards and the space he owns in the Trump Tower. The Trump Tower is current on its debt, and unless there is a drastic change over the next few months, it will begin to generate a profit when Galeries Lafayette, the French retailer, begins to pay rent in September on space it has leased there.
Prospects for the railroad yards are also better now that Mr. Trump and several civic groups have reached an agreement about the scale of the development for the more than 70 acres of empty lots. But a lengthy and expensive zoning process has yet to begin. If that, too, is favorably completed, the zoning will greatly enhance the value of the acreage. Chase Manhattan Bank, the leading lender on the property, is expected to cover most of the cost of the zoning process and may receive some equity for doing so.
 
New License for the Taj Mahal
 As for his biggest Atlantic City property, Mr. Trump last week won relicensing for the Taj Mahal casino, a billion-dollar, candy-colored giant that dominates the gambling business in that city. The New Jersey Casino Control Commission granted the extension of the license, but expressed great reluctance because it concluded that Mr. Trump did not prove that he was financially stable.
The commission told the developer to return on June 17 with conclusive proof that his finances and those of the Taj Mahal are stable. Mr. Trump and holders of the "junk bonds" that financed the Taj are preparing to file papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission that would give the bondholders 50 percent of the equity in the Taj in exchange for reducing the interest on the bond debt and extending the maturities of the bonds.

HEADLINE: Bold and Nimble Banker With Few Flops in Past

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
With a wall of television cameras facing him and a bevy of aides at his side yesterday, J. Terrence Murray, chief executive of the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, looked more like a politician on the campaign trail than a banker.
At a Manhattan news conference, Mr. Murray fielded questions about his bank's latest acquisition, the purchase of the failed Bank of New England, an audacious and controversial move. 
 The purchase is bold because of its size -- the Bank of New England's collapse could ultimately cost the Government more than $2.5 billion. And it is bold for the precedent of allowing a powerful industrial conglomerate, the buyout firm of Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts, to own a stake in what will be one of the nation's largest banks.
 
A Well-Respected Company
 But breaking precedent and making bold moves are nothing new for the 51-year-old Mr. Murray, who has built a well-respected and innovative financial-services empire. "Terry Murray is a businessman rather than a banker," said James Moynihan, an analyst with Advest Inc. in Boston. "He has more entrepreneurial instincts than any other New England banker."
Since the announcement Monday night that Fleet, based in Providence, R.I., had beaten out the Bank of Boston and the BankAmerica Corporation to gain the $15 billion in assets of the Bank of New England, Mr. Murray has been traveling the region preaching the gospel of the deal. "We're buying a clean bank and we think we can grow it," the stocky, redheaded Mr. Murray told the gathering yesterday.
The morning after the announcement, Mr. Murray was in the office of Lawrence K. Fish, the Bank of New England's departing chief executive, meeting with him and other senior officers of the bank. That day and the next, he shuttled from Boston to Hartford, New York, Portland, Me., and Providence, meeting with employees, analysts and reporters on a schedule calibrated by the half-hour.
"He's direct, he's smart and has a clear understanding of how you run a successful bank," said Mr. Fish, who will continue in his job for two to three months. "He's a very dynamic guy who has a lot of brains and a little luck."
With a salary of $755,000 and frequent travels, often in chartered jets, Mr. Murray has come a long way from blue-collar Woonsocket, R.I., where he worked as a newspaper carrier and a waiter as a youth. The son of a factory worker, Mr. Murray's first real job was in a textile mill, but when he saw how tedious the work was, he quickly went back to high school -- and finally to Harvard.
Upon graduation in 1962, already married and with two children (he now has five), Mr. Murray took a trainee position at Fleet's predecessor bank, the Industrial National Bank, and never left. After a decade of putting together complex deals, particularly bailing out troubled real estate projects, Mr. Murray, then in his 30's, became the bank's No. 2 officer. In 1982, he became chief executive upon the death of John Cummings Jr., who had held the No. 1 position. Today, he and his wife, Suzanne, live in Narragansett, R.I., and he spends his free time golfing and adding to his collection of Presidential letters.
 
Up Through the Bank
 "Terry's a roll-up-the-shirtsleeves kind of manager and a very down-to-earth guy," said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker Anthony in Portland, Me. "He did go to some good schools that can create a certain pretention. But, he's not like that. He came up through the bank and really learned his job in the trenches."
Mr. Murray is perhaps best known for his strong vision and his belief in diversification. So far, his agressive approach to acquisitions has brought only a few mistakes. In the early 1980's, he began to diversify away from banking and into non-banking financial services by buying leading companies in a variety of areas outside New England -- a consumer finance company, a mortgage banker and a student-loan servicing company. In 10 years, he acquired 46 companies and saw Fleet grow from a $3.5 billion company in 1981 to a $32 billion one today. It will grow to more than $40 billion with the Bank of New England acquisition.
Even Mr. Murray acknowledges that Fleet prides itself on being nimble and opportunistic. "Our company is very entrepreneurial," he said at the New York news conference. "It's required a lot of resourceful entrepreneurial thinking. We're always looking outward and even in bad times, there is opportunity. And, the Bank of New England is one of them."
The $625 million that Mr. Murray and his investors are paying for the Bank of New England has, for the first time, brought him recognition beyond New England. In one big move, he is creating one of the nation's top 10 banks and breaking the historic barriers between banking and commerce. It was Mr. Murray's decision to approach Kohlberg, Kravis for funds and now, when talking to the press on telephone conference calls or in conferences like the one in Manhattan today, it is the issue he is asked most often to address.
 
Bank-Commerce Mix
 Many fear that the mixing of banking and commerce will lead to concentrations of power and could lead to loans being made on a favorable basis to the industrial concern that owned the bank. At the same time, in today's capital-starved banking system, such industrial concerns are being eyed as sources of fresh funds.
"We called K.K.R.," Mr. Murray said. "We were sitting in Providence and looking at the prospect of bidding on the Bank of New England. We couldn't bid without creating incremental new capital. We needed a unique, sophisticated investor with lots of capital. We knew that K.K.R. has large pools of capital, so we went to them." That was Mr. Murray's first and only stop for funds.
He defends the arrangement, saying that K.K.R is only a passive investor seeking an "attractive rate return." K.K.R. will have "no board responsibility, no voting rights and no management say," he emphasized.
And he readily concedes the deal is not riskless -- the biggest unknown is the speed of any rebound in New England's economy. But, if Mr. Murray's record is any sign, luck is generally on his side. In 1986, he was outbid by the Bank of New England for the Conifer Group in Worcester, Mass. -- by less than $1 a share. Although a disappointment then, Conifer later turned out to be riddled with bad real estate loans. Mr. Murray instead bought the Albany-based Norstar Bancorp, a New York franchise that has helped Fleet weather New England's bad times. Still, a few of his acquisitions -- particularly the Indian Head Bank in New Hampshire -- have been flops.
In a brush with disaster, in early 1990, Mr. Murray once briefly considered merging with the troubled Bank of New England, but passed. "That would have been the ultimate disaster," said Mr. Cassidy of Tucker Anthony. "He was lucky that merger never took place. But he can't go on luck all the time, which is where smarts and hard work comes in, and he has both."

HEADLINE: Kennedy Center Names a Top Executive

BYLINE: By BARBARA GAMAREKIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
James D. Wolfensohn, the chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, announced the appointment of Lawrence J. Wilker as chief operating officer today. Mr. Wilker, president and chief operating officer of the Playhouse Square Foundation in Cleveland, is to join the center on July 1.
The appointment to this newly created position comes after a four-month search and a review of some 130 performing arts institutions. 
 "Larry Wilker combines rare financial, general management, fund-raising and leadership skills," Mr. Wolfensohn said today. "He has the drive, energy and enthusiasm, and a personal style to help keep the Kennedy Center in the forefront of the performing arts in the United States."
In the new position, Mr. Wilker will operate as the center's second in command, responsible for the day-to-day operation.
The appointment is part of a management reorganization plan being put in place by Mr. Wolfensohn, who assumed the chairmanship a year ago. It is a departure from the Kennedy Center's tradition of having a single top executive. The plan is based on a five-month study conducted by the management consulting firm of Cannon Devane and it reflects an administrative trend at arts institutions across the country.
Additional appointments, including that of an artistic director for theater, are expected during the next few months.
Mr. Wilker, who has an undergraduate degree in economics, a master's degree in acting and directing and a Ph.D. in theater administration, joined the Playhouse Square Foundation in 1982, where he has overseen a $40 million theater restoration project. From 1977 to 1980 he was vice president of the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theater Foundation. Before joining the Playhouse Square Foundation, he was the director of properties for the Shubert Organization for two years.

Decline in Sales At Rolls-Royce

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, April 25

 BODY:
Sales of Rolls-Royce luxury cars are down sharply in Britain and the United States, the parent company's chairman said today.
David Plastow, chairman of the industrial conglomerate Vickers P.L.C., said at the annual shareholders meeting that the first three months of 1991 "have been extremely difficult for Rolls-Royce motor cars." 
 Mr. Plastow said Rolls- Royce's first-quarter sales had fallen markedly in both countries in line with a slump in sales of other luxury cars.
He did not give any specific figures, but analysts were forecasting that Rolls-Royce's worldwide sales would fall to 2,760 in 1991 from the 3,333 recorded in 1990.
Mr. Plastow said Vickers would continue to invest in Rolls-Royce to insure that the car maker was well placed to take advantage of an economic upturn.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Are Up 0.6% For 2d Consecutive Increase

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes rose in March for the second consecutive month, a real estate trade group said today. The advance of six-tenths of a percent was new evidence, analysts said, that the housing recession has bottomed out.
"It's another sign that we've reached the bottom of the general real estate or ousing recession," said Daryl Delano, an economist with Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. But he and other analysts do not expect any big improvement in the near future. 
 "It will move forward, but very, very slowly," Mr. Delano said.
The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes totaled 3.18 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 3.16 million a month earlier. February's 8.9 percent advance was the first since November.
Other recent signs of a resurgence in the housing industry have included a 16.2 percent jump in new-home sales and an increase in housing starts in February, some of which analysts said was attributed to good weather. But applications for building permits -- often an indication of future activity -- also posted their first gain in eight months.
The president of the realtors group, Harley E. Rouda, attributed the sales increases to favorable mortgage rates and to growing consumer confidence in the economy. "Buyers in all income ranges are going ahead with their purchases," he said.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said fixed-rate mortgages averaged between 9.40 percent and 9.59 percent in March, down at least one-half of a percentage point from a year earlier.
The median price of an existing home rose to $96,500, up 2.7 percent from February and four-tenths of a percent from March 1990. The median means half of the homes cost more, half less.
The resale rate in the Midwest jumped 10.2 percent, to 970,000 units. The median price there was $76,200, down three-tenths of a percent from February.
For the second month, sales rose in the Northeast, up 4 percent, to a 520,000 rate. The median price was $142,300, up 3.7 percent.
But sales plunged 7.3 percent in the South, to a 1.24 million annual rate. The median price of $87,500 was up 5.2 percent.
And in the West, the resale rate slipped 1.9 percent, to 530,000 units. The median cost there was $137,000, up four-tenths of a percent.

HEADLINE: Knight-Ridder Net Drops; Viacom Narrows Its Loss

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Knight-Ridder Inc. reported a 39 percent decline in its first-quarter profit yesterday, blaming an advertising slump related to the recession and the Persian Gulf war for its "toughest quarter in memory."
Viacom Inc., meanwhile, said its loss for the first quarter narrowed from a year earlier, as its earnings from operations rose 42 percent. 
 Following are details of the media companies' results:
 
Knight-Ridder
Knight-Ridder, the Miami-based newspaper and information-services giant, said it earned $15.8 million, or 32 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared with $25.8 million, or 50 cents a share, in the comparable quarter last year.
Revenue fell 2.7 percent, to $540.1 million, from $554.9 million a year earlier.
The company reported 4.4 percent decline in overall first-quarter newspaper revenue, to $456 million, the first such drop since Knight-Ridder was formed in a merger in 1974, said Robert Singleton, chief financial officer.
The drop in overall revenue included an 8.4 percent decline in newspaper advertising revenue, to $340.4 million, and an 8.8 percent rise in circulation revenue, to $106.6 million.
Revenue from business-information services rose to $84.1 million, from $77.8 million a year earlier.
Prospects for the rest of the year are guarded. "We have a chance of a flat to slightly up year, although the second quarter is currently projected to be flat to down slightly," Mr. Singleton said.
Knight-Ridder publishes 29 daily newspapers, owns electronic retrieval, news, graphics and photo services as well as cable television outlets, and manufactures newsprint. Its stock fell 75 cents on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday to close at $53.50 a share.
 
Viacom
Viacom, a New York-based cable-television and entertainment company, said it lost $3.7 million in the three months ended March 31, in contrast to a loss of $17.1 million a year ago. Revenue edged up 3.6 percent, to $407.2 million from $393.2 million.
The company said earnings from operations at its cable-television division, which includes the MTV Networks and the pay-television Showtime channel, more than doubled, to $39 million, while earnings from operations at its cable television systems rose 66 percent, to $25 million.
Operational earnings in Viacom's entertainment segment rose 5 percent, to $28 million. But earnings from operations in broadcasting fell 69 percent, to $2 million, because of softness in the advertising market and the cost of recent radio station acquisitions.
Viacom is 84 percent owned by National Amusements Inc., a closely held company controlled by Sumner Redstone with 675 movie screens in 14 states and Britain. Viacom's stock fell 25 cents, to $31.875 a share, on the American Stock Exchange.

Earnings Rise 71.3% At Johnson

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest health-care-products company, said yesterday that first-quarter profits jumped 71.3 percent, to $418 million, or $1.25 a share, from $244 million, or 73 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago.
The increase reflected a write-off of $125 million last year because of economic turmoil in Argentina and other Latin American countries. Adjusting for the extraordinary charge, earnings rose 13.3 percent, from $369 million, or $1.11 a share, a year ago. 
 Sales increased 12.1 percent, to $3.15 billion from $2.81 billion, with about 3.1 percent coming from weakness in the dollar overseas, where the company has half its sales.
Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., announced its 27th-straight annual dividend increase: to 40 cents a quarter from 34 cents.
Ralph S. Larsen, the company's chairman, said sales results were "outstanding" in pharmaceuticals, which increased by 20.8 percent worldwide and 24 percent in the United States. He also reported "solid gains" of 14.5 percent in hospital supply sales.
Consumer products like Tylenol were hurt by economic problems in Brazil, rising only 4.1 percent. Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said the company's sales were "better than it looks, because consumer products in Brazil were down at least $50 million."
"New-product launches fueled strong domestic growth" in all three business units, Mr. Larsen said. The company said its new prescription drugs were headed by an anti-anemia drug, Proscrit; an anti-bacterial drug, Floxin, and a blood-pressure drug, Vascor. It also introduced an over-the-counter version of Monistat, a widely prescribed remedy for women's yeast infections.
Mr. Larsen said other products with sales increases included Acuvue disposable contact lenses, diagnostic tests for hepatitis-C, and the antihistamine Hismanal. Ethicon surgical sutures continued to gain market share, despite a recent challenge by the United States Surgical Corporation. He added that Ethicon is also pressing to become the market leader in endoscopic products that are increasingly used in "less invasive" surgery.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Johnson & Johnson's share price rose $1.125 yesterday, to $95.

HEADLINE: Xerox's $116 Million Profit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., April 25

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation reported a first-quarter profit of $116 million today, compared with a loss in the 1990 period that mostly resulted from a discontinued real estate investment.
The company said its first-quarter income, excluding 1990's $367 million loss from discontinued operations, rose 3 percent from $113 million a year earlier. 
 The increase reflected a doubling to $6 million in profits in Xerox's insurance and financial services operations, which were increased by insurance underwriting results.
Income from Xerox's document-processing business, hurt by the recession and the Persian Gulf war's effect on consumer spending, was the same as last year's $110 million.
Including discontinued operations, Xerox said its net income for the three months that ended on March 31 was $1.01 a share, compared with a loss of $254 million. Its revenues totaled $4.2 billion, up slightly from $4.15 billion in the 1990 period.
Thomas Abbott, a spokesman, said Xerox was able to maintain profits in document processing despite sluggish consumer spending because of continued growth in service and rentals, supplies and in the financing of equipment.
Revenues from Xerox's document-processing business, aided by favorable currency exchange rates, grew to $3.2 billion, up 5 percent from $3.05 billion.
The company's revenues from insurance and other financial services totaled $1 billion, versus $1.16 billion. Xerox said the drop in revenues primarily reflected the withdrawal from writing personal lines of property and casualty insurance, including the sale of the Navco Corporation, an automobile insurance specialty unit.
On the New York Stock Exchange today, Xerox's stock rose $1.875, to $58.125.

HEADLINE: New Claims for Unemployment Insurance Rise by 47,000

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
Reversing a two-week decline, the number of people filing new claims for state unemployment insurance climbed by 47,000, to 498,000, in the week ended April 13, the Labor Department announced today.
The report pointed to continued economic weakness, a subject seized upon by President Bush today. He took the occasion of a photo session with former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita of Japan in advance of a Group of Seven meeting here to reiterate the Administration's desire for lower interest rates to help spur economic growth. 
 "We want to see these interest rates down a little bit," the President said, "including our own." Mr. Bush was presumably directing his message mainly at Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and other Fed policy makers, but he did not specify them. The Bush Administration has been more persistent in its admonitions to the central bank than previous Administrations, but its tone has been less aggressive.
The report on initial jobless claims received particular scrutiny this time because the April 13 week was the same one in which the Government conducted its monthly survey of employment and unemployment.
 
Downward Trend Overall
 But even though initial claims are considered a predictive indicator for the economy at large, analysts said they were not particularly discouraged by the latest increase.
"It doesn't mean you should get real pessimistic," said Maury N. Harris, the chief economist at Paine Webber Inc. For one thing, Mr. Harris said, initial claims traditionally provide only short notice of economic turns. For another, he said, claims were still reflecting a downward trend when gauged on a four-week moving average -- 491,250 in the latest period compared with 494,250 on April 6 and 511,250 on March 30.
Analysts also said that recent figures may have been somewhat skewed by seasonal adjustment problems around the Easter holidays and by an inability to adequately adjust for a recurring shift in claims around calendar quarters. Because some states peg jobless payments to earnings in the preceding quarter, some people defer applications until the new quarter begins, when their base for calculations will tend to be higher.
For these and other reasons, claims figures are subject to wide weekly gyrations, prompting economists to average them over longer periods.
Alan C. Lerner of the Bankers Trust Company was another analyst not distressed by the latest claims data. Agreeing with comments on the economy by Mr. Greenspan earlier this week, Mr. Lerner said, "There is evidence that the rate of decline is slowing."
 
Payroll Figure Awaited
 He predicted that figures to be published by the Labor Department May 3 would show that payroll employment fell in April by a relatively modest 100,000.
Today's report of initial claims rising 47,000 followed declines of 70,000 and 22,000 in the two preceding weeks and left the total well under the peak of 543,000 recorded for March 23. Some 10,000 of the latest rise in claims were in Michigan, where automobile makers have been cutting payrolls.
Without seasonal adjustment, claims in the April 13 week numbered 461,700, or 14,600 more than the week before, the report also showed. In the comparable 1990 week, 315,600 new claims were filed.
The seasonally adjusted rate of insured unemployment remained unchanged at 3.3 percent for the week ended April 6, with 3,496,000 people collecting benefits, down 36,000 from the last week in March.
But while the latest figures did not portray any significant worsening of the labor market, they did provided little grounds for optimism.
"The recession is definitely still going on," said Carol Ann Hamilton of National Westminster Bancorp in New York. "Unemployment is going to rise for some time."

HEADLINE: White House Lists 22 Critical Technologies

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
Departing from a longstanding policy, the White House today listed 22 areas of technological development that should be nurtured as "critical to the national prosperity and to national security."
Until now, the White House had opposed efforts to identify and nurture critical technologies as unwarranted governmental interference. Aides to President Bush had said such lists involved picking winners and losers, were counterproductive and undermined the Administration's commitment to free trade. 
 The change was signaled in a letter to President Bush that accompanied the list released today. In it, William D. Phillips, chairman of the National Critical Technologies Panel and associate director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, said: "We most recently have been reminded, by the spectacular performance of U.S. coalition forces in the Persian Gulf, of the crucial role that technology plays in military competitiveness. It is equally clear that technology plays a similar role in the economic competitiveness among nations."
 
Report Required by Congress
 Congress, in passing the Defense Authorization Act, required that the White House consider and issue such a report.
The report cited technologies involving materials and manufacturing, information and communications, biotechnology and life sciences, aeronautics and surface transportation, and energy and the environment.
Dr. Phillips said that almost all of the critical technologies cited were essential to the military as well as to economic prosperity and that he saw "a considerable overlap" between today's list and one prepared by the Defense Department in 1990.
The broad list of technologies is also similar to one issued last month by the Council on Competitiveness, a nonprofit organization of leaders in business, education and labor, but the White House study places more emphasis on technologies involving surface transportation and the environment.
 
Commercial Use Urged
 The report urged greater commercial use of new technologies. "The key to future U.S. competitive success involves a fundamental change in the way U.S. industry competes in the marketplace," the report said.
"This is the first time that the White House has identified priorities in technology for the country to pursue," said Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, chairman of the Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Defense Industry and Technology. "But there is still a raging dispute between those who put out this report and others in the White House over the Government's role in meeting this challenge."
Included in the surface transportation technologies section of the report were the development of "Intelligent vehicle/highway systems," often referred to as "smart cars" and "smart highways," and electrically powered vehicles, which rely on advances in batteries and fuel cells.
The environmental section involved minimizing pollution; recycling, and the treatment, storage and disposal of pollutants.
The report also listed technologies in these areas:
 
Materials processing.
Electronic and photonic materials.
Ceramics.
Composites.
High-performance metals and alloys.
Flexible computer integrated manufacturing.
Intelligent processing equipment.
Micro- and nano-fabrication.
Systems-management technologies.
Software.
Microelectronics and optoelectronics.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Push for Lower Rates At Group of Seven Meeting

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The United States will emphasize the need to lower world interest rates when it meets in Washington this weekend with its chief economic allies in the Group of Seven, a top Treasury official said yesterday.
But even before this public acknowledgement of what the United States has been quietly lobbying for in recent weeks, Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the Bundesbank, said the German central bank was not considering lowering interest rates. 
 In other comments, the Treasury official, David C. Mulford, the Under Secretary for International Affairs, indicated that the United States was not overly concerned about the recent sharp rise of the dollar, which has climbed about 20 percent since February against the mark and some other major currencies.
The debate on interest rates will undoubtedly take up a lot of time this weekend and will be watched closely because of the impact interest rates have on the foreign exchange market.
But analysts said yesterday that they expected no significant onslaught against the rising dollar because the level of the dollar has not become worrisome to finance officials. Also, they said, German resistance to lower rates there, combined with Bush Administration pressure for lower rates here, is the blend of policy needed to slow the dollar's rise.
"This may be a weekend that nothing definitive will happen," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation in New York. He said he did not think the current level of the dollar was a big concern as long as the rally subsides. But he said there was a worry that the speed of the rally this year might mean the dollar would continue to move higher.
The dollar closed yesterday in New York at 1.7495 marks, up from 1.7460 on Wednesday, and 137.85 yen, up from 137.80.
John Lipsky, the director of international bond trading at Salomon Brothers in London, said: "In the end it seems likely that the G-7 focus in the communique is likely to be cautious. If there is a promise to prevent unjustified dollar appreciation or over rapid appreciation, but no one is willing to undertake the policy moves to do that, that would undermine the G-7 process."
Mr. Mulford made his comments at a news conference in Washington. He said that interest rates around the world were "too high," especially in Europe. Because of these interest rate levels, he said, "the prospect for growth is less good." He said that policy makers should concentrate on stimulating growth rather than fighting inflation at a time when the world economy is slowing down.
 
Dollar's Rapid Rise
 Mr. Mulford added that despite the dollar's rapid rise since February, the increase had been orderly and stable.
On Tuesday and Wednesday central banks in Europe, led by the Bundesbank, sold dollars in an effort to slow the rally. But traders said the Federal Reserve Board did not participate. This dollar selling helped stop the rally.
Mr. Mulford's comments echoed those that Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady had made in recent meetings with members of the Group of Seven, which consists of the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
And yesterday, President Bush added his voice to the chorus, calling for lower interest rates in the United States. At a White House meeting, the President said, "We want to see these interest rates down a little bit, and I think that would be good for the world economy, including our own."
But at the same time, Mr. Pohl made clear in an interview with The Financial Times that the Bundesbank, Europe's key central bank, was not thinking of lowering rates. "A cut in interest rates in Germany is not on the agenda," Mr. Pohl said. "Calls for Germany to cut interest rates are, from our point of view, difficult to understand."
United States lobbying for lower rates comes at a time when it suddenly appears that key central banks have stopped the lowering of interest rates that had begun earlier this year.
The Bank of Japan was thought to be near easing but apparently has now put it off. And the Federal Reserve, which eased aggressively earlier this year, has apparently put any further moves on hold. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chariman, told Congress on Tuesday that he was being cautious about any further lowering of interest rates. And a tax increase in Germany had seemed to open the possibility of lower rates there or, at the least, no further increases.

HEADLINE: Compaq Net Up 24 Percent For Quarter

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Compaq Computer said yesterday that its first-quarter profit rose 24 percent, and Data General posted its second profitable quarter after a string of losses. But struggling Unisys said its loss had widened sharply.
Compaq's stock price dropped sharply, apparently because it warned that the next quarter's profits could suffer. 
 Following are details of the companies' results.
 
Compaq
The Compaq Computer Corporation said it earned $114.3 million, or $1.26 a share, in the first quarter, compared with $92.2 million, or $1.07 a share, in 1990's first quarter. Revenue was up 11 percent, to $970.8 million, from $872.2 million in the 1990 period.
"Our financial results for the first quarter were very good, especially given all the uncertainties surrounding the war in the Middle East, slowing global economies and the effect of major strategic programs," said Joseph R. Canion, president and chief executive of the Houston-based company.
Mr. Canion said sales were strong worldwide. Foreign sales were 16 percent above the 1990 period and accounted for 59 percent of revenue.
But Compaq warned that its second-quarter profit could be hurt by price cuts this month on many of its products as well as by the stronger dollar, which hurts the results of sales abroad.
Because of these factors, "it is likely that second-quarter earnings will be below those of the second quarter of 1990," Compaq said in a statement.
Compaq's stock plunged $9.375 yesterday, or 15 percent, to $52.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
One analyst, Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the drop resulted mainly from Compaq's warning about the second quarter. In addition, he said, the first-quarter earnings were at the low end of analysts' estimates.
 
Data General
The Data General Corporation said it earned $19.2 million, or 60 cents a share, in its third quarter ended March 30, continuing to rebound from a string of losses.
The Westboro, Mass., company had a loss of $8.6 million in the comparable period a year ago. Revenue for the 1991 period rose almost 2 percent, to $320.4 million from $314.8 million.
The company's president, Ronald L. Skates, said Data General's results improved despite the weak economy and the impact of a strong dollar, which makes its products more expensive abroad.
During the previous quarter, Data General reported a $12.4 million profit after nearly two years of quarterly losses.
Data General had losses in its proprietary line of computers as customers increasingly demanded "open systems" computers that can more easily work with other brands.
Mr. Skates said the company remained cautious because of the worldwide economic slump, but he added that Data General was well positioned for the long-term.
Data General's stock rose $1.50 yesterday, closing at $18 on the Big Board.
 
Unisys
The Unisys Corporation reported a first-quarter loss of $98.2 million, more than 30 times the company's first-quarter loss a year ago of $3.2 million.
First-quarter revenue declined 11 percent, to $2.06 billion, from $2.31 billion in the 1990 period.
"The weak economic environment in our major markets around the world continues and has resulted in a general slowdown in computer industry demand," said James A. Unruh, chairman and chief executive.
The company's orders and revenues remain depressed while customers continue to delay large technology investments, Mr. Unruh said.
Losses on a commercial microcomputer contract with the Government and the effect of price controls on Brazilian operations also contributed to the loss, Mr. Unruh said.
Unisys, based in Blue Hill, Pa., said it had reduced administrative and selling expenses to 1987 levels and had eliminated 3,000 jobs last quarter. Its work force was at 72,000 at the end of the quarter.
Shares of Unisys fell 37.5 cents yesterday, closing at $4.50 on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: $1.4 Trillion Budget Plan Is Approved by the Senate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
The Senate approved a $1.4 trillion Government spending plan for the next fiscal year tonight after rejecting efforts by Democrats to shift money from the Pentagon to domestic health, education and welfare programs. Approval came by voice vote.
In a series of significant test votes throughout the day, the Senate repeatedly upheld the spending limits imposed in last year's bipartisan budget agreement between Congress and President Bush. Final approval of the Senate budget measure today came by voice vote. 
 The next step in the budget process is for senators to negotiate a compromise with the House of Representatives, which adopted a similar budget blueprint last week. Because it does not become law, the compromise measure, known as a budget resolution, is not subject to veto or approval by the President, but will provide guidance to Congressional committees writing appropriations bills and other legislation over the next five or six months.
 
Changes From Bush Plan
 The Senate and House would both provide more money than the President requested for education, child health and child nutrition programs in the fiscal year 1992, which begins Oct. 1. Both houses would provide less money than the President sought for space exploration. The Senate, like the House, summarily rejected Mr. Bush's proposal for further cutbacks in payments to hospitals under Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 34 million elderly and disabled people.
In the Senate, as in the House, the budget debate was devoid of the passion and anguish that characterized last year's debates on the budget. Lawmakers are sticking closely to the fiscal framework they put together last fall.
The 1992 budget resolution "upholds the principles of the budget summit agreement of last year, and it upholds the discipline that was the fundamental underlying reason for the budget summit agreement -- the discipline to control spending," said Senator Jim Sasser, the chairman of the Budget Committee. Mr. Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat, adroitly beat back efforts by liberals eager to spend more on social welfare programs and conservatives eager to slow the growth of Federal spending.
Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, proposed to cut military spending by 2 percent a year for five years and use half the savings for education, health care and pollution control programs. The other half of the savings would have been used to reduce the Federal budget deficit, projected at $286 billion next year under the Senate plan.
 
Bid to Cut Arms Outlays Lost
 Mr. Bradley's proposal failed after Mr. Sasser raised a point of order, charging that the proposal violated rules established to enforce last year's budget agreement. Those rules generally prohibit the transfer of money from the military budget to domestic spending accounts in the next three years. Mr. Sasser said he sympathized with Mr. Bradley's objective, but could not vote for the proposal because it would "do violence to the budget summit agreement that we enacted into law last year."
"We are compelled today to carry out that agreement," Mr. Sasser said. "I wish it could be otherwise." Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, warned his colleagues that they would be "plowing a big hole in the budget agreement" if they approved the Bradley proposal.
Echoing the frustration of many senators, Mr. Bradley complained that last year's budget agreement "locked everyone in concrete," severely limiting the Government's ability to respond to a measles epidemic, the recession and other national problems.
By a vote of 73 to 22, the Senate reaffirmed its support for the budget agreement and blocked Mr. Bradley's proposal.
The Senate later rejected, by a vote of 70 to 25, a proposal by Senator Paul Simon that would have cut the military budget by 2 percent, or nearly $6 billion, next year. All the savings would have been used to reduce the deficit, and the National Taxpayers Union endorsed the proposal by Mr. Simon, a liberal Democrat from Illinois.
 
Plea for Military Cutbacks
 "After the United States won World War II, we reduced defense spending by 90 percent in three years," Mr. Simon said. "Surely today, after winning the cold war, we can reduce defense spending by 2 percent."
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the Democrat who serves as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, joined many Republicans in opposing the Simon amendment. Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, said the military spending levels in the 1992 budget resolution and in last year's budget agreement were already too low. Senator Domenici said the Defense Department was shouldering 40 percent of all the savings achieve in last year's budget agreement.
The Senate budget resolution contains a surprisingly strong endorsement of the principle that the Government should trim benefits and subsidies provided to affluent people, as President Bush recommended. "Subsidies that are provided to the wealthiest segment of our society should be either redirected to provide more assistance to the poor and the underprivileged, or applied to further deficit reduction," the resolution says.
But the Senate did not specify how that commitment to fairness and equity should be put into practice. The Senate budget resolution observes that people from high-income families can receive Government assistance in the form of farm subsidies, school lunch subsidies, low-interest loans to pay college costs and subsidized health insurance under Medicare.
The House Budget Committee said that proposals to reduce Government subsidies for high-income people had "a great deal of merit," but, like the Senate, it did not explicitly demand any changes in such subsidies.
By a vote of 60 to 37, the Senate rejected a proposal by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to freeze Federal spending for 1992 at this year's levels. Despite the euphoria on Capitol Hill over last year's budget agreement, he said, the deficit will set a record of nearly $300 billion this year and will be almost as high next year.
"The deficit is very much like a lizard," Mr. Grassley said. "When Congress tries to catch the lizard, it grabs the tail and the tail comes off in our hand. The lizard goes on its merry way and grows a whole new tail, only bigger and longer."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Judge Rules Surgeon With AIDS Must Tell Patients

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 25

 BODY:
A Superior Court judge ruled today that a surgeon infected with the AIDS virus must inform patients before operating on them.
In what is believed to be the first court ruling in the nation to weigh the protection of a health-care worker's confidentiality against a patient's right to know, the judge, Philip S. Carchman, said, "If there is to be an ultimate arbiter of whether the patient is to be treated invasively by an AIDS-positive surgeon, the arbiter will be the fully informed patient. 
 "The ultimate risk to the patient is so absolute, so devastating, that it is untenable to argue against informed consent combined with a restriction on procedures which present 'any risk' to the patient," Judge Carchman wrote in a 75-page opinion.
The opinion appears to go farther than the draft guidelines being studied by the Federal Centers for Disease Control, which recommend that infected physicians voluntarily suspend performing procedures that carry a risk of transmission, or seek the approval of local committees.
The center began re-examining its recommendations that call for a case-by-case evaluation of how infected physicians and dentists should practice after a dentist in Stuart, Fla., who died of AIDS, was found to have infected three patients. Another Florida dentist gave up his practice this month after learning that he has AIDS and recommended his patients undergo testing.
 
Guidelines Differ
 In recent months, the American Medical Association and the American Dental Association have adopted policies recommending that infected physicians tell their patients or stop performing surgery.
But the New York State Health Department adopted an opposing view in guidelines issued in January that said health-care workers need not tell patients if they are infected and may continue to operate or perform other invasive procedures.
The case that brought the issue before Judge Carchman was filed in 1988 by Dr. William H. Behringer, an ear, nose and throat specialist who practiced in Princeton and performed surgery at the Medical Center at Princeton until he was found to have AIDS in 1987. Dr. Behringer was 42 years old when he died of AIDS on July 2, 1989, but his estate continued the suit, charging the medical center with breach of contract and violating state anti-discrimination laws.
The decision is expected to be appealed and eventually to reach the New Jersey Su preme Court, lawyers for the estate and the medical center said.
Judge Carchman ruled in favor of the physician in finding that the hospital breached its duty to protect the confidentiality of his diagnosis, which was made in June 1987 when he came to the hospital's emergency room.
The information on Dr. Behringer's medical chart became widely known throughout the hospital and was being discussed around town before he was his release d from the hospital two days later. In his suit Dr. Behringer said his friends shunned him, his patients left him and he suffered emotional and economic distress because of the disclosure.
 
'Whispers Became Roars'
 "All that was required was a glance at a chart, and the written words became whispers and the whispers became roars," Judge Carchman wrote. "And common sense told all that this would happen."
Judge Carchman ruled the physician's estate was entitled to damages from the medical center for failing to protect his confidentiality as a patient. The amount will be the subject of further hearings.
But his opinion upheld the action of the medical center and its president, Dennis Doody, in suspending Dr. Behringer's surgical privileges.
The hospital and its various boards and committees discussed how to deal with issues raised by Dr. Behringer's infection for weeks. At one point the executive committee of the medical and dental staff recommended that Dr. Behringer retain all his privileges, that he follow precautions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and that he be subject to careful monitoring for competence.
 
Informed-Consent Form
 But Mr. Doody and the hospital's legal counsel said that despite the absence of a reported case of transmission of the AIDS virus from a health-care worker to a patient at that time, Dr. Behringer would be required to reveal his infection in an informed-consent form to be signed by his patients.
Judge Carchman said everyone realized this amounted to a "de facto prohibition" from surgical practice.
Nonetheless, in weighing this action against Dr. Behringer's assertion that the hospital was violating his rights under the state's anti-discrimination law, Judge Carchman ruled that the hospital acted properly.
"New Jersey's strong policy supporting patient rights, weighed against plaintiff's individual right to perform an invasive procedure as part of the practice of his profession, requires the conclusion that the patient's rights must prevail," Judge Carchman said.
Roger J. Bernstein, the lawyer for Dr. Behringer's estate, said he applauded the decision for recognizing a patient's right of confidentiality when receiving an AIDS diagnosis.
 
Fear of Death
 But he said the court too readily accepted the certainty of death from AIDS despite testimony during the trial in December 1989 that "there is a significant group of HIV-infected people who have lived for 10 years and longer without contracting a fatal disease."
He said "fear of death" played an excessively large role in the decision. "It gave credence to fears not founded on the real risks of AIDS transmission," he said, adding that it mirrored the hospital's view that "AIDS equals bad equals out."
John R. Heher, the lawyer for the medical center, said the case was precedent-setting on two counts: for requiring infected health-care workers to inform patients of their disease before performing an invasive procedure, and for requiring that hospitals sequester the health records of staff physicians who contract the AIDS virus.
Mr. Bernstein, the estate's lawyer, said, "There is a conflict in the law that has never been resolved between laws that protect confidentiality and those that require informed consent."

HEADLINE: It's Official: July Saw The Recession's Start

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
The committee of seven prominent economists that is the arbiter of when recessions officially begin and end, ruled today that the current one started nine months ago, in July. The panel made no attempt to guess when it might end.
The decision of the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private organization whose rulings go into numerous record books, means the American economy began to contract before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. But, committee members said, the initial contraction might never have evolved into a full-blown recession without the damage to the economy that resulted from the Persian Gulf crisis. 
 "The war plainly did not create the overall economic slowdown that was very evident even in June," said Robert Hall, a Stanford University economist and chairman of the committee. "However, the increase in oil prices that followed the invasion probably did play a role in the sharp contraction that occurred in the fall."
 
Characteristic Contraction
 That sharp contraction in the four areas that the committee watches most closely -- jobs, personal income, sales and industrial production -- is a phenomenon that is characteristic of nearly every recession, with or without a political crisis. Without that sharp contraction, concentrated this time in October and November, the slowdown might never have turned into a genuine recession, in the committee's view.
Today, the Labor Department said the number of people filing new claims for state unemployment insurance climbed by 47,000, to 498,000, in the week ended April 13. That reversed two weeks of decline. President Bush promptly chided the Federal Reserve for not doing more to push down interest rates. [Page D2.]
Mr. Hall said that the sharp contraction in the fall was " what the business press would call a free fall." Although the committee concerned itself today only with dating the recession's starting point, Mr. Hall and other members said the economy was still contracting.
"It will be a long time, I predict, before we meet again to date the trough -- the end of the recession," Mr. Hall said. The Bush Administration, the Federal Reserve and many private economic forecasters say that the Persian Gulf crisis, with its impact on oil prices and consumer confidence, caused the recession, and they say it is now coming to an end. The committee, in effect, steered clear of both contentions.
The committee members, by a unanimous vote, provided a starting date for the recession that will appear in thousands of Government documents and business publications. The record now lists eight other recessions since World War II with an average length of 12 months. If this one is average it would end in June.
Geoffry Moore, a committee member from Columbia University, said, "So far this one does look to me very much like an average recession, although it is hard to find evidence that it is ending."
 
The Popular Definition
 The National Bureau, a private organization that finances research, has pinpointed not only recession dates but also the beginnings and ends of booms. In that role, the ruling today served the additional function of defining the economic expansion that started in November 1982, at the end of the last recession, and lasted for 92 months, until last July.
Only one other expansion since 1854 was longer: The booming 1960's produced 105 months of constant growth, from early 1961 until the final months of the decade.
The popular definition of a recession is two quarters of contraction by the gross national product, which is the value of all goods and services produced in a given period. By that definition, the current recession started in last year's fourth quarter, when the G.N.P. declined by 1.6 percent at an annual rate, and this year's first quarter, when the G.N.P. decline was more than 2 percent and perhaps much more, according to most estimates. The Commerce Department will announce the first-quarter figure tomorrow.
The Dating Committee also prefers that a downturn last at least six months to qualify as a recession. But it frequently dates recessions as starting in the midst of a quarter -- in this case in the early weeks of last year's third quarter.
This time July became a sort of average for four key developments. The committee decided that job growth peaked in June, then jobs began to disappear as layoffs accelerated. Personal income, adjusted for inflation, grew to its highest level in July and has fallen ever since. Sales by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers peaked in August and then declined, and industrial production went into decline in September.
The other committee members are Martin Feldstein of Harvard, president of the National Bureau; Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University; Benjamin Friedman of Harvard; Victor Zarnowitz of the University of Chicago, and William Branson of Princeton.

2-Day Gain by U.S. Issues Ends

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The two-day advance in Treasury bond prices came to a halt yesterday as the market in long-term securities absorbed various economic factors.
The number of initial claims for unemployment insurance rose 47,000, to 498,000, in the week ended April 13, the latest period covered by the Government's survey. Bond prices rose slightly on the news, but an increase had been expected and was thus not taken as serious negative news by investors in fixed-income debt issues who count on negative economic reports to protect their holdings from inflation and higher interest rates on newer offerings. 
 Also weighing on the fixed-income market was the decision by BankAmerica on Wednesday to reverse an earlier reduction in its prime lending rate from 8 3/4 percent back to 9 percent.
 
Long Bond Off 7/32
 As a result, late trading found the Treasury's bellwether long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue maturing in February 2021, down 7/32, at 96. This raised its yield to 8.23 percent, from 8.20 percent the day before.
The long bonds had been up as much as 10/32, when prices began to sag in the final hour of trading at the Chicago bond futures market. That market closes at 3 P. M., Eastern time. The New York cash bond market has no fixed hours.
The late weakness in bonds caused the Treasury's long notes, the 7 3/4 percent issue due February 2001, to slip 6/32 in late dealings, to 97 28/32, causing its yield to rise to 8.06 percent, from 8.03 percent the day before.
 
Auction of 5-Year Notes
 Prices of intermediate Treasury debt, meanwhile, were bolstered by the successful auction of five-year notes, which followed the excellent reception of an auction of two-year notes a day earlier.
The sale of the five-year notes again drew a record amount of bids, $32.4 billion for the $9 billion offered. This exceeded the record $30.2 billion that was bid for $8.5 billion of the same maturity a month ago.
The five-year notes were auctioned at an average yield of 7.70 percent for an issue with a 7 5/8 percent coupon. At the last monthly sale of this maturity, the average yield was 7.81 percent and the coupon was 7 3/4 percent. The price of the two-year notes rose 3/32, to 100 6/32, which brought its yield down to 6.89 percent, from the average of 7 percent obtained at Wednesday's auction.
"About 30 minutes before the close of bidding, rumors swept the market that a few bidders acting on behalf of Middle East interests were planning to take most of the five-year notes," said Andrew J. Schnydrig, a Treasury bond trader at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer of Zurich. "But the successful auction also had a negative tinge to it. Some in the Street think both sales this week could mean that there will be less aggressive bidding at the refunding auctions."
 
Refunding Auction in May
 On May 7, 8 and 9, the Treasury will hold its quarterly refunding auctions of notes and bonds. The total amount offered is expected to have a record face value of $35 billion or more.
Sentiment was also mixed at the short end of the Treasury maturity spectrum, as market participants tried to fathom the next move by the Federal Reserve. Yesterday, the Fed moved to drain reserves from the banking system for the fifth time in the last six sessions. After appearing at first to again have little impact on the key Federal funds rate, the rate finally moved from 5 13/15 percent to close at 6 percent.
The funds rate, which is what banks charge each other on overnight loans, is the only interest rate that the Fed has a large measure of control over. It is also the rate that banks, among other large financial institutions, charge each other for temporary loans. And it is also considered to be the bedrock cost of credit from which most other interest rates are scaled upward.
At any rate, the discount rate on the Treasury's 90-day bills, which are normally the most sensitive to the funds rate, fell 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.60 percent; six-month bills were unchanged at 5.70 percent, and the one-year bills declined 3 basis points, to 5.81 percent.
Following are the details of the Treasury's auction of five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall And the Dow Drops 28.46

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Wave after wave of computerized program selling, and widespread investor concern that interest-rate cuts may be out of the question for a while, toppled stock prices yesterday.
A forecast from Compaq Computer that second-quarter profits would be down this year also contributed to the decline. Compaq's stock price fell 9 3/8, to 52 1/2, and it was the most active stock on the Big Board, with 6.4 million shares changing hands. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 28.46, or almost a full percentage point, to 2,921.04.
Showing that the drop extended broadly across the market, the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell about the same. Over-the-counter stocks, as measured by the Nasdaq composite index, also fell, about half as much.
Trading was at about Wednesday's level, rising slightly to 166.9 million shares from 166.8 million. Sixty-nine stocks rose to 52-week highs, but declines led advances by almost 2 to 1.
 
Computerized Selling
 Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said heavy computerized selling near the beginning and end of the day clipped almost 29 points off the Dow. A 16-minute selling wave immediately after Compaq's forecast of weak profits accounted for more than half the decline.
"I think the market has to churn around for a while," said William S. Stack, chief investment officer for the Lexington Management Corporation. "We don't have any real incentive to push it one way or another. We either need important developments in earnings or movement in interest rates, and I don't think we have news on either one."
Wall Street investment people seemed almost entirely focused on either rates or profits or, in many instances, on both.
In Boston, Robert G. Freedman, chief portfolio manager for John Hancock mutual funds, said the market, which plunged 35 points in the first hour, began with "bad news from Compaq and that set the tone for the day -- which was down."
 
Many Issues Disappoint
 The market, he argued, is "reacting to disappointment in a lot of different stocks and is causing volatility in the marketplace."
As for interest rates, he noted that the Treasury auctioned $9 billion of five-year notes yesterday at an average yield of 7.7 percent, or less than the 7.81 percent in the prior auction last month.
"It's an indication that rates are coming down and that's usually positive for stocks, but it didn't help the market at all."
The conclusion, he said, is that "the market's in a period of consolidation over the next couple of weeks after a strong run and is still waiting for a cut in interest rates."
Even so, he said, "I haven't changed my feeling that the market is still headed higher."
Joseph H. Barthel, investment strategist for W. H. Newbold's Son, said: "The market's been locked in a 150-point trading range between 2,850 and 3,000 since early March. Since then the bullish newletter writers have stayed optimistic while the number of bears has slightly retrenched."
He said he had found in a review of consolidation periods over the last 25 years that the number of bulls typically drops an average of 27 percent while the number of bears climbs 34 percent.
"What that reflects," he said, "is that the market has been too optimistic."
He argued that declining rates have been "the catalyst for advancing stock prices" and "with this prop removed, the market's faced with an exhorbitant number of bulls who have been disappointed and this is prompting the selling."
Other technology stocks weakened. Digital Equipment fell 2 7/8, to 69; Honeywell 2 1/4, to 58 1/4; Intel 2, to 53; Apple Computer 2 1/4, to 58 1/2; Microsoft 2 1/4, to 100 3/4, and Hewlett-Packard 1 3/8, to 53 5/8.
An exception was Sun Microsystems, the most active stock on the Nasdaq list, with 5.6 million shares traded. It rose 4 3/4, to 38 1/4. It rose 1 1/4 on Wednesday after a sharp rise in profits.
UAL hit a 52-week high of 161 1/2 but closed at 159 1/4, down 1/8. The stock dropped almost immediately after its announcement early in the day that it had lost $157 million in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
MURDOCH SELLING 9 U.S. PUBLICATIONS FOR $600 MILLION

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born publisher whose wide holdings in the United States include New York magazine, 20th Century Fox and several television stations, agreed yesterday to sell most of his magazines in this country for more than $600 million, people involved in the talks said.
The buyer is a partnership controlled by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, the New York buyout firm that was also involved in the recent purchase of the Bank of New England. 
 As head of the News Corporation, Mr. Murdoch, now a United States citizen, went on an acquisition binge in the 1980's, but the debt he took on along the way has proved a huge burden. In February he had reached agreement with bankers to change the terms on much of his $8.2 billion in debt.
 
TV Guide Is Not in Deal
 Although the agreement with the banks did not specify asset sales, analysts had always assumed that $800 million or more would have to be raised for him to be able to meet his obligations.
The partnership, called K-III Holdings, is buying nine publications, the most profitable of which is The Racing Form, a daily newspaper that has covered thoroughbred racing nationwide with no serious competition.
The other publications are Soap Opera Digest, Soap Opera Weekly, New York, Seventeen, Premiere, European Travel & Life, Automobile and New Woman. Mirabella, the fashion magazine, and TV Guide were not part of the sale, the people said.
 
Heavy Debt Incurred
 The price was fairly low compared with what the magazines might have fetched in the 1980's, but Peter Diamandis, former head of Diamandis Communications, said that given how treacherous the magazine market has been lately, Mr. Murdoch got a decent price.
But if the price was low, Mr. Murdoch had little choice. Like the heads of many other media companies, both domestic and foreign, Mr. Murdoch determined to expand his company internationally in the 1980's, presumably on the theory that only big global companies would prosper. Media executives justified that expansion on the theory that their properties generated so much cash that they could comfortably pay off part of the debt they had incurred, or, if neccessary, sell some properties at ever-rising prices to meet those obligations.
In the United States alone, Mr. Murdoch bought the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Metromedia's televison stations, TV Guide, a variety of magazines and book publishers.
But by this year Mr. Murdoch's cash flow was insufficient to meet debt payments and he was forced to sign the agreement with the banks to renegotiate his loans.
To some degree, the theory has proved true that diversification within media would pay off. Fox's movies "Home Alone" and "Edward Scissorhands" were both surprise hits. Because they were relatively low-budget films and were highly profitable, they took some of the pressure off the News Corporation. But not enough to avoid a substantial sale of assets.
And so last month, after much speculation, the magazines were put on the market. Mr. Murdoch, perhaps because he was so aware that in the current economy it would be hard to sell the unsuccessful properties, was determined to sell all the publications as a group.
 
Interest From Other Buyers
 A number of buyers were apparently interested, including Reed International, the British concern that has been expanding its American publishing business and whose properties include Variety, the entertainment trade paper.
But the sale was not easy because a number of Mr. Murdoch's magazines do not make money, according to proprietary data.
Of those that do, The Racing Form is by far the most profitable, having had cash flow last year of $25 million, according to industry estimates.
Soap Opera Digest is also considered a desirable property. Last year it had $15 million in cash flow on sales of $37 million.
 
Magazine Business Struggles
 Mr. Murdoch sold his publications for about 10 times their last year's cash flow, or the cash the magazines generated. That is a relatively low multiple compared with what the publications might have fetched in the 1980's. Mr. Diamandis said the going rate was about seven times cash flow. "In the late 1980's, the multiples were as high as 15 times cash flow," he said.
Soap Opera Weekly is a relatively new publication that is barely making money.
The data on New York magazine reflect not only how difficult the magazine business has become, but particularly how tough the New York market is. Last year the weekly publication had cash flow of $7 million on revenues of $47 million. Its cash flow was down from $9.7 million a year earlier, and its revenues were relatively flat.
On the other hand, some magazines, like Seventeen, have prospered despite new competition from publications like Sassy. The monthly magazine aimed at teen-age girls had cash flow of $9.6 million last year on net revenues of $47 million. That profit was up from $8.4 million a year earlier.
 
Losses for New Publications
 The data also indicate how difficult it is to start a new publication and how long it takes before that publication makes a profit. For example, Premiere, a magazine that covers the movie industry, lost $1.6 million last year on revenues of $14.5 million. Although it continues to lose money, the losses have declined. The previous year it had lost $5 million on sales of $11 million.
European Travel & Life also continues to lose money, having a negative cash flow last year of $984,000. Still, that figure is down sharply from the previous year's loss of $2.4 million, giving some indication that eventually it may become profitable.
Mr. Murdoch did not sell TV Guide, which many industry experts say was Mr. Murdoch's biggest acquisition error. The News Corporation paid $3 billion for a publication considered to have been worth $2 billion or less.
K-III Holdings was formed in February 1989 by Kohlberg, Kravis and several former executives at Macmillan Inc., the publishing and information services company. Since then it has been involved in various acquisitions or proposed acquisitions in publishing. In May 1990 it bought Ward's Communications, which puts out a highly regarded auto industry newsletter, and in December it bought the assets of Field Publications and Funk & Wagnalls.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Trade Bloc War? Concern Grows

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IS the world economy headed for a split into three warring trade blocs -- Europe, North America and East Asia?
"Not if we succeed in the Uruguay Round," said Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, during a discussion in New York this week. Named for the country where the current trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade began in 1986, the Uruguay Round broke down in December over Europe's refusal to yield to American demands for drastic cuts in farm subsidies. 
 Efforts to get the trade talks back on track are going on. But the most formidable obstacle to their success -- European resistance to lower subsidies -- has not been removed.
Mr. Delors seeks to blame the United States for this. He said he had told President Bush that if the United States continued its "negative" approach, in an attempt to paint the European Community as "the bad guy of the world," the talks would fail. "Bush understands that," Mr. Delors said. "We cannot negotiate under these circumstances."
The Bush Administration regards this as evasion. It denies that it has taken an antagonistic line toward Europe on trade. The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, "has said nothing mean," said her spokesman, Timothy O'Leary. He said Mr. Delors was "trying to divert attention from the real issue -- outrageously high European agricultural subsidies."
Do the American negotiators see any sign that the Europeans are willing to change their position? "There's nothing yet," Mr. O'Leary said. And what about the future? "It will depend on the mood," he said.
But Mr. Delors said he thought there was "a better mood" ahead for discussing agriculture. "I share the fears of many economists and politicians about a world divided into many blocs," he said.
This view represents a growing awareness that the United States is moving to establish its own regional trade bloc and is prepared to take unilateral action against countries that it deems to be discriminating against American exports.
Following the free-trade agreement with Canada, the Bush Administration is moving aggressively to negotiate a wide-ranging free-trade agreement with Mexico. The Administration faces opposition from labor and environmental groups but is being strongly supported by a coalition of business interests favoring the pact and supporting the Administration's request for "fast track" negotiating authority, which requires that trade agreements be voted up or down by Congress without amendment.
Two motions are now before Congress to end that fast-track authority. But President Bush intends to submit a plan to Congress within the next week to protect workers' rights and the environment to safeguard the Mexican agreement and fast-track bargaining authority. The Administration thinks it has too much at stake to let the Mexican agreement fail.
It believes that the deal is the key to stronger economic growth on both sides of the border. And if the Mexican deal goes through, the Administration means to negotiate a similar free-trade arrangement with Chile and later with other Latin American countries.
Skeptics wonder whether the effort to build an American regional bloc makes sense. Prof. Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University calls American regionalism "an empty threat" to the European Community.
In a forthcoming article in Foreign Affairs, he declares: "It is not credible that the United States would shoot itself in the foot, and indeed higher up, by sidetracking her energies and her trade to a region whose fragile democracies, inflations, debts and slow growth rates offer a far less attractive market than the burgeoning Far East and the European Community, both of which are even now more substantial markets for American exports. If the United States turns foolishly away from the world to her own backyard, the European Community's likely reaction would be: fine, get buried in it."
That may be an overstatement. There is full awareness, both here and abroad, how vital to the economic growth of every country expanding world trade has been, and what a threat to future growth would be posed by a splitting off of the United States, Europe and East Asia into hostile regional trading blocs.
If the Uruguay Round fails, the largest German bank, the Deutsche Bank, states in its Bulletin, "the current trend toward inward-looking trading blocs will probably accelerate, and trade conflicts will multiply."
No country wants that outcome, knowing that it could breed recession or depression. Regionalism, based on internal free-trade principles, can contribute to the welfare of the Americas, Europe and East Asia, but only if each region is open to other regions and nations.

HEADLINE: Slump in Air Travel Brings Losses at UAL and Delta

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation and Delta Air Lines, two of the nation's largest airline companies, reported large losses for the first quarter yesterday, reflecting the sharp slide in air travel brought on by the Persian Gulf war and the recession.
UAL, which is based in Oak Grove Village, Ill., and is the parent of United Airlines, said it lost $156.9 million in the three months that ended on March 31. The Atlanta-based Delta said it had lost $84.1 million. 
 Such losses were "pretty much expected," said Thomas Canning, an analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation. "It's mostly a function of the weak traffic. People just weren't traveling in the first quarter."
The industry has been hit hard since the Persian Gulf crisis first began last August, inflating fuel prices. Airlines in the United States lost nearly $4 billion last year.
The airlines seem to be doing better now, with traffic picking up and fuel costs somewhat lower than at the peak of the gulf crisis. But much of the traffic was lured back by steep discounts.
The UAL loss is far greater than the $36.4 million the company lost in the first quarter of last year. UAL's revenues rose slightly, to $2.56 billion from $2.51 billion.
"Our dismal first-quarter results were due primarily to a very significant, industrywide reduction in travel following the outbreak of the Persian Gulf war," the chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, said.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, UAL's stock fell 12.5 cents, to $159.25.
 
Delta's Traffic Growth
 At Delta, Thomas J. Roeck Jr., the chief financial officer, said traffic was up 8 percent in the quarter. The company's loss was in contrast to a profit of $31.3 million, or 48 cents a share, in the 1990 quarter.
He said a large portion of the traffic growth in the first two months of the year came from "discount fare promotions."
Delta, the third-largest United States carrier, after American Airlines and United, said its revenues totaled $2.29 billion, up slightly from $2.12 billion in the 1990 period.
The company's stock rose $1.125, to $71.875, on the Board Board.

HEADLINE: Disney's Quarterly Profits Fall 29%

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 25

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company said today that its earnings for the quarter ended March 31 fell 29 percent as a weak economy and the Persian Gulf war hurt attendance at its theme parks, and box-office flops depressed results from its film division.
Disney said its net income for the quarter, the second of its fiscal year, was $126.6 million, or 95 cents a share, compared with $178.5 million, or $1.29 a share, in the comparable period last year. Revenues for the quarter were $1.44 billion, an increase of 10.8 percent over the period a year earlier. 
 Operating income in the company's theme parks and resorts segment fell 33 percent, to $130.7 million. Revenues in the segment fell 6 percent, to $671.1 million. The company singled out lower attendance at Walt Disney World in Florida, lower occupancy rates at its resort hotels and the costs of expansion as reasons for the decline. Results in the segment were helped somewhat by higher per-capita guest spending, Disney said.
In the film entertainment segment, operating income fell 20 percent, to $46.2 million. Revenues in the segment rose 31 percent, to $613 million. Disney said the drop in income was primarily attributable to the weak box-office performance of two movies, "Scenes from a Mall," a comedy starring Woody Allen and Bette Midler, and "Run," a drama about a student trying to avoid local mobsters.
Disney released its earnings after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where the company's shares closed at $115.125, down $2.875.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Give Vietnam $1 Million; Assistance Is First Since the War

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today that it would provide financial assistance to Hanoi for the first time since the Vietnam War, approving a small but symbolically significant aid package for Vietnamese disabled during the fighting.
The announcement that $1 million would be made available for artificial limbs comes less than a week after the two nations agreed to open an office in Vietnam to resolve the cases of American soldiers missing since the war. It represents one more cautious step in a slow warming of relations that began two years ago.
 
Ties Hinge on Cooperation
 Administration officials reiterated that an initiation of full diplomatic relations or the lifting of a 15-year trade embargo would hinge on Hanoi's cooperation in accounting for all missing American soldiers and in reaching a diplomatic settlement to the civil war in Cambodia. 
 But in the statement announcing the aid, Richard H. Solomon, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, also pointedly expressed appreciation for Vietnam's program of economic reforms.
State Department officials said the Agency for International Development would funnel the $1 million in aid through private American humanitarian groups, which will produce the artificial limbs in Vietnam.
The limbs will go to people who suffered their wounds during the Vietnam War, including soldiers from the North and South Vietnamese armies, members of the Vietcong and civilians.
Officials said the program would be similar to efforts for the disabled in Afghanistan, Uganda and Mozambique. They said they could not estimate how many people would be treated.
"It's a sign of new cooperation," said a State Department official who monitors Vietnam. "But it is not a step toward resuming diplomatic relations." No Government officials will be sent to Vietnam to work on the aid program, he added.
Mr. Solomon told the Senate subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific affairs that the United States had conditionally pledged aid involving artificial limbs and child care in 1987, when Vietnamese and American officials first agreed to work together on accounting for the missing soldiers.
"We have found some improvements in cooperation, but limited results," Mr. Solomon said, "and Vietnam really needs to accelerate unilateral and joint efforts to achieve the results we are seeking."
 
Role of Office in Hanoi
 Referring to the temporary office on M.I.A.'s that will be opened in Hanoi, he said: "It will have no diplomatic or political responsibilities, and should not be seen as a first step in the normalization process. It can, however, help to accelerate normalization once a Cambodia settlement is signed."
The United States still lists some 2,276 Americans as missing or unaccounted for in the Vietnam War. Since August 1987, Vietnam has turned over more than 288 sets of remains, but only 117 have been identified as those of Americans. Most of the others were judged not to be the remains of Americans or could not be identified.
Ann Mills Griffiths, executive secretary of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, said the aid program was "a very positive move," adding: "We are hopeful the temporary office may facilitate greater results. But that is up to the Vietnamese."
Gen. John Vessey, the special envoy to Hanoi on prisoners of war and the missing, has focused on 119 "discrepancy cases" in which the United States believes that soldiers were seen alive after their planes were shot down or they were otherwise separated from their units.
 
Progress in 13 Cases
 Kenneth C. Quinn, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who is working with General Vessey, told the Senate subcommittee that American-Vietnamese technical teams had made progress in 13 of those cases by digging up remains and retrieving other evidence.
Economic aid to Vietnam has long been a center of controversy. During negotiations with the Carter Administration in 1977, Vietnam insisted that the United States had an obligation to contribute billions of dollars toward the country's postwar recovery.
The Vietnamese based their claim on two documents. One was the Paris cease-fire agreement of 1973, which pledged American support for Vietnam's reconstruction. The second was a letter sent by President Nixon to Prime Minister Pham Van Dong after the cease-fire that reportedly pledged more than $4 billion in food and reconstruction aid.
Neither the Ford nor the Carter Administration accepted Hanoi's argument, maintaining that its invasion of South Vietnam in 1975 broke the cease-fire agreement.
The prospect of diplomatic ties vanished in December 1978, when Vietnam invaded Cambodia to overthrow the Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot. But relations slowly began to improve in 1989, when Hanoi removed the last of 140,000 Vietnamese combat troops from Cambodia.
Although Vietnam still provides a considerable number of military advisers to Phnom Penh, the Bush Administration moved to increase cooperation last July by opening talks with Hanoi on ways to make peace in Cambodia.
 
U.S. Licenses Aid Groups
 Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d went a step further that month when he said the Administration would encourage private American groups to offer humanitarian aid to Vietnam. The Administration has since licensed 36 organizations or individuals to provide $4.3 million in relief.
Administration policy drew a good deal of criticism today from both Republican and Democratic senators.
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, a Vietnam veteran and a Democratic critic of the Administration's Vietnam policy, welcomed the announcement. But the senator, who will travel to Hanoi next week, suggested that the Administration was "holding the people of Vietnam and our own relationship and our own benefits that we gain from it a prisoner -- not just to our feelings about the Vietnam War, but prisoner also to the Cambodian conflict."
He said the missing soldiers could be more rapidly accounted for if the Administration expanded its trade and communications with Hanoi.
Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, asserted in testimony before the subcommittee that United States intelligence agencies had not been aggressive enough in following up "live sighting reports" of American servicemen who could still be alive in Vietnam.
 
Talk of Sighting P.O.W.'s
 Mr. Smith complained that the agencies had "repeatedly denied" Congressional requests to review "first-hand accounts from refugees who say they have seen American P.O.W.'s in captivity in Southeast Asia, some as recently as January 1991."
Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, said he agreed with Mr. Smith. "I'm not criticizing Vietnam as much as I am our own Government," Mr. Helms said, referring to information on the missing servicemen. "I've never heard as much double-talk as I have gotten each time when you try to reason or learn something from our Government."

HEADLINE: Panel Asks Bush to Cite 3 Nations

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
A panel of Cabinet officials has recommended to President Bush that the United States officially cite China, India and Thailand on Friday for tolerating violations of American copyrights and patents, Congressional and Administration officials said today.
Such a move would require the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills to begin a formal investigation and negotiations with each country. It would also authorize, but not require, her to increase duties or introduce other restrictions on imports from these countries if no improvements were made by December or early next year. 
 The United States and American trade associations are concerned about reports that Chinese companies are copying American pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals and computer programs without paying any license fees to the inventors. They have also complained that India and Thailand do not protect American patents on pharmaceuticals and copyrights on records, books and movies.
 
Difficulty Seen in Citing China
 The recommendation of the Economic Policy Council, which includes President Bush's top advisers on economic issues, does not guarantee that China will be cited. A former Ambassador to China, the President has made American relations with China his personal responsibility and has resisted sanctions proposed in the past for Chinese human rights violations.
Victoria Clarke, a spokeswoman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, declined to comment. "There's only one desk officer in this town on China, and that's George Bush," she said.
Wu Jianmin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, warned the United States today that any punitive measures linked to intellectual property rights would hurt relations with China, The Associated Press reported from Beijing.
 
Decision Near on China's Status
 The decision on whether to cite China for failing to protect American intellectual property rights comes almost two years after the Tiananmen Square massacre and less than six weeks before the President must decide whether to renew China's most-favored-nation trading status. This status, granted in 1980, allows Chinese goods to enter the United States at the lowest tariff rates available for each product.
China's most-favored-nation status is subject to annual renewal by the President with the acquiescence of either house of Congress. When President Bush renewed the status last year, House members angry about Chinese human rights violations voted to cancel the move, but the Senate took no action before going into its summer recess.
President Bush is required to notify Congress by June 3 of any renewal this year. Opponents of most-favored-nation status for China, who have been led by Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, would then have until Sept. 3 to overturn this step.
 
Special 301 Measure
 The action recommended by the Economic Policy Council on Wednesday night would represent the first time that the United States has cited a country under the so-called Special 301 measure. This measure is a section of the nation's trade law that was amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 to toughen penalties for foreign countries that do not protect American intellectual property rights.
In 1989 and 1990, the United States put several countries -- including China, India and Thailand -- on a list of countries to be monitored for possible failures to protect American copyrights and patents.
The Trade Policy Group, an interagency committee of deputies to the members of the Economic Policy Council, recommended last week to the council that Indonesia also be cited, prompting an unusual burst of lobbying by representatives of the Indonesian Government, a Congressional official said today. Indonesia was not included in the final list of countries recommended by the Economic Policy Council, said the Administration officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified.
 
Thai Official's Comment
 Indonesian and Indian officials declined to comment. A Thai official who insisted on anonymity said trade negotiations between Thai and American officials at the United States consulate in Amsterdam ended earlier this week without an agreement on intellectual property.
In its recently published annual review of foreign trade barriers, the Office of the United States Trade Representative found that China lacked a copyright law and that a planned law fell short of international standards. The Federal agency also cited industry reports that patented American pharmaceutical and oter chemical products were "being produced in China, without license, for both domestic and export markets."
The report added that "China, in copying these U.S. products, reaps the benefits without incurring the associated costs" of development.
The President's response is imminent because under the Special 301 measure, the United States trade representative, who is part of the President's Executive Office, must identify offending countries within 30 days after issuing its annual report on foreign trade barriers. The report was issued this year on March 29, meaning that the last business day before the deadline is Friday.
 
Discouraging to Investment
 Roger W. Sullivan, the president of the United States-China Business Council, a Washington-based association of American companies with investments in China, said the lack of protection for intellectual property rights there was discouraging investment.
Mr. Sullivan said American executives had told him, "We're not going to go forward with this investment because the guy who supplied us with the process software won't let us go in there."
The trade association has favored the citing of China under Special 301, while continuing to oppose any effort to take away China's most-favored-nation status. "Some of the companies, particularly the larger ones, feel that this is the way to address the real problems, and not the blockbuster approach" of removing most-favored-nation status, Mr. Sullivan said.
 
Wider Charges Against China
 China's image in Congress has declined further in recent months because of its ballooning trade surplus with the United States, allegations that it forces political prisoners to produce products for export markets and concerns about its exports of arms and nuclear technology.
Representative Pelosi plans to introduce a measure next week in the House that would link a renewal of China's most-favored-nation status to its performance on human rights, an aide said today.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman also said today that linking trade ties to human rights would hurt American relations with China, The Associated Press reported.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.S. IS SKEPTICAL ON AUTONOMY PACT FOR KURDS IN IRAQ

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
White House officials expressed skepticism today over President Saddam Hussein's accord with Iraqi Kurds and said the Bush Administration was committed to building camps for the Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq.
The American reaction to the Iraqi-Kurdish agreement, announced in Baghdad on Wednesday, paralleled that of the Kurdish refugees themselves. Since their flight to the mountains, the refugees have insisted that they will not return to Iraq until Mr. Hussein is out of power, and they repeated that insistence today. 
 The American skepticism of Mr. Hussein's intentions toward the Kurds became evident when the White House said it had ordered about 300 armed Iraqis to leave the vicinity of Zakho, a northern Iraq town near where coalition forces are setting up a safe haven to resettle Kurdish refugees.
 
Letter to U.N. Delegate
 The order came in a letter delivered on Wednesday to Iraq's delegate to the United Nations, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, by Thomas R. Pickering, the American representative at the United Nations.
Iraq has protested the decision by American, French and British troops to occupy a buffer zone for refugees along the Iraq-Turkey border. But Mr. Anbari told reporters late today that Iraq had agreed to comply with the American order and had removed all but 50 police officers from the town.
Administration officials said they could not confirm Mr. Anbari's statement, and reporters in Zakho said they had seen several hundred armed Iraqis in Zakho as of today. But Pentagon officials said today that some Iraqi police officers might be allowed to remain in Zakho to maintain civil order. Kurds in the area say that the police officers are Iraqi soldiers in disguise, a report that has kept the fearful refugees from leaving the squalor of the mountains.
 
Waiting for a Safe Return
 The Administration says the Kurds' fears for their safety were not allayed by Wednesday's agreement between Mr. Hussein and Kurdish leaders. The preliminary accord reportedly guarantees democratic rule and increased autonomy for Iraqi Kurdistan, and would allow the estimated one million Kurdish refugees to return home in peace.
But Mr. Hussein made similar promises in 1970, they recalled, only to follow them up with ferocious attacks on Kurdish cities during rebellions in 1974, 1988 and again this year.
In remarks to reporters today, a senior Administration official who develops policy on the Kurds said the United States intended to protect hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees on both sides of the Turkey-Iraq border until their safe return to their homes could be reasonably assured.
He added that the Administration had no clear idea how that safe return could be negotiated, much less when. In the worst case, he said, it cannot be ruled out that the camps now being built by American and European forces will become "something like the Palestinian refugee camps" operated for years in the West Bank territory occupied by Israel since the 1967 war.
 
Prime Minister Comments
 In Baghdad today, Iraq's new Prime Minister, Saadun Hamadi, insisted that his Government was determined to repair all breaches with its enemies at home and abroad. Mr. Hamadi said that Iraq would rapidly comply with all United Nations terms for the lifting of economic sanctions and that Mr. Hussein had dealt with Kurdish leaders "with sincerity and good intentions."
Asked about the accord between Mr. Hussein and Kurdish leaders, the senior American official expressed doubt that Mr. Hussein could be trusted for long to keep his promise of fair treatment for the Kurds.
"It is in our interest, in everyone's interest, to have the Kurds go back to their homes, but also to go back to some kind of assurance that they will not be persecuted," the official said. "And we're not there yet. If you were a Kurd and had the bitter experience over I don't know how many years, would you just be willing to take Saddam's word on a piece of paper and go home? I think that's questionable."
 
Doubtful of International Help
 The American official said that it appeared unlikely that involvement by the United Nations or neutral powers could be enlisted to enforce the accord between Mr. Hussein and the Kurds because outside involvement would violate Iraq's sovereignty.
Although the United States has fewer objections to international assistance, he said, the question of outside involvement in internal political issues is especially sensitive in other nations, Chief among them are the Soviet Union and China, two members of the United Nations Security Council who are coping with domestic unrest of their own.
The senior official said he was more optimistic that the camps being built near the Turkish border could eventually be turned over to United Nations troops or other non-American supervision, if only because the Soviets and other powers have no desire to see American troops in Iraq for years.
 
Complaints of Iran
 The Pentagon said today that an Air Force C-141 transport would leave Washington on Friday for Teheran, where it would deliver a 145,000-pound load of donated blankets for a million Kurdish refugees in Iranian camps.
The plane will deliver the first shipment of American aid to Iran since the Iran-contra affair of 1985 and 1986, when the Reagan Administration secretly sold weapons to Iran.
Iran has complained bitterly that it has shouldered the bulk of Iraq's refugee problem with little outside assistance, and it called on the Bush Administration Sunday to offer more direct aid to Iran, saying the Kurdish problem was largely the creation of the United States and the gulf war..
The senior official said that the Friday shipment was arranged after the Iranians "suggested some limited help" to the Americans for its Kurdish refugees, but that "the door is not wide open" for further discussions on the refugee situation or any other matter.
 
Cease-Fire Issue
 He also maintained that the United States was not prepared to offer American assistance to some 500,000 Kurds who are reportedly massed at the Iraq-Iran border waiting to enter Iran.
Although the United States has given such assistance to Kurds at the Turkish border, it lacks bases or other facilities close enough to make deliveries to the Iran-Iraq border.
Iraq's compliance with the terms of the cease-fire in the gulf war became an issue again today when the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna said that Baghdad had failed to disclose the locations of its stocks of nuclear-weapons material, one of several United Nations requirements for the lifting of sanctions.
The State Department also told Iraq today that it had no objection to Iraqi crop dusting south of the 36th parallel but insisted that such activities in the Kurdish region north of that line be done by contractors under the supervision of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Iraq has asked to dust the crops out of fear that crop failure could contribute to famine in the devastated region.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
New Iraqi Premier Is Asking Improved Ties With Ex-Foes

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 25

 BODY:
Iraq's new Prime Minister, Saadun Hamadi, struck a broadly conciliatory note today, saying the country is moving toward democracy, wants better relations with the coalition nations and will scrupulously meet the United Nations terms for lifting economic sanctions.
In a 90-minute news conference with Iraqi and foreign journalists, the 57-year-old American-trained agronomist seemed to go out of his way to offer an olive branch to his country's former enemies. But he continued to criticize deployment of American troops in northern Iraq to protect Kurdish refugees, saying it is unjustified now that the United Nations is ready to do the job. 
 Speaking in Arabic from the head of an immense conference table seating more than 60 in the Ministry of Information, the Prime Minister said Iraq wanted to restore diplomatic relations with the Persian Gulf war's coalition partners if they would reciprocate by reopening their embassies in Baghdad.
He rejected American complaints that Iraq may have under-reported its stocks of chemical and other weapons to the United Nations, saying Baghdad is determined to comply fully with the Security Council's plan for destroying those weapons, compensating Kuwait and lifting the economic blockade as laid down in Resolution 687.
Iraq, he said firmly, has "no biological weapons or nuclear weapons," and the inventory of weapons of mass destruction that was sent to the United Nations this month "is correct and precise."
"Our primary objective is to implement the Security Council's resolutions," he said.
 
No Information on Zakho
 Asked whether Iraq would comply with the Bush Administration's demand to withdraw its military from the northern town of Zakho, where American troops are establishing a safe haven for Kurdish refugees, Mr. Hamadi said, "I'm not in a position to know about such things, and I can't answer you." At the United Nations, Iraq's envoy said Baghdad would comply with the demand.
Asked if Iraq had abandoned its territorial claim on Kuwait, the Prime Minister took a conciliatory line, saying: "We are looking to the future and want to forget the past. Therefore, I don't like to raise issues that may disrupt the situation now."
He promised that their companies would be welcome to bid for postwar reconstruction contracts in Iraq once the United Nations-imposed trade sanctions have been lifted.
As Iraq is one of the few OPEC oil producers able to increase its output, he pledged that his nation would cooperate with Saudi Arabia in regulating production to insure that the cost of oil rises smoothly in line with inflation if demand picks up later this decade and to prevent an economically disruptive jump in prices.
 
Sanctions Are Assailed
 Only once did Mr. Hamadi appear to take issue with the gulf war allies. Asked whether Iraq can realistically hope for normal relations with the rest of the world while President Saddam Hussein remains in power, he accused the United States and its allies of delaying an end to sanctions to force political change because this suits their interests and not because they object to the Iraqi Government on principle.
The United States, he argued, is traditionally friendly with Israel despite the continued Israeli occupation of Arab lands in violation of the Security Council's resolution. It also works closely with Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir, whom he described as a "well-known terrorist," guilty of "massacres against Palestinians."
He also expressed strong personal loyalty to Mr. Hussein, saying at one point, "I know no one who keeps as firmly to his principles as President Saddam Hussein." He said Iraq's leader was popular and had many historic achievements, which the world would recognize once the crisis was over.
An ascetic-looking man, Mr. Hamadi was appointed to the post of Prime Minister, which the President had previously held, in the wake of Iraq's defeat in the gulf war.
 
Democratic Reform Seen
 The decision to split the two jobs and create a separate Prime Minister and Cabinet is presented by Iraqis as the first step in the country's planned move toward greater democracy and pluralism, which was proposed as early as the 1980's but postponed as a result of the Iran-Iraq war.
The choice of Mr. Hamadi, who is a Shiite Muslim in a country where power has been firmly held by the Sunni minority, is widely seen as an attempt to reassure the restless Shiites in the south.
Mr. Hamadi threw no new light on the emerging political agreement between Baghdad and Kurdish opposition leaders announced last night by Jalal Talabani, head of the Patriotic Union for Kurdistan.
"I'm going to confirm that Iraq is conducting this dialogue with sincerity and good intentions," he said. "The aim is to find an objective, patriotic national solution to the autonomy issue."
Woven through much of what Mr. Hamadi said at the news conference was a classic exposition of the process of political reform that the Government says is getting under way in postwar Iraq.
According to this view, the revolutionary institutions that the ruling Baath Party established after it took power in 1968 are now "evolving into democratic institutions, gradually and practically."

Whither Art Prices
Are the prices for contemporary art going up, down or holding firm? 
 That question is among many posed by auctioneers, dealers, collectors and investors who view next week's sales of contemporary art at Sotheby's and Christie's in Manhattan as a barometer of how the market is faring in the recession.
Other questions these experts are asking include: How will auctiongoers respond to next week's evening sessions at Sotheby's and Christie's in which more than half the postwar artworks date from as recently as the 1970's and 80's? And will the record sum of $6.3 million, paid at Sotheby's at the peak of the art boom in 1988 for Robert Rauschenberg's "Rebus," be matched or bettered when the 1955 painting is presented again Tuesday night at the same house?
The contemporary-art auctions are the first in the two-week spring marathon of major art sales, which is expected to bring in a combined total of $174.4 million to $234.7 million. This would be drastically down from a year ago, when the combined total for the May art sales was $924.7 million.
This year's contemporary-art auctions are to take place 12 months after the end of a six-year boom in sales in this field. In the downturn at both houses that began last May and deepened in November, the dollar totals realized at each contemporary-art sale dropped precipitously -- in a few cases to less than half what the auction houses projected these sales would bring. And for the first time since the mid-1980's, the number of unsold properties soared at contemporary-art sales to as much as 50 percent of the works offered.
Because of the poor results of these sales, the economy and the Persian Gulf war, there had been speculation that Sotheby's would move its contemporary-art sale to London. "We never planned to move the New York sale of contemporary art to London -- only the Impressionist art," said David Nash, who heads Sotheby's fine art sales internationally. He said that when the war in the Persian Gulf was well under way in mid-February, he had suggested to Christie's that both houses combine their New York and London sales of Impressionist and modern art, a plan Christie's rejected.
 Both Sotheby's and Christie's say the number of unsold works next week should be lower than at the sales held last May and November. To counter these setbacks, said Lucy Mitchell-Innes, who heads Sotheby's sales of contemporary art in New York, she has organized the house's sale along different lines: "We have taken very little dealer property in this sale. And more than 75 percent of the evening session, and much of the rest of the sale, is from private collectors."
At Christie's, Diane Upright, who heads contemporary-art sales in New York, said: "Substantially more than half the works are from private collectors and are fresh to the market. This was a sale assembled in the middle of the war, when no one knew what would happen in the economy. We sought artworks that were off the market for many years and could be offered with conservative estimates. It's conservative estimates that produce an atmosphere of enthusiastic bidding."
Although no one knows whether the mix of works in these sales will spur buying and stem the proliferation of unsold properties, one thing is certain: the price levels of the art offered is lower, with fewer works expected to sell at or above $1 million and many more properties expected to bring $100,000 or less. The overall totals projected by Sotheby's and Christie's reflect these changes. They are half or a third of what the auction houses estimated the 1990 sales would realize.
Sotheby's two-day auction of postwar art begins at 7 P.M. on Tuesday, offering 74 works that the house expects will total $23.7 million to $32.1 million. The sale, which ends Wednesday, includes 272 items estimated by the house to bring $31.3 million to $42.4 million.
The most-talked-about artwork in next week's sales, Mr. Rauschenberg's "Rebus," is back at Sotheby's, where it was sold for $6.3 million in November 1988 to the Swedish real estate investor Hans Thulin, a price that remains a record at auction for a work by the artist. This time the painting is being sold by order of a Swedish finance company that has not been identified, and was the last painting to be consigned to the sale after the catalogue closed in early March.
"We were asked by the creditor to sell this painting," Ms. Mitchell-Innes said. "Mr. Thulin used the painting as collateral for a loan." The Swedish collector, who paid record prices at auction in the late 1980's for several artworks and two cars, quickly resold a few of them, including a Bugatti Royale 1931 sports coupe that he bought for $9.8 million at Christie's in London in 1987. Last May, Mr. Thulin said he had sold the Bugatti to a Japanese syndicate of businessmen but would not disclose the price he had been paid. Mr. Thulin did not return phone calls placed this week to his offices in Stockholm and Brussels. Before "Rebus" was shipped to Sotheby's, Mr. Thulin sent a blitz of faxes to art dealers in many countries offering to sell the painting for an undisclosed price.
Sotheby's presale estimate on "Rebus," a curiously serene painting splashed with paint, plaster, varnish, graffiti, a torn poster, comics and photographs, is $4 million to $6 million.
The same sale is to offer 30 works from the collection of Charles Saatchi, the British advertising magnate, including Cy Twombly's untitled gray painting from 1969, which Sotheby's estimates will bring $1 million to $1.5 million. The Saatchi holdings are not identified in the catalogue, but Sotheby's has named a number of them and confirmed that many of the sale's 45 properties date to the 1970's and 80's. Among them is Philip Guston's "Edge" from 1976, depicting in black and red a row of sturdily shod feet marching across the 6-by-10-foot canvas. The presale estimate is $700,000 to $900,000.
Among the other Saatchi works that are expected to bring lower prices are two by Jeff Koons -- "Travelbar" from 1986" ($70,000 to $90,000) and an assemblage of Hoover and Shelton vacuum cleaners completed in 1986 ($100,000 to $150,000). In addition, there are two by Susan Rothenberg -- "Cabin Fever" from 1976 ($250,000 to $350,000) and "Squeeze" from 1978-79 ($150,000 to $200,000) -- and Elizabeth Murray's "Sleep" from 1983-84. The Murray is expected to bring $80,000 to $100,000.
At Christie's, most of the value of the two-day contemporary-art auction is in the first session, which is to be held at 7 P.M. on Wednesday. The 54 works, expected by the house to bring $14.8 million to $20.4 million, are part of a two-day sale of 371 artworks that is expected to total $20.9 million to $28.5 million.
Among Christie's most important works is Mr. Twombly's "Near Parnassus," a 1964 dialogue painting of a gray ground from his Rome series that is expected to bring $3 million to $4 million. There are two paintings by Ellsworth Kelly -- "Black Curve IX" from 1976 ($550,000 to $650,000) and "Green White" from 1959 ($300,000 to $500,000).
 
 
The Beatty Collection
 Impressionist and contemporary artworks from the collection of Sir Alfred Chester Beatty, the New York-born mining industrialist, and his son, the late Chester Beatty, is to be auctioned at Sotheby's in late June in London and in November in New York. The Beatty collection -- best known for van Gogh's "Sunflowers," which was auctioned at Christie's in London in 1957 for $39.9 million -- includes 33 works expected to bring more than $20 million. The collections is being sold by the Helen Gertrude Chester Beatty Trust of London, established by the heirs of Sir Alfred's daughter-in-law, who died in 1986.
Among the most important paintings are two by Toulouse Lautrec -- "Bed," from 1898, a bordello scene that may sell for more than $2.5 million, and an 1891 depiction of Mme. Fabre doing her makeup, which may bring more than $5.9 million.

HEADLINE: Judge Holland's Stunning Surprise

 BODY:
Since plea bargains are rarely overturned, the chances that a judge would reject a deal crafted by the Federal Government, the state of Alaska and the world's largest oil company seemed almost nil. On Wednesday, however, Judge H. Russel Holland bravely threw out the agreement ordering Exxon to pay $100 million to settle criminal charges arising from the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
He said the fines were "inadequate" and sent "the wrong message, suggesting that spills are a cost of business that can be absorbed." In effect, he told the Bush Administration to strike a tougher bargain -- which it now can. 
 The original agreement ordered Exxon to pay not only criminal penalties but as much as $1 billion more in civil damages to help restore Alaska's environment. Despite obvious flaws, the settlement was praised by environmentalists and by this page as preferable to a long and chancy trial.
What began to change many minds was the release on April 8 of summaries of 58 scientific studies conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These summaries suggested far greater environmental damage than originally suspected. The full studies have not been released. Nor have studies of the spill's economic costs -- which, according to some participating economists, could amount to $5 billion or more.
There's no justifiable reason to keep those reports secret. The Justice Department argues that releasing the data now would weaken its case in any future trial. That argument is vastly outweighed by the data's public value -- to inform any new settlement, gauge the fairness of that settlement and, not least, help guide the restoration of Prince William Sound.
The parties now have three choices: a trial, a new fine imposed by Judge Holland, which could cost Exxon as much as $600 million more, or a renegotiated plea bargain. Nobody wants a long trial. A bigger penalty would surely serve as a further, welcome deterrent to industry carelessness. But the best solution would be a tough new deal, embracing both criminal and civil penalties, that would require more up-front money than the leisurely payout provided for in the original bargain and approximate more closely the damages implied in the still-secret reports.

HEADLINE: China's Gulags Deserve No Favors

 BODY:
In the long run, American consumers and Chinese democrats both benefit from the freest possible economic exchanges between the two countries.
China's very low wages translate into cheap import prices for a wide range of toys, clothing and electrical appliances. Hard currency flowing back from the U.S. increases the political leverage of Chinese constituencies favorable to renewed economic and political reform in places like the special economic zones of China's southeast coast. 
 Yet China's hard-line Communist regime confounds this long-term logic with its arrogant contempt for human freedoms and fair economic play. Beijing seems to interpret past Bush Administration indulgence of its appalling human rights record as a license for fresh abuses.
The appropriate American response is for President Bush to strictly condition, or even suspend, China's privileged access to U.S. markets, formally known as "most favored nation" status, when it comes up for renewal later this spring.
The worst abuse is China's shameless exploitation of convict labor for export production. Senator Jesse Helms has been raising this issue for some time, always eliciting stiff denials from Chinese authorities. Now Asia Watch, a New York-based human rights organization, has uncovered official Chinese documents that call for intensified labor camp production, targeted especially at U.S., German and Japanese markets.
American law has long banned the importation of prison-made goods from anywhere. The ideals of free trade can scarcely be fulfilled when labor is in chains. China's vast gulags hold millions. Many of these labor camp inmates are being punished for political offenses, like participation in the 1989 democracy movement. All endure extremely harsh conditions. Extending trade privileges to a gulag economy offends the most basic American values.
As a Communist country that denies its citizens the right of free emigration, China can only qualify for U.S. trade privileges by receiving an annual waiver, initiated by the President and subject to review by Congress.
For the past decade, China has been granted waivers on the reasoning that growing trade relations will bring the Chinese people human rights gains as well as economic benefits. This year, such reasoning will be hard to sustain without gagging on the idea of gulag work gangs.

HEADLINE: Fast Track on Trade Speeds Democracy's End;
Stimulus to Cleanup

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Border Boom's Dirty Residue Imperils U.S.-Mexico Trade" (front page, March 31) deserves clarification. You confuse my call for "free trade and a long-term plan for the environment" as supporting the conclusion that "most committed advocates of free trade insist that existing environmental problems should be addressed before free trade becomes a reality."
My position and that of the Border Trade Alliance, which promotes local economic development on both sides of the border, are clear. With the Environmental Protection Agency's assistance, Mexico's counterpart agency has drafted a strong set of environmental regulations. The problem is financial. The funds necessary for infrastructure development and the enforcement of environmental regulations are lacking throughout Mexico, not just in its northern border. The environment is not a trade issue to be included in free trade negotiations. 
 The Border Trade Alliance supports parallel, but separate, discussions of the financial problem. Where market access for United States technology, products, services and investments will improve environmental quality, we recommend that they be included in the free trade agreement. If you combine Mexico's environmental law with ready access for environmental products, services and investment, environmental quality under free trade will improve dramatically.
Contrary to your supposition, the compliance with environmental regulations by United States factories in Mexico, called maquiladoras, sets the standard among Mexico's domestic industries. Pollution did not begin with the maquiladoras.
It is unfortunate that critics of the free trade agreement confuse the problem with the means for a solution. The United States-Mexico border needs new, clean industries, skilled technicians, technology and investment, which generate a tax base from which to finance infrastructure. Free trade will be a significant catalyst for stimulating economic growth in Mexico, creating jobs for thousands of citizens.
In addition, Mexico needs political, social and economic reform, including tax restructuring, environmental consciousness and investment to take a developed nation position on the environment. Defeating free trade portends no solution for the overburdened, underfinanced infrastructure along the United States-Mexico border.

HEADLINE: Business Failures Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Business failures increased by 53.3 percent in the first quarter, the biggest rise in seven years, the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation reported yesterday.
The business researh company said services and retail trade suffered the worst, a typical situation during a recession. The company said 20,811 businesses failed in the first quarter, compared with 13,577 in the first quarter of 1990. 
 "Every region and every major industry sector, with the exception of mining, posted a sizable increase in failures in the first quarter," said Joseph W. Duncan, the company's corporate economist.
Failures in the services sector jumped 58.7 percent, to 5,437, from 3,425 a year earlier. Retail trade failures increased 32.5 percent, to 4,109 from 3,101.
Many companies that serve businesses failed as large businesses cut back on their use of outside companies, Mr. Duncan said.
Financial services and real estate companies continued to fall victim to a depressed real estate economy. The category recorded 1,256 companies, a 43 percent rise from a year earlier.
Construction companies posted a 48 percent rise in failures, with 2,849 concerns going out of business in the quarter.
More than 1,300 businesses failed in New England, more than double the number in the 1990 quarter and the biggest rise in any region.

HEADLINE: New Stance on Car Sales

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 26

 BODY:
The president of the National Automobile Dealers Association urged auto makers today to increase cash rebates and offer lower financing rates to stimulate car sales.
Frank Anderson Jr., president of the association, said, "The time has come to jump-start car and truck sales, even if it takes short-term measures we don't like and have traditionally opposed, like consumer rebates and interest subvention programs." 
 Mr. Anderson's comments were in a speech delivered today to a group of Chevrolet dealers in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. A text of the speech was released by the association.
His statements today represent a shift in position for the association. The group has opposed rebates and low-interest loans offered by the car companies "because they take the dealer out of the merchandising process," Mr. Anderson told the dealers today.
The change comes as many dealers are in dire financial situations. Last year, 900 dealers went out of business, according to the association, which represents 25,000 dealerships. Sales of cars and light trucks in this year's first quarter were 11.4 percent below the level in the 1990 quarter.

HEADLINE: America West Loss Widens

DATELINE: TEMPE, Ariz., April 26 (AP)

 BODY:
America West Airlines said today that it lost $49.9 million in the first quarter because of the Persian Gulf war, the recession and high jet fuel prices.
Al Frei, America West's chief financial officer, called the quarter "the most severe operating environment in U.S. aviation history" and said the loss industrywide was about $4 billion over the last six months. 
 For the period ended March 31, America West had revenues of $352.9 million. The results compared with a net loss of $2.6 million on revenues of $304.8 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Beauty Salon Magazine Fails

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Whittle Communications is suspending publication of its American Style magazine for beauty salons because of sluggish advertising demand, the company said yesterday.
The fourth issue of the magazine, which was started last fall and was published every other month, will be its last. It was distributed to 140,000 beauty salons nationwide. 
 "American Style was a big idea at the wrong time," said Peter Finn, publisher of American Style. "We gave it our best shot, but current economics and the national downturn in the print industry proved too much for us."
The decision represents a rare setback for Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., but American Style is not the first media casualty in the beauty parlor market.
Murdoch Magazines called off a planned video service for beauty salons before it started last summer because of worries that advertising support might not be available. The publishers of Confetti magazine halted publication of their monthly beauty salon magazine in February after a major backer withdrew his support.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Moves Up Slightly on Mixed Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar edged aimlessly higher yesterday as traders absorbed mixed messages about the United States economy and interest rates ahead of this weekend's meeting of world monetary officials.
Gold fell slightly in New York but was mixed overseas. On the Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $353.90 an ounce, down 10 cents from late Thursday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $353.50, also off 10 cents from late Thursday. 
 Currency trading was extremely quiet in the absence of major factors.
The Commerce Department reported a second consecutive decline in gross national product; the decline was worse than some analysts had expected, but the currency market took the news in stride.
The report said the economy shrank at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the quarter. The drop in gross national product, the total output of goods and services, outpaced the 1.6 percent rate of decline recorded from October through December.
Traders were also relatively unmoved by an apparent sign of higher inflation in the report's inflation gauges. One gauge, a price index that measures a fixed basket of goods, increased at an annual rate of 5.1 percent in the first quarter -- up from a 4.7 percent rise in the fourth quarter.
"The G.N.P. report was a classic mixed bag. For the dollar market, it very quickly was just thrown out the window," said Jerry Egan, chief dealer at the Bank of Boston.
Market participants largely focused on this weekend's meeting in Washington of monetary officials from seven leading economies. President Bush was scheduled to meet with the finance ministers and central bankers on Sunday.
Dollar traders were concerned by remarks made yesterday by Karl Otto Pohl, head of the German central bank, indicating he wanted to keep German monetary policy tight.
Stronger interest rates in overseas markets generally help currencies competing against the dollar.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a close of 137.83 yen, from 137.87 on Thursday. Later in London, it rose to 138.15 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 138.10 yen, up from late Thursday's 137.85 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6860, from $1.6935 late Thursday. Sterling also lost ground in New York, where a pound cost $1.6905, down from $1.6915 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.7510 German marks, up from 1.7490; 1.4766 Swiss francs, up from 1.4670; 5.9110 French francs, up from 5.8995; 1,294.00 Italian lire, up from 1,291.00, and 1.1523 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1532.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Lifted by Late Rise in Futures

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
A late rally lifted prices of long-term Treasury bonds yesterday, while the intermediate and shorter maturities remained narrowly mixed. Dealers attributed the late turnabout to an advance in prices of Treasury bond futures in Chicago in the last hour of trading there. The Chicago bond futures market closes at 3 P.M., Eastern time.
Earlier in the session, both cash and futures prices had been under pressure from the start of trading. At that time the Government had reported that the first-quarter gross national product had declined by 2.8 percent on an annual basis, following a decline of 1.6 percent in the last quarter of 1990.
 
Increase in Inflation
 Ordinarily, this latest sign of a weakening economy would have benefited the markets in bonds and other fixed-income debt issues because it would mean less upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. But the first-quarter data also showed that inflation, the bane of the fixed-income market, had increased to 5.1 percent at an annual rate, from 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1990. 
 In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year long bonds were offered at 96 9/32, up 9/32, while the yield fell to 8.20 percent, from 8.23 percent the day before and 8.24 percent a week ago. Earlier, in Chicago, the spot June bond futures closed at 96.7, up 10/32 on the day and 17/32 for the week.
"As is often the case, the cash bond market followed the lead set by the Chicago bond futures," said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president and credit market specialist at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Significantly, much of the late buying in Chicago was short covering, which usually indicates a shift in market sentiment. Aside from the G.N.P. data, there was no other news of consequence."
One explanation for the change in sentiment, Mr. Sullivan continued, was the belief that some of the Group of Seven industrialized nations meeting in Washington this weekend will resist efforts to lower the value of the dollar. While a strong dollar often has a negative impact on exports, it does make dollar-denominated securities more attractive. The dollar closed the week on a firm note, which may also have contributed to the late rally.
"The late rally may have also reflected expectations of a sharp rise in unemployment when the April jobs data are released next Friday morning," Mr. Sullivan added.
The Federal Reserve, for its part, drained reserves from the banking system for the sixth time in the last seven sessions to prop up the key Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for temporary loans. At the time of the draining, the funds were trading at 5 15/16 percent, or slightly below the Fed's perceived target of 6 percent. Later, the usual pre-weekend lessening of demand for funds caused the rate to slip down to 5 7/8 percent.
Among the shorter Treasury maturities, discount rates on bills were slightly higher. The Treasury said it would auction $11.75 billion of new one-year bills on Thursday.
In the note sector, prices rose from 1/32 for the two-year issue to as much as 3/32 for the 10-year issue.

HEADLINE: Washington Presses Japan to Open Construction Jobs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
After several years of diplomatic fencing, Japan and the United States traded harsher jabs today over American access to the Japanese construction market.
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, began a legal process that could result in Japanese companies being barred from many Federal and federally funded construction projects in the United States, beginning on June 1. 
 A Japanese negotiator who insisted on anonymity said that if the sanctions go into effect, Japan will retaliate by suspending its current program of giving preferential treatment to foreign companies on 17 big public works projects. But he said considerable progress had been made recently in negotiations and insisted that the American sanctions would probably never go into effect.
 
3 Nations Cited

An American official who also insisted on anonymity agreed that some issues were being resolved. The Japanese Government offered today to expand the preferential treatment program to certain other projects, he said, while adding that the sanctions would go into effect if remaining differences were not addressed.
Mrs. Hills today also officially cited China, India and Thailand for tolerating violations of patents, trademarks and copyrights. This could result in duties or other restrictions on imports from all three countries.
She said President Bush approved of the decision to name China. The President, a former chief of the American liaison office in China, resisted sanctions after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.
Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who led a push in Congress for citing the three countries, said he was "very pleased" with their designation.
 
A Hardening Stance

Mrs. Hills's moves reflect a hardening of the Administration's stance on trade and a new willingness to take unilateral action against countries perceived as treating American businesses unfairly.
The collapse of negotiations last winter in Brussels for a new global round of tariff reductions has cleared the way diplomatically and legally for the more aggressive stance. The American trade laws pertaining to economic sanctions permit less action to be taken when foreign countries are proceeding in good faith with bilateral or multilateral negotiations.
The move against Japanese construction companies comes five years of increasingly acrimonious disputes over the tiny share of Japanese public works contracts that are awarded to American companies.
The Japanese Government has maintained that the limited success of American firms reflects their lack of experience in the Japanese market. American trade negotiators have maintained that American firms are excluded deliberately.
Today's move was partly symbolic, because Japanese companies do little work on Federal and federally funded projects in the United States. In 1989, Japanese companies won contracts worth $2.8 billion in an American market worth $435 billion, said Elizabeth Dugan, a spokeswoman for the Commerce Department.
But Federal projects accounted for only $14 billion of the market, and Japanese companies won only $100 million worth of contracts for these projects, she said.
By comparison, the Japanese construction market is variously estimated at $300 billion to $550 billion, with American companies claiming only $300 million a year.
The proposed regulation would bar Japanese companies from public works projects that receive money from the Energy, Transportation and Defense departments and from the Bureau of Reclamation in the Interior Department. Appropriations for these projects amount to at least $21 billion this fiscal year, Mrs. Hills said.
 
 Problems in Europe

The procurement practices of the European Community and three of its members -- Germany, France and Italy -- are also causing concern and are now the subject of negotiations, Mrs. Hills said.
John R. Tucker, president of AEG Westinghouse Transportation Systems Inc., a Pittsburgh-based maker of mass transit equipment, said Japan had raised a series of obstacles to American construction companies. Japanese criticisms of American safety and tidiness practices, he said, are only the latest in a series of smokescreens thrown up to obscure a refusal to do business with American companies.

HEADLINE: Federated Will Offer a Reorganization Plan

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Fifteen months after entering bankruptcy, Federated Stores Inc. will ask a Federal judge on Monday to approve a reorganization plan that would offer cash and notes worth 100 cents on the dollar to the unsecured creditors of seven of its store groups, including Bloomingdale's, according to creditors and executives close to the company.
The plan also provides for an offer of Federated common stock to unsecured creditors of Abraham & Straus, another New York store division, and of the Lazarus stores in Ohio, they said. 
 All told, Federated has $7 billion in debt, and hopes to eliminate it all through these offers.
In effect, the offer to the unsecured creditors of the seven store subsidiaries represents a 100 percent payback over three to five years, these people said. The notes involved will be interest-bearing term notes. The offer will be made to the unsecured creditors of Bloomingdale's, New York; Burdines, Miami; Rich's Inc., Atlanta; Jordan Marsh, Boston; Maas Brothers, Tampa, Fla.; Bon Marche, Seattle, and Stern's, Paramus, N.J. The unsecured creditors are mostly suppliers and service companies like advertising agencies. It was not clear what the plan held out for Federated's secured creditors, primarily its banks.
The offer to the A.& S. and Lazarus creditors has an undetermined value at this time, because the approximately one million shares of Federated stock to be offered to them have no market value until the company emerges from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy and goes public. The one million such shares were authorized by Federated Stores, the American holding company for the Campeau Corporation, of Toronto, which owns the nine store groups in the United States. But those shares were never issued.
Carole Sanger, vice president for communications at Federated's headquarters in Cincinnati, said the company did not comment on speculation. Other unsecured creditors familiar with the plan said that industry reports of an arrangement of 50 percent cash and 50 percent notes for the seven subsidiaries was not correct because it had been changed from a week ago. However, the retail executives familiar with the plan's contents said yesterday that they had not been informed that the ratio had been changed.
The retail executives familiar with the plan said details were still being changed. But the basic framework, calling for cash and notes to certain creditors and equity to others, was expected to remain.
Creditors reacting yesterday to the present form of the reorganization plan expressed a variety of opinions. Some wanted to wait for a fully refined plan because the basic one they had seen had too many loopholes. Some said they were encouraged by it in general terms. One area of potential controversy was said to be the precise maturity period for the interest-bearing notes. Another would be some clarification of the value of the Federated equity to be offered to the A.& S.-Lazarus creditors. A third issue to be resolved was the ratio of the contemplated exchange of bonds to equity.
Federated Department Stores and the Allied Stores Corporation, which respectively own five and four of the store groups, went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Jan. 15, 1990, along with all the store divisions. Campeau had bought Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988. The Federated Stores Inc. name was created for the American holding company.
Although all subsidiaries and divisions were profitable, the high debt created by the takeover compelled the American stores to seek court protection from their debts.
The basic plan, if approved by the court in Cincinnati, is expected to be altered and refined for at least six months, the retailers said, with the reorganization beginning no sooner than the end of Federated's fiscal year on Jan. 31, 1992. Toward the end of the first quarter ending in April, they said, Federated would go public and the authorized shares would then assume some form of market value.
The differences in the proposed settlements to creditors of the seven store groups under Federated and Allied and the two divisions of Federated stem from the fact that the two groups had varying ownership and corporate affiliations with Campeau.
Federated's business plan, announced in October, has largely been scrapped, according to Kurt Barnard, a New York analyst and publisher of a retail marketing newsletter under his name. "The recession and consumer retrenchments have sobered Federated management into recognition that consumer buying and strengthening competition may be more damaging than first assumed," he said.

HEADLINE: MAGAZINES MURDOCH IS SELLING, AND ONE HE IS NOT;
New York Magazine Hurt by City's Slump

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
New York magazine, perhaps the best-known city magazine, has seen better days.
With the New York economy in a tailspin, the magazine's total advertising pages dropped from 3,126 in the 1989 fiscal year to 2,905 in the 1990 fiscal year. Indeed, it has only been through aggressive increases in the price charged per ad page that the magazine has stemmed some of the decline in ad revenues, and it is only through continued such increases that it expects to turn ad revenues around by the 1992 fiscal year. 
 "How has New York been doing over the last couple years?" asked Judith Price, president of rival Avenue magazine, referring to the city's economy. "Pretty lousy. That's the problem."
Financial documents that were circulated to potential buyers last year show the magazine produced $7 million in cash flow on revenues of $48 million in the 12 months that ended June 1990, for a 15 percent margin.
"That's very low for a local magazine," said Robert A. Cohen, president of a New York magazine consulting company that bears his name. Typical operating margins are 20 to 30 percent, he said.
"New York magazine, like all local regional magazines," he said, "is suffering from a near-collapse of the retail advertising market and I would imagine that it has lost tens of millions of dollars of value versus what it could have been sold for three years ago."
 
One's Loss, Another's Opportunity
 While the slippage at the magazine is a loss for Rupert Murdoch, its current owner, it represents a buying opportunity for Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, which on Thursday agreed to buy New York and eight other publications from Mr. Murdoch.
This year, the magazine's forecast calls for $9.8 million on revenues of $49.2 million, and next year $11.9 million on revenues of $54 million. Those snapshots appear to have been taken before charging the magazine for its share of the overhead costs borne by Mr. Murdoch's organization, like interest costs. Depending on the size of those costs, it is possible the magazine was even less profitable to Mr. Murdoch than the documents suggest.
Media experts also questioned whether the magazine would in fact see the projected recovery even with, as Mr. Murdoch's investment bankers suggest, the recent demise of 7 Days and Manhattan,inc.
"There are so many high-end books in New York; it's a crowded market, and then with the intrusion of VCR's, people don't have time to read a thick book each week," said Paul DuCharme, director of print media at Grey Advertising.
For all the bad news, media experts said the magazine had other lures for a potential owner, like the weekly window it offers into an affluent, mostly New York audience of 1.6 million readers. On the surface, its paid circulation has held steady at 430,000, but lately those figures have been helped by a costly increase in copies given away to airlines.
Ms. Price of Avenue magazine is highly respectful of the product and its longtime editor, Edward Kosner. "He's a trend surfer," she said. "He's able to smell and spot trends, and that's what made New York magazine."
Although people close to the buyer said the magazine was not for sale, there was talk of interest by other publishers.
One contender was squelching the rumors.
 "That's totally inaccurate," said Morton Zuckerman, the media executive who already owns U.S. News & World Report and The Atlantic. He acknowledged that he was part of a group that had sought to buy three publications -- New York, Premiere and Automobile -- from Mr. Murdoch.
Though his group lost out to a $650 million or so package proposed by the Kravis group, media experts were abuzz yesterday about whether Mr. Zuckerman might get a second shot should Henry R. Kravis choose to sell a few of his new purchases to reduce the cost of his acquisition or his debt.
Mr. Zuckerman was nonetheless skeptical yesterday that Mr. Kravis would part with the influential New York property. "They will remain the owner," he said.

HEADLINE: Corner of Connecticut Is Foundering as Its Lifeline, the Navy, Scales Back

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., April 24

 BODY:
Here in the self-proclaimed Submarine Capital of the World, home of the nation's largest submarine builder and the Navy's largest submarine base, the local economy is declining slowly and may soon reach levels not seen since the demobilization that followed World War II.
A combination of military-related plant closings, work force reductions and job transfers out of state are expected to shatter the economic base in southeastern Connecticut and neighboring Rhode Island. 
 Though many areas of the country are expected to be hit hard by base closings and weapons cutbacks, few are likely to suffer as much as Groton, New London and the 19 other towns in New London County, which depends more on military spending than almost any other area of the country.
"Catastrophe isn't too strong a word," said Barton W. Whitman, a vice president of Aquidneck Management Associates, a 40-employee consulting firm supported in large part by contracts from the Naval Underwater Systems Center.
"We're talking about an unemployment rate for the area that might run between 20 and 25 percent," he said.
Business and governmental officials fear not only Depression-era unemployment rates but quick drops in the area's real-estate market, banks and retail businesses.
The economic effects, which would only worsen the state government's chronic revenue shortfalls, might also force town governments to raise property taxes. "Electric Boat is 17 percent of our tax base," said C. Richard Foote, the town manager of Groton.
Military spending per capita is about $9,500. Sixty percent of the 110,000-person labor force is engaged in military-related work, and $1.6 billion of the county's $2.1 billion annual payroll comes from military spending. "The engine that runs the machine in this county is defense," said William D. Moore, president of the Southeastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce.
Electric Boat, the largest employer in southeastern Connecticut and the state's second largest after United Technologies, another military contractor, is expecting to learn the fate of its bid for a $2 billion Seawolf submarine contract within the next two weeks. If the company loses, it may close. If it wins, it probably will still pare its work force from 22,000 to 11,000 by 1995, a response to the Navy's plans to cut its future submarine fleet by more than half.
Meanwhile, across the Thames River in New London, 800 to 1,100 of the 1,495 jobs at a Navy research laboratory, the Naval Underwater Systems Center, will probably be transferred to Newport, R.I. The reassignments, part of the plan proposed this month by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to close 31 military bases, will probably start in October and go on for five years.
Further darkening the economic outlook here are transfers and decommissionings at the Navy submarine base in Groton, where the number of personnel is expected to drop from 14,000 to 10,100 by 1996. And in nearby Montville, the Department of Energy is gradually shutting down the UNC Naval Products plant, which employs 1,060 people and makes reactors for submarines. In Rhode Island, Electric Boat has 4,000 workers at its Quonset Point shipyard.
 
'Going to Be a Ghost Town'
 Last month, a study conducted by Regional Economic Models of Amherst, Mass., projected that New London County, with a population of about 255,000, will lose between 13,000 and 27,000 jobs by 1996 because of military cuts. It also estimated that the population will decline by 24,000, the average annual wage will fall by $3,000 and up to half of the disposable income in the region will disappear.
"This is going to be a ghost town," said Emma Devlin, who for the last 27 years has owned Hughie's restaurant, two blocks from the Naval Underwater Systems Center in New London.
Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics of St. Louis, is the region's economic linchpin. The company has experienced the boom-and-bust cycles associated with war and peace before, particularly in the late 1940's and early 1950's, before the development of the nuclear submarine. In those days, it was forced to diversify and created products like the device that automatically clears pins from bowling alleys.
 
Working on First Seawolf
 Neil D. Ruenzel, director of communications at Electric Boat, said the company's reductions stem from the Navy's decision to reduce the number of Tridents from 24 to 18 and the next generation of nuclear submarines, the $2 billion Seawolf, from 29 to 11. Electric Boat won all the Trident contracts and is now building the last. It is also working on the first Seawolf.
He noted that the Navy now plans to build only one Seawolf per year, not three. Electric Boat would have to seriously consider closing if it does not win the contract each year, he said, because the cost of retooling after a year without a contract would make the company unlikely to win future bids. Unlike its competitor in Newport News, Va., which also builds aircraft carriers, Electric Boat makes only submarines.
Newport News was expected to win the second Seawolf contract in March. But Navy officials, pressured by Connecticut's Congressional delegation and Electric Boat executives, delayed a decision last month to further study the effects of a stripped-down submarine fleet on the two shipyards and the competitive bidding process.
Business and civic leaders in the Groton-New London area worry that the Virginia Congressional delegation wields far more political clout than Connecticut's. The county's Representative, Sam Gejdenson, a Democrat from Bozrah, has also become a frequent target of local criticism because of his lack of support for the military build-up during the 1980s.
Mr. Gejdenson noted, though, that the unemployment rate for the New London area for February may have been the highest in nine years, but was the same as the national average, 6.5 percent. He also attributed the approaching crisis to the area's failure to diversify its industry.
Indeed, little local foresight is evident, particularly among the workers in places like the Sub Cafe in New London and the Nautilus Barber Shop in Groton. "I don't think anything is going to happen," said Kenneth H. Levine, an electrical mechanic for seven years at Electric Boat, which was founded 90 years ago as the nation's first submarine maker. "This place has been here forever."
Some diversification is underway. The Mashantucket Pequot Indian casino is slated to open this fall in Montville. Some think that's too little, too late. "You're replacing 1,500 engineers with 1,500 croupiers," said John C. Markowitz, president of Sonalysts, a sonar research concern in Waterford.
In the meantime, a coalition of county business leaders is trying to pressure the Navy into awarding the Seawolf contract to Electric Boat.
They are also airing public service announcements on local radio and television. The commercials, which have been criticized by some for their gloominess, show a field of tombstones, each carved with the name of local military contractor. In the background, a ship's bell faintly tolls.

HEADLINE: Apollo Theater Wins Reprieve on Repayments

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 26

 BODY:
The landmark Apollo Theater, which was scheduled to close on June 1 because of severe financial problems, won some breathing room today when its state and private lenders declared a six-month moratorium on loan repayments.
During that period, the lenders will try to renegotiate the Harlem theater's financing in an effort to protect the state's investment of $9 million and to save the stage where performers like Sarah Vaughan and Dionne Warwick began their careers. 
 Percy E. Sutton, the former Manhattan Borough President who is the largest investor in the group that operates the Apollo, said in a statement that he might convert the group into a nonprofit institution so the theater could receive tax-deductible contributions.
In exchange for declaring the loan moratorium, the state's Urban Development Corporation, which is the Apollo's largest lender, won the right to hire a consultant to study how the theater might be managed more effectively.
The $16.5 million renovation of the historic theater was plagued by cost overruns and management problems during its construction phase from 1983 to 1988. It now is troubled by insufficient bookings and high insurance and utility costs.
 
War of Words

A particular problem has been the financial performance of a new video studio that has produced less than half its anticipated revenue, said Vincent Tese, the state's Director of Economic Development and the chairman of the Urban Development Corporation.
In the last two days, the fight to save the Apollo has been accompanied by a war of words between state economic development officials and William Stern, Mr. Tese's predecessor as chairman of the Urban Development Corporation.
Mr. Stern was quoted in New York Newsday on Thursday as saying that the state's efforts to keep the Apollo afloat, including Mr. Tese's anticipated decisions to declare the moratorium and to cut the interest rate on the corporation's loans to 4 percent from 8 percent in 1986, were "a kind of welfare."
Mr. Stern, who left state government in 1986 and is now a private investor in New York City, said today that he was using the term generically to refer to government-financed economic development projects that make use of grants and low-interest loans rather than marketplace incentives like tax breaks.
 
Criticism of Remarks

Because the Apollo is in Harlem and because Mr. Sutton and his fellow investors are minorities, state officials and Apollo investors have portrayed his remarks as racist.
"The state's Economic Development Office looks for places to invest that will create jobs and economic opportunity," said Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the Urban Deveopment Corporation. "We do it in Buffalo. We do it in Albany. We do it in Harlem. It's peculiar, to say the least, that he would pick out a project in a minority community and call it welfare."
Mr. Stern fired back today that the economic development officials were battling him rather than addressing problems in the loan program.
"Welfare is a perfectly legitimate word," he said. "We can't get into this politically correct language. But the idea is that this was a hit, so they'll hit me back. That's the way they do it. I know, because I used to be on the inside."
The Apollo renovation was financed primarily by the corporation, by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and by the Federal Government. The theater, which opened in 1934, reopened in 1988 after having been closed for 10 years.
In a complex lease-purchase arrangement, Mr. Sutton's Apollo Theater Investor Group leases the theater from a corporation subsidiary known as the Apollo Theater Redevelopment Corporation.
To allow the theater to establish financial stability, the state allowed the investor group to defer making lease payments until March 1, 1991.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 8.66; Loss for Week at 53.21

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
A depressing report on the state of the economy, although much as expected by Wall Street, brought the bond market down initially yesterday, and stocks followed.
For most of the day, stocks fell when bonds fell and rose when bonds rose, but by the end of the session bonds ended narrowly ahead while stocks closed narrowly lower. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell to 2,912.38, down 8.66 on the day and 53.21, or 1.8 percent, for the week.
Trading slowed from 166.9 million shares on Thursday to 153.9 million yesterday, the quietest in three weeks. Declines led advances by 859 to 672 but 62 stocks reached new highs. Four fell to new lows.
 
 Further Drop for Compaq
 Compaq Computer, which slid by 9 3/8 on Thursday after forecasting a drop in second-quarter profits, fell 1 5/8 more yesterday, to 50 7/8.
Michele Preston of Cowen & Company recommended that investors switch to Lotus Development, a producer of personal computer software. Lotus promptly rose 2 1/8, to 34 3/8.
Figures compiled by Birinyi Associates showed that even professional program trading had little effect on the market. Despite waves of computer-driven buying and selling, the activity raised the Dow less than 4 points.
Traders attributed the week's sluggishness to disappointments over earnings and signs that the economy was not weak enough to prompt the Fed to bring interest rates down.
Uncertainty over both has kept many investors on the sidelines, traders said.
Even yesterday's figures seemed inconclusive. They showed that the gross national product, the total output of goods and services, slid at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first quarter. Traders said the drop came fairly close to what many economists had expected and thus had only a minor impact on the market.
Greg A. Smith, chief investment officer at Prudential Securities, said in his current newsletter, published well before the G.N.P. data were released, that "a surprisingly weak economy is possible" and that "there are some indications of some slippage in consumer confidence."
He added, "About the only definite conclusion I can come to at this stage is that it doesn't appear very clear what kind of recovery we may or may not be experiencing."
 
'Back and Forth All Day'

"The market's been back and forth all day," said David S. Chao, head trader in New York for County NatWest Securities. "It took its cue from the bond market after the G.N.P. numbers came out."
Still, he added, "stocks have been pretty listless the last couple of days."
In his weekly newsletter, Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company, said he would be "reluctant to chase" groups that have done well but also have "questionable long-term fundamentals." He mentioned regional banks with heavy debt, textile and apparel companies, specialty stores and home builders. He singled out energy and utility stocks as "current values."

HEADLINE: Proposal to Link Airports by Rail Is Dealt Setback

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
A plan for a rail link to whisk passengers between La Guardia and Kennedy International Airports is unraveling because, transit officials say, a study has found that not enough passengers would use it to justify its more than $2 billion cost.
The study, commissioned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, has led the various transportation agencies that had hoped to ease congestion around the airports to reconsider or withdraw their support of the plan, officials said yesterday. 
 The airports handle more than 54 million passengers and 1.5 million tons of cargo a year. But the panel that conducted the study estimated that only 1,200 passengers a day travel between La Guardia and Kennedy. In addition, they said private investors would be unlikely to offer financial support -- in return for development rights or tax abatements -- despite the easy access the rail link would create for sites along its route, such as Shea Stadium and Jamaica Center in Queens.
 
The Proposal Is Downgraded
 Officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the regional commuter railroads and the city subways and buses, said that as a result of the study's findings the project had become a lower priority for their agency.
And the New York City Department of Transportation said it would prefer concentrating on short-term solutions to reducing traffic congestion around the airports while considering other airport access routes.
"The fact is that this probably means that it slips in terms of priority on several investment agendas, including ours," said Gregory Johnson, the director of planning for the M.T.A. "But airport access of some sort does sit somewhere on the agenda because the two airports are gateways to the national and international markets and therefore critical to the region's taking a role in global competitiveness."
When the M.T.A. announced the rail-link proposal in March 1990, using the rights of way along the Van Wyck Expressway and Grand Central Parkway, it was touted as a tool to spur economic development along the route.
 
Panel Urges an Alternative
 But in the report commissioned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is responsible for the airports, a panel of experts on urban development concluded not only that there was little private interest in development along the route, but that an aiport link would have few riders and would be economically unfeasible.
Instead the panel, which was convened by the Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit research organization that studies land-use issues, recommended concentrating on separate links between Manhattan and the two airports.
According to the report, about 25,000 people a day travel between Manhattan and La Guardia and 17,000 between Manhattan and Kennedy.
Port Authority officials said the figure of 1,200 a day traveling between the airports was too low and stressed that the report was undergoing revisions. "There's not enough meat here to formulate any conclusions about feasibility yet," said David Z. Plavin, the director of aviation for the authority.
 
One Conclusion Anticipated
 Mr. Plavin also said the conclusions reached by the panel about potentially low ridership and the lack of interest from private investors were expected.
"Supporting the alignment with development rights, yes, that's something we would like to have happen," he said. "But I don't think any of us assumed that was going to be a significant contribution to the system."
But other transit officials said they were disappointed by the panel's findings on development potential.
The proposed line would tie the central terminals at Kennedy and La Guardia along the Van Wyck Expressway and Grand Central Parkway, and transit officials were hoping the prospect of reinvigorated development around stations at Shea Stadium, a stop on the No. 7 subway line, and Jamaica Center, where the Long Island Rail Road stops, would induce private investment.
The report said the Port Authority, as the agency charged with operating the airports, should assume the lead role in developing and financing public transport to the airports.
But Mr. Plavin said the region's transportation agencies must share the responsibility for financing such a system.

HEADLINE: Newspaper Executives Say It's Bad All Over

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
From the Times Mirror Company in Los Angeles to Knight-Ridder Inc. in Miami, executives from 15 newspaper companies who spoke at a two-day conference that ended here today told tales of lower advertising, revenues and earnings in the first quarter of 1991, after a dismal 1990.
For months, many executives had hoped that a boom in consumer confidence after the Persian Gulf war would end the advertising slump. 
 Several companies, most of which also own broadcast stations, cable television systems or other properties, said the advertising decline was encouraging them to experiment with new ways of appealing to consumers and advertisers.
 
 Concentrating Their Efforts

But for the most part, the executives who addressed financial analysts at the 20th annual Morton Media Conference said they were concentrating their efforts on two areas: replacing lost ad revenue with money from circulation, and cutting costs as much as they can.
"The rumors of better times are still ricocheting around out there," said James K. Batten, the chairman and chief executive of Knight-Ridder Inc., which publishes The Miami Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer and 25 other papers. "But we still don't have any tangible evidence of it."
Knight-Ridder's revenues from newspapers declined 4.4 percent in the quarter from the period last year -- the first such first-quarter drop since the 1974 merger that created the company. Others fared far worse. At the Tribune Company in Chicago, revenues fell 31 percent in the newspaper division and 20 percent over all, figures that did not include results from The Daily News in New York, whose 1991 operating losses were reflected in the company's 1990 results.
Classified advertising was the primary culprit, plummeting at every company. At the Gannett Company, which publishes 82 daily newspapers, classified linage dropped 13 percent. John J. Curley, the chairman, said, "This is the worst year since I've been alive."
 
 War and Recession

The main culprit was the recession, but the war had a significant impact. Last month, several companies said they were detecting signs of a postwar pickup. Ad volume at The New York Times, while down 19 percent for the entire first quarter, declined only 12 percent in March. But Walter E. Mattson, the president and chief operating officer of The New York Times Company, said that this month the newspaper's ad volume was once again running 19 percent below levels of a year ago.
With few exceptions, the newspaper companies have tried to recapture the lost ad revenue by raising newsstand and subscription prices.
Affiliated Publications Inc., which owns The Boston Globe, said it expected to add $9 million in annual revenue by raising the home-delivery price of The Globe to $4 a week, from $3.50, and increasing the street price to 50 cents a copy, from 35 cents, in areas at least 30 miles outside Boston.
John L. Morton, the financial analyst who organizes the annual conference, cautioned that "circulation revenues are a touchy game, because you want to make sure you don't hurt your franchise." But he said the companies had little choice because "they did all the cost cutting they could last year."
Some companies are, however, still paring costs. This month, the Pulitzer Publishing Company negotiated new contracts that eliminate many work rules governing the pressmen and paper handlers at The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Nicholas G. Penniman 4th, Pulitzer's senior vice president for newspaper operations, said he expected to cut 80 press room positions soon, saving $3.4 million annually.
 
 Going to School

But the companies are more concerned about finding new revenues. On Thursday, Dow Jones & Company said it would be bringing out a classroom edition of The Wall Street Journal, with distribution starting in September.
Other companies, among them Multimedia Inc., Knight-Ridder and Pulitzer, plan to create computer data bases, using their subscriber lists as the foundations, to help advertisers locate specific customers for their products.
And several companies, including Tribune, Multimedia, Pulitzer and the E. W. Scripps Company, said they were considering starting cable television channels.
The Tribune Company described its Chicagoland Channel, which it plans to start later this year in partnership with Continental Cable, as a 24-hour news and entertainment channel.

HEADLINE: Recession Grew Worse in Quarter As Economy Shrank at 2.8% Rate

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
The economy contracted more rapidly in the first three months of the year than it did at the end of 1990, as national output recorded its first consecutive quarters of decline since the recession of 1981-82, the Commerce Department reported today.
Most analysts had come to expect in recent weeks that the decline would exceed the fourth quarter's 1.6 percent annual pace, and today's report, which showed a 2.8 percent rate of decline in the January-March period, was not seen as significantly worsening prospects for pulling out of recession. Some analysts still say recovery will begin by midyear.
 
Officially in Recession
 The data on the output of goods and services were accompanied by what appeared to be worrisome figures on inflation -- various gauges rising to annual rates above 5 percent -- but close examination suggested that these were aberrations related to imported oil. 
 Still, the decline in the gross national product reflected broad weakness in the economy, which is now officially in recession, and there are few signs of recovery other than in residential real estate.
"It's not clear you're yet approaching the trough," observed M. Kathryn Eickhoff, a New York consultant and former economist for the Office of Management and Budget. She said it was difficult to see how G.N.P. could expand in the current quarter.
But the Bush Administration clung to its forecast of a spring upturn, with Michael R. Darby, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, declaring that "a small positive number is certainly within the realm of probability."
But Mr. Darby cautioned, "We are moving into a transition stage, so expect crosscurrents in various aspects of economic activity for several months yet."
The contraction was officially designated a recession on Thursday by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which said July was the starting point even though G.N.P. advanced at a 1.4 percent rate in the third quarter. Today's report of a second straight quarterly decline in gross national product fulfills the popular definition of a recession.
Nearly every sector contributed to the first-quarter decline. Spending on personal consumption, which accounts for 65 percent of the economy, fell at an annual rate of $9.5 billion, or 1.4 percent, after a 3.4 percent rate of decline in the fourth quarter. This was the first time since the first half of 1989 that consumer spending fell for two straight quarters.
An even bigger drag was an annualized drop of $19.8 billion, or 14.4 percent, in business investment, mainly reflecting cutbacks in orders for durable equipment. Mr. Darby said this might reflect temporary deferrals during the Persian Gulf war, and he cited more recent reports showing that investment intentions had steadied.
But the National Association of Manufacturers said business investment, which had been relatively buoyant because of increases for computers and other office automation equipment, was now "following its normal cyclical pattern of falling sharply during recessions."
 
 Government Spending Down
 Purchases of goods and services by all levels of government also fell, an infrequent occurrence. Despite the war, Federal spending was $3.1 billion lower, with $500 million of that accounted for by the military.
Department officials said that the war had only a negligible effect on the economy and that they could not even tell whether the effect was to raise or lower G.N.P. The war was largely fought from inventories, specialists have noted, providing no gain to gross national product until the stockpiles are replenished.
Businesses continued to liquidate stocks of automobiles and other goods at a rapid rate of $20.7 billion in the quarter, the report also showed. This had the effect of raising G.N.P. somewhat since the drawdown, at $26.4 billion, was even higher in the October-December quarter.
Inventories are now so lean, said Edward Guay, an economist for the Cigna Corporation, that even a small amount of fresh demand would force factories to raise production almost immediately. He said a surge of inventory rebuilding could push second-quarter G.N.P. growth to a rate of perhaps 2.5 percent.
Mr. Darby said the department estimated that inventories fell sharply in March but for purposes of calculating the G.N.P. this was roughly offset by an improvement in the trade deficit.
 
 Concerns Over Exports
 For the quarter, exports fell at a $700 million pace, following a sharp fourth-quarter increase, a development that raised concern among some analysts that export growth might not be strong enough to be an important engine of recovery.
Real final sales fell at a 3.3 percent pace in the first quarter, in contrast to a 1.4 percent increase in the fourth, the report also showed.
As for inflation, the fixed-weighted price index climbed to 5.1 percent, from 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter, while the implicit price deflator jumped to 5.5 percent, from 2.8 percent.
This, several analysts said, was mainly a result of a decline in the price of imported oil, which in a statistical quirk produces a temporary increase in the reported inflation rate that is subsequently reversed.
 
 Another Gauge of Prices
 The inflation rate for gross domestic purchases, Mr. Darby noted, slowed to 3.6 percent in the first quarter, from 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter, and was only 3.1 percent when a Federal pay increase is excluded.
The first-quarter price data included increases in excise taxes and in postal rates.
Today's report also showed that the nation's savings rate -- personal savings as a percentage of disposable personal income -- edged down to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent.
G.N.P. measured in current dollars instead of in constant 1982 dollars rose at a rate of $35 billion, or 2.6 percent, in the first quarter, after rising $12.7 billion, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, in the fourth quarter.
In a revision of some fourth-quarter data, the department said corporate profits from current production were weaker than initially reported for that period, falling $11.8 billion, instead of the $5 billion calculated a month ago.
Real G.N.P. ran at a rate of $4.12 trillion in the first quarter, down from a $4.15 trillion pace in the fourth quarter. Current-dollar G.N.P. totaled $5.56 trillion.
Data included in the preliminary estimate of gross national product for the first quarter of 1991 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates:

 	 	 	Current Prices	Last Quarter	Pct. Chg.	 	 	 	Gross national product	$5,562.3	2.6	 Consumption	3,741.1	1.8	 Business investment	506.3	-12.8	 Inventory change	-22.9	N.A.

HEADLINE: MAGAZINES MURDOCH IS SELLING, AND ONE HE IS NOT;
Publishers Find Profit in Soaps

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Soap Opera Digest and Soap Opera Weekly look to be two of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company's more valuable acquisitions in the magazine package. The publications expect to have 40 cents of cash flow, essentially profit, for every dollar of revenue this year, according to financial papers prepared for potential buyers. But will the magazines continue to prosper? Stay tuned.
The two magazines, available at supermarkets nationwide, provide news and plot synopses of daytime serial dramas. They dominate their market, with Rupert Murdoch's investment bankers likening them to the Time and Newsweek of their field. 
 One reason for the magazines' glowing financial health is that soap fans are so avid that the magazines have to spend little to attract them. Soap Opera Digest, for example, spends just 14 cents in marketing expenses to attract one dollar of circulation revenue. Soap Opera Weekly, still a relatively new publication, spends only 36 cents.
By contrast, larger mass-market publications, like Time and Newsweek, spend up to 75 cents, mainly for discount subscriptions, gifts like telephones and desk planners and third-party sales operations.
The soap-opera publications' are doing especially well given how the recession has hurt larger magazines aimed at more affluent readers. The soap-opera magazines' readers' incomes average less than $24,000.
The companion publications are also inexpensive to produce, with a staff of about 60 to bring in $60 million in annual revenue. They have loyal, predominantly female readers who live mostly in the Midwest and South and are in their early 30's. The magazines have such strong supermarket sales that they would prosper without advertising.
That picture emerges from a 136-page review document. While the documents are basically marketing tools, they offer an unusually detailed look at the magazines.
In the year ending June 30, Soap Opera Digest expects to have revenue of about $45 million, up nearly 19 percent from $38 million a year earlier. The profit contribution this year is expected to total $22 million, up from $15.7 million the year before.
Soap Opera Digest has the equivalent of 40 editorial, advertising and production employees, or less than one person for every million dollars of revenue.
Many of the most successful magazines in recent years have been smaller specialized publications, which can attract both fervent readers and advertisers.
This is especially true with Soap Opera Digest, a twice-monthly publication costing $1.95. Its sells about 1.5 million copies, nearly 70 percent at newsstands.
Founded in 1975 and acquired by Mr. Murdoch in 1989, Soap Opera Digest was meant to appeal to fans who missed episodes of soap operas, it but later expanded to include news and celebrity profiles. The synopses appealed especially to working women.
 
 Soap Opera Star Salaries
 Some of Soap Opera Digest's best-selling cover articles in 1990 were "How Much Do Soap Stars Make?" (single copy sales: 1,137,200) and "TV's Sexiest Men" (1,109,923).
Soap Opera Weekly was founded in November 1989, shortly after the acquisition of Soap Opera Digest. The weekly is a tabloid-sized publication costing 99 cents.
The weekly expects to post $16.3 million in revenue in this fiscal year, nearly triple the $6.2 milliona year earlier. It expects to earn $4.2 million this year, up from only $79,000 the year before. Start-up publications rarely break even, let alone make a profit so quickly. It has a staff of only 19.
Competition is minor for both publications, according to the Murdoch bankers. There is Soap Opera Update, a biweekly with an unaudited circulation of 200,000 and Episodes, which Mr. Murdoch's people described as a promotion for ABC-TV soap operas.
But buried deep within the mountain of glowing statistics are some cautionary numbers. For one thing, Soap Opera Digest's subscriptions for the 1992 fiscal year are projected to be flat at 475,000 and single-copy sales, the ones at the newstand, are projected to decline to 1,019,000 from 1,033,654.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Leave Detroit With Vows to Help Auto Makers

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 26

 BODY:
Facing record losses, a raft of new regulations from Washington and increased competition from abroad, the American auto industry has spent two days wooing one of the largest delegations of members of Congress ever to descend on Detroit.
The lawmakers left town today with many members vowing to give the industry more consideration. 
 "I never realized what effect the economy has been having," said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland. "We have to be more aggressive in trade negotiations. Imports are still a problem."
The impressions of the 41 members of Congress who toured factories and executive offices of the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, as well as the headquarters of the United Automobile Workers union, could have an important impact on coming debates about proposed legislation on trade and clean air.
 
Some Temper Their Concerns
 Naturally, kind words about the automobile industry, which paid for the visit, from lawmakers who represent other areas may have simply reflected a desire to be polite in front of their colleagues from Michigan and their hosts. But some seemed to be truly impressed.
"After seeing Detroit up close, I'm going to be more inclined to temper the environmental concerns of my constituents with the need to revitalize the auto industry and the nation's manufacturing base," said Representative Frank Riggs, Republican of California.
Mr. Riggs said his constituents in Sonoma County were worried about expanded offshore oil drilling. Energy legislation before Congress that would regulate such wells is also expected to impose tougher fuel-efficiency regulations on the automobile industry. Manufacturers are clearly hoping that Mr. Riggs may now be less willing to accept stricter fuel-efficiency measures to get the prohibition of drilling his constituents want.
As regular participants in Washington's legislative horse trading, United States automobile makers have historically opposed stricter standards on safety, fuel efficiency and automobile emissions. In many debates the automobile companies issue the same dark warning: A law like this could sink the United States auto industry.
Ater the law passes,the Big Three usually find a way to comply. The script is as old as the seatbelt, which Detroit once opposed as ineffective and too expensive. In the longer term, the industry's credibility has been damaged in the eyes of lawmakers who regard its opposition as reflexive and lacking regard for social policy.
 
Many Without Industry Ties
 Detroit, of course, has its traditional defenders in Congress, including the Michigan delegation. Among those defenders on the tour were Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat who is co-chairwoman of the Congressional Competitiveness Caucus. But more than half the group have no automobile plant in their districts.
"More than half the members weren't even in Congress for the debates of the 1970's, and they don't know anything about the auto industry," Ms. Kaptur said. They also are not aware, she said, of the industry's far-reaching economic impact, including its use of half the nation's production of carpet and 20 percent of the semiconductors. Her remarks were delivered at the conclusion of a tour through G.M.'s Hamtramck Assembly Plant, where Cadillacs are built.
What the delegation learned in its 24 hours in Detroit was that the manufacturers have been spending billions of dollars to comply with Federal legislation that has brought airbags, doubled fuel efficiency and improved the safety of vehicles. "People were amazed to learn that the large Buick had better fuel efficiency than Toyota's luxury car," said Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan.
But the spending exacted a price in competitiveness, the companies said. And if automobile makers have cried wolf once too often, the industry's problems now appear to be all too real. Losses since last December have been about $5 billion, and Chrysler has been scrambling to solve short-term financial problems.
Thursday afternoon, the delegation heard Owen F. Bieber, president of the automobile workers union, say that a bill before Congress could open free trade with Mexico could cause the loss of union jobs. The companies support the bill, in one of many examples of the conflicting interests of the union and the manufacturers over legislation.
The bus trip from the union's headquarters to a new $1 billion Chrysler assembly plant, which is scheduled to open later this year, passed through blighted east side neighborhoods and crumbling, abandoned factories. A spokesman for the union said the route was chosen intentionally. "There's no way to go through the east side without some eye-openers."
At Ford's proving grounds, the former racing driver Jackie Stewart drove members on high-speed circuits of the test track. But the highlight, all seemed to agree, was a buffet dinner at Chrysler headquarters with Lee Iacocca, the corporation's chairman. According to reports from the dinner, which was closed to the press, Mr. Iacocca eloquently urged members to press for restrictions on Japanese imports.

HEADLINE: BANK DEPOSIT FUND NEARLY INSOLVENT, U.S. AUDITOR SAYS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
The nation's top auditor said today that many more banks were effectively bankrupt than regulators had recognized, and that therefore the program that insures depositors was "nearly insolvent."
The official, Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, suggested that a quick way to fix the fund, which is financed through premiums paid by banks, would be to raise $15 billion through additional contributions from the banking industry. 
 "The bank insurance fund is nearly insolvent, and I cannot overemphasize how important it is to restore it as quickly as possible," Mr. Bowsher told the Senate Banking Committee. "If you don't get on top of this soon enough, then the taxpayers will eventually lose."
 
40 Cents for Every $100
 To raise $15 billion quickly, Mr. Bowsher urged Congress to consider an immediate special assessment on banks of 40 cents for every $100 in deposits. He said that if the lawmakers found this would unduly restrict lending by the banks, Congress might consider levying an assessment of 20 cents in 1991 and again in 1992.
In either event, he strongly urged the Senators not to put a cap on existing annual premiums at 30 cents for every $100, as the Bush Administration has proposed.
The $15 billion increase could be used by the fund both to bail out insolvent banks and to borrow against, thus further strengthening the insurance program. Existing law permits the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which operates the fund, to borrow up to nine times its net worth. The law also gives the agency a credit line of $5 billion with the Treasury.
 
Audit Used Regulators' Files
 Economists for the White House and for Congress have relied upon economic models to determine the net worth of the bank insurance fund, and their findings have predicted that the program may run out of money within a year or two. But the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress that Mr. Bowsher heads, conducted an audit that was based on information from the regulators' own files. The results of the audit, presented at the hearing today, showed that the fund and the banking industry were in far weaker condition than previously calculated.
Mr. Bowsher's testimony was the most dire of any Government official in a long series of hearings over the last year. In the hearings, a progressively worse picture of the plight of the insurance fund has emerged.
Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the chairman of the Banking Committee, said the G.A.O. had found that "the bank insurance fund is essentially out of money."
"We're in a position of some real vulnerability," said Mr. Riegle, Democrat of Michigan.
But the proposal made by Mr. Bowsher today provoked only criticism in Congress and from the industry and appears to have little chance of approval. The Administration and bank regulators have proposed a different way to recapitalize the fund.
They have recommended repairing the fund by increasing its authority to borrow by $70 billion. On Thursday, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, introduced a measure to increase the fund's borrowing authority by just $25 billion, but Treasury officials have criticized that measure because it does not include most of the proposals they have put forward to overhaul the entire banking system.
 
 On Top of Current Premiums
 Mr. Bowsher's suggestion that the fund be buttressed by an immediate special assessment was immediately challenged by banking groups, who said a bite of 40 cents for every $100 in deposits would be too much for the industry to bear. The assessment would be on top of existing premiums, which are scheduled to increase this summer to 23 cents for each $100, from 19.5 cents.
The $15 billion sought by Mr. Bowsher to bolster the fund is slightly less than the entire industry's earnings last year. It also represents less than one-tenth of American banks' existing capital -- the owners' stake in the banks that is crucial as a cushion to absorb large losses.
Mr. Bowsher said preliminary results of the audit of the bank fund put its net worth at the end of last year at $2 billion to $5 billion. The actual amount depends upon how dozens of large banks that are effectively insolvent, but have not yet been seized by the Government, are classified.
Unaudited results put the fund's net worth at $8.4 billion as of Dec. 31. L. William Seidman, the chairman of the F.D.I.C., disclosed on Tuesday that his agency was disputing the G.A.O.'s audit, but the accounting office declined to comment before presenting its conclusions to lawmakers today.
Mr. Seidman has said the fund is weak and needs additional borrowing authority. But he has said it would not be insolvent if, as many economists and Government officials have predicted, the economy began to turn around by summer.
Both Mr. Seidman and Mr. Bowsher acknowledge that a large part of their dispute centers on timing -- whether to recognize losses in 1990 or 1991 for a fund that virtually all officials now concede is headed toward insolvency if Congress and the Administration are unable to agree on a solution.
The findings of the audit have a far-reaching effect, though, because the F.D.I.C.'s authority to borrow from the Government is largely tied to its net worth. This week, officials said they had begun to draw on their borrowing authority to help finance the failure of the Bank of New England and two affiliated banks, whose cost had already been subtracted by the F.D.I.C. in its calculation of the bank fund's net worth of $8.4 billion. That collapse requires an initial outlay of at least $5 billion. It is estimated that the failure will cost as much as $2.5 billion ultimately, after the banks' bad assets are sold.
Mr. Bowsher and Mr. Seidman have said they hope to work out their differences soon. But if they are unable to reconcile the different financial figures, Mr. Bowsher said the accounting office would have to give a qualified, or adverse, auditor's opinion that the F.D.I.C. balance sheets are not based on generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require that all contingent liabilities be included in the audit.
Bank deposits of up to $100,000 are protected by the F.D.I.C., and depositors holding up to that amount would continue to be protected even if the fund became insolvent. If that occurred, the fund, which was created in 1934 after many banks collapsed in the Great Depression, would have to be bailed out by taxpayer funds, since it is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.
Mr. Bowsher told reporters after the hearing that the existing difficulties could put the bank fund in the same position as the now-depleted fund that protected depositors at savings associations.
"It's somewhat similar to the savings and loan situation of 1988," Mr. Bowsher said. "You don't have money to resolve problems now, so you start parking your problems and then it costs even more."
 
 Examination of 368 Banks
 Mr. Bowsher said the G.A.O. figures reflected an examination of the financial condition of 368 banks. Those banks were on the regulators' list of troubled institutions. Many had assets of more than $100 million.
He said that 71 of those institutions were "already insolvent, or nearly so" and would cost the fund $7 billion to $11 billion. Of those banks, he said the problems of at least 40 were so grave that they had to be calculated in the net worth of the fund at the end of last year.
"The remaining 31 banks, more likely than not, will fail without recapitalization, but do not meet the criteria of insolvency and therefore present accounting rules do not require the fund to reserve for these banks," he said.
 
 Banks See 'Alarming Proposal'
 Banking groups and some Senators on the banking committee criticized Mr. Bowsher's idea of a special premium, saying it could further tighten credit at a time when there were already complaints that banks had refused loans to credit-worthy customers.
"It is an alarming proposal that would strike extremely hard at many institutions," said Charlotte LeGates of the National Council of Savings Institutions, a Washington-based trade group of banks and savings associations. "To lead the American public to the idea that bankers can go into the vault, spin the dial and pull out vast hoards of cash is something that is simply not true."
Richard A. Kirk, the president of the American Bankers Association, said the G.A.O.'s proposal "clearly would be economically and financially counterproductive."
"If you really want to see a credit crunch, this is the way to get one," he said.

HEADLINE: Baker Says Israel Fails to Provide Needed Responses

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 26

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that Israel had failed to give all the responses he needed to continue trying to put together an Arab-Israeli peace conference and that as a result he and President Bush would have to reappraise their next steps in Middle East peacemaking.
Mr. Baker had to leave Israel abruptly because of the death of his mother in Houston today, but he had largely completed his daylong talks with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister David Levy. 
 On Mr. Baker's departure from Israel, his spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, issued a statement dictated by the Secretary that left the unmistakable impression that he was highly unsatisfied with Mr. Shamir's position on how to arrange a peace conference that Palestinians could attend.
The statement also left the clear impression, which American officials pointedly would not deny, that the Bush Administration now believes that primarily because of Israel's obstinacy it is going to have to reconsider how, and even whether, it will continue trying to put together an Arab-Israeli peace conference.
 
Israelis Give Their Side
 Israeli officials hurriedly briefed reporters traveling with Mr. Baker before they left Jerusalem, giving them a list of responses that Mr. Levy had given Mr. Baker, which they insisted demonstrated flexibility on Israel's part. The responses involved some concessions on procedural issues, but not on any key points dividing them from the Arabs, who, up to now, have not publicly shown any more flexibility than the Israelis.
As Mr. Baker left the Prime Minister's office, after being called by his wife, Susan, and informed of the death of his 96-year-old mother, Bonner Means Baker, the Secretary was asked by reporters whether he was returning for another peacemaking swing, as his aides had hinted on Thursday.
"Well, we don't know yet whether we will be coming back," he said. Then, referring to the Israelis, he added, "We have got some answers, but there are still some questions that we have asked to which we do not have answers."
As Mr. Baker's plane was about to take off, Miss Tutwiler elaborated in a statement she said was personally cleared by the Secretary.
"The President called the Secretary in his suite at the King David Hotel," she said. "After the President expressed his condolences on the death of the Secretary's mother, the Secretary gave the President a brief sense of where things stood. The only characterizations I am going to be able to give you concerning today's meetings here in Israel is the following:
"Obviously, the meeting with the Prime Minister, even though it ran over, was abruptly concluded. Questions remain here in Israel. We still need some answers from the Israeli Government relating primarily to modalities before we can move this process forward. The Secretary intends to see the President when he returns from Houston to determine appropriate next steps in the search for Middle East peace. That is it."
 
No Further Elaboration
 The statement was significant not only for what it said, but also for what it did not say. Asked if the Secretary still was waiting for responses from the Arab side to move the process forward, or whether the Arabs were being just as obstinate, Miss Tutwiler said that Mr. Baker wanted to leave the statement exactly as it was.
These remarks contrasted sharply to those that Mr. Baker made at the end of his previous stops, when he always tended to accentuate the positive. Even after talks on Tuesday with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, which made no apparent progress either, Mr. Baker called the discussions "useful."
While no American official would explicitly say so, it was apparent that Mr. Baker felt that after his four visits to Israel in the last seven weeks, the Israeli Government was still refusing to give him what he believes are the minimum acceptable answers to some key questions. Mr. Baker had vowed that he would not allow any of the parties to string him along.
Without explicitly saying so, American officials left the impression that the Secretary was trying to administer some diplomatic shock therapy to the Israelis, much the way President Ford and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger did in April 1975, when they announced a "reassessment" of American policy toward Israel after the Israelis had not gone along with American ideas for a deal with Egypt..
When Mr. Baker was in Israel a week ago, on his third Middle East swing since the gulf war ended, he left Mr. Shamir with a series of compromise proposals on how a peace conference might be organized that Palestinians could attend. The Israelis want a ceremonial opening conference that would usher in direct talks with Arab neighbors. The Syrians want a full-fledged conference with United Nations involvement and with the parties being able to refer deadlocks to conference sponsors.
The Israelis refused to have any Palestinians from Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem attend, because it might suggest that Jerusalem's status is negotiable, and they want American asurances that any Palestinians who do take part will not claim allegiance to the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Palestinians want more flexibility in choosing their own representatives.
When Israeli officials gave reporters the text of the official responses to Mr. Baker, even as he was still meeting with Mr. Shamir, it seemed to be a pre-emptive move that may have influenced Mr. Baker's blunt statement.
 
The Israelis' Responses
 In the responses, the Israelis said they had agreed that the Soviets and the Europeans could take part in the peace conference in some way -- provided they accepted Israel's terms. There would be no role for the United Nations, which the Syrians demand.
Second, Israel agreed to a conference provided that it is an opening to direct talks and that the superpower sponsors will have no authority to impose a solution or have any other operational role in the negotiations. To help satisfy Arab demands for an ongoing conference though, Israeli officials said they would agree that after six months of talks the Arabs and the Israelis can "inform" the co-sponsors about their progress -- provided that both sides agree to do so.
Third, the conference would be called the Conference for the Opening of Direct Negotiations for Peace in the Middle East.
Fourth, in Israel's view, the task of such a conference would be to lead to direct talks and cover issues like water problems, economic development and arms reductions. There was no Israeli mention of trading land for peace.
Fifth, Israel is ready to talk to a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, provided that it is not connected to the P.L.O.
 
Clarification Offered
 Later, Israel clarified its position, saying it would not allow Soviet co-sponsorship of the conference until the Soviet Union renewed diplomatic relations with Israel.
But even with that, the Government's answers stirred the beginnings of a possible political storm. Right-wing ministers said the Government had gone too far. Science Minister Yuval Neeman of the far-right Tehiya party threatened to leave the coalition unless Mr. Shamir reconsidered.
Even Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, both allies of Mr. Shamir, were reported to be unhappy, particularly with the provision that the talks might be reconvened if the direct negotiations ran into difficulties. All this is to be debated at an Israeli Cabinet meeting on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Cambodia Ruler Shrugs As Plan for Peace Stalls

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, April 25

 BODY:
Wide anticipation of an imminent settlement of the Cambodian war now seems to have been premature.
Western governments have generally assumed that Phnom Penh's Vietnamese-backed Government can not last more than a few years without a peace treaty ending Chinese military aid to the Cambodian rebel alliance. 
 But a draft treaty carefully negotiated by the United States and other key members of the United Nations Security Council, with little reference to Phnom Penh's goals, has stirred nervousness here and in Hanoi. And the Cambodian Government, however shaky, seems to think it can hold on.
It is politically impossible for any Cambodian faction to reject the United Nations draft outright. But the Phnom Penh Government, concerned about sovereignty, disarmament and a possible return of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas to power, has proposed enough "amendments" to the plan to block it for some time or even derail it.
From the perspective of Phnom Penh, the challenge from the rebel coalition is far from dire, Cambodian officials and Eastern European diplomats say. They say the Government may have much to gain from delaying a plan that would strip it of much of its power and then hold elections that the regime is likely to lose.
"Many predicted doom for us when the Vietnamese troops withdrew" in September 1989, nearly 11 years after their invasion to unseat the Khmer Rouge, a senior Cambodian official said. "But almost two years later, we're still here, and we're managing pretty well."
Phnom Penh does not feel enough pressure to sign a risky peace. "Everyone is tired of the war," a Soviet diplomat said. "But there is no hurry. This is not a collapsible economy, and there isn't that much fighting."
Officially, the Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen and the chairman of the National Assembly, Chea Sim, have accepted the United Nations plan as a treaty "framework" and "a good basis" for negotiations.
But little talk has transpired since December between Phnom Penh and the United Nations or among the Cambodians. A new meeting of the Supreme National Council, which includes members of the Government and the three opposition factions, has been expected since mid-April; now diplomats say it may not happen before June.
All sides have agreed to abide by United Nations calls for a cease-fire until the meeting is held, but the rainy season brings a kind of truce anyway.
A sharp decrease this year in aid from the Soviet Union and other countries in Eastern Europe has resulted in higher inflation, power cuts and a general worsening in living conditions. But the Government has coped.
Militarily, the Khmer Rouge rebels have gained some ground in the dry season, extending routes of communications and supplies.
But they have avoided big battles with the Government army, which is said to have a "backstop" of at least several thousand Vietnamese troops.
 
Phnom Penh's Stake
 "It's not a wonderful army," the Vietnamese Ambassador, Ngo Dien, said. "But it seems enough to face the other side.
"The problem for the regime is not whether the solution is Communist or non-Communist," he said, "but what happens to them and what they've built and acquired in the last 10 years."
Vietnam maintains that its influence on Phnom Penh is waning, despite Western pressure on Hanoi to push the Cambodians to settle. Conservatives in Hanoi, including the army, are unhappy at the prospect of multiparty elections next door.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Belongs in GATT

 BODY:
Even as politics divided the world after World War II, trade united it. Now, Communism's collapse and the third world's disenchantment with protectionism makes possible a truly global market -- one world, united in trade.
The framework for trade advances has been the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Under its auspices nearly 100 diverse nations have agreed to uniform, equitable rules of international commerce. Yet GATT ought to be even more universal than it now is. Politics still divides.
Western deference to China now keeps Taiwan, the world's 13th-largest trading nation, outside GATT. Beijing objects that admitting Taiwan would undermine the principle that there can be only one China. 
 That argument doesn't stand up. Taiwan has deliberately skirted the one-China issue by applying to GATT as the "Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu." Its admission under this name would follow the precedent of Hong Kong, a GATT member since 1986. Ideological hostility, not China's integrity, seems Beijing's true concern.
Taiwan's open-market economy meets normal GATT entrance criteria, while Beijing's half-reformed, half-centralized system falls short. And despite the mainland's huge edge in territory and population, Taiwan is a weightier player in the world economy by almost every measure: industrialization, trade flows, capital exports and international reserves.
Taiwan is now America's sixth-largest trading partner, accounting for this country's second-largest bilateral trade deficit. With the Bush Administration's stated commitment to GATT, Washington might be expected to support Taiwan's application strongly. But thus far it has not.
The Administration would best serve American political and economic interests by supporting Taiwan's entrance into GATT.

HEADLINE: Murdoch Gets a Generous Price

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Publishing executives were abuzz yesterday over K-III Holdings' agreement to pay $650 million for nine of the News Corporation's publications, including New York magazine, Seventeen and The Racing Form. The general consensus is that K-III is paying a hefty, but not exorbitant, price when the future of advertising spending is uncertain.
"In this market, it is very hard to evaluate values because advertising revenues are falling so fast," said one publishing executive. "That multiple is going up every day," he said, referring to the price, which is 11 times cash flow, a term used in the industry to describe profitability.
 
 The Biggest Step Yet

This purchase would represent the biggest step yet by K-III Holdings, a two-year-old publishing venture run by three former Macmillan executives with backing from Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the buyout firm with the very deep pockets. Beginning in February 1989, William F. Reilly, K-III's chief, has bought a variety of smaller publishing properties, including the Weekly Reader, trade magazines, encyclopedias and specialized directories. The more visible publications would represent a new direction for him and the company. 
 Both K-III and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which is selling the magazines, had more than the usual problems in arriving at appropriate prices in the slumping market. Several people with knowledge of the negotiations, said the News Corporation had to reduce its 1991 advertising estimates for various publications after results for April and May came in below its earlier projections.
And K-III's bid left room for further deterioration. According to one person with knowledge of the talks, the final price that K-III pays for the magazines will depend on what the actual cash flows for the various publications are through June 30, the end of the New Coporation's fiscal year. If they fall below projections, K-III will pay less than the $650 million price the two sides agreed on.
While there are some highly profitable publications in the group -- like The Racing Form and Seventeen -- industry executives questioned how much room there was for these established properties to grow. And the newer publications, like Premiere and European Travel & Life, do have room to grow, but are not seen having as much potential for significant profit.
There was much speculation in the publishing world yesterday that K-III will sell off some of its magazines, perhaps relatively quickly after the deal closes to recover some of their investment as soon as possible. Among the names most often mentioned were "Seventeen," and "New Woman."
But people close to K-III said earlier this week that they would keep the publications intact.
One magazine that was said to hold special appeal for Henry Kravis, the Kohlberg, Kravis partner, was New York magazine. According to one executive with knowledge of the talks, Mr. Kravis has no intention of selling it and was particularly involved in its purchase.
Mr. Kravis and his wife, the fashion designer Carolyne Roehm, have led a highly visible life that has been widely chronicled in the last decade. She was featured on the cover of the Nov. 24, 1986, issue of New York, in an article called "The Working Rich." Like other executives who have made money in other businesses, such as Laurence A. Tisch, Mr. Kravis is now investing in a prominent media company.
Nor is Mr. Kravis considered likely to sell The Racing Form, because it is such a cash cow. Even if K-III wanted to sell it, finding a buyer willing to pay $200 million or so might prove difficult, despite its profitability. The paper, published seven days a week, has about 110,000 circulation and a newsstand price of $2.50 a copy.
Until recently it has had a virtual monopoly on the business, but that may be about to disappear. Robert Maxwell, the British-based entrepreneur and longtime Murdoch rival, is set to introduce another racing paper in the United States in the next several weeks. Publishing experts say that could lead to a price war, cutting into profits for The Racing Form. Some race tracks have also begun to offer their own publications, and these are already crimping profits. And race track attendance is down.
The paper's current cash flow, or the actual cash the business generates, is about $25 million, which is below the $35 million cash flow the paper is said to have had when Walter Annenberg sold it to Mr. Murdoch .
K-III Holdings is also considered likely to hold on to Soap Opera Digest, in part because it, too, generates so much cash. It had $15 million in cash flow on revenues of $37 million in 1990. Finding a buyer who would pay a sufficiently high price for a single publication would be very difficult.
What that means is that if K-III were to sell any of the publications, Seventeen may well be a likely target. Hearst and Conde Nast are both considered likely buyers.
Whatever it keeps, K-III will have its hands full, particularly if the economy -- and advertising -- do not bounce back soon. And a number of industry executives said privately yesterday that they are beginning to think there may not be a recovery until 1993. That would mean magazines could languish for the two and a half years -- proving even the most conservative projections overly optimistic.
"Every publisher is looking at a year that is much softer than they anticipated in their original budgets for the year," said Reginald Brack, the chairman of Time Warner Publishing.
 
 Upbeat Projections
 But the projections in the financial documents for the magazines are generally upbeat. The offering prospectus on New York, for instance, assumes that advertising revenue will grow in 1992 to $41 million, from $36 million in 1990.
Furthermore, most industry executives agree that the Murdoch magazines are unusually well run, so that there is little room for cost cutting as a way of increasing profit margins.
K-III brings some clear management expertise: Mr Reilly refashioned Macmillan into a larger and more profitable company, which was so attractive that he then lost it in a takeover battle. In forming K-III, he brought with him Charles G. McCurdy and Beverly C. Chell, Macmillan's former chief financial officer and general counsel, But the textbooks at Macmillan are a far cry from popular magazines.
There was some talk yesterday that K-III might bring in some new management, depending on how many magazines it retains.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Hollywood Keeps Striking Out On Real-Life Baseball

BYLINE: By ALLEN BARRA; Allen Barra, a contributing writer for The Village Voice and Entertainment Weekly, has written about film and sports for American Film, Premiere and Inside Sports.

 BODY:
Baseball movies are older than the World Series, and as Casey Stengel used to say, you can look it up. The first World Series was played in 1903, and according to Prentice Hall's handy reference book, "Everything Baseball," (the book you can look it up in), the first feature-length baseball movie, "The Ball Game," was cranked out in 1902. There's an old Hollywood adage that baseball movies don't sell tickets, but during the last 89 years more than 150 of them have been made, so somebody must be going to see them.
As a new season begins, a quick trip to a videocassette store reveals an amazing range of baseball subjects covered by Hollywood over the years. Buster Keaton's "College" (1927) contains perhaps the funniest baseball scenes ever filmed, as the hero tries to make the university baseball team. John Badham's "Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings" (1976), a film which was all but ignored upon its release but now rates near the top of most critics' list of best baseball movies, features James Earl Jones, Billy Dee Williams and Richard Pryor as post-World War II Negro League barnstormers. 
 The Little Leagues were covered in the series of "Bad News Bears" films that began in 1976. And in recent years, the minor leagues have made it to the screen in "Bull Durham," one of the most popular of all baseball movies, and the cable television movie "Long Gone," which starred William Petersen and Virginia Madsen.
Currently several films with baseball themes are in production or the planning stage, including the tale of an American ex-big leaguer in Japan, a former major league manager who helps put together a Russian national team, a minor leaguer scout and even the story of the first female professionals. When it comes to baseball, it seems that Hollywood has all the bases covered.
All the bases except one: home, as in reality -- the lives and work of contemporary big league ballplayers. This is all the more surprising when you consider that professional baseball has never been more popular in terms of attendance and television viewership and that several baseball movies in the last few years have been substantial hits. Yet Hollywood and the major leagues avoid each other the way the Chicago Cubs avoid the World Series.
Hollywood might insist otherwise, pointing at such earlier films as the biographies of Lou Gehrig, Jim Piersall and Grover Cleveland Alexander and such recent films as "Major League" and "Eight Men Out."
"Fear Strikes Out" (1957) is, in fact, a film whose reputation has grown in recent years, a harrowing account of how the pressures of big league play (and the pressures imposed by a pushy father) contributed to the nervous breakdown of the star outfielder Jim Piersall. And "Eight Men Out," John Sayles's revisionist account (taken from Eliot Asinof's book) of the 1919 Black Sox scandal, may be the first movie ever to factor problems of economics and class conflict into a sports movie.
But others are either sentimental ("The Pride of the Yankees," 1942, about the great Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig), maudlin ("Bang the Drum Slowly," 1973, about a hayseed catcher played by Robert De Niro who is dying of leukemia) or bowdlerized ("The Winning Team," 1952, about the Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, played by a former sports announcer, Ronald Reagan, who portrayed Alexander not as an alcoholic but as an epileptic. He was both).
As for "Major League" (1989), it tells the story of an ex-Las Vegas showgirl (played by Margaret Whitton) who wins a pennant by assembling a team composed of misfits and castoffs. (Anyone who has ever observed the precision and balance of a winning major league team knows that the chance of a randomly selected bunch of also-rans finishing in first place at the end of a 162-game season are about the same as a room full of monkeys armed with word processors being able to produce "The Baseball Encyclopedia.")
Films like "Major League" are Hollywood's version of baseball realism; most of the others sound as if they could fit more easily under the category of science fiction.
"Rhubarb" (1955) went "Major League" one better (or maybe one worse) by having a cat become the owner of a big league team. The supernatural looms large in baseball movies. Pennants have been won with the aid of angels ("Angels in the Outfield," 1951) and the devil ("Damn Yankees," 1958). And lest these plots sound silly to modern fans, remember that the hero of "The Natural" (1984) has a special bat that seems to be charged with the power of a lightning bolt that felled the tree the bat was cut from. How silly will the story of an Iowa farmer who builds a ballpark to lure the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson (the 1988 hit "Field of Dreams") seem 20 or 30 years from now?
 Hollywood scriptwriters are so removed from the realities of big league ball that one of them concocted "It Happens Every Spring" (1949), about an egghead scientist (in baseball movies anyone who reads the sports pages without moving his lips is an egghead) who invents a chemical for making a baseball avoid a bat. Apparently the screenwriter was unaware that baseball pitchers had found such a chemical nearly 100 years earlier and that it had been outlawed. It's called spit.
Why can't baseball movies reflect the big league game as the players play it and as the writers and fans see it? Tim Braine, an independent producer who is currently working on "Comrades of Summer," the first baseball movie set in the Soviet Union, finds the prospect of doing realistic baseball movies "too expensive and too difficult."
"For one thing," he said, "you need the approval of Major League Baseball, and that is an extremely protective group of people. You have to fictionalize and soften your material in order to avoid difficulty." Mr. Braine offers an example involving the principal owner of the Yankees: "If you wanted to make a movie about George Steinbrenner's fall from power, you might find that whatever baseball people thought of Steinbrenner in private, you couldn't get them to approve a script which made Steinbrenner a villain because it would make owners in general look bad. By the time you got done compromising your original material, you wouldn't recognize it."
Another reason movies avoid contemporary stories of big league players, Mr. Braine suggests, is that "it isn't so easy for fans to identify with ballplayers as they once did -- or at least that's what conventional wisdom says."
"In some cases," he said, "actors would be portraying athletes who make more money than they do. The average producer would say, 'So where's the conflict? Where's the tragedy?' I'm not saying I agree; I'm just saying that the ballplayers' current prosperity makes it more difficult to get the audience to sympathize with them."
The man most responsible for that prosperity is Marvin Miller, the former executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, the players' union, and the chief architect of free agency, which allowed players to sell their services to the highest bidder. Mr. Miller definitely does not agree that modern baseball is devoid of interest for moviegoers. "Fans are always interested in the nuts and bolts of the game -- there's as much drama in baseball now as there ever was," he says. "If there wasn't, there wouldn't be so much fan interest."
Besides, Mr. Miller says, "Just because players make more money now doesn't make them less interesting or less human." Mr. Miller cites several modern players whose stories he thinks would make good films: Tony Conigliaro, the Red Sox slugger whose career was ruined by a single pitch that nearly blinded him; J. R. Richard, the fireballing Houston ace who couldn't convince the team's brass that he was having heart trouble, and Curt Flood, the Cardinals outfielder who risked his career by challenging the reserve clause, which bound a player to one team.
"How about Roberto Clemente?" says Mr. Miller, referring to the Hall of Fame Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder, who died in a 1972 plane crash while on a mercy mission. "A batting champion, a World Series hero, a man who dies a tragic death, a national hero in Puerto Rico. Isn't that a natural movie story? And there are plenty of stories with happy endings, like Hank Aaron and his pursuit of Babe Ruth's home run record.
"For that matter," says Mr. Miller, "the story of how the players finally stood up to the owners and struck to preserve their hard-fought right to free agency would make a terrific movie." But echoing Mr. Braine, Mr. Miller adds, "I wouldn't expect the owners to cooperate with that one."
Stories about contemporary players are never produced, Mr. Miller notes: "They always go back to the past when they do a factual movie about baseball, because then they can get nostalgic about the subject. Hollywood people know baseball from the sports press, and sportswriters are often like overgrown boys nostalgic for a past that never was."(Note: "The Babe," the story of Babe Ruth, has just begun production in Chicago with John Goodman in the lead.)
At least one former ballplayer thinks a realistic movie about baseball can be made -- in fact, he claims to have already made it. Jim Bouton, the former New York Yankees pitching star and author of the controversial best seller "Ball Four," directed a short documentary last year called "Bus League," about life with the Birmingham Barons minor-league team. Even though the film is currently the property of Kingworld, a major distributor of television programming, "Bus League" still hasn't been shown.
"The mentality of the people who do TV and movies amazes me," says Mr. Bouton. "They think people aren't interested in real life. The truth is, if you made movies, and I mean either documentaries or fiction, that showed everything that really goes on in baseball, people would never stop watching. If you followed the players around with a camera, you'd see much stranger and more interesting things than you see in baseball movies. How could you miss? You'd be combining the two great American pastimes, baseball and soap opera.
"You know what would happen? They'd end up showing two-hour movies about the player's lives and broadcast only the highlights of the games."
 
DOUBLE PLAYERS
 Ballplayers don't just perform for the fans in the stadiums. Sometimes they put on a show for moviegoers.
* The New York Yankees' slugging outfield duo of the early 1960's, Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, appeared in not one but two feature films: "That Touch of Mink" (1961), which starred Cary Grant and Doris Day, and "Safe at Home" (1962). Debate over which film features the pair's finest work has spawned numerous critical feuds, most notably the one between Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael (see Ms. Kael's landmark essay "Circle, Squares and Diamonds").
* The Pittsburgh Pirates' late, great outfielder Roberto Clemente was supposed to make his film debut in "The Odd Couple" (1968) but backed out when he found out that his role would be to hit into a triple play against the New York Mets in a game attended by the sportswriter Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau). Clemente was too proud to be seen hitting into a triple play, and the Pirate second baseman Bill Mazeroski was asked to pinch hit.
* The comic actor Joe E. Brown starred in two baseball films made from stories by Ring Lardner, "Alibi Ike" (1935) and "Elmer the Great" (1933). Brown chose show business as a career over baseball when the Pirates dropped him in favor of another promising young third baseman, Pie Traynor, who went on to a Hall of Fame career. -- Allen Barra

HEADLINE: 'Illiberal Education'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Nancy S. Dye offers a surprisingly simplistic and misleading reading of Dinesh D'Souza's "Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus" (March 31), one of the year's most important books.
Instead of responding to Mr. D'Souza's analysis, Ms. Dye constructs frail straw men easily devastated by her merciless blows. "Like other conservative critics," she writes, "he believes that if only professors would stop assigning texts conservatives deem subversive and start showing slides of the Parthenon, disaffected young Americans of every background would rally around a core of shared values and traditions." Actually, in "Illiberal Education," Mr. D'Souza says very little about "the great books" and nothing about the Parthenon. What he does do is show that race relations are souring on campus and postulate that policies designed to combat the problem actually exacerbate it. His proposed solutions include new affirmative action policies based on economic need rather than race, but not slides of the Parthenon -- or greater adherence to the traditional curriculum, for that matter.
Mr. D'Souza marshals a great deal of evidence to make the case that under the banners of multiculturalism and diversity, campus leaders are redrawing the ugly lines of racial segregation. But rather than deal with the central thesis of Mr. D'Souza's book or challenge his proposed solutions, Ms. Dye chooses to reassure us with a statement irrelevant to the book she is reviewing: "The great books are alive and well on college campuses." She may be right. At Vassar College (of which Ms. Dye is dean of the faculty and from which I graduated last spring), I read Plato, Shakespeare and Melville, but I also witnessed the persistent harassment of conservative black students, intolerant and divisive protest over an invitation to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan to speak on campus and a general souring of race relations.
Ms. Dye could have addressed the threats to racial integration, equality of opportunity and academic freedom that Mr. D'Souza brings to light, but instead she chose to ignore his book and continue a polemical attack against Allan Bloom's "Closing of the American Mind."

Home Loans

 BODY:
The drop in interest rates and a moderation of housing prices throughout the New York region has opened a window of opportunity for many people who wanted to buy a home during most of the 80's but could not afford one.
Now the State of New York Mortgage Agency, also known as Sonyma, has opened that window a bit wider. The agency introduced a new fixed-rate mortgage last month with down payments as low as 2 percent. Other Sonyma-sponsored mortgages require a minimum of 5 percent down on the purchase price. The new loans, which are for first-time buyers, are available for amounts up to $191,250 on one-family houses, cooperatives and condominiums. The loan limits for buyers of multi-family residences range from $244,650 for two-family houses to $367,500 for four-family houses.
Income limits for borrowers vary according to the location of the property. They range from $58,685 for a household of three or more in most of the state to $85,560 for such families in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. The mortgages, which will be available through Jan. 31, carry origination fees of 2.5 percent. For more information call the Sonyma mortgage line at (800) 382-HOME.

HEADLINE: Summertime, and the Prices Are Easy

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
WITH recession gripping the Northeastern states, clouds are hanging over the region's summer resorts.
The Hamptons, Fire Island, Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod, the Berkshires, the Catskills and the resort communities of the New Jersey Shore are all struggling through mini-slumps. 
 These summer havens also have been jolted by changing demographics and shifting vacation preferences. Families that once would have rented a house for a month or more are now taking shorter but more frequent vacations, and the large groups of single people in their 20's who once seized on house-sharing arrangements are now shrinking as the Baby Boom generation grows older.
In many cases, the shifts have prompted new and different rental arrangements. Brokers say extremely short-term rentals -- for a week or even less -- are growing more commonplace. So, too, are house shares by single people over 40, couples and even families with young children.
Whatever the causes, owners and brokers report that demand for summer houses is off, prices are down as much as 20 percent and more second homes are being offered for rent.
"The exuberance has left the market," said Tina S. Fredericks, a broker in East Hampton who handles rentals in the Hamptons, Montauk and other communities at the east end of Long Island. "We certainly don't get a sense that people are hot to spend a lot of money."
Those in the market for a summer house, she added, "are looking for less-expensive, shorter-term rentals."
The downturn began with the summer of 1989, experts say, when the huge weekend migrations to the region's beaches and mountain areas began to wane.
While this has provided some relief for crowd-weary sun worshipers, hikers and motorists, it has also thrown the region's resort real estate markets into disarray. In communities where large numbers of homes have traditionally been rented out for the summer, and where demand seemed all but insatiable during most of the 80's, summer renters are now being courted more aggressively than any time in memory.
As always, the rentals are being packaged in many forms -- large groups of unrelated single people sharing beach houses, families leasing mountain cabins for two weeks or a month and wealthy people taking country estates at rents as high as $100,000 for the three-month season from Memorial Day to Labor Day.
Real estate executives in some of the most popular Northeastern resorts -- including the Hamptons and Cape Cod -- say that last year was the weakest in more than a decade, with hundreds of houses sitting empty for part or all of the summer season.
And the summer of 1991 promises large numbers of vacation houses at rents that are highly negotiable, and in most cases well below the lofty levels reached in the mid-80's.
The slump has been aggravated by the growing number of properties offered for rent, just as demand has slackened. Resort community brokers say the inventory has expanded because so many second homes that owners normally would use themselves for most or all of the summer are being listed. Plagued by job worries, reduced incomes and other recessionary woes, many owners are electing to economize by renting out their summer houses for the first time, or for longer periods than they had in the past.
"IT seems like everybody who owns a house is suddenly offering it for rent," said Harriet Haynes, a Manhattan real estate executive who is seeking tenants for two houses she owns in in Otis, Mass., a resort community in the Berkshires. "Maybe the people who bought second homes just can't afford them."
Mrs. Haynes and her husband, Charles, a professor at New York University, have been investing in Berkshire houses and renting them out since the early 80's. Renters, she said, "have just become a lot more cautious."
"We've reached a point where people want to rent by the week, and they also want to look at the house before they commit," she said. In contrast, more summer renters in the mid-80's took houses for a month or more, and did so simply on the basis of photographs and verbal descriptions of the property.
Some owners of vacation homes and officials of the resort communities say the bottom of the slump may have passed. They point to a rebound in economic optimism since the end of the Persian Gulf War, and a tendency of many families, still nervous about the international travel in the aftermath of the war, to vacation closer to home.
"Our calls for summer rentals have been the highest in four years," said Pat Padula, director of the Department of Tourism for Monmouth County in New Jersey, which includes Belmar, Ocean Grove, Point Pleasant and other beachfront resorts. She estimated that brokers in the resort communities had signed on 30 percent more summer tenants so far this year than they had at the same time last year.
Though rents have eased, leasing a house in the more popular beach and mountain resort areas still can be expensive. Simple three-bedroom houses close to the beach in the Hamptons begin at around $20,000 for the three-month summer season. On Fire Island, Cape Cod and along the New Jersey Shore, season prices range from $10,000 to $15,000, and even in the less costly mountain communities of upstate New York and western Massachusetts, cabins fetch $5,000 or more.
Those who share houses, known in the resort communities as "groupers," have refined their arrangments into a complex ritual. The groups are brought together at open houses, cocktail parties and through classified advertising and typically include at least 12 people sharing a three-bedroom house.
In such an arrangement, known as a "half-share," each renter is entitled to use the house only on alternate weekends, and shares a bedroom. On Fire Island and in some communities in the Hamptons, where house shares are most common, rates for a half-share begin at $1,000 for the summer, and exceed $1,500 for many houses.
Homeowners and experienced renters say prices have declined 10 percent to 20 percent since they reached a peak in 1987 and 1988.
"The idea is simply to pay the mortgage and stay above water," said Alan Freeman, a Manhattan producer of educational films who is seeking 19 more single people for half shares this summer in an eight-bedroom house he owns in Ocean Beach, on Fire Island. He attended a recent house-share promotion at a Manhattan hotel at which homeowners sought tenants with photographs and videotapes of happy weekenders frolicking in the surf.
Mr. Freeman already has nine half-share tenants who have signed, five of whom took advantage of a special discount offered to those who committed themselves before April 15. They are paying $1,000 for the summer. Now, he said, he is asking $1,350.
His experience in some ways reflects those of others who bought resort properties during the giddy real estate boom of the 80's and are now in a financial squeeze. He said that when he bought the Fire Island house in 1986 he had planned to rent part of it out, but to smaller groups. He also hoped to use the beach and oceanfront vista as a setting for environmental and drug- prevention films. But after failing to win funds for his film production projects from the Federal Government or private sources, he said his income has been less expected, and he has no choice but to fill the house with summer renters.
The summer rental slump, while clearly tied to the region's deep economic problems, also reflects shifts in demographics and the preferences of young families. Many are no longer able or willing to take long vacations. Indeed, veterans of the resort rental industry say a major shift in the market began to emerge in the 70's with the growing number of women in the workplace.
FOR decades, thousands of families in the Northeast had rented cottages or houses for the summer and organized their schedules so that mothers and children would use the use the rentals all summer and working fathers would join them on weekends. But for women with full-time jobs, that option disappeared.
Now, some analysts say, families are being tempted by a range of travel options throughout the year that reduce the amount of vacation time they can devote to a summer rental.
"The recession has hurt, but for a lot of people it has become a question of whether they want to take a whole month and rent a house," said Barbara Nevin, a broker on Martha's Vineyard, Mass. She added that the island's summer rental market, although "picking up a bit this year," had been "very weak during the last two seasons."
"We are seeing a pattern," Mrs. Nevin said. "The same kind of families that used to rent a house for a month are now deciding maybe to rent for two weeks and spend the other two weeks at Disney World or someplace else."
Another shift affecting most of the resort areas, particularly those where sharing houses has been commonplace, is the aging of the Baby Boom. As the population bulge that moved during the 1980's from its 20's to its 30's now moves into its 40's, veteran "groupers" say the character of house sharing has changed.
"There was a wildness in the 70's and 80's that has just about disappeared," said Mike Turitto, a New York City sales representative who has been organizing co-ed groups to share houses on Fire Island for 15 years and is now looking for 10 more people, ages 28 to 40, to fill a house in Ocean Beach. Ten have already signed on.
"People have gotten older and much more conservative," he said, adding that there are now many more "subcultures of house shares."
For many, the appeal of summer house sharing has not diminished with age, marriage or even children. Increasingly, married couples and families with children are getting together to share.
"We share the kitchen, the children play together and it usually works out smoothly for everybody," said Barbara Rothchild, a Manhattan pre-kindergarten teacher who, with her husband, Norman, a sales manager, owns a seven-bedroom house in Southhampton.
The Rothchilds, who have a 7-year-old daughter, share the house with other families during the summer. She said the house mates have included friends -- they met one of the couples in a Lamaze class -- but most have been strangers who responded to their newspaper "house-share" advertisements. This year, the ad has been placed, but house mates have yet to sign on. The price for a family in the Rothchild's house is $3,500 for a half-share.
"We are getting a lot of phone inquiries," she said. "People are shopping around."
Elsewhere in the mountain and beach communities of the Northeast, real estate experts say summer renters are approaching the market with caution and with economies in mind.
On Fire Island, Lee Mehlig, a broker based in Saltaire who deals in summer rentals, said one clear sign of the slump last year was among hundreds of summer houses on the island that are rented out by the month. These monthly rentals have always been in highest demand for August, he said, and August rents have almost always been committed to tenants by April or May. But last year, he said many houses were still available for August in June and July, and some even remained empty during the peak of the August vacation period.
The market for house shares has also been weak, he added.
"It used to be that if you had six slots to fill you could count on 8 or 10 applications," Mr. Mehlig said. "Now maybe you will get 4."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Manhattan Hotels;
Redoing the Sheratons for the Convention and After

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
WHEN the Sheraton Centre asks guests to pardon its appearance during renovation, it means more than indulging a change in wallpaper.
A construction hoist has been lashed to the side of the 50-story tower. A sidewalk shed runs around the base. The lobby, being completely reoriented, has been greatly truncated. And that powerful pounding guests hear is the sound of four new elevator shafts being driven through the building. 
 What is going on, in short, is almost as much a re-creation as a remodeling. In the end, the 29-year-old hotel on Seventh Avenue, between 52d and 53d Streets, will court a new clientele, charge higher prices and get a new name: the Sheraton New York Hotel. Much the same process is under way at the Sheraton City Squire, cater-corner from the Centre, which is to emerge from a remodeling and partial refacing as the Sheraton Manhattan Hotel. Both projects were designed by Brennan Beer Gorman of Manhattan.
Given the current slow state of the hotel market, it might seem surprising that ITT Sheraton would commit $142.6 million to renovate the 1,800-room skyscraper and $47.2 million to redo its 650-room neighbor.
But the hotels are being rebuilt for what the company, based in Boston, hopes will be a better market, and for the 1992 Democratic National Convention, for which the Sheraton Centre, along with the nearby New York Hilton, will serve as headquarters.
Moreover, a period of lower occupancy would seem to be ideal for a renovation. At the moment, eight floors, representing nearly 300 rooms, are out of service.
"We couldn't have picked a better time to do this," said Karl Franck, vice president and managing director of Sheraton's two Seventh Avenue properties. "There is a downturn in business and there was a war -- which, incidentally, did not figure in our planning. But it happened to be good timing all around. By next year, we'll have the right product and the overall economic situation is expected to reverse itself to a degree. We intend to go after the overseas market. And away we'll go. It will be a new game."
For now, not only is occupancy down at the two Sheraton hotels, so are the rates, although Mr. Franck declined to be specific.
Overall, the occupancy rate in New York City was 53.3 percent in January, according to the most recent figures compiled by Pannell Kerr Forster, certified public accountants, a national concern with headquarters in Manhattan. That is in contrast to a rate of 59.7 percent in January 1990.
Averaged annually, New York City had an occupancy rate of 72.6 percent for 1990, a drop from 74.6 percent in 1989 and 76.7 percent in 1988 and 1987. "An occupancy in the low 70's is still very healthy and may be one of the highest in the country," said John A. Fox, a principal in Pannell Kerr Forster. "Things have softened but by no means is it the death knell of the industry."
"I don't have figures for the postwar period but, anecdotally, things seem to be coming back," Mr. Fox said. "But they're still not booming."
"I don't think we're going to recapture what we lost," said Stephen W. Brener, an industry consultant whose Manhattan firm bears his name. "We're going to have trouble holding on to what we had. I don't think the hotel industry is going to come out of this recession until way into the next year."
Another vital sign that has dropped in recent months is the average daily room rate, which was $139.62 in January, contrasted to $142.36 in January 1990.
"It's not a substantial drop but it's unique to New York," Mr. Fox said. "New York's rates, at least in the last 20-year period, have increased in excess of inflation. As for the near future, he said, "the consensus is that rates will be either flat or slightly up but still significantly below inflation rates."
The room rates compiled by Pannell Kerr Forster reflect what a hotel takes in, not what a guest pays. To that $139.62 average rate, for example, would be added $11.52 in sales tax (at 8.25 percent), $8.38 in the city's occupancy tax (at 6 percent), $6.98 in the newly imposed New York State occupancy tax (at 5 percent) and a $2 city hotel tax (for rooms costing more than $40) -- bringing the total to $168.50.
"THE newest room tax hurt us badly," Mr. Fox said. "It makes it much tougher for New York City to be competitive with other major destinations, particularly as it relates to groups and convention business, which is very attuned to rates."
One big project that has suffered in the current market is the hotel planned at the southernmost end of Battery Park City. Having sent out a request for proposals, the Battery Park City Authority began talking with a development and operating team. However, David Emil, the president of the authority, noted last week that "the market for hotel development is much weaker than a year ago and there are substantial problems in our current negotiations."
Some of the projects that are still going forward are the Regent Hotel, on 57th Street, between Madison and Park Avenues; the Ramada Renaissance Hotel, on Broadway, between 47th and 48th Streets and Sheraton's remodeling of the St. Regis, Fifth Avenue and 55th Street, which is to reopen this fall.
Remodeling was long overdue at both the Sheraton Centre and City Squire, which were built by Laurence A. Tisch and Preston Robert Tisch. The Sheraton Centre opened in 1962 as the Americana and claimed the distinction of being the tallest hotel in the world. It was also about the closest Manhattan ever got to a Miami Beach hotel, with its abstract geometric shapes and vivid yellow color.
On the day the Americana opened, the Tisch brothers began the City Squire, a high-rise motel with its base given over to parking. It also had -- and still has -- a swimming pool, a rarity in a Manhattan hotel.
Both were taken over by a partnership between Sheraton and the Equitable Life Assurance Society in 1979. Sheraton bought out Equitable's interest last year, at which time it was at liberty to begin the renovation.
WHILE the Sheraton Centre served as a Democratic headquarters for the 1976 and 1980 conventions, it has been showing its age and design defects. The lobby was remarkably small and cramped, traffic patterns were confusing, elevator service was inadequate and the rooms, guests complained, were much too noisy.
"The way the hotels have been in recent times has not measured up to Sheraton's own standards in other parts of the world," Mr. Franck said. "This was not a secret."
At the Sheraton Centre, the lobby is being expanded to 8,740 from 3,520 square feet; three new passenger elevators are being added to serve floors 21 through 28, easing the load on the six existing high-rise cabs; a new service elevator is being installed running the height of the building; dark-tinted, double-glazed windows are being added throughout, which ought to cut down noise in the rooms and will also change the appearance of the hotel's facade.
The more luxurious "Towers" portion of the hotel, which now takes up the 46th through 50th floors, will be expanded two floors and get an expanded lounge and a new four-bedroom, duplex suite. A new entrance for the convention business is to be built on 53d Street and new escalators will serve the ballroom- and meeting-room floors. Public rooms and guest rooms will be renovated.
Across the avenue, the base of the City Square -- which is now covered in a heavy metal grille that makes the structure look exactly like the parking garage it is -- will be reclad with bays of reflective glass and panels of acrylic cement and plaster. Guest rooms will be renovated and get new windows like those at the Sheraton Centre.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: The Federal Buildings;
A Spur to Slow Construction

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
FOR New York City, the proper word for two major Federal building projects that are going forward in lower Manhattan is opportune.
Over $500 million in new construction will be "going into the ground," in the lingo of the construction trade, late this year or early next with the award of two contracts by the General Services Administration last month. 
 One project is a new Federal Court House, the largest in the country, to supplement the existing court building serving the Southern District. The other is an office building. They will start at a time when all indications are that private construction work in the city is sliding toward its lowest levels since the 70's, dragging construction employment down.
"The situation is bad and could potentially get us back to where we were in the 1973-74 period," said Louis Coletti, president of the New York Building Congress, an association of businesses involved in construction. Current unemployment in the construction trades is about 25 percent, he said. In lower Manhattan, the vacancy rate in office buildings is 17.5 percent, says Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial real estate firm.
Figures from F.W. Dodge Corporation, the McGraw-Hill affiliate that tracks construction activity, show a 64 percent decline in starts in residential and nonresidential construction in the first quarter of this year compared with the first quarter of 1990. The number was 2.3 million square feet this quarter and 6.4 million a year ago.
Historically, public projects have helped take up slack under these circumstances. For the Government, the slack means more competitive prices and lower costs than could have been achieved in the 80's. And the Federal Government prefers to own rather than lease the space it occupies long-term.
ACCORDINGLY, all parties involved in these projects are congratulating themselves that they are starting a countercyclical effort in New York City development. They also are bringing two institutional quality buildings to lower Manhattan that will undoubtedly add stature to the urban environment long beyond this cycle and the next.
They are also focusing attention on the Federal Government's space needs, which have grown in Manhattan even as employment regionally has fallen in the last 10 years. The reason is the big rise in activities related to criminal justice and environmental protection.
The new buildings bear description.
The beige-stone courthouse completes the Foley Square ensemble of court buildings. It is a 27-story tower rising above a broad nine-story base on a site of almost two acres east of the New York County Courthouse and across Pearl Street from the existing Federal court building. The $241 million contract was awarded to BPT Properties, a partnership of Bechtel Investments Realty and the Park Tower Group.
It will have 43 courtrooms and one ceremonial courtroom in a structure of 921,000 gross square feet. Courtrooms come in varied sizes. There will be 23 "typical" courtrooms (2,100 square feet, 12-foot ceilings); six large courtrooms (2,800 square feet, 16-foot ceilings); and 14 smaller magistrates' courts (1,500 square feet, 15-foot ceilings, usually). Then there is a ceremonial court (5,000 square feet, 20-foot ceilings).
A courthouse also needs space for juries and lawyers and judges' chambers and libraries and staff functions. Add it all up and it comes to 547,000 square feet of occupiable space. The term "occupiable" in Federal parlance means the space inside the walls where people work. It is a smaller fraction of the gross floor area than what the private market calls rentable square feet in an office building.
The architects are the firms of Kohn Pederson Fox Associates and Simmons Architects, a participating minority firm. Lehrer McGovern Bovis, with Don Todd Associates, another minority firm, is the general contractor and Structure Tone is construction manager for the interior. The ground breaking is scheduled for the end of this year and initial occupancy should start in early 1994, says Daniel MacEachron, senior vice president of BPT Properties.
The office project is on a 70,000-square-foot site east of Broadway between Duane and Reade Streets. It will be a 34-story building with 974,000 gross square feet (687,000 occupiable above street level), with the main entrance at 290 Broadway on the Duane Street corner. A four-story arcade 25 feet wide will run along Duane Street facing 26 Federal Plaza, the nation's largest Federal office building aside from the Pentagon. The design also includes a three-story rotunda and a low pavilion at the eastern side of the site for a daycare center, auditorium and health club.
The $276 million contract was won by the Linpro Company, a national developer based in Berwyn, Pa., through its New York office, where Christopher F. McGratty and John T. Livingston are the partners in charge. The architect is the firm of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum. Raquel Ramati Associates was the design consultant and Tishman Construction Corporation is the general contractor.
Excavation can be expected to start in five or six months, Linpro said. In one sense the new office building seems to come at a peculiar time. Any entity other than the Federal Government would be tempted to move into the rental market during the soft downtown market and find bargain-priced space. New York City is doing just that, putting aside its original intention to take half the space in the new Federal office building. That lease probably would have cost over $50 per occupiable square foot.
BUT the Federal Government considers it advantageous in the long run to own its space, which it can produce economically because of its low borrowing costs. And contractor prices are likely to be lower when activity is slow.
"Put it this way," said Donald R. Knab, chairman of BPT Properties. "If the need exists, this is precisely the time to do it."
The need exists, says William J. Diamond, regional administrator of the General Services Administration. At 26 Federal Plaza, "not a square foot is available," he said. "We can't even put in a physical fitness unit."
The big growers have been the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The E.P.A. is aleady a 175,000-square-foot tenant at 26 Federal Plaza and in the new building will have 250,000 square feet, its total allotment. The F.B.I. will take the rest of the space in 290 Broadway but will keep some of its space across the street.
Federal employment in Manhattan has risen over the last 10 years to 27,200, officials said, from 23,800 in 1981. The Government has had to take more leased space than it prefers, said Mr. Diamond. The regional counsel of the I.R.S. moved into 39,000 square feet at 7 World Trade Center; the General Accounting Office took 24,600 square feet there. The Security Exchange Commission took 38,600 at 75 Park Place.
The development projects are moving forward as soon as they are because of New York City's willingness to let the Government have the sites in a "friendly condemnation" after design negotiations with the City Planning Commission. The Government paid $104 million for the sites. Had a public review process been required, which residents of nearby residential buildings would have preferred, the projects might well have been delayed beyond 1992.
As it is, a construction start early in 1992 would come more than four years after Senate authorization of funds for both projects, in December 1987. Even then, court clerks were sitting at desks in hallways.

HEADLINE: Talking: Insurance;
Meeting Mortgage Payments

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
A TERRIFYING prospect for any homeowner with a large monthly mortgage payment is a long period of unemployment. The rise in foreclosures over the last year is a direct reflection of how easily such a calamity can occur during a recession.
 But the specter of default is as much a problem for bankers as borrowers. Thus it is hardly surprising that lenders look for ways to encourage borrowers to protect their payments from such a hazard through a private insurance policy. Known as mortgage unemployment insurance, the idea was conceived by Richard T. Harris, president of Morgard, a St. David's, Pa., agency that supplies support services to insurance companies. The policy is not for everybody, for the premiums can be quite high under some circumstances.I 
 Last November, the first homeowners were solicited -- the 280,000 carrying mortgage loans from Chase Mortgage Corporation of Tampa, Fla. The opportunity has since spread to other lenders; the insurance can be bought only if the lender is participating in such a program.
 New borrowers are being offered an even better opportunity. Increasingly, the real estate broker, builder or banker supplying either the property or the loan has been offering to pay the premiums for the first year or so. "All the opinion polls were showing that one of the main reasons people weren't buying was because they were concerned about their jobs," said Mr. Harris.
 Offering to pay the premiums for a trial period became an obvious marketing tool. "If it can give our buyers the peace of mind they need to buy a home, it's probably well worth it," said Tim Good, president of Mortgage Access Corporation of Morris Plains, N.J., an affiliate of Weichert Realtors that has been exploring the idea.
 This form of unemployment insurance adds another layer of security to the more traditional protection, known as mortgage life insurance, that pays off a mortgage entirely if the borrower dies.
 The key question for borrowers is whether the enemployment insurance is worth the cost. That question also arises for mortgage life insurance.
 Unemployment protection covers the borrower's mortgage payments while he or she is out of work. Coverage is normally limited to a year, although a shorter term -- say, six months -- may occasionally be obtained for lower premimums. Almost all policies will cover payments of up to $2,500 a month, enough to cover most borrowers' needs. Payments are defined as principal, interest, taxes and insurance, all of which are normally paid to the lender in one monthly check.
 The premium is based on the size of monthly payments, the risk rating of the borrower's job category and the geographical area. For instance, a borrower who is a salesman in Middlesex County, N.J., carrying monthly payments of $1,000 would pay a premium of $39 a month under the policy being considered by another Weichert affiliate, the Weichert Insurance Agency.
 Borrowers with an adjustable-rate loan could find their premiums automatically adjusted up or down with their monthly payments as interest rates fluctuate. Premiums are added to the regular amount payable to the lender each month.
 If two people, such as a married couple, are on the mortgage note, both will be covered for the same premium as a single individual, but the rating will be based on a blend of both job category ratings. If one loses a job, benefits will be based on the unemployed spouse's prior portion of total household income. For example, if the wife lost her job and her income represented 40 percent of household income, then 40 percent of the mortgage payments would be covered.
THERE is normally a waiting period of 30 to 60 days after a layoff before coverage begins. Being dismissed for cause or having prior knowledge of a pending layoff before the policy was issued are grounds for automatic disqualification.
Anyone who is self-employed or has a checkered employment history or even a job considered extremely insecure, such as a truck driver, assembler or construction worker, may not even be accepted. However, situations that involve only a temporary layoff may be covered.
 Patricia Mungenast, assistant treasurer with Chase Mortgage, said about 250 people had signed up so far. Based on initial reponses, she said that far more will be enrolled as soon as the remaining states approve the plan. About 35 states have approved so far; in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut approval is still pending.
Borrowers seeking advice from their local independent insurance agent may not find much. Many are skeptical about the opportunity although they admit they do not yet know much about it. "You are normally better looking at your entire insurance needs in a more comprehensive way," said John Manougian, president of John Manougian Insurance Agency of Silver Spring, Md.
 But there are exceptions. If the borrower's job might indeed be in jeopardy within the next few years the investment could be worthwhile, especially if the job might prove difficult to replace without relocating, said Glenn Daily, an insurance consultant in New York City.
 Part of the skepticism may derive from the negative view independent agents have traditionally taken of mortgage life insurance -- a policy added to monthly payments that pays off the remaining principal if the borrower dies.
 Under such a policy, premiums remain stable for the life of the loan but the potential proceeds decrease as the outstanding balance shrinks. In most instances -- though there are exceptions -- the payoff goes directly to the lender, not the survivor or beneficiary. So the beneficiary cannot control the use of the money, if, for instance, he or she prefers not to have the loan paid off.
Mortgage life insurance offered through a lender does not normally require a physical examination and may be the best type of life insurance anyone with medical problems may be able to buy, agents concede.
 Further, said Mr. Manougian, "some of the policies allow the money to go to the beneficiary instead of the bank."
He added that this option is more likely to be available through a regular insurance agent than from a lender. The ones from the independent agent may also be cheaper.
 In other instances, a compromise might work. For example, Chase Mortgage now offers a payoff tied only to accidental death -- an alternative that sharply decreases premiums and might be particularly appropriate for the younger borrower.

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: THOMASTON;
Opera House Revival Is Work in Progress

BYLINE: By CHARLOTTE LIBOV

 BODY:
IN 1958, a determined group in East Haddam mounted a campaign to rescue a dilapidated opera house that was slated for demolition. They succeeded, and the building became the Goodspeed Opera House, nationally renowned for its efforts to preserve the American musical.
Now, similar efforts are under way in Thomaston, with the goal of turning the town's formerly condemned opera house into a cultural beacon for northwestern Connecticut. But Sally Hassenfelt, the program director for the Thomaston Opera House Commission, said she doesn't like to carry comparisons to Goodspeed too far. Although she is an admirer of Goodspeed, she said, she wants the Thomaston hall to create its own tradition as a community resource with varied uses. 
 "The only way for us to succeed through the recession is to become a place for the performing arts through the whole area -- for the town, the county, the state and for neighboring states," Miss Hassenfelt said. "But we would have to be flexible, and that means offering children's theater, educational theater, concerts and special events."
Virtually since the Thomaston Opera House was shut in 1985, supporters have worked to revive it. The community is getting an opportunity to gauge their success at an "April Celebration Weekend" of theater and music, which began yesterday. These are the first public events at the opera house in six years.
Today's program, scheduled for 2:30 P.M., includes a performance by the Naugatuck Valley Youth Symphony and an organ solo by Wade Bray of Norwalk.
 
Work for Mops and Brooms
 A recent feasibility study concluded that total renovation of the opera house, which occupies the top two floors of the Town Hall, would cost about $1.2 million -- a daunting sum, Miss Hassenfelt acknowledged. So, the commission is going slowly, she said, holding performances before most of the restoration work has even begun.
"We feel the important thing now is to get it open, so people can see all the wonderful things we can do here," Miss Hassenfelt said recently, as she watched workers put the finishing touches on a new stage floor. Mops and brooms were in the corner, ready to tackle the hall's heavy coat of dust. By opening night, though, "the place will shine," promised Mary Reynolds, chairwoman of the Thomaston Opera House Commission.
Since its construction in 1884, the opera house has played a major role in Thomaston's history and legend. Built at a cost of $50,000, the 564-seat hall is listed on the state and national Registers of Historic Places. The formal European-style opera house sits atop the red-brick Victorian Town Hall. Town meetings, high school graduations and other civic functions were held in the opera house, as well as balls, vaudeville and even performances of opera.
Gene Martin, retired executive editor of The Waterbury American and treasurer of the opera house commission, recalled going to the opera house as a boy, when it was briefly used as a movie theater.
"Supposedly, Caruso sang there, and Ray Bolger danced there," he said. "But I'm a little skeptical, because I can't find a playbill or an article. But George Jessel appeared several times."
 
Classic Pipe Organ
 Legend holds that the opera house is haunted by the ghost of an old man who was caretaker at the town firehouse next door. "People have said they hear strange noises," Mr. Martin said. "But I don't put much stock in it."
As it fell into disuse in the 1960's, the town condemned the opera house and prepared to demoish it, but a group of local volunteers made enough repairs to meet fire and building codes, and it was reopened. In 1971, the Connecticut Valley Theater Organ Society installed a classic pipe organ in the hall, which was used for summer theater and occasional concerts.
"Over the past 40 years, there were other commissions which contributed money through cake sales and performances, and they collected sizable sums to get the opera house restored," Mrs. Reynolds said. "We would just get to the brink, and then something disastrous would come along."
In 1985, officials closed the opera house in the midst of a performance of "Our Town" by a New York theater troupe, citing fire code violations. Following a study of the Town Hall and the opera house, the town meeting voted to renovate the entire building to comply with safety codes.
"It's a wonderful building," said Mrs. Reynolds. "It would be a shame to see it destroyed."
Even with the renovations, the interior of the opera house seems unchanged from its original construction. That authenticity makes it such a treasure, said Craig Morrison, a Philadelphia architect who is a consultant for the League of Historic Theaters in Washington.
"In New England, there is quite a tradition of having these opera houses, but a lot of these have been torn down or renovated," said Mr. Morrison, who visited the opera house in February. "Once in a while, you find one like this, which has stayed intact and has stage and decoration and begs to be used. It's a real charmer."
Miss Hassenfelt, who has worked in the theater since 1972, said she learned about the opera house in 1989 while having lunch in Manhattan with an actor, James Brennan, who had performed there in summer stock. A onetime apprentice at Goodspeed, she went on to work as a stage manager for John Houseman at the Juilliard School in Manhattan and for New York productions of "Fiddler on the Roof," "Annie" and "42d Street."
 "The opera house is part of the history of our town," said Thomaston's First Selectman, Eugene McMahon. "In the old days, we had town meetings and dances there. It was the hub of the town. Because of its history, and because it could be one of the finest little theaters in northwestern Connecticut, I think it should be restored."
 The long-range plans for the theater include summer musical productions, a year-round concert series, plus new plays, theater workshops and educational programs for adults and children. But for now, the commission is trying to raise modest sums. A recent $10,000 grant from the Waterbury Foundation will pay for the new floor and stage lights. And the commission has applied for a grant from the State Commission on the Arts to mount a fall musical, Miss Hassenfelt said. The opera house has no air-conditioning, so plans for all-year use are on hold.
But even though the major renovation of the Thomaston Opera House still appears years off, enthusiasts are more hopeful than they've been in years, said Mrs. Reynolds.
"There is a whole new feeling about the opera house," she said. "Even though there are still water stains on the walls, everyone who comes in just senses the magic is here. The time is right."

Lockheed's Side Gets a Big Boost From the Air Force
 

After five years of intense competition, the Air Force selected the Lockheed Corporation, the General Dynamics Corporation, the Boeing Company and Pratt & Whitney, a division of the United Technologies Corporation, to build its next-generation fighter, the F-22. The contract may also determine which companies remain in the military aviation business. The award is one of the largest in history -- it may total $95 billion if a full 650 planes are built -- and one of the only remaining large-scale military-aviation projects. With the end of the cold war and the sharp declines in spending, the losing team, headed by the Northrop Corporation, must now decide if has a future making planes.
 
The Exxon Deal Sours
 
They danced around the negotiating table for more than a year. And until last week, the Exxon Corporation, the State of Alaska and the Justice Department thought they had a deal. Exxon would pay as much as $1.1 billion in civil penalties over 10 years and an additional $100 million in criminal fines for damages caused by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. But Federal District Judge H. Russell Holland told the parties to call back their lawyers. He said $100 million was not enough money to deter a company the size of Exxon, from future wrongdoings. "I'm afraid these fines send the wrong message, suggesting that oil spills are a cost of business that can be absorbed." Absorbed they can be. Last week Exxon announced record first-quarter earnings of $2.24 billion.
 
A Fumble in the T.W.A. Plan
 
Kirk Kerkorian, the wily Beverly Hills investor, wanted to buy troubled Trans World Airlines from Carl C. Icahn. T.W.A. has $2.7 billion in debt and has missed several of its payments. Mr. Kerkorian was willing to kick in $250 million from his Tracinda Corporation and he had the unions, which were committed to $441 million in givebacks, on his side. But he did not have Transportation Secretary Samuel B. Skinner on his side. Mr. Kerkorian asked the Transportation Department to stop the sale of T.W.A.'s trans-Atlantic routes to American Airlines. Those routes were part of Mr. Kerkorian's restructuring strategy. Last week, Mr. Skinner said the sale could go through. Mr. Icahn will get cash -- the exact amount still to be negotiated -- but cash may not be enough for the airline to survive.
 
Trump's Empire Comes Unglued
 
To Donald Trump, they were trophies. Now he must give the trophies back. In a tentative agreement with his creditors, Mr. Trump -- who owes $2 billion -- would sell the Trump Shuttle to NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines.. Banker's Trust would get Mr. Trump's 50 percent interest in New York's Grand Hyatt Hotel, Citicorp would get his 27 percent share of Alexander's, the department store. The Regency Hotel in Atlantic City would be put on the block. And his yacht -- with its legacy of bestowing bad luck on each of its owners -- would go to a unit of American Express.
 
KKR on a Leash
 
The regulators must be leery. . They placed so so many restrictions on Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company that the buyout firm can only be called a "passive investor." Even though it is putting up $283 million in the deal, led by Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc., to take over the Bank of New England the buyout firm will not gain voting rights until after three years. There are more safeguards as well. To prevent KKR from dominating the bank, and possibly lending to itself and friends at favorable rates, the Federal Reserve is not allowing the buyout firm to control its own shares. They must remain in the hands of the firm's 75 investors. Nor will KKR get any seats on the board for three years. Even with these restrictions, analysts expect the deal to set a precedent. Permitting companies to buy banks, after all, is part of the Administration's banking reform plan.
 
Rupert Murdoch, the Australian publisher, owes his creditors $8.2 billion and is having trouble raising the cash. For Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts, it is another opportunity to do another deal, and last week it put up $600 million to buy most of Mr. Murdoch's magazines. The titles include The Racing Form, Soap Opera Digest, Soap Opera Weekly, New York, Seventeen, Premier, European Travel & Life, Autombile and New Woman.
 
Retrenching at Rolls
 
In the 1980's, when yuppies reigned, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd., a unit of Britain's Vickers P.L.C., often oversold its production runs. The waiting period for exotic beasts like the $250,000 Bentley Turbo S could be years. But with the yuppies gone, the luxury auto maker too must retrench. It is cutting production by about 18 percent, from 3,333 units in 1990 to 2,760 this year.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
A C-Minus Recession
 
What kind of a report card does this recession get? "Below average for most recessions," said Sam Kahan of Fuji Securities Inc., in Chicago. That's too bad. According to the Commerce Department, the gross national product contracted by 2.8 percent in the first quarter. But what is worse, "consumer spending was also down, for the second quarter in a row." That has not happened since 1980. For an economy that is traditionally pulled along by the consumer, that is a gloomy sign.
 
Big-Ticket Letdown
 
As if the figures for gross national product were not bad enough, orders for durable goods, the big-ticket items that are expected to last at least three years but often don't, have taken another big plunge. They were down 6.2 percent last month, according to the Commerce Department, the fourth decline in the last five months and the biggest decline since last November's 11.2 percent drop. "The magnitude of the drop-off is usually associated with the beginning of a recession rather than the end." said Douglas P. Handler, an economist at Dun & Bradstreet.
 
Home Sales Improve, a Bit
 
At least sales of existing homes rose last month. But don't get your hopes up, the increase was minuscule, just 0.6 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors. Still, they did move in the right direction. But the "market is still soft," said Richard Peach, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. "People are concerned about whether they will have jobs."
 
Detroit's Dismal Showing
 
Sales of automobiles continue to shrivel, only more so for the domestic makers than the Japanese and the transplants. In mid-April, Detroit's sales were down 14.1 percent, compared the same period last year. The transplants were up 3.2 percent. Hardest hit was the Ford Motor Company, prompting rumors -- denied -- of further plant closings. Ford lost 30.2 percent in sales while the General Motors Corporation was down by 14.1 percent. Only Chrysler showed an increase, a slim 1.1 percent gain. Some of the Japanese transplants did very well: Mazda was up 434.5 percent, Mitsubishi increased sales by 105.5 percent and Nissan climbed by 62.9 percent. Only Toyota took an American-style plunge: its sales fell by 22.8 percent.
 
Why the Worries on Inflation?
 
So how does Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, view the economic news? He is more worried about price stability than economic contraction. "The issue of inflation," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee last week, "is that it never surfaces visibly until it is well advanced." Is inflation really such a pressing concern? "Even in this recession, the economy is running at 79 percent of capacity," said Robert P. Prince, head of research at Bridgewater Associates Inc., in Wilton, Conn. "Inflation kicks in at about 80 percent and getting there from here doesn't take that much growth."
 
Pickens Attacks Japanese
 
T. Boone Pickens is an unlikely defender of the nation's industrial heartland. But that's what the corporate raider and Texas oilman sounded like last week when he testified before Congress. He said Japan's big auto makers, when they set up shop in America, brought their suppliers with them. Transplanted Japanese companies supplied other transplanted Japanese companies in a manner verging on collusion. He is supported in his claims by a number of unions and a Midwestern think tank. Does Mr. Pickens have an ax to grind? Yes. After buying 26 percent of the Koito Manufacturing Company, one of Toyota's suppliers, he was denied a seat on its board even though he was its biggest shareholder. In the battle over the seat, Toyota, with only 19 percent of the shares, voted against him. He vowed to continue the fight.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Cutting a Deal, New Soviet Style
 
The Soviet Union's leaders are behaving more like politicians, less like commissars. Last week, in a dacha near Moscow, President Mikhail Gorbachev and 9 the 15 leaders of the republics hammered out a deal. They forced Mr. Gorbachev to agree to repeal some of the price rises and tax hikes he enacted last month and to change the constitution. Ultimately, "he acknowledges independence for the Baltics, Moldavia and Armenia," said Vladimir Kvint, U.S.S.R. Professor of Political Economy. What does President Gorbachev get? Popularity. That would be a plus, given his dismal ratings of late.
 
Japan's Art Crackdown
 
In Japan, companies buy art not just for esthetic reasons, but also as bribes. That's why police raided Itoman & Company in Osaka, and 50 other sites. Since the Japanese are such big buyers of high-priced art, the crackdowns could affect world auction markets. "Very wealthy persons might not want to be connected with large public purchases right now." said Bonnie Barrett Stretch, editor of Artnewsletter, a trade publication.
 
Germany: Only Inflation Counts
 
Karl Otto Pohl, head of Germany's central bank, has one thing on his mind: inflation. To keep it low, he said, in spite of pressure from Washington German interest rates will not come down. "Mr. Pohl is concerned with the growing money supply and with capacity constraints which lead to inflation," said Carl Weinberg, of High Frequency Economics in New York. Washington will not get its way.

Tough Time for a Promotion

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
On Jan. 1, Edwin M. Cooperman and G. Richard Thoman became co-chairmen and co-chief executives of the American Express Company's biggest money-maker, the Travel Related Services division. They couldn't have picked a worse time.
War soon erupted in the Persian Gulf, the economy fell deeper into recession, personal bankruptcies began to climb and Americans began to move more toward saving than spending. The division, which oversees the company's charge-card operations and has been the engine of American Express's meteoric growth, recorded its first quarterly loss in 25 years. 
 "There has never been a quarter like that," said Mr. Thoman, 46. "We have never seen a recession hitting the affluent consumer, as well as a slowdown in the travel business."
Because of the troubles, executives say they are becoming more conservative in accepting new card holders.
"We intentionally slowed down our card growth," Mr. Cooperman said. "But we still have the engine pumping away."
Indeed, even with the troubles, Mr. Thoman and Mr. Cooperman, who is 47, have been able to bring a number of long-planned initiatives to fruition. Last week, American Express reached an agreement with Sumitomo Bank to form a joint venture to issue personal charge cards and offer consumer loans in Japan. The company also began an effort to cut the comparatively high commissions it charges merchants who accept its card.

The Dow Looks Even Mightier From Abroad

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
A Dow at 3,000? To Americans who think in dollar terms, that was an extraordinary event. But the strength of the dollar has meant that to foreign investors, American stocks have zoomed much further.
For an investor who thinks in German marks, the Dow Jones industrial average hit its high last Monday, when it was up 31 percent since the beginning of the year. That was the equivalent of the Dow at 3,453, indexing for currency changes from Dec. 31. For an American investor, the Dow had risen but 14 percent when it peaked at 3,004.46 on April 17. 
 The difference, of course, has been the dollar's strong rally, which began in early February, when it was at 1.45 marks, and which has pushed it up to 1.75 marks. The buck's boom owes some of its strength to hopes that the American economy will rally and interest rates will stop falling. But much of the move can be seen as the fall from grace of the mark as Germany's Government struggles with the aftermath of the monetary unification with the former East Germany.

Tracking Environmental Risk

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
When the closing bell clanged at the New York Stock Exchange last June 26, the shares of PPG Industries of Pittsburgh weighed in at $49.25 each. By the next day's close, those shares had skidded nearly $3 -- thanks to fresh news reports about the company's potential role in cleaning up chromium-tainted land in Jersey City.
Curiously, public officials in New Jersey had announced as early as December 1988 their plans to seek cleanup contributions from PPG and several other companies. But as this case illustrates, in the absence of a reliable disclosure process, stocks are enormously vulnerable to the vagaries of sudden reports on possible environmental liabilities. 
 What noxious residue has been found on a company's land? What is being stored on the site next door? What liabilities did the company purchase with its latest acquisition? It is not difficult to imagine the questions that can keep investors awake at night. But finally, it is starting to get a little easier to assemble some answers, too.
One reason is that a regulatory initiative begun two years ago is starting to bear fruit in the current crop of annual reports. The Securities and Exchange Commission warned companies in 1989 to disclose any potential environmental cleanup liabilities they might face under the Federal Superfund law. As a result, many of the current crop of 1990 annual reports provide a bit more information about environmental liabilities than they did in the past, said Michael Silverstein, president of Environmental Economics, a research firm in Philadelphia.
"It's not that the 10-K liability disclosures are totally and completely adequate," Mr. Silverstein said. But the numbers are so compelling that "incomplete as they are, they merit the attention of investors."
Add to that the services of entrepreneurs who are applying computer record-keeping and sorting techniques to the vast numbers of documents that have been filed with state and Federal environmental agencies in the past decade. The result is a host of electronic data bases that can be searched far more quickly and comprehensively than would be possible by hand.
Since 1988, at least a half-dozen new national data bases have been formed, and smaller regional services are springing up almost weekly. There is no exhaustive roster, but industry specialists identified the leading companies as Ensite, based in Denver; Environmental Audits, in Lyonville, Pa.; the Environmental Risk Information Center, in Alexandria, Va.; the Petroleum Information Corporation, in Littleton, Colo.; Toxicheck, in Birmingham, Mich.; Vista Environmental Information in San Diego, and, as the newest entry, Environmental Data Resources in Southport, Conn.
The intensifying competition does not worry Ronald D. Miller, president of Vista, one of the earliest entrants in the field. "The industry is really still in the infancy stage," he said. "The challenge right now is to create a market for our product; once that market is created, we can fight over market share."
Anthony J. Buonicore and Peter Cashman, two former environmental consultants who own the newly hatched Environmental Data Resources, are somewhat less altruistic. Emphasizing their environmental experience, Mr. Cashman said, "We are confident we will take market share."
Mr. Buonicore sees electronic record-searching services as a critical addition to corporate S.E.C. reports. "The S.E.C. action in 1989 is the strongest they've taken about what you have to disclose for environmental liability," he said. "But they rely strongly on the company's own opinion of materiality. So most of the 10-K's do not disclose very much."
Securities lawyers researching potential acquisitions, accountants doing corporate audits, potential investors, lenders and creditors contemplating foreclosure -- all need as complete a picture as possible, he explained. A thorough review of what is already available in the public records of various government agencies is a critical starting point for their examinations.
If it has become easier to find an environmental data base, it is still hard to choose one whose searches will not only provide answers to investors but also satisfy the legal and regulatory criteria that are emerging in the field of environmental assessment. But progress is also being made on that front.
Michael L. Italiano, an environmental lawyer with Gardner, Carton & Douglas in Washington, is the chairman of a multi-industry committee working under the auspices of the American Society for Testing and Materials to develop professional standards for those who do environmental assessments. And when Mr. Italiano's panel offers its proposed standard to the society for adoption later this year, it will almost certainly include some standards for the records' search that those audits entail, he said.
In the meantime, one data-base user has taken matters into his own hands. Robert V. Colangelo is president of the Green Corporation, an environmental services concern in Chicago. He has reviewed most of the leading data bases now available and plans to publish his conclusions later this year, he said.
Among his preliminary findings: Few of the existing companies are insured for errors or omissions in their research, and both product prices and the scope of the search can vary sharply from company to company. While users must shop carefully, he added, the data bases are obviously becoming an important piece of the industry.
Mr. Italiano, the lawyer, also has some reservations about some of today's electronic archives. "My personal view is that it will be a long time before there is a data base that will give you everything you need, because there is just too much land and too much history you need to cover," he said. "But tremendous improvements are being made almost weekly, so their role in the future will probably be much greater than it is now."

HEADLINE: Keep Trade Out of the Deficit Debate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Mr. Kearns falls victim to his own accusations as he lowers the veil of economics over the United States trade deficit with Japan.
Building factories in the United States is not a result of trade balance manipulation but of good business. The United States realizes gains from the sale of land, supplies, construction and operations associated with the output of such a plant. The Japanese gain the use of a superior work force. The components used by Japanese factories in the United States come from all over the world, just as they do in United States factories and in German factories.
Japan is not the only nation to produce in one foreign country for export to another. This is simply the execution of a long-term business strategy. Take Texas Instruments, which is a major producer of memory chips in Japan. More than one-half of this output returns to the United States in the form of imports from Singapore. Would Mr. Kearns count this as an export of Japan, Singapore or the United States?

HEADLINE: Congressman Assails Safety of 'Walk-In' Medicine

BYLINE: By Philip J. Hilts, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
While offering hope for new forms of fast and economical medical service, the rapid growth of walk-in clinics and surgical centers is also providing "the last refuge for the medical buccaneer," a Congressman asserts in an opening statement prepared for a hearing on Monday.
"This is a largely unregulated arena of health care," Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said in his statement prepared for the hearing of the House Small Business Subcommittee on Regulation. 
 Mr. Wyden, the chairman of the panel, put his opinions this way: "Literally millions of procedures are performed each year with little or no quality review of the doctor's expertise, the training of his assisting personnel or the kind and suitability of live-saving equipment which may, or may not, be on hand.
"It is the view of the chair that ambulatory care provides a fertile environment for medical entrepreneurs who are undertrained, unscrupulous or unethical. In the words of one physician interviewed by the subcommittee staff, outpatient services is an area of care that is the last refuge of 'the medical buccaneer.' " m
 
Fast and Inexpensive Care
 The hearing will review the explosive growth of non-hospital clinics and surgical centers, which increased in the 1980's to more than 5,000 from only a handful at the start of the decade. The clinics have proliferated because they offer inexpensive care without long waits over a long period, often staying open late at night.
If centers that provide services like diagnosis, X-rays, drug treatment and mental health care are included, the number registered with states has risen to 23,000 from near zero in the 1970's.
Mr. Wyden provided several illustrations of clinic shortcomings:
*A Southern California doctor allowed his bookkeeper to administer a general anesthetic; the patient died during the operation.
*A diagnostic center in Texas allowed a radiological technician to give a 5-year-old a sedative; the amount given was an overdose and the child died.
*In Virginia, a child choking on a piece of candy nearly died when his mother took him to a clinic where the sign read, "Immediate Care." The clinic turned the child away because no doctor was present. Passing policemen resuscitated the boy on the sidewalk in front of the clinic.
 
Proposed Rules Are Expected

The extent of the problems in such clinics is not known, Mr. Wyden said, adding that that in itself is a problem resulting from the lack of regulation.
The one-day hearing on Monday is expected to help shape regulating legislation that Mr. Wyden is expected to introduce in the current session.
Doctors and medical associations have resisted regulation of the clinics. One reason is that doctors are already regulated by licensing and insurance rules. They say it would be difficult to distinguish, for regulatory purposes, between the clinics and an ordinary doctor's office and the procedures carried out there. Private doctors' offices operate under minimal government regulation.
Dr. Michael D. Bishop, an emergency-room physician who owns five walk-in clinics in Indiana, called the planned hearing "just sensationalistic." He said in a telephone interview that he opposed additional regulations, though they would bring some other clinics up to the standard that he said he applied in his own.
Dr. Bishop said his clinics, called "Immediate Care Centers" on their signs, offer more services than a doctor's office, including the ability to handle emergency cases like heart failures, with special expensive equipment. But he said his clinics discouraged patients from coming for emergency care.
 
Voluntary Guidelines Available

Arthur E. Auer, the secretary of the National Association for Ambulatory Care, which represents several hundred clinics, said his association offers guidelines that the clinics can follow voluntarily. He said no additional regulations were necessary because problems at the clinics were rare, at least among the members of his association
"They are really no different than doctor's offices, unless they advertise certain additional advantages, which they then must live up to," Mr. Auer said. "We don't believe they should advertise a physician on duty or essential equipment if they don't have it."
Frank Papineau, an investigator for the General Accounting Office, who is working with Mr. Wyden's staff, says in testimony prepared for the hearing that there are "some common and continuing problems for the consumer" in the clinics.
 
A $40 Billion 'Fraud' Bill
 Mr. Papineau, whose office is the auditing and investigative arm of Congress, said these include "inapproprate use of, or lack of credentials, no minimum standards for treatment and false and deceptive advertising,"
He said "medical hucksters" are responsible for "a large measure of the $40 billion medical fraud bill paid annually by American consumers and taxpayers." The $40 billion is what Mr. Papineau estimated is spent on unnecessary medical care and procedures annually out of the nation's total medical bill of $700 billion.

HEADLINE: SANDINISTAS SEEK NEW ROLE TO PLAY

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua

 BODY:
A year after going down to electoral defeat, the Sandinista Front is searching for identity in a world without a powerful Soviet Union to arm and defend it, and in a country without right-wing dictators to fight.
The Sandinistas, who rode to power in 1979 at the head of a popular insurrection against the Somoza family dictatorship, lost last year's presidential elections to an opposition coalition led by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
 Now it is debating the creation of a democratic political party, and its leaders say Marxism-Leninism and the idea of taking power by military means have been ruled out. But they seem uncertain, or divided, about what kind of political definition to take. Working documents for a party congress scheduled for July speak of "humanistic socialism," but some rank-and-file members wonder what that means, and others say it sounds too mild.
 
Next Election in 1996
 Former Vice President Sergio Ramirez Mercado, probably the leading theorist of the Sandinista Front, said it was "premature" to try to define the party more clearly now.
Mr. Ramirez said he thought that by the next elections, in 1996, "this neo-liberal enthusiasm in the world will wane, and people will begin to think of alternative models for societies."
"On the other hand," he continued, "we have to see what happens in Nicaragua, whether with Mrs. Chamorro's economic program the country can achieve stability, increase production, grow and create jobs. In that case, an opposition party has to think about what it can offer."
On the personal level, the Sandinista leaders have developed in different directions. For some, who had passed their adult lives underground or in power, this is the first taste of anything like ordinary life.
Former President Daniel Ortega Saavedra spent several months traveling in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf in an ostensible peace effort after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Mr. Ramirez gives speeches abroad and writes, in his first vocation.
Former Interior Minister Tomas Borge, at age 61 the elder in the Sandinista leadership, is trying to establish a career as a celebrity interviewer for foreign newspapers and magazines. He is said to ask $10,000 to do articles on such figures as Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and Fidel Castro of Cuba.
Luis Carrion Cruz, at 38 the youngest member of what is now a seven-man Sandinista directorate, plans to enroll in the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard in September to work toward a master's degree in public administration.
Mexican-born Victor Tirado, who had a significant role in guerrilla days but a less significant government role, said he was hoping that some group in the United States would invite him for an expenses-paid visit.
Others are more oriented inside Nicaragua. Bayardo Arce, who once combined journalism with guerrilla activities, now oversees the substantial press and broadcasting empire the Sandinistas have managed to retain. Jaime Wheelock Roman, former Agriculture Minister, is in charge of drafting the documents for the coming party congress.
"The country has changed, and we have also changed," said Mr. Carrion, explaining why the Sandinista Front has to "modify and reorganize itself in the form of a democratic political party."
He said the idea of an armed movement led by an all-powerful "vanguard" -- the national directorate -- had been appropriate during the years of fighting the authoritarian Somoza dynasty, but had been "debatable" in the years after 1979, and "definitively, in the present circumstances, it is inappropriate, incorrect and unnecessary."
 
Party Congress in July
 The debate and discussions now under way at all levels of the Sandinista Front, which will culminate in the congress in July, encompasses its past performance as well as its future shape. At the highest levels of the party, the debate is thought to be quite intense, even though it seldom comes into the open. In recent interviews, several members of the leadership gave only mild hints of the differences.
"Any defeat brings trauma to a political party," Mr. Ramirez said, "but especially in a party like the Sandinista Front that didn't have defeat in its perspective in 1990."
He said the Sandinista Front remained a political group "with strength, but one that didn't have the strength to win the elections." As a result, he said that in the next five years the Sandinista Front would have to present "a moderate program of consensus that will allow us to improve our standing with sectors of the population where we lost."
Mr. Ortega said the Sandinista Front, with more than 40 percent of the vote last year, had withstood the tide of change better than most Communist parties in Eastern Europe.
"It's because we, at the time of the triumph of the revolution, had the vision to follow a different route, a plan with a mixed economy, political pluralism and Christian participation, different from that of Eastern Europe or Cuba," he said.
Mr. Ortega said he did not want to think about 1996 yet. He said the Sandinistas needed to help Nicaragua achieve stability this year while at the same time defending their position in what he called "a new fight for property occurring in Nicaragua."

HEADLINE: Crux of Debate by Group of 7: Interest Rates

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
The Finance Ministers and Central Bank presidents of the seven leading industrial nations, meeting here this weekend, are arguing over whether to reduce interest rates to prevent recession from spreading through the world. But woven into the discussion is another question that will shape their final decision: Does the world have enough savings for all its needs?
The Germans insist there is not enough, and interest rates must stay high to ration it. The Americans agree that over the long run, the world might lack enough spare money to modernize Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and also to finance new factories, homes, roads, power stations and the like elsewhere. But short term, the Bush Administration says, capital -- essentially savings available for investment -- is sufficient for interest rates to come down, encouraging people to borrow and spend. 
 The conflicting views showed up in briefings, interviews and speeches in advance of the meeting of the Group of Seven countries: the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada. President Bush is likely to repeat a request for lower rates at a White House breakfast on Sunday.
"We must accept for a period of time high real interest rates as a logical result of a shortage of capital," said Karl Otto Pohl, president of the German Bundesbank. He referred in particular to the more than $230 billion that he said the West Germans were transferring to East Germany.
But if high rates ration scarce capital properly, as the Germans contend, they also discourage the borrowing that is necessary for the spending needed to bring the United States out of recession and to revive sluggish European economies. That is the Bush Administration view, prompted in part by concern that a decline in European purchases of American products might prolong the recession.
Reflecting those concerns, David Mulford, the Treasury's Under Secretary for International Affairs, argued that in these hard times there was not much demand for capital. Quite the contrary, he said, "liquidity is piling up in the banks."
The communique that the ministers are to issue Sunday night is not likely to be stated in terms of the capital shortage, officials of several countries said.
They said the communique was more likely to consider whether "a brief detour" is needed to reduce rates for a while to insure that many countries do not go into recession, or whether rates must stay up to avoid inflation. Inflation can come if there is too much borrowing and too much demand, but not enough goods to go around.
Whatever the short-term considerations, the capital-shortage issue is likely to remain at the heart of the debate, now and at future Group of Seven meetings, experts say. That is because the traditional sources of surplus capital -- Germany, Japan and the Middle East oil countries -- are increasingly spending their extra money on themselves. They are doing so just as new demands for capital arise for Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and to repair Middle East war damage.
But if managing capital, or savings, is to be the new focus, then the Group of Seven must determine the total of world savings, economists say. That might be difficult, particularly in the 1990's, given that savings fluctuate in ways that make them hard to measure.
David W. Mullins Jr., a Federal Reserve Board governor, argues, for example, that investing in new Eastern European factories or repairing damaged Middle East oil wells creates sources of new income, which is then available to repay debt. New savings, in effect, are created to repay the borrowed money, postponing a capital shortage and holding down interest rates in the process.
"There might be some crowding out of other investments initially, but these investments in the long run are good for growth," Mr. Mullins said.
Similarly, Robert Hormats, a vice president for international investment at Goldman Sachs, says that investment in the 1990's is likely to be more productive than in the 1980's, when a lot of borrowed money went for consumption rather than for factories or other wealth-producing investments.

Jobless Issue Proves Puzzle to Democrats

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
For all the fragmentation of the Democrats over the last three decades, the one issue that has always pulled the party together is the one that created its coalition in the Great Depression: unemployment.
Now, in the midst of the first recession in a decade, its impact underlined by the report on Friday of a sharp drop in national output earlier this year, the Congressional Democrats have an issue and they do not seem to know what to do with it. 
 The issue, simply put, is that in this recession far fewer of the jobless are covered by unemployment compensation than in past recessions. Moreover, the trust fund that is supposed to pay for benefits beyond the regular 26 weeks is actually getting fatter because its rules often require a very high unemployment rate in a state before the fund kicks in.
A couple of weeks ago Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, said the House Ways and Means Committee was about to move ahead with legislation extending benefits, but nothing has happened.
Last week Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who chairs the Finance Committee, held a hearing on the issue and said Democrats would have to do something about extending benefits. "The problem," he said, "is trying to figure out how to pay for it."
Then the Senate passed a budget resolution with a provision that would make it still harder to raise taxes to pay for any extension, and no one challenged that clause.
The simplest and the most prominent of the ideas is Representative Thomas J. Downey's. The Suffolk Democrat proposes paying for expanded unemployment benefits by raising the wage base on which employers pay Federal taxes for unemployment benefits. Employers now pay taxes on wages up to $7,000. Mr. Downey would raise that to $53,400, but at the same time reduce the tax rate. This would limit the effect on small businesses paying lower wages, but produce a considerable gain in Federal revenue.
Under his plan the Federal tax for an employee earning $30,000 would go to $90 from $56. For those earning $18,667 or less, the tax would actually decrease.
Mr. Downey would use the money raised for a new, entirely federally financed program of extended benefits, which would be based on the national unemployment rate, not state figures, and, in the most politically unassailable section of his plan, would raise to 26 weeks, from 13, the basic benefits military veterans would get. Civilians now get 26 weeks. His bill would also curtail the rights of states to disqualify claimants.
Mr. Downey estimates that the total cost of his plan would be $26 billion. It is legal under last year's budget agreement because it includes the taxes to pay for itself.
 
Vulnerable to G.O.P. Attacks
 But the tax increase is substantial, at a time when Democrats hate to make themselves vulnerable to Republican attacks that their party likes to tax. Mr. Foley said Friday that at the tax level proposed by Mr. Downey the bill would be "extremely difficult to pass," though he hoped for some action in this session.
Mr. Downey acknowledged that a "dramatically less ambitious" bill could get through. He is delaying action on the bill in the Ways and Means subcommittee he chairs, while seeking votes on the full committee, trying to trim as little as possible to get them.
In the Senate the leading advocate of change is Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. He testified before Mr. Bentsen's panel that the recession was "much more serious" than acknowledged and that the committee should vote to extend benefits.
He was particularly distressed because the trust fund that pays for extended benefits was expected to take in five times as much in taxes this year than it will pay out. And after Labor Secretary Lynn Martin defended that fund's "ample resources" as a evidence of solvency, Mr. Sarbanes compared her comment with a librarian claiming her library was functioning well because every book was on the shelf.
But the most dramatic figures are the ones Mr. Bentsen cited in opening the hearing -- the estimate that while as many as 75 percent of the unemployed drew benefits in past recessions only half that many were getting them now. The 75 percent figure came from 1975, but previous high totals included 64 percent in 1961, 60 percent in 1958 and 67 percent in 1976.
Isaac Shapiro, a senior research analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities here, derived those percentages from Labor Department statistics. He calculated that 37 percent of the unemployed in 1990 drew benefits, and said data from the first three months of 1991 indicated that only 42 percent of the unemployed would draw unemployment insurance benefits this year. He noted that as any recession continues and deepens the percentage getting insurance benefits increases because more workers with long job histories and insurance coverage are laid off.
 
'The Gap Is Normal'
 Ms. Martin seized on this point to dismiss concern about the difference between the total of the unemployed and the number receiving benefits. "This gap is normal," she testified.
She cited a Congressional Research Service study that identified the unemployed not receiving benefits as typically young, not the heads of families or their families' primary source of income.
"The Administration," she said, "believes that the unemployment insurance program is continuing to effectively perform its prescribed and targeted mission of providing temporary, partial wage replacement to experienced workers who become unemployed through no fault of their own, and encouraging an early return to work."
Her opposition to any change in the law was different, and far less partisan, than the scorn that Representaive Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip, heaped on the Downey proposal.
Mr. Gingrich, of Georgia, said: "If liberals voted for tax cuts that would create jobs, we wouldn't need this kind of proposal. It's sad to see liberal Democrats create unemployment and then call for more spending to try to fix it."
Mr. Gingrich saw this issue, as he sees almost everything, as a political issue.
Not many Democrats talk that with that kind of partisan edge. The words "Republican recession" are never heard. The discussions are dry, not intense.
Even Mr. Downey speaks more with frustration than a strong political blood lust, saying of his fellow Democrats, "If the party can't deliver for these people, who are our people, then what are we doing here?"
 
In the Past, Passion
 It was not always that way. Democrats used to be to get pretty passionate over the unemployed.
Consider the intensity of an earlier Congressional debate over extending unemployment insurance benefits. In 1958 the unemployment rate was 6.8 percent, as it was in March of this year, and Senator John F. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, was telling the Senate, "We cannot adjourn this summer without having taken some constructive step to help nearly six million unemployed."
Senator Harry F. Byrd, the conservative Virginia Democrat, saw budget problems and Federal domination of the states in Mr. Kennedy's proposal. Senator Wayne Morse, Democrat of Oregon, disagreed and insisted, "Congress should enact measures which will do something about filling the empty stomachs of the growing hundreds of thousands of hungry persons in our country who have exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits or will soon do so."
Mr. Byrd and the Republicans won the vote in the Senate, but liberal Democrats swept that fall's elections, and Mr. Kennedy was heard from again.
Today the Democrats must deal with budget constraints and uncertainty about what they stand for, reflected in Mr. Downey's account of his failure to get a colleague to back his bill. Mr. Downey said the other Democrat told him that his bill made sense, but that he would not support it. After all, the other Democrat said, he was already committed to supporting three controversial measures: the civil rights bill, a bill guaranteeing parental leave and a bill prohibiting employers from giving permanent jobs to replacements for strikers.
Those bills all have active organizations actively lobbying for them. The Democrats used to be the lobbyists for the unemployed.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Murk of Politics Obscures Baker's Path to Peace in the Middle East

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d briefly interrupted his Middle East diplomacy last week to meet with the Soviet Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh in the Caucasus Mountains. Before their talks, Mr. Baker toured the area, and while standing on a hill, with the giant Mount Elbrus hidden in fog in the distance, he was asked whether from this perch he could see his way to peace in the Middle East.
In a brief flash of candor, Mr. Baker answered, "About as clearly as I can see Mount Elbrus." 
 After Mr. Baker's three trips around the Middle East in seven weeks, it is apparent that, while the road to peace may remain obscure, several other things should be crystal clear.
The first is that his entire effort to engineer a diplomatic breakthrough between Arabs and Israelis may be based on a false premise: that the defeat of Iraq in the Persian Gulf war has opened a new "window of opportunity" to settle this age-old conflict.
To begin with, as long as President Saddam Hussein of Iraq remains in power, the war is not over in the eyes of the Arabs or Israelis, and both still have their eyes more on him than each other.
 
No Mood for Concessions
 Neither the Israeli Government nor the Israeli public is in the mood to make any serious concessions to the Palestinians, who supported Mr. Hussein during the gulf war while he launched repeated Scud missile attacks against Israel.
The Saudis, Kuwaitis and other Arab gulf states, who winked at Israel during the war and hinted that after Iraq is defeated they might adopt a new stand toward Israel, have shown no such inclination. They already alienated their Muslim religious communities by siding with the Americans against Iraq, and they do not need to court more trouble by warming up to the Israelis, or by giving President Hussein a propaganda tool with which to attack them.
Throughout his travels, Mr. Baker tried to get the Jordanians, Syrians and Saudis to make positive statements toward Israel to help induce Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to be more forthcoming. What did he get? When King Hussein of Jordan was asked what confidence-building gestures he might be prepared to make toward Israel to lessen tensions, he cited only the fact that Jordan had not joined Iraq in attacking Israel -- not exactly something that will induce Israelis to trade land for peace.
Mr. Baker left Israel on Friday saying he did not know whether he would be coming back, and making clear that the Israelis had not given him the answers he needed to convene a peace conference. In the morning he had met with Foreign Minister David Levy, who offered several concessions to help make a peace conference possible; then Mr. Baker went to see Mr. Shamir, who took almost all of them back, officials said.
That episode illustrates the second revelation of Mr. Baker's travels -- that neither the Arabs nor the Israelis have shown a commitment to making a realistic peace conference possible. That would mean adopting flexible positions to make it easy for the adversaries to come to the peace table rather than impossible.
The Israelis want the Palestinians to come on the condition that they abandon their most cherished political positions first: that is, agree to never mention the Palestine Liberation Organization and agree that Palestinians who are residents of Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem be barred from the talks, because otherwise it might imply that Jerusalem is negotiable.
Mr. Shamir also insists on continuing to build Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as Mr. Baker is trying to woo the Arabs.
The Arabs want Israel to agree before the conference starts to trade land for peace, but are unwilling to even hint at what peace might consist of. Before Mr. Baker met with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, the Saudi monarch was asked a simple question: Since the Saudis do not want to come to the peace conference with Israel, would they be prepared to enter into direct talks with the Israelis on the side, dealing with regional issues like water use, arms control and economic development?
 
No Peace Without Political Pain
 King Fahd answered: "Our ardent hope is that peace is achieved in this region. This is the important thing. It is important that we not move ahead of ourselves in these things."
This leads to the third point made clear by Mr. Baker's travels: There is no such thing as a politically painless peace process.
"So far the United States has been trying to make peace in a politically low-cost fashion," said Stephen P. Cohen, president of the Montreal-based Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation and an expert on the peace process. "They have tried to coax the Saudis and other Arabs instead of saying, 'Look, we saved you against Iraq. We invested enormous assets to do so and now we expect something in return vis-a-vis Israel.' "
On the Israeli side, added Mr. Cohen, it means being willing to state publicly when, where and why the Shamir Government is not being serious or reasonable in meeting even the minimum Arab conditions for a peace conference, even if that means a tough public debate with American Jewish leaders and within Israel. Administration officials insist that if Israelis and American Jews understood how little was being asked of Mr. Shamir's Government to make a peace conference possible, they would be shocked.

Henderson, Back in Lineup, Fails to Get to First Base

BYLINE: By LEONARD KOPPETT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., April 27

 BODY:
Rickey Henderson got back into action today after missing 13 games with a leg injury, but he remained one stolen base short of Lou Brock's major league record of 938 steals.
Henderson failed to reach first base in four trips to the plate as the Oakland Athletics defeated the California Angels, 4-3, at the Oakland Coliseum. 
 He made three fine plays in left field before leaving the game after making the final out of the seventh inning. There was no new difficulty with his left calf and he was expected to play again Sunday.
"My leg responded well to running in the outfield, and I feel a lot of confidence in it," Henderson said. "As for stealing bases, you can't steal first base so I have to get back into the swing of hitting."
 
'No Sense in Pushing It'
 "No new problems," said Manager Tony La Russa. "He was getting a little stiff, maybe, and there was no sense in pushing it."
"He did fine," said Barry Weinberg, Oakland's trainer. "He got a little fatigued. This is like a first spring training game for him now."
Henderson was injured in the fourth game of the season, on April 12, while running out a grounder. In his first game, he had stolen base No. 937, then was thrown out twice in subsequent games. The injury, a muscle strain, turned out to be more serious and slower healing than first believed. When Henderson was still unable to play after a few days, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to the day of the injury. This was the first day he was eligible to return.
 
Brock Present, Hoopla Absent
 Brock, who had come to Oakland to be part of any record-breaking ceremony in the season's first series, had teased Henderson then about giving him "48 hours" to do the job. Today, he was on hand again, without issuing time limits.
However, the hoopla that marked Henderson's attempt to break the record at the beginning of the season was pretty much absent now.
Facing Mark Langston today, Henderson flied to center, struck out, rolled to short and popped up to second. But he ran well enough in flagging down a long drive to left in the fourth and a foul in the bullpen area in the fifth and in making a catch against the left-field wall in the seventh.
 
No Echoes of Controversy
 Henderson's return had no echoes of the controversy that surrounded him in spring training, when he reported late and spoke publicly about his desire to have his $3 million contract renegotiated to match this year's salary inflation. When he signed the pact before the 1990 season, he became baseball's highest-paid player; now the leaders are in the $5 million class and he wanted an adjustment.
Henderson was accused of being selfish and was booed loudly in spring training appearances. But on opening night here, he received a warm reception from the Oakland crowd and was loudly cheered as he contributed to a victory. Since then, his contract status -- still not finally resolved -- has receded as a public issue in the local media and in clubhouse conversation. It seemed no factor at all today.
What was a factor, however, was the return of an important regular to the Athletics lineup. The team has had many injuries, including one to shortstop Walt Weiss, and lost six of its last seven games on a recent road trip. In Henderson's absence, five different players filled the lead-off role: Weiss, Lance Blankenship, Mike Gallego, Willie Wilson and Fred Manrique, the shortstop filling in for Weiss.
 
Third Victory for Moore
 Oakland raised its record to 11-7, after a stretch of five losses in six games at Seattle and Minnesota. Mike Moore, pitching into the seventh, scored his third victory, the first 3-0 start of his career. When he needed help, La Russa provided it by calling on three different pitchers to get one out each in a one-run situation in the seventh and eighth, then had Dennis Eckersley come on for a one-two-three ninth.
Moore yielded two runs in the first inning. But with two out in their half of the first, the Athletics got three on a walk to Jose Canseco, Dave Henderson's single, Terry Steinbach's two-run double and Mark McGwire's scoring single. Dave Henderson went on to have a four-hit day that raised his average to .406. Rickey Henderson is hitting .200.
Steinbach's scoring fly in the sixth made the score 4-2, and that was enough to withstand California's run in the seventh.

The Rain in Barcelona Wakes Up the Organizers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain

 BODY:
As King Juan Carlos officially reopened Montjuic Stadium for the World Cup of track and field on Sept. 8, 1989, he heard whistles, jeers and protests from several thousand Catalan nationists, calling attention to themselves as an "oppressed nation." This was no big deal. The King had been razzed on other occasions, and Catalonians often use public events to express their feelings.
 But it was that 90-minute thunderstorm two days later as the World Cup was ending that got people wondering.
 
Water Everywhere
 For nearly three years, citizens of Barcelona had been gearing up to stage the summer Olympics in 1992. Montjuic Stadium, a majestic 62-year-old edifice atop the hills overlooking the city, was being fixed up, built up and spruced up to become the crown jewel of the Games as the site for opening and closing ceremonies and the track and field competition. 
 But under torrential downpours, it became evident that the stadium had not been fixed, built or spruced enough. Water collected everywhere. Interiors thought to be sealed from the outside were flooded. The infield became a pond. The stadium steps turned into waterfalls. The place was a mess, and suddenly, the stadium had become a symbol of the Olympics, less than three years away.
In the minds of more than a few people here, the cascades of water washed away a veneer of ability. Now, the depth of problems confronting organizers all along, which were previously little known to the general public -- political infighting, lagging construction, lack of enough hotel rooms -- had taken on a new profundity and urgency. It hardly mattered that the Olympic organizing committee had had nothing to do with the World Cup, which was staged by the International Amateur Athletic Federation. Under sheets of rain, few were willing to make the distinction.
 
Now at Halfway Point
 The next morning, one local newspaper declared that Barcelona "failed the only big test before 1992."
 It is now about midway between the rainy past and the opening ceremonies of July 24, 1992, and few Barcelonese appreciate the role of the rain more than Pasqual Maragall, the 50-year-old Mayor of Barcelona and president of the 1992 organizing committee, known commonly as C.O.O.B., the initials of its formal name in Spanish.
 "In a graphic way, the rain helped," he said in a recent interview at the Palauet Albeniz, a small but opulent government building just down the hill from Montjuic. "It had a positive effect, in the sense that it made things a bit dramatic when there was still time enough to recover and provide a new dynamic."
 Unlike many others who serve as president of an organizing committee and leave the operations to an executive director, Maragall is fully involved in the Olympic effort. Once a student at the New School in New York and a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, he saw the Olympics as an opportunity to revitalize Barcelona, expanding its position as Spain's leading economic force by making it a tourist destination and cultural center as well.
 
Other Improvements Made
 Refurbishing old sports buildings was only one of the possibilities. The Olympic bid would also lead to better roads, subway extensions, a modernized airport and desperately needed luxury hotels to attract business leaders and upscale visitors.
 But like so many civic projects, Olympic efforts were bogged down in politics shaped by pressures and demands from the three major players: the city government, the regional government known as the Generalitat of Catalonia, which is housed just across a plaza from city offices, and the federal government in Madrid.
 "The climate around C.O.O.B. was very stormy and difficult," Josep Miquel Abad, the chief executive officer of the organizing committee, said in a separate interview at his office. "Every day was something different. Now, the situation has changed a lot. Relations are much closer."
 By exposing the inadequacies of the stadium, the thunderstorms embarrassed the infighters and shocked them into realizing how their differences and mistrust were jeopardizing the Games. As if by magic, when the skies cleared, their behavior changed. Within six months, Maragall formed a working group of representatives from the three political entities, the public works agencies and the organizing committee to monitor progress. He also brought in an independent auditor, the California-based Bechtel Corporation. Among 300 projects under way, they focused their main concerns on roads, subways and hotels.
 
Traffic Often a Nightmare
 Barcelona is a vibrant city of 1.7 million people and 700,000 cars and trucks, an unusually high ratio that often makes traffic a nightmare. While the subway system is vast, modern, clean and safe, and nearly all the Olympic venues lie within the metropolitan area, organizers knew from the beginning that getting people around and finding them suitable accommodations would be their biggest problems. They also knew that the solutions would shape the future of the region, far beyond the 17 days of the Olympics.
 But rather than maintain an overly ambitious campaign to have everything finished by the end of 1991, Maragall's working group scaled back the efforts, focusing on a more realistic schedule of completing a freeway known as the outer ring road; a subway line to Montjuic, where a 15,000-seat indoor arena and a swimming complex sit adjacent to the stadium; and eight luxury hotels.
 In time, the group discovered that even those expectations were a bit grandiose. So plans were modified again, with the emphasis on finishing the ring road by early next year and completing construction on four hotels. Work on the subway line would continue but with no expectations that it could be finished in time for the Olympics, making it, perhaps, the biggest victim of the earlier squabbles.
 "We knew it would be very difficult, very delicate," Maragall said of the 4.3-mile extension. "It was always possible until the end of last summer, but the politics were so difficult to overcome, we knew it was probably impossible."
 Adequate and affordable hotel space remains a concern. Soon after Barcelona won the Games, in October 1986, the organizing committee booked 80 percent of the available rooms during the period of the Olympics and rates were fixed, tied to a projected consumer price index. Today, with the Spanish peseta much stronger against the dollar than it was five years ago, the rates seem expensive, about $160 a night for a room in a two-star hotel. And there's not much room to bargain. Hotel owners are complaining that the rates are too low and have vowed to charge even more for the rooms the organizing committee did not reserve.
 To charges of price gouging, Abad and his colleagues say don't blame them, blame the hotel owners.
 Security is another issue that worries organizers. Spain's proximity to north Africa and the Middle East and Barcelona's long coastline along the Mediterranean Sea make the region particularly vulnerable to terrorist attack. Officials also fear problems from the Basque separatist group, known by its Spanish initials, E.T.A., and from the Palestine Liberation Organization, which has formal representation in Spain.
 Abad remembered discussing security concerns with a member of a visiting Soviet delegation, who suggested it would be easy to control the problem by building a large fence around the city. Abad said he laughed and told him, "In a democratic society, you cannot do such things."
 Maragall sees none of the difficulties ahead as impediments to successful Games, not even a mayoral election May 26, in which he is seeking a third term. He said he would be shocked to lose, but even if he did, projects would be completed on time, the Olympics would go forward as planned. The country, the region, the city and the organizing committee had come too far for anything less, he said, as if the shimmering, late afternoon sun peeking through the windows of his office didn't make the point as well.

HEADLINE: Squeeze Play;
Hussein's Ouster Is U.S. Goal, But at What Cost to the Iraqis?

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE United States intelligence community this month completed its first full assessment of war damage in Iraq, and the numbers were sobering: $30 billion to rebuild the infrastructure of roads, bridges, power plants and oil installations; five years to repair the electrical grid; months to get water purification plants working; shortages of chlorine and grain, depleted livestock and acute shortages of medicine.
 The question for the Bush Administration is what should Saddam Hussein be allowed to do about it? 
 After nine months of trade sanctions and economic blockade, the United States and its allies still exert absolute control over the levers of Iraq's economy. Two months after the shooting stopped, Mr. Hussein has not been allowed to sell a single barrel of oil, his principal source of national income.
 While a long and meticulous inspection program goes ahead to verify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction, Washington and its allies will retain enormous power over Iraq's 18 million people, many of whom are refugees in their own land, many of whom are hungry, sick or traumatized by war.
 Therein lies the quandary for the Bush Administration -- how tightly to squeeze Iraq, and when to let up. This next step may determine the long-term survival of the man Mr. Bush has been able to defeat in every way except one: Mr. Hussein remains in power in Baghdad. If not victory, as Milton's dark angel said, it is yet revenge.
 By all accounts, the initial inclination in the White House is to tighten the screws, using as justification Mr. Hussein's repression of the Kurds in northern Iraq and his disingenuous accounting of the ballistic missiles, chemical weapons and nuclear materials he is hiding.
 President Bush reaffirmed on Friday his central postwar policy goal. "There will not be normal relations with this man as long as I'm President of the United States," he declared, adding that "it's only terror that's keeping him in power" and "we want him out of there."
 
Tighter or Looser?
 The critical question for United States policy will be whether to undertake a controlled strangulation of Iraq's economy as part of a strategy to topple Mr. Hussein, or a loosening of the noose that allows Mr. Hussein to rescue his people from the deprivation and destruction of the war. Strangulation inevitably brings more human suffering and will prevent Iraq from making a down payment on reparations to Kuwait, whose civilian and oil economies suffered untold billions in damage from the Iraqi occupation. Strangulation would also prolong the damage being done to the economies of Jordan and Turkey, which had strong trading ties with Baghdad before the war.
 But allowing Iraq to open the valves of its formidable oil industry would only strengthen Mr. Hussein as the leader who can still deliver at home. It would also allow him to fulfill his obligation to pay war damages in Kuwait and perhaps launch him once again into the Arab political arena he still aspires to dominate.
There were strong indications at week's end that Mr. Bush and his senior advisers were getting ready to calibrate their postwar campaign. "My impression is that they are at the thinking stage and not at the clear formulation stage," said one senior analyst who participates in the interagency groups that feed options to Mr. Bush and his senior national security aides.
 In another indication, a senior Administration official was asked whether the United States would look favorably on Iraqi requests to export oil. The official said that would depend upon a lot of things, "Such as first of all, there will be a big difference in approach to it whether Saddam Hussein is in power or not."
 Whatever course Mr. Bush takes, constructing and then managing a postwar strategy for Iraq will be complicated and full of risks.
 "It's not clear to me how long this population can hold out with these sanctions," said one government specialist on Iraq. "They still seem to be eating, but we need to get electricity going for water purification, they need chlorine and simple things you could give them." He added that because of the threat of cholera and other diseases, "They need vaccines and medicines massively and immediately."
 Without elaborating on where Administration policy was going, one senior adviser said, "Oh, we're not going to let Iraqis starve."
 Still, no one in the Administration foresaw the scale or intensity of the Kurdish crisis, which has left thousands dead.
Even if the ropes were taken off Iraq's economy, intelligence estimates say the country's oil revenues would not be able to cover the reconstruction bills or pay down the $80 billion in foreign debts piled up over the last decade. By the end of the current decade, Baghdad's shortfall is forecast at between $100 billion and $170 billion. Just to pay the interest on its debt this year, Iraq needs $8 billion.
One Central Intelligence Agency estimate says that with minimal investment, Iraq could be exporting 1 million barrels a day within three months. And, the study adds, with a $1.5 billion investment to repair bomb-damaged pumps, Iraq could be shipping 2.7 million barrels a day of crude oil to the world markets by the end of 1992, assuming the West cooperates by selling Baghdad the oil-sector equipment and spare parts it desperately needs.
 
Diagnosing His Strength
 In contemplating a long-term pressure campaign to drive Mr. Hussein from power, one part of Mr. Bush's calculus must be whether any amount of pressure can dislodge the Iraqi leader from his seat as absolute ruler in a totalitarian police state.
Last month, a special intelligence assessment suggested that Mr. Hussein's regime was "diseased" and he was not likely to last more than 6 to 12 months. But in the ensuing weeks the intelligence community has altered its view, based on the observation that the Iraqi Army has remained loyal to Mr. Hussein and that violent insurrection that flared in the north and south never made it to the capital.
In an important respect, the spontaneous uprising in the predominantly Shiite Muslim south and the northern Kurdish provinces may have only served to reinforce Mr. Hussein's appeal as a strong central figure able to prevent ethnic and regional pressures from splitting the nation apart. To the Sunni Muslim minority that has run Iraq in this century, Mr. Hussein still is the only thing standing between them and the anarchy of disintegration; the only thing holding together the unruly ethnic and religious warren on the fertile and oil-rich land of Mesopotamia.
To be sure, many Iraqis would prefer a change at the top, but taking on Mr. Hussein's security apparatus has long been regarded as a suicidal proposition.
From the moment the war ended and Mr. Bush opposed an initial Iraqi request to sell oil to buy food and medicine, there was every indication that Mr. Hussein sensed Washington's pressure game and has maneuvered to counter it. After five days of secret negotiations in Baghdad last week, Mr. Hussein struck a tentative accord with Kurdish guerrilla leaders to end the state of war in the north and to cooperate in bringing 2 million Kurdish refugees back from the borders with Iran and Turkey under new security guarantees.
Whether the pact survives the scrutiny of the Kurdish community, it demonstrated Mr. Hussein's focus on dividing his internal opposition as the first step in his political recovery at home. His next step will be to divide the international coalition that effectively controls his economy.
Iraq's export pipelines through Saudi Arabia and Turkey are the key to his economic recovery. Saudi Arabia, whose ruling family has dedicated itself to Mr. Hussein's downfall, has the least interest in rushing to reopen the valves on the oil terminal it allowed Iraq to establish on its Red Sea coast in 1989.
But Turkey continues to suffer the effects of lost trade with Iraq. Aside from the hefty pipeline fees it once earned, Turkey misses the lucrative market Iraq provided for its exports and the barter payments that arrived in the form of 4,000 tanker trucks carrying Iraqi crude oil for Eastern Turkey's refineries.
Jordan also would suffer from an extended embargo against Iraq. Bereft of friends among the oil-rich Arab gulf states that fought Iraq while Jordan stayed on the fence, King Hussein's severe economic problems will only intensify in coming months.
The Bush Administration, having decided that the Jordanian monarch was too important a strategic player in the region to abandon during the war, could end up contributing to Jordan's economic collapse by insisting on keeping Iraq's borders sealed against trade. Without the trade revenue, Baghdad cannot make payments to Jordan on the pile of debts left over from the Iran-Iraq war, nor will Jordanian farmers and exporters be able to ship goods to their traditional overland markets in Iraq.
 Mr. Hussein will focus his diplomatic energies at the United Nations Security Council, where China, the Soviet Union and many non-aligned nations may balk at an economic campaign that smacks too heavily of retribution or nation tampering.
 Most Iraq specialists who have watched Mr. Bush over the last nine months instinctively believe that a harsh pressure campaign is ahead and they are gearing up to be alert for the telltale signs of human catastrophe, such as epidemics and starvation, that will require what one analyst called "humanitarian adjustments" along the way.
But for now, from Baghdad to Basra and from Mosul to Kirkuk, it seems clear that it will be a long time before Iraq's war-weary population returns to the living standard to which it was accustomed -- at least as long as Mr. Hussein rules.

The Dauntingly Expensive Task of Imposing Arms Control

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
THE incomplete inventory of weapons of mass destruction that Iraq delivered to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar earlier this month has opened a Pandora's box of problems for the United Nations, which must now set out to locate and destroy the weapons and find the money to do it.
Under its sweeping cease-fire agreement with Iraq, the Security Council gave itself an extraordinarily ambitious task: to get rid of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons, its weapons-grade nuclear material, its ballistic missiles with ranges of more than 95 miles and any research and production sites and equipment to develop them. 
 Iraq's limited cooperation is only the first illustration of just how difficult, time-consuming and costly the ground-breaking exercise will be. And it raises the question of whether arms control can be imposed from the outside when the target country may not possess the political will to help.
If it is so difficult to dismantle an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in a country that has just suffered a devastating military defeat, how would it ever be possible to disarm other regimes -- North Korea, for example, or South Africa -- if they were unwilling to cooperate?
"When the United States and the Soviet Union decide to eliminate weapons, it involves years of planning and every single detail and legal nicety is spelled out in thick briefing books," said Janne E. Nolan, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, and the author of a book on ballistic missiles. "This time, we're just winging it."
The process of organizing an administration to conduct the inspection and destruction is daunting. Mr. Perez de Cuellar named a Swede and an American to head a commission that will oversee hundreds, perhaps thousands, of technical experts from around the world in a project expected to take years. Hans Blix, the director general of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, which will take responsibility for inspecting and destroying the Iraqi stocks that could be used to make nuclear arms, told the Bush Administration last week that he will need more than 400 experts.
Iraq has denied -- falsely, American intelligence officials say -- that it has biological weapons, or research operations to develop them. It has argued that since its weapons-grade nuclear material is subject to international inspection, there is no reason to deal with that issue. American intelligence officials believe that Iraq has substantially more than the 38 launchers and the 52 Scud missiles it listed. Last Monday, the I.A.E.A. told Iraq to disclose the location of its nuclear fuel within a week; so far, the Iraqis have not responded. The special commission will work with the I.A.E.A. not only to inspect and dispose of the 48 pounds of highly enriched uranium fuel it already inspects; for the first time, it is supposed to hunt for uranium-enrichment operations and equipment, as well as laboratories where a nuclear device might be designed.
But Iraq is a country where diplomats must apply in writing days in advance to take a trip outside of Baghdad and where foreign delegations are never allowed to roam unescorted. Even after the experts are in Iraq, will Saddam Hussein's Government allow them free access to the sites they want to inspect? Or will their arrival give the Iraqis sufficient time to hide any questionable material or weapons at alternate sites?
"We have to assume that no matter what access the Iraqis give us that they will be looking over our shoulders and that everything we do will have to be negotiated with Saddam," said Gary Milhollin, director of the Washington-based Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. "To do a complete inspection, we would have to search every cave and building in Iraq."
If Iraq does not comply, the Security Council can do little but enforce a tough set of economic sanctions against Iraq, including a ban on oil exports, Bush Administration officials admit. "All we can do is say that their response falls far short of what's expected of them and to try to make their lives as difficult as possible," said one senior Administration official.
The United Nations has not yet figured out a way to destroy or dispose of these weapons. Nuclear material can be relatively easy to seal and ship, and missiles and launchers can be disposed of with little difficulty. But the destruction of chemical and biological weapons is a different matter altogether, and the United Nations is grappling with a range of options -- from crude battlefield destruction, in which an area would be sealed off and the weapons burned, to the construction of a site where the weapons could be destroyed according to strict environmental standards; such construction might cost billions.
Even if the United Nations exercise is successful, the next question is who will pay for it. Members might be required to contribute to a special fund, a burden many would not welcome; or, a senior Administration official suggested, the Security Council could try to pass a resolution demanding that Iraq finance the operation from oil revenues.
For arms control experts, the operation illustrates the limits of current international controls. "Inspection routines do not define most of the proliferation in the world," said the military analyst and author Anthony H. Cordesman. "If we let Iraq get away with this, it will make our efforts to impose any regime over weapons of mass destructions impossible. If the U.N. fails, who in the region is going to sign any non-proliferation agreement and stick by it?"
The exercise also raises a more fundamental question: whether weapons of mass destruction and the means to build them -- the West German chemical weapons plants, the Soviet missiles, the French-designed "vaccine" factories, the natural uranium from Brazil, Portugal, Niger and Italy, for example -- should be sold in the first place.
Mr. Cordesman estimates that the global cost of the war to liberate Kuwait could be more than $500 billion, more than 10 times the cost of all the arms transfers to Iraq in the last decade.

HEADLINE: The Region;
Can a City Numbed By False Apocalypses Scare Itself Into Action?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
IN the annals of public posturing, the three biggest threats by New York City government are: we're closing your neighborhood firehouse; we're cutting subway service; we're not hiring the police officers we promised. And the leading nominee from private industry: we're moving to New Jersey.
Only this month New York City transit officials retreated, for the time being, from their threat to shutter token booths at night, shrink or scrap some bus routes and curtail other services. The Dinkins administration, which warned last fall that as many as 15,000 New York City employees might have to be dismissed, now estimates that only 1,100 will actually have been fired before the fiscal year ends June 30. Apocalyptic visions are not, of course, limited to New York. In Connecticut this month, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker rescinded threatened layoffs after state employees agreed to contract concessions. 
 Who's kidding whom? Were the officials bluffing? Were their scare tactics expected from the start to collapse of their own weight? Were they trial balloons leaked to generate public protest? Were the threats designed to dramatize the dimensions of budget gaps that local governments are confronting, to spur negotiations with organized labor and special interest groups or to make the eventual economies, however onerous, seem acceptable by comparison?
"All of the above," says Mortimer L. Downey, executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, whose new chairman, Peter E. Stangl, is reconsidering the proposed service reductions that some people fear would drive riders away without appreciably bridging a projected deficit. "It's a public bargaining process," Mr. Downey said. "Getting out in public with one approach sometimes brings people to the table to discuss other approaches. It gets people focused."
Barry Feinstein, an M.T.A. board member and leader of the Teamsters local that represents city employees, agreed. "It's part of how government does business," said Mr. Feinstein, an acknowledged grand-stander himself. "It's meant to create a fear or to draw fire, to have an idea tested and then to be followed up with something less stringent. Those things are all legitimate parts of trying to accomplish a legitimate government end. If you take the view that the end justifies the means, you can be comfortable with that."
 
Crying Wolf
 The price of crying wolf repeatedly, though, is that it can breed cynicism. The practice has evolved into a periodic theatrical production -- a participatory one in which the players improvise to avoid the script's draconian denouement. These latter-day versions of the original fable are spontaneously choreographed. Rather than ending with one of the protagonists being eaten alive, if all goes well the prospective victim survives to dance with sheep in wolves' clothing.
<> <> City Budget Director Philip R. Michael and other officials insist that the dimensions of the problems are usually real even if proposed solutions sometimes represent the worst case rather than wishful thinking. The prophecies are rarely supposed to be self-fulfilling.
"I don't think you make every proposal with the expectation that it's engraved in stone," Mr. Michael said. "Often, for the purposes of credibility, you have to make a plan that is within your control. If you put out a plan that is your fondest hope, which preserves the greatest number of services and inflicts the smallest amount of pain but you need a bunch of partners to accomplish, then everyone will say, correctly, that you can't deliver and you're just daydreaming."
One shortcoming of the Dinkins administration has been its inability to bluff effectively. Earlier this year, New York City Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez persuaded the teachers' union to defer some of the wage increases it had just won rather than subject its members to thousands of layoffs. Mayor David N. Dinkins has yet to get municipal employee unions to agree to deferrals, furloughs or other concessions -- in part because he has not given labor leaders a dramatically worse alternative, like layoffs, from which they could then bargain to save their members' jobs. Arguably, Mr. Dinkins's apparent lack of guile contributed to higher labor costs in the first place. Fearing a strike and refusing to engage in political gamesmanship, he announced a contract with the teachers last September before reaching agreement with other municipal unions that probably would have settled for less. Mr. Michael's seemingly contradictory warning later that week that as many as 15,000 city employees might have to be dismissed because of declining revenues was released as much to pre-empt a similar alarm by Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman and to reassure the bond market of the city's resolve as it was to frighten the other unions.
No less a figure than Victor Gotbaum, former leader of District Council 37, the largest municipal employee union, argued that, if anything, the administration has been too reticent, or inconsistent, in portraying the problem. "In the old days," Mr. Gotbaum recalled, "we regarded it as crying wolf because if John Lindsay said he had a $300 million deficit, he was right but he borrowed it. Today it's not a question of crying wolf. Phil Michael was murdered because of his timing -- he talked of 15,000 layoffs after the teachers contract, so people asked: 'Why are you crying wolf now?' Not even the unions deny there are real tough times ahead. If anything, there's a lack of definition, which is indicative of a lack of leadership on all levels."
Harrison J. Goldin, the former city comptroller, largely agreed. "When the Mayor warned last fall about dire things that needed to be done he was accurate," he said. "The impression the public got thereafter that maybe those things didn't need to be done, in the face of an underlyng situation that, in fact, is getting worse, has made it all the more difficult to mobilize the support and get the concurrence you need to accomplish the solutions. Union leaders are, after all, politicians, and they find it very difficult to bring along members who have not been conditioned to accept how serious the situation is."
 
No Spirit of Sacrifice
 Mr. Goldin recalled that under Mayor Edward I. Koch, anticipated deficits evaporated with the improving economy, but "that helped to create a situation in which people were skeptical." Moreover, said Robert F. Wagner Jr., a member of the M.T.A. board, "it's been done over and over again and the dimension of the problem is so great that traditional approaches to getting the attention of the public, the Legislature, the City Council and others are not working. Instead of making people pay attention, it ends up making the agencies involved, like the M.T.A. or the city government, look foolish."
Henry J. Stern, the president of Citizens Union, a government monitoring group, agreed that comparisons with the city's 1975 fiscal crisis and recurring false crises since then have numbed the public. "The doomsday scenarios of bankruptcy and default are refreshingly absent from Fiscal Crisis II," he said, "but regrettably absent is the spirit of sacrifice."
And, regardless of how much bluffing went on before, this time a wolf is most definitely pacing impatiently at the door. Mr. Dinkins has already shut two firehouses (of as many as 41 that were targeted for closing). And while he has so far spared promised police expansion from the cleaver, he is reluctantly beginning to explore deeper cuts and other economies in a number of departments and categories that were considered sacrosanct only a few months ago including the administration of the Police Department. Meanwhile, transit officials are still juggling alternatives to close their own budget gap. "The service cuts and fare increase are still pending," said Mr. Downey of the M.T.A. "The one thing that hasn't gone away is the deficit."

In Bush Presidency, The Regulators Ride Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TEN years after President Reagan announced a systematic campaign to cut away the thicket of Federal regulation, the garden of Government is once again teeming with an abundant growth of new regulations.
The Bush Administration disclosed last week that it was preparing a record number of new rules, covering everything from clean air to child care to savings and loan associations. 
 The "unified agenda of Federal regulations," published twice a year, shows that the number being developed by Federal agencies has grown about 17 percent, to 4,675, since Mr. Bush became President in January 1989. From 1983 through 1988, the number held steady at around 4,000.
White House officials say President Bush is distressed by the increase. As Vice President, he coordinated the Reagan Administration's "deregulation" campaign, one of the cornerstones of Mr. Reagan's economic program. Mr. Bush led the Reagan Task Force on Regulatory Relief, which mowed down hundreds of rules deemed burdensome to business, consumers, universities or local governments.
Federal officials and former officials give two reasons for the resurgence of rule-making activity: President Bush has not made deregulation a political priority, and Congress has passed many laws that require the executive branch to formulate new rules.
Cornelius M. Kerwin, dean of the School of Public Affairs at American University, said, "The volume of rule-making in this country is a reflection of the demands made on our political system by the American people, and they now want the Government to take an active role in solving a broad swath of problems."
 
Reregulation?
 Professor Kerwin said that President Bush, preoccupied with foreign affairs, had been "less than aggressive in his attack on Federal regulation."
Bush Administration officials said that new rules were proliferating because they were required by new laws dealing with, among other things, immigration, Federal grants to child care centers, restrictions on lobbying, food product labeling, aircraft noise and the rights of disabled people.
Christopher C. DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Institute, who was executive director of Mr. Bush's Task Force on Regulatory Relief from 1981 to 1984, said: "There is a great growth in regulation these days all over the Federal Government. It is being led by Bush appointees."
In part, he said, the current trend reflects a perception that "maybe we went too far" in reducing regulation of financial institutions, airlines and other industries. Mr. DeMuth said he emphatically disagreed with that view.
James C. Miller 3d, director of the Office of Management and Budget from October 1985 to October 1988, said that the effort to curtail Federal regulation "definitely gets less emphasis now than in the 1980's." Mr. Miller, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said that Mr. Bush should "put more of his political capital into the effort to avoid excessive regulation."
The costs of Federal regulation were one of President Reagan's favorite themes. "American society experienced a virtual explosion in Government regulation" in the 1970's, he said in 1981. Excessive, inefficient regulations "limit job opportunities, raise prices and reduce the incomes of all Americans," he said. His Vice President, Mr. Bush, declared that "we have regulated ourselves to death."
By May 1982, Mr. Reagan was boasting, "We acted quickly and effectively to cut away the thicket of Federal regulations -- a thicket that was stifling business and industrial growth."
Heather J. Gradison, who served as head of the Interstate Commerce Commission from 1985 to 1990, said she was disappointed to see a diminished commitment to deregulation these days. "The Reagan Administration appointed people who had strong ideological inclinations to move forward with deregulation," she said. "We have not seen anything like that mandate from the Bush people."
But Robert Pitofsky, a law professor at Georgetown University who served on the Federal Trade Commission from 1978 to 1981, said the political pendulum was just swinging back toward the center. "Regulation during the Reagan years, when enforcers were ideologically committed to an extreme free-market approach, was uncharacteristically low, compared with the previous 30 years," he said. "What we are seeing now is a more centrist trend, a move back toward the historic average."
The agenda of regulatory activities planned by Federal agencies in the next 12 months includes such diverse items as peanut marketing quotas, tobacco price supports, restrictions on imports of honeybees and zebra mussels, auto emission standards, child labor rules, restrictions on fishing for black rockfish off the coast of Washington and rules for disposing of tissue from dead whales.
Vice President Dan Quayle is trying to carve a role for himself monitoring Federal regulation to insure that the benefits of new rules outweigh the burdens imposed on American business. As head of a new interagency group called the Council on Competitiveness, Mr. Quayle has advised all Federal agencies that he intends to supervise the review of proposed regulations, just as Mr. Bush did in the last Administration. Already the council has demanded changes in several environmental rules, including one that would set air pollution standards for municipal waste incinerators.
The Quayle panel would seem to be acting in line with the philosophy Mr. Bush expressed when he signed the clean air bill last year. He said the Government should rely less on regulation and more on the marketplace, offering "incentives, choice and flexibility for industry to find the best solutions."
But the growth in the volume and detail of Federal regulation seems likely to continue unless President Bush makes a stronger personal effort to curtail it.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Over Steep Turkish Passes, the Kurds Start Back to Iraq

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ON THE TURKISH-IRAQI BORDER, April 27

 BODY:
The movement of Kurdish refugees back to Iraq from their grisly camps in the mountains of southern Turkey appears to be starting in earnest.
United States Army helicopters today flew 325 Kurdish men from Isikveren, one of Turkey's biggest and most desolate refugee centers, to help build the resettlement encampment of blue and white tents in the river valley outside Zakho, in northern Iraq. 
 Special Forces officers running the airlift plan to bring in at least 250 more Kurds from other border encampments each day for the next three days, in an effort to build enthusiasm for the move among the refugees.
There were about 6,000 volunteers for the pick-and-shovel jobs in the Zakho camp this morning, said Dayton Maxwell, the United States Agency for International Development's specialist in charge of disaster relief here.
 
Some Now Return Voluntarily
 Perhaps more significantly, in the nameless valleys and gorges scattered along the Iraqi side of the mountains, people were coming back on their own today, in groups of tens and twenties, building into the hundreds. They climbed over high passes and ridges from Turkey onto footpaths that turned into dirt tracks and finally, roads.
The returning refugees had little to carry -- perhaps a blanket, a transistor radio, a few belongings bundled into a makeshift pack. Mostly they walked, but on some roads there were donkeys carrying bundles or refugees packed into a truck bumping down the road.
The mass flight of Iraqi Kurds for the Turkish and Iranian frontiers began when Iraq's forces crushed a Kurdish rebellion last month in the aftermath of its defeat in the Persian Gulf war. The United Nations estimates there are 416,000 refugees at this border and farther within Turkey, while 200,000 to 400,000 are reported on the Iraqi side of the border. More than a million people have fled to Iran, the United Nations says; on Friday, it doubled its estimate of the daily death toll among the refugees, from 1,000 to 2,000.
American military and aid officials hope that once movement of the Kurds and other refugees back to their homes in Iraq begins, it will become a mass flow, as their exodus was.
About 200 families returned to their homes in Zakho last night, Mr. Maxwell said. That number would surely have swelled today.
A major factor in the growing movement appeared to be the removal of several hundred armed Iraqis described as policemen, but widely believed to be soldiers or security agents.
But on a number of roads, Kurdish guerrillas known as Pesh Merga (those who face death) kept some refugees back, saying the streets were still unsafe, in an apparent effort to assert their authority. A local commander said about 3,000 of the guerrillas have gathered on the outskirts of the zone protected by Western forces, where half a dozen refugee camps are planned.
Mr. Maxwell, explaining the airlift of the Kurdish refugee workers, which has been worked out over the last week with traditional clan chiefs, said:
 
Momentum Needed
 "The important thing is to break the ice and get some momentum going. They are very anxious to come, and now that the flow has started, we will get supplies in place and start moving people through."
At Zakho today, First Lieut. Joel Baker of the Marine Corps, whose combat engineering platoon hammered together the 1,000-tent camp at Zakho in a hurry, watched refugee families coming back to town along the main highway. They were packed into carts pulled by tractors.
"The marines put up this place to give the Kurds their freedom," he said. "It makes you feel good to see how hard work can change people's lives."
The roads on the Iraqi side showed the haste with which the refugees moved out, taking off in every vehicle that moved, including fire trucks, garbage trucks, buses, ambulances and taxicabs.
High in a mountain valley, more than an hour's drive from the last visible population center at the village of Darkar, a group of 17 refugees paused to rest in the shade of a tree before passing two abandoned municipal fire trucks on their way back to Zakho.
"I want to go home," said Hayam Haji, a 12-year-old girl. "Zakho is better to live in. I am not happy because Saddam is still in power. When Saddam is gone, I will be happy."
 
Taking Precautions
 A man going back to the town said: "I'm going back to Zakho to look at the house and see if everything is all right. If the Pesh Merga are in the town and everything is all right, I will go back."
But the bright day, in which British marines and fresh paratroopers manned positions hard by the roadblocks of the Kurdish guerrillas, barely concealed the Mideast tribal blood feuds that could spell trouble for the coalition forces committed to keeping the peace here.
"The situation is not stable now," said a guerrilla leader named Mohammed Shafik, at a roadblock only a few miles from the last roadblock set up this morning on the main highway by American and British marines. "Due to this instability, we will keep our weapons."
"We have many reservations about Saddam Hussein," he said, referring to the agreement reportedly reached between the Iraqi President and some Kurdish leaders. "We have to be alert in our minds. We have had many bad experiences."
At another roadblock, a guerrilla leader who gave his names as Abu Zira put the score-settling to come bluntly: "We don't want anybody who was appointed by Saddam Hussein.
"I think the British, Americans and French will remain as long as it is in their interest," he said. "When it is not in their interest they will leave. And when the allied forces leave the place, the Pesh Merga will start fighting again."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
EUROPEANS PRESS U.N. ROLE
 MONDORF-LES-BAINS, Luxembourg, April 27 (AP) -- Officials from France and Britain proposed today that the United Nations encourage hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurdish refugees to return home by assuring their safety.
"The Kurds demand more security," France's Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, said after an informal meeting here of European Community foreign ministers. "The United Nations must be involved in returning the Kurds."
Mr. Dumas proposed that the Security Council meet to examine conditions in Iraq. French officials said such a guarantee would force President Hussein to respect his accord in principle with Kurdish leaders. The British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, suggested a United Nations police force to protect the Kurds.

HEADLINE: School Choice, Without Harm

 BODY:
President Bush wholeheartedly supports "parental choice" as a way to improve America's public schools. In announcing his new education plan, he said that giving parents more flexibility to choose schools "will create the competitive climate that stimulates excellence in our private and parochial schools as well."
This is a revolutionary change from the tradition of assigning pupils to public schools based on where they live. But thus far Mr. Bush has been remarkably vague about how he envisions such "choice" plans in practice. The idea is outlined sketchily in three sentences in a strategy document, amplified by five sentences in a fact sheet. 
 There one learns that the President would provide $230 million for demonstrations and incentive grants and would incorporate choice into the largest Federal school aid program -- the $6 billion Chapter 1 program providing desperately needed remedial education to disadvantaged children.
The choice approach has some attractions. It would provide a way out for bright or ambitious students currently trapped in inferior neighborhood schools, who might well blossom if allowed to choose a better school. And, if applied successfully, it might force weak schools to improve lest they lose their students to better schools.
But the Administration ought not embark on such radical change unless it can insure that the neediest students won't be left even worse off than before, in disintegrating schools that have been stripped of their best and brightest.
Since 1965, Washington has tried to provide equal opportunity for students who are economically and educationally at risk through the Chapter 1 program. Money is given to schools that serve a high proportion of poor students. It is generally spent on the lowest achievers, who receive remedial help in subjects like reading and math.
Recently, Federal rules have allowed any school where poor children constitute 75 percent of enrollment to use Chapter 1 funds for schoolwide services, like lowering class sizes in all grades, hiring reading teachers or guidance counselors. Thus, many schools, particularly in low-income urban areas, now rely on Chapter 1 funds to improve instruction for all students.
Mr. Bush now proposes to convert Chapter 1, allowing eligible students to choose any school they wish to attend, whether public, private or parochial, and their pro-rated share of the program's funds would follow.
Giving bright, highly motivated low-income students more educational options is not only desirable, but imperative. Too many of these students are trapped in public schools that continue to operate despite poor performance.
But what about the less motivated, most troubled students, who are ill equipped to exercise choice and might be rejected if they did? Washington's emphasis ought to be on improving the weak public schools for them, or on attaching enough money to each student so that better schools would want to compete for even the dullest and most poorly behaved. Unless the Administration is willing to promote quality education for all students, its plan will be little more than a publicly funded scholarship program for the bright and restless.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Kuwaitis, Having Survived Hussein, Now Find Their Environment Toxic

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, April 27

 BODY:
With many Kuwaitis remaining out of their country two months after the end of the Iraqi occupation, this country seems in little hurry to measure the long-term health peril resulting from the hundreds of oil-well fires left by the retreating Iraqi forces.
The nation seems to have a divided view of the environment; pointing to the blazing wells is a way to vilify President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, but pointing too hard at the smoke might slow down the return of Kuwaitis, about half of whom are not yet back. 
 "We don't want people to flee the country," said Dr. Walid Daud, head of the preventive medicine department of the Kuwait Oil Company.
Yet the health hazard is such that doctors are advising anyone with chronic respiratory problems not to return yet, and some are advising families with children to wait as well.
 
 No Special Risks, At Least Not Now
 From what they know now, Kuwaiti and American scientists say, the environment poses no special risks to healthy people. Yet, the burning oil has become a pervasive blight, and there is much the scientists do not know about the long-term effects of the huge spills and fires, and their resulting pollution.
Kuwait has not put much emphasis on re-establishing a testing laboratory plundered by the Iraqis that could measure what was going into the air, and has declined to pay the United States Environmental Protection Agency to do the job.
Hospitals have andecdotal evidence that emergency-room visits and admissions are up because of air pollution, but are not able to keep track of how much. A house-to-house survey is under way to measure the smoke's health effects, and how people's daily practices make them vulnerable to pollution. But the survey is being done privately, not by the Government.
Some Americans also appear to be taking a complacent view of the problem. For example, on Monday, Col. Eliot J. Pearlman, a physician who specializes in industrial and preventive medicine and who is based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, tried to reassure 60 soldiers here that they faced no danger. After a series of questions about the long-term effect on human lungs, one soldier asked if anyone had performed autopsies on sheep's lungs to see the effect of the smoke.
No, said Dr. Pearlman. But Kuwaiti scientists say those lungs show black spots.
 
 A Land That Lives in a State of Denial
 A Kuwaiti reluctance to confront environmental threats is not surprising, a foreign-educated Ph.D. said. "We don't admit to having any problem, political, economic or environmental, until it explodes," he said.
The wells are emitting all the garden-variety industrial pollutants present in the United States, including sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and other ingredients of smog. But they also produce a class of chemicals called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are proven carcinogens.
Dr. Daud and other Kuwaiti officials said these are dangerous only with chronic exposure, and argued that all the fires set by the Iraqis should be out within months.
But as the fires continue to burn, Kuwaiti and foreign specialists say, the release of oil into the environment is producing pervasive, troubling symptoms. Among the questions about these is whether the polycyclic chemicals will remain in the air, and if they break down, whether the resulting chemicals will be less hazardous, or more.
Oil, which this country once drew from reservoirs a mile below the surface, is spitting over everything. Raw or as ash, it is in plants and animals, water and soil, on windshields and clothing, in lungs and even stomachs.
"We eat oil all the time now," said Fatima al-Awadi, a chemist, tracing the chain from well to soil to grass to animal. "It's in the meat."
Dr. Jassim M. al-Hassan, chairman of the biochemistry department of Kuwait University, stood on an island in the Sabriya oilfield north of here and remarked, "I don't think this area will ever recover."
The island is inside a river about a mile and a half long. But Kuwait has no rivers of water; this was oil. And it is flowing in the lowest-lying part of the surrounding desert -- the only fertile part, where the soil washed from the stony hills gradually collects, and where a stingy Nature provides just enough water to allow seeds to germinate.
Oil can be seen flowing in many places, cutting channels in the sand and forming black pools.
From a distance, most of the desert still looks pristine. But up close, the flowers that bloomed before the war -- daisies, milkweed, geraniums and others -- are spotted with oil and soot.
The same smoke that irritates eyes and throats in the city is attacking the sand itself in the desert. Once the sand was dry and granular; now it is being melded into a crust by the ash and the black rain that falls from unnaturally overcast skies.
 
Perilous for People, Deadly for Animals
 Herds of grazing sheep and goats look gray, too. The people who herd them, often children, now walk in front instead of behind, to try to protect the flocks from mines.
But the shepherds are leading their animals to oil-covered grass, where the animals appear to be poisoning themselves. Many show respiratory congestion, stop eating and die quickly. And in each flock, at least one or two sheep are nearly bare of wool and totter weakly. The tanker trucks that used to bring water for the animals now carry it only to people.
Where the sheep do find water, it is worse yet. The soot in the black clouds attaches itself to whatever moisture is in the air and produces the black rain.
The content of these rain puddles has not been scientifically analyzed, but Mohammed Abel, a biologist at the Environmental Policy Council, inadvertently performed an experiment. He has two kid goats at his home. After a rain, one drank from a puddle while the other did not. The latter goat has grown; the one that drank has lost weight and looks weak, Mr. Abel said. Fodder is contaminated, as well.
Dr. Hassan of Kuwait University fears for the camels. Some are domesticated and some run loose. The scientist crouched near a plant that grows in clumps in the desert, one often eaten by camels, and points to the spots of oil on each delicate yellow blossom.
Insects have been affected, too. In some places, pools of oil are like flypaper to the butterflies. But not, unfortunately, for the flies, of which there are far more than usual, including two varieties not seen here before. The reason may be as simple as the uncollected garbage, or the relatively cool, wet weather brought on by the smoke. And there are almost no bees; no one is sure why. Birds can be seen migrating through the area of burning oil, and specialists fear for them.
Then there is the question of the fish in the Persian Gulf, which in normal times is a major food source. The issue has been rendered partly moot by the Iraqis' destruction of Kuwait's fleet of dhows. But noncommercial fishermen still throw lines from jetties on the beach, even though ribbons of oil are visible a few yards offshore.
 
A Survey Obscured by Its Own Sludge
 To try to determine how bad the effects are, this week a group of 17 Kuwaiti scientists set out to survey residents, asking what symptoms they suffered and whether they drank tap water or ate locally grown food. In the evening, after the first day of knocking on doors, they looked over the survey forms and realized that the medium was the message -- the forms themselves were splattered with oil.
Scientists, American and Kuwaiti, acknowledge two fundamental problems: The level of soot and gases is highly variable, from place to place and from minute to minute in a given spot, and Kuwait is no longer able to measure the pollution.
Before the war, there were three permanent monitoring stations, situated to measure pollution from an industrial area, a sewage plant and other usual sources, and there were two mobile laboratories. The Iraqis disabled one of the fixed monitoring stations and took both the mobile ones, and the war drove away the lab technicians.
Some of the questions posed by the environnmental degradation here will in time yield to better analysis. Early in May, the United States Army's Environmental Hygiene Agency is to bring an advanced laboratory to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Field teams are to perform two weeks of sampling, but no public report is expected until fall.
 
Kuwait's Scientists Are Slow to Return
 Kuwait's own scientific establishment, heavy with Ph.D.'s trained in the United States and Britain, is near a standstill. Dr. Mustafa al-Desuki, chief technical adviser to the Kuwaiti Environmental Protection Department, said 80 percent of his staff was still abroad.
Postwar Kuwait has resolved to be less dependent on foreigners, but for years the country relied almost exclusively on foreign technicians. Many of these do not want to come back, and some, like Palestinians and Iraqis, are unwelcome.
Nonetheless, after two months of living amid burning oil wells, many Kuwaitis still do not see all this primarily as an environmental problem, but an economic one.
"This is cash," a businessman said of the oil. "If the fire was out and the oil underground, and the country needed to borrow, that would be our collateral. If the firefighters say it will take $500 million and seven months, I'd say give them $1 billion and three months."
While the firefighting goes on, some scientists minimize the environmental damage. Colonel Pearlman said oil will not hurt the gastrointestinal tract "unless you drink a good cup of crude," and for most people, skin irritation is "pretty much a nonevent unless you bathe in the stuff." The particles are too big to enter the lungs, he said, and will lodge instead in the upper respiratory tract, where they can cause irritation.
"Coughing up black soot is a protective mechanism by our bodies," Dr. Pearlman said. "That doesn't mean it's a health hazard. That means it's a nuisance."

HEADLINE: Racial Quotas Are a Fact of Economic Life

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Tossing Around the 'Quota' Bomb" (editorial, April 7), you claim to doubt that proposed revisions to the civil rights laws would drive employers to hire according to quotas to avoid lawsuits. The Bush Administration in making this argument, you say, "cites no evidence." You then provide ample evidence yourself. 
 The case involving the Daniel Lamp Company, which you discuss, and which was described on "60 Minutes" and received a good deal of attention in Chicago, makes the point. The lamp company employs fewer than 30 production workers; the employees are mostly Hispanic, but at various times several blacks have been employed as well.
After a black woman who had been rejected for a job complained, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claimed that a nondiscriminatory employer would have had more black employees (8.45 blacks, to be precise). It proposed that the company spend $10,000 advertising to discover blacks who felt they had been discriminated against and further that the company pay $124,000 into a fund out of which several rejected black applicants, and any blacks responding to the advertising, could seek damages. If the employer did not agree, a lawsuit would follow (the commission filed suit on Jan. 16).
How did the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission conclude that Daniel Lamp should have had 8.45 black employees? Because that number was approximately 30 percent of Daniel's work force, and the commission claims that is the percentage of blacks employed by companies within a three-mile radius of the Daniel plant.
This is the study to which you refer, and it proves nothing. The lamp company was in an entirely Hispanic neighborhood, paid the minimum wage and was not likely to elicit large numbers of applicants who lived at a distance from the plant. All of the employees who worked at the plant were from the neighborhood.
An employer observing the situation of the Daniel Lamp Company, whether or not the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ultimately prevails, can be forgiven for thinking that the better part of discretion is to hire a specified number of minority workers to avoid trouble. To paraphrase your words, if you refuse to recognize the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's demand as a quota, it will be hard to conduct any cogent debate.
Anyone who has lived in the United States and worked for an employer in the last 20 years knows, despite the absence of evidence cited, that employers engage in race-conscious preferential treatment to avoid litigation. Not all of this behavior is undesirable, but until the civil rights establishment, and the Democratic Party, are willing to be candid about the facts of life, a constructive discussion of the pros and cons cannot begin. They'll just have to stand there and take it when the quota epithet is hurled at them.

OUT OF THE CHANNEL
The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill in Prince William Sound.
By John Keeble.
290 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $22.95.  
 Few things in Alaska ever happen on a small scale. The Klondike gold rush of 1897 set off a stampede of hyperbole matched only by the greed of the prospectors. The Good Friday earthquake of 1964 not only buried whole towns, including the old port of Valdez, under a seismic wave of water, but created a new shoreline for much of the state. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline, built in the 1970's after a vast oil field was discovered beneath the North Slope, was the biggest private construction project in history, hooking the state on a potentially destructive treasure.
So when the Exxon Valdez, one of the world's most technologically advanced tankers, was ruptured on a shallow reef two years ago, it was not just any old accident but the nation's largest oil spill, a gusher of nearly 11 million gallons. And when Exxon settled with the United States Government and the State of Alaska last month, the claim made history. Exxon agreed to pay $1.1 billion, the largest sum ever paid for an environmental catastrophe.
As John Keeble shows in "Out of the Channel," the spill was all the more dramatic because it was a clash of two extremes: the industrial world, in the form of the Texas-based Exxon Corporation, versus primordial nature, Prince William Sound with its sea otters and its villages inhabited by people who live off whatever they bring in from the sea.
At the height of the cleanup effort, when an army of 11,000 workers slopped around Prince William Sound in orange rubber suits, hand-scrubbing rocks and hosing down beaches with hot water, there was a rollicking, black-humor, typically Alaskan quality to the whole mess.
Mr. Keeble, the author of four books of fiction, tells the story of the great spill in a style and tone that is more impressionistic than the scolding narrative it could have been. His approach, while a bit meandering in some sections, serves him well, because nothing about the saga of the Exxon Valdez was ever as black-and-white as it appeared.
For example, even though the Coast Guard made the ship's skipper, Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, give up his license to operate a ship for nine months after he pleaded no contest, in July 1990, to charges of negligence and consuming alcohol within four hours of sailing, no jury and no investigative reporter has been able to show conclusively that he was drunk when he went below deck a few minutes before the spill and gave up command of his ship during the most treacherous part of the journey from Valdez to Long Beach, Calif. (Indeed, he was acquitted in Alaska of charges of intoxication and reckless endangerment.) Mr. Keeble adds nothing new to the file on Captain Hazelwood, who is the youngest skipper in Exxon history, a voracious reader, a bit of a rebel and a conscientious man with a well-documented drinking problem.
Instead, the author gives him the now familiar revisionist treatment, describing him as the fall guy for a stereotype of a corporation. Mr. Keeble concludes that the truth about Captain Hazelwood will probably never be known, or at least understood, because he has become an icon. "The nation," the author writes, "could fix its sense of outrage and guilt upon him."
Mr. Keeble, who covered the spill for The Village Voice, spent enough time in Prince William Sound to bring back an engaging story. He talked with the "spillionaires" of Valdez, who lambasted Exxon while getting rich off boat rental fees to the company's cleanup fleet; with the confused and troubled villagers, and with the corporate spin doctors prowling around press conferences in fresh-pressed Eddie Bauer togs. The problem is the book's structure. The narrative moves from late-night chats aboard fishing boats to dissertation-style explanations of oil chemistry, without conveying a sense of the overall story or a developing theme.
Mr. Keeble finds the fishermen most interesting, with their advanced degrees and their homes cut off from the world; he calls them "the quintessential Alaskans of the moment." They opposed the pipeline from the start, because they feared that a spill of any significance could harm one of the world's last great salmon fisheries. And in the first hectic days after the accident, while Exxon dithered, the fishermen took charge, starting their own cleanup in an effort to save their salmon hatcheries. Aside from these eco-fishermen, though, Mr. Keeble finds few people worth romanticizing.
"Alaska," he writes, "is a resource colony, or economic territory." That may be true, but most of the "exploited" residents receive enough in oil dividends -- roughly $1000 per person -- to be willing co-conspirators. Until a few years ago, trying to find somebody who opposed the oil industry in the 49th state was like looking for a real cowboy in midtown Manhattan.
Mr. Keeble concludes, as other observers have, that the cleanup effort was by and large a public relations campaign -- one that cost more than $2 billion, employed more Alaskans than any project since the pipeline was built and took very little oil out of the the water -- perhaps no more than 20 percent. The technology that has gone into bringing oil from beneath the ground and transporting it to fuel-hungry consumers in the lower 48 states may be plenty advanced, but the methods used to clean up the muck after an accident are in the Stone Age.
There are sharp passages in this book about what a flood of oil does to an unspoiled landscape and its inhabitants -- descriptions of otters scratching their eyes out, birds gagging on the toxic sludge and villagers discovering the capitalistic impulse to gouge their customers. And such sights, we are now learning, are just a hint of the destruction; this month, biologists hired by the Federal Government announced that the damage was far worse than originally reported and that its effects may linger much longer than had been anticipated.
While there is nothing funny about the spill, the tone of this book is bit too grim, occasionally even preachy, and misses the raucous humor that Alaskans themselves found in an oil giant humbled by the accidental release of its prized cargo.
"Through their use of oil," Mr. Keeble writes, "humans have entered into an exchange with their own natural history that extends back through the millennia." But, he observes, we may be "consuming our natural history faster than it can replenish itself." Such things were seldom mentioned by the lawyers and accountants who dealt with the fallout from the nation's worst spill. Mr. Keeble's ability to find ironies in catastrophe may be his greatest contribution to the tanker of words spilled over the Exxon Valdez.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 28, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A review on page 23 of The Times Book Review today, about "Out of the Channel: The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill in Prince William Sound" by John Keeble, briefly summarizes the settlement reached by the oil company in March with the United States Government and the State of Alaska by saying Exxon had agreed to pay $1.1 billion. On Wednesday, after The Book Review had gone to press, a Federal judge overturned part of the settlement, saying the criminal portion of the penalty, $100 million, was too small, and leaving the entire settlement in doubt.

HEADLINE: FILM;
'Truly, Madly' Favors Ghosts Without Gimmicks

BYLINE: By MATT WOLF; Matt Wolf is an American theater critic and journalist based in London.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Anthony Minghella's first film, "Truly, Madly, Deeply," features among its characters a ghost who returns to be with the grief-stricken woman he loved. But any similarities to "Ghost," insists the British writer-director, are merely coincidental.
"It's such a different kind of film," Mr. Minghella, who is 37 years old, was saying over breakfast one morning in a Covent Garden brasserie. He said the specter of the American blockbuster constituted both "a blessing and a curse." 
 "It's a blessing that 'Ghost' did well," he said. "If it had been a disaster, then it probably would have inhibited this film from being released. It also suggested there's an appetite, happily, for films which have an anti-naturalist quality to them." On the other hand, he added, " 'Ghost' is there. I can't drive around it; I have to drive through it."
Not that audiences are likely to confuse the two movies. Whereas "Ghost" vaunts its Hollywood slickness from the outset, "Truly, Madly, Deeply," which opens Friday in New York City, looks like the low-budget English feature that, in fact, it is (the film cost about $1.8 million). Its opening scenes, showing Juliet Stevenson as the bereaved Nina in therapy, hint at a Bergman-like austerity. Only gradually does the film's quirkiness emerge in its celebration of human idiosyncrasy and in its rebuttal of all the trademarks of ghost-ridden movies. No walking through walls or otherworldly bluish lights here; the director's interests lie in "those strange ricocheting emotional dynamics" that have always marked his earlier work, as a dramatist, in theater and television. Like his new film, one of his early plays, "A Little Like Drowning," dealt with loss and grief without gimmickry.
"Is he really there?" Mr. Minghella said, discussing the film's plot, in which Alan Rickman as Nina's lover, Jamie, appears from the dead at her flat to offer solace and eventual release. "Who can see him? Is he really dead? I felt instinctually that those questions weren't at all appropriate." The film dispenses with the expected barrage of special effects, which, said Mr. Minghella, its producers could not have afforded anyway. "It's a wonderful thing when the economies of film making determine the style," he said. "We simply wouldn't have been able to do any of those things even if we collectively thought we must."
More important, he felt, was to honor his script's "shifting realities." "The movie's not about death, particularly," said Mr. Minghella. "It's about all forms of loss -- about all forms of hanging on to versions of the past which actually impede any sort of progress in relationships." In the film's final scene, Jamie and his other ghostly friends wave farewell to Nina through the window of her flat in what amounts to a gesture of letting go. Said the director: "In many ways, the movie is a meditation on the circumstances of women like Juliet in contemporary London: how you make your way, what sort of community you establish, how that community operates, how you move on."
"Truly, Madly, Deeply" marks the seventh collaboration between Mr. Minghella and Miss Stevenson, whom he first met when she appeared in several episodes of the BBC dramatic series "Maybury," for which he wrote a decade ago. The two have worked together on and off since in television and in radio, although never in the medium -- theater -- in which both remain best known. Mr. Minghella says he believes in fostering working relationships over time and points out that Bill Paterson, who plays Nina's boss at the agency that employs her as an interpreter, is the only one of the film's principals with whom he had not worked before.
"I would hope it was a sign of creative loyalty and also of seeing the possibility of the shorthand in relationships," said the director, whose wife, the Hong Kong-born dancer Carolyn Choa, has a small role in the movie. "You don't waste time in a creative relationship; there's a mutual vocabulary. You can get right to the heart of the matter."
Mr. Minghella said he owes the style of "Truly, Madly, Deeply" to yet another collaboration -- his partnership with the late Jim Henson. For Mr. Henson, he wrote nine episodes of the television series "The Storyteller," as well as a 1989 television film "Living With Dinosaurs," which starred Miss Stevenson.
"Before my Henson period," Mr. Minghella said, "all my narrative solutions were extremely naturalistic, extremely in the realm of what is possible. Then I worked on 'Storyteller' and spent two years really reading folk tales and myths and fantastical pieces of literature." The result was liberating.
"It opened me consciously or otherwise to the possibility of marrying two distinct styles: one which accommodates rather bold devices like the laws of fairy tales and at the same time marrying that with a much more apparently authentic style of language," Mr. Minghella said.
 A dramatist who first came to attention in the theater in the early 1980's with various plays on London's equivalent of Off Broadway, Mr. Minghella hasn't written for the stage since 1986, when he made his West End debut with "Made in Bangkok," about a British tour group on vacation in Thailand. The play arrived with impeccable credentials -- a major producer (Michael Codron), director (Michael Blakemore) and star (Felicity Kendal) -- and yet still lost money. Five years later, Mr. Minghella finds the very genre of theater puzzling.
"I don't know what constitutes the sort of material that's best expressed in the theater anymore," said the director, who was a drama lecturer at his alma mater, the University of Hull in northern England, until 1981.
For now, Mr. Minghella was sounding like a man hooked on the screen. On tap are three separate projects -- "The Seven Deadly Sins" for Henson Productions, about a man who is visited by the seven vices; a script for the director Randa Haines ("Children of a Lesser God"), set partly in Italy and in the United States; and another directing job, "Mr. Wonderful," about a group of Italians working for Con Edison in Manhattan. A movie of "Made in Bangkok" is possible, too.
The second of five children born to southern Italian emigrants, Mr. Minghella pointed to a link between his childhood on Britain's Isle of Wight and the process of film directing, a link he is only now discovering. Having grown up above his parents' seaside cafe, where life revolved around the kitchen, the director looks back on "an impossible domestic situation" of endless bustle and activity.
"I found myself going to university as far away from that kitchen as possible into a career and a job that couldn't be more of an antithesis, quietly writing in a room," he said -- antithetical, that is, until he started to direct. "I looked up and realized there were 70 people shouting and trying to get gear into place," he said, remembering the precise epiphany. "For one blinding moment, I'd gone back into the kitchen again. It felt great."

HEADLINE: Texas Governor Is Elusive on Taxes

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., April 24

 BODY:
One hundred days after becoming Governor of Texas, Ann Richards still seems to be campaigning for the job, except now she looks as if she is having fun.
Crisscrossing the state last year, Ms. Richards proclaimed her intentions to create a "new Texas." And now, as she dashes around the state Capitol, the slogan remains her rallying cry. Just as she did in the campaign, she offers specific policies on only a few carefully chosen issues, all the while avoiding any commitments on tax matters. 
 Instead of enjoying the honeymoon usually afforded newly elected officials, Ms. Richards, a Democrat, has been courting and cajoling the State Legislature and the executive bureaucracy, trying to establish her spheres of influence. Rather than expending political capital, she has been trying to create it.
"She stepped into this job at the worst possible time, given the condition of the state," said George Christian, an Austin lobbyist, "and she has not tried to shake everything up from top to bottom because that could have been a disaster for her."
 
Some Unfinished Business
 Appointing women and members of minorities to state jobs has been one of Governor Richards's major preoccupations. She has also pressed for legislation tightening the regulation of the insurance industry and the disposal of hazardous waste, and she has joined other politicians in promoting a new government ethics law. So far, however, none of her major legislative projects have been enacted.
"Her strategy seems to be to fire a few well-aimed rifle shots, not broadsides," said Mr. Christian, a former press secretary to President Lyndon B. Johnson. "Meanwhile, she is doing everything she can to prepare for the big crisis ahead."
In midsummer the Governor and the Legislature are planning to contend with a deficit last estimated at $4.6 billion in a two-year budget of about $53 billion. Unlike other states facing a temporary shortage of revenue because of the recession, the financial problems in Texas are more permanent.
For nearly a decade, low prices and declining production in the oil and gas industry have robbed the state of once-abundant revenue. At the same time, state and Federal courts have required Texas to increase spending on public schools, prisons, welfare and the care of the mentally ill.
After a briefing on the budget by fiscal experts early this year, Gib Lewis, the Speaker of the State House of Representatives, said, "I move we recess and go throw up somewhere."
A reaction of that sort has become a common sentiment among Texas politicians. But Governor Richards, who often seems to be grinning under her crown of white hair, is an exception.
"We look at this mess and we see all the valuable things we can do with it," said Mary Beth Rogers, the Governor's chief of staff. "Actually, this is a wonderful time to be an activist Governor of Texas."
So far, Ms. Richards has made only one foray into fiscal matters, and it failed when her proposal for a state lottery was rejected by the Legislature. Otherwise, she has postponed any action on the budget, insisting that all decisions on financial policy should wait until a special legislative session she plans to call sometime after July 1.
On that date she is scheduled to receive a special audit of state agencies that is intended to show how up to $1 billion can be saved by streamlining the state government and eliminating waste. On the same day a special commission headed by former Gov. John B. Connally is supposed to report on alternatives for raising new revenue.
But the options are limited. Texas is one of only five states with neither a personal nor a corporate income tax. Relying on sales and property taxes to make up for lost oil revenue has already driven those tax rates to some of the highest levels in the nation.
As a result Texas may have the most regressive tax structure in the United States. One recent study showed that a family of four earning $10,000 a year paid about 7.1 percent of its income in state and local taxes, while the rate for a family the same size earning $100,000 was about 4.4 percent.
Throughout the primary and general election campaigns last year, Ms. Richards shied from taking firm stands for or against changes in the tax structure, much to the frustration of her opponents. She has been equally elusive since her inauguration, but her reticence matters less now because others have taken the lead on the tax issue.
 
A Redefined Political Agenda
 Three weeks ago Lieut. Gov. Bob Bullock, a Democrat, presented a plan calling for corporate and personal income taxes while reducing sales and property taxes. The plan instantly redefined the state's political agenda, and not only because Mr. Bullock, as chief officer of the State Senate, holds a powerful post in the state government.
"The tax question can be resolved, but only with a massive town meeting at which Texans decide who they are and what they want to be," said George Shipley, a Democratic political consultant and lobbyist.
"Bullock can put the deal together on the inside, but Ann is the one who is going to have to close the sale by going to the public," he said, referring to the Governor by her first name, a practice commonly used by her friends and foes alike.
As she bides her time and guards her options, Ms. Richards has taken a position on the importance of the issue, but not on how to resolve it.
Earlier this month she told the Connally committee: "We cling to the pretense that we are living in the 1940's with the lowest fees, the lowest taxes and the best business climate. As we prepare to enter the 21st century, we can no longer trade in pretense and myth."
So far she has given no signs of whether she is willing to join forces with Mr. Bullock, who is both a political ally and a rival. But Ms. Rogers, the Governor's chief of staff, said, "People are all assuming that its an income tax or nothing, and I am not sure we are there yet."

HEADLINE: High Medical Costs Hurt Growing Numbers in U.S.

SERIES: The Price of Health/First of five articles.

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Long a gnawing worry of the poor, medical expenses and health insurance are now a source of mounting anxiety for millions of middle-class Americans -- healthy or sick, insured or not.
 For a growing number of people, insurance status has become the pivotal factor in important personal decisions, trapping some people in jobs they do not want and forcing others to forgo needed medical care. 
One spreading phenomenon is known as "job-lock" -- fear of changing jobs because of a medical history that, in today's more stringent insurance market, would probably prevent a worker's acceptance by a new health plan. Cancer patients or those with chronic diseases are most vulnerable.
 Anna Wu Work, a 36-year-old molecular biologist, says it is only her health coverage that keeps her working full time as a researcher at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, Calif., when she would rather spend more time with her daughters, Elizabeth, 4, and Kelsey, almost 1. She is afraid to leave her job or ask for part-time work, because she was treated for an early stage of breast cancer three years ago, and needs health insurance in the unlikely event of a recurrence.
 
Shaping the Health System
 "It's a special time," Dr. Work said, "and I want to be with my children, especially since I know I might not be there forever. But the one thing I can't do now is quit, because I have insurance here and I'm uninsurable if I leave."
 Most Americans still have health insurance. But as the nation's medical costs soar, more and more people are being squeezed financially or abandoned altogether by insurers. Their fears, and the vaguer disquiet of many well-insured people who see awesomely high bills for common medical procedures, are becoming important new forces for change in the nation's health system.
 "We've gotten to the point where everybody is scared," said Robert J. Blendon, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who is an expert on public opinion and health policy. "Everyone has heard these terrible stories about some middle-class working person they can identify with who had no insurance and got into an awful situation."
 
One Nightmarish Story
 If concerns about health insurance are an emerging obsession for America's middle class, it is stories like Brent McRae's that shape the worst nightmares.
 Mr. McRae was 27 years old and only two months into the new sales job that made him move to California from Texas in 1988 when he began to lose weight and feel ill. After five weeks of testing and finally surgery, he was found to have colon cancer.
 The bills were more than $100,000. But after his release from the hospital, he found out that the insurance he was still paying for through his former employer in Texas had been canceled because the employer had not sent his premiums to the insurer.
 "To this day, I have no idea who kept the premiums," Mr. McRae said, "but that was just the beginning."
 During his time in the hospital, Mr. McRae passed his new employer's 90-day waiting period and became eligible under the company's insurance for coverage of the six months of chemotherapy that he faced, at $700 a week -- or so he thought.
 "Five weeks into the chemotherapy," Mr. McRae said, "with a catheter imbedded in my chest, I walk into my oncologist's office, and he sits me down, puts his hand on my knee and tells me there's been no payment because John Hancock is denying coverage, saying the cancer was a pre-existing condition, even though it hadn't been diagnosed when the coverage began. Then he said he could no longer bankroll my treatment."
 Mr. McRae went without chemotherapy until he got new insurance, and last year had further surgery because the cancer had spread to a new part of the colon.
 "At one point in the middle of the whole thing, I hit bottom, between having cancer and being told I had no insurance, and I tried to commit suicide," he said.
 But his story has a happy ending: for the last year he has been cancer-free, and last month, in an out-of-court settlement, the former employer and the two insurance companies paid his medical debts and legal fees.
 
The Uninsured: Overview

 33 Million Lack Basic Protection
 Most Americans still have health insurance coverage, either through their jobs or, if they are elderly or poor, through Medicare or Medicaid.
 But some 33 million Americans, 13 percent of the population, most of them lower-income workers or their families, live without this basic necessity of modern American life. And tens of millions more have such limited policies that they are at risk of financial devastation.
 Even those numbers underestimate how many people are at risk and the scale of public insecurity. In a recent 28-month period, a Census Bureau study found that more than one in four Americans went at least a month without coverage. The proportion was higher still among black and Hispanic Americans.
 Dr. Blendon said several polls have shown that most Americans worry about their insurance coverage, especially in the future.
 "If you ask people about their coverage, 30 percent say they're not sure their current insurance would cover a major bill, but if you ask about the future, 60 percent say they're not confident about their insurance," Dr. Blendon said. "Insurance costs are doubling every seven years, and what employers are doing to contain costs, principally, is cutting back benefits. Working people are already paying more for less coverage, and they know that in the next negotiation, the company will take back more benefits."
 The American health insurance system is based primarily on group coverage provided by employers. But as the costs of insurance policies have risen, to keep pace with medical bills, employers have tried to shift more of the burden to employees, forcing them to pay larger deductibles, higher co-payments and in many cases an ever-larger portion of their own premiums.
 And an increasing number of working families work for companies that offer no health insurance at all. Small businesses and service businesses are especially likely to not provide insurance, and even large companies are hiring more part-time and per-day workers who are not eligible for benefits like insurance.
 "Our health insurance system is based on the idea that employers provide insurance, but more than three out of four uninsured Americans are either workers or dependents of workers," said Nancy Barrand, a senior program officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of Princeton, N.J.
 Insurers, faced with the ever-higher costs of medical technology, are trying to limit their risks by seeking to exclude people most likely to need expensive medical care. In the process they are undermining the very notion of insurance as a strategy for spreading risk.
 Insurance fears press especially hard on those who have already suffered a serious health problem like cancer or a heart attack and find themselves unable to get any insurance to cover the condition. Cancer patients, even those who have long been free of the disease, may face waiting periods as long as 20 years after applying before their insurance will cover a recurrence. Other people who are deemed health risks may be forced to consider policies with deductibles as high as $20,000.
 
The Part-Time Worker

 Staying Healthy Is a Daily Worry
 Maintaining adequate health insurance has become a worry even for many workers who have never spent a day in a hospital and have always taken for granted that health insurance would be there, free, as a fringe benefit of their employment.
 Hope Chasin, 44, says she never thought twice about insurance in all the years it came with her job, but now that she works on a per-day basis at a New York record company and has no employer-paid benefits, she is obsessed with the topic.
 "Not a day goes by that I don't worry about insurance," Ms. Chasin said. "When I start thinking about it in any way, shape or form, I get too scared. It seems very bleak. I'm saving my money for a mammogram, and this sounds ridiculous, but I'm praying, please, let me not need root canal work right now."'
 Ms. Chasin, who earns less than $25,000 a year, said she researched every possible insurance policy for which she was eligible when her former job at Time-Life Inc. was moved to Cincinnati.
 But the comprehensive coverage she wanted cost about $2,500 a year, more than she could afford, so she bought only a Blue Cross-Blue Shield hospitalization plan, for which she pays $250 a quarter and which does not pay any of her regular doctor bills.
 That was the approach most families used to take, until the advent of employer-paid health insurance in the 1950's.
 But the affordable hospitalization insurance that used to provide genuine protection to so many families is not much of a buffer against the price of medical care these days, when bills for one visit to a specialist's office, together with fees for tests and procedures, can be many hundreds of dollars.
 Even as the insurance system's gaps widen, the medical system's prices all but assume that an insurer is paying bills. And Ms. Chasin, who says she cannot afford to see a specialist about a pain in her arm that has bothered her for months, knows it.
 "As you get older, you realize all the things that can happen, that tomorrow morning you could wake up with some serious illness and enormous medical bills," she said. "I never thought I'd be in this situation, and now that I am, I'm noticing how many of the people around me have no insurance at all. I'm also noticing that whenever I talk about it, people get all heated up."
 
The Single Mother

 No Coverage for the Children
 Dr. Blendon and most other experts believe that the number of uninsured workers is likely to continue rising.
 "The small businesses that are the fastest growing part of the economy universally don't offer fringe benefits," he said. "So you leave your job at Apple and go work for Apple Lookalike, and you lose your insurance."
 Medicaid provides insurance for the poorest families, but covers less than half of those below the poverty line nationwide. In all but a handful of states, a family of three must have a yearly income less than $7,000 to qualify for the state-Federal program. (Pregnant women, infants and those with special medical needs can often qualify for Medicaid with a somewhat higher income.)
 Children are especially likely to be uninsured. Indeed, about half of all uninsured Americans are under 25, and about a third are under 18.
 "In the same period that the number of uninsured over all rose 24 percent, it was 40 percent for kids, almost all among working families," Dr. Blendon said.
 Dana Van Putten, a New York theatrical wardrobe worker, is insured through her union. But her month-old son, David, and her 5-year-old daughter, Dina, have no coverage at all because Ms. Van Putten, a single mother, cannot afford the extra $400 a month it would cost to convert to a family policy.
 Ms. Van Putten, 30, who is diabetic and had a difficult pregnancy, has been living on a $280-a-week unemployment check since January. She says she has been worried about insurance ever since she found out in November that her union coverage would not pay for the baby's hospital costs.
 David's bills turned out to be particularly steep, because he was in intensive care for five days.
 "I just got the bill, which was $16,195, and I clutched my hand on my heart when I saw it," Ms. Van Putten said. "I'll never get that paid off, and I'll never be able to save money to buy a house. What are you supposed to do, go bankrupt?"
 
The Job-Locked

 Insurance Governs Career Choices
 The rising number of uninsured families sends ripples through the health-care system.
 "As the number of uninsured people goes up," Ms. Barrand said, "it affects everybody else because people without coverage still need health care, so they go to the hospital and end up getting uncompensated care, which forces the hospital to shift those costs onto those who have coverage."
 In a telephone poll of 1,005 adults nationwide last December, more than 15 percent of those contacted said they or a family member had changed jobs or remained in a job because of health benefits. (The poll, conducted by International Communications Research for The Associated Press, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.)
 Workers with a history of cancer, diabetes or heart disease, or those whose spouses or children need expensive longterm treatment, often find themselves locked into job and insurance they had when the medical condition began because any new insurer will reject coverage for a pre-existing condition, either for several years or indefinitely.
 Counselors at cancer support groups tell of a Hollywood executive who turned down a tantalizing job at another studio without telling his wife, who had cancer, after he realized that the insurance at the new job would not cover her treatment.
 Similarly, a New York social worker recounts the story of an unhappy corporate vice president who raised capital for a new venture of his own, but gave it up after realizing that he could not get insurance to cover his 4-year-old son's treatment for a heart defect.
 And Dr. Work, the California researcher afraid to leave her job at the City of Hope, originally thought she could get around the insurance issue by getting coverage under the policy covering her husband, a cardiologist who joined a private group practice after her cancer treatment. When he joined the practice, the group policy covered cancer recurrence costs two years after the original cancer treatment ended. But when the two years was up, and they applied, Dr. Work and her husband found that it had been extended to five years.
 "I did everything right, I found the lump early, I had it taken care of, but I'm still being penalized," Dr. Work said. "Insurance is supposed to about sharing the risk, but nobody wants to share with the people who need sharing with."
 
The Job-Seeking

 When Past Ills Get in the Way
 Others with a history of medical problems find that insurance concerns make it difficult to find employment.
 Betty Moore, 60, of Alpharetta, Ga., said she was unable to find a job in 1970 after her first round of heart surgery to replace a valve weakened years earlier by rheumatic fever.
 "Everybody said they couldn't put me on their insurance because of my record and they said I couldn't work without insurance, so I finally got a small business loan and bought a florist shop," she said.
 At the time, Mrs. Moore was still covered under the insurance policy provided by her husband's job at the Lockheed Corporation, which paid for a second round of heart surgery in 1979.
 But when Mr. Moore left the job because of a disability, Mrs. Moore was left without insurance and the medical debts began to pile up.
 "We have $1,000 on the credit card from when I had to go to the hospital for a kidney problem for 11 days, and we're paying that off by the month," Mrs. Moore said. "We owe our doctor $1,600, and I still owe $400 from when I fell off a ladder in November. And then my husband owes some, too. We've gotten so far behind on the doctor bills, it's going to be a while to get caught up."
 After calling 10 insurance companies, Mrs. Moore finally found a $179-a-month policy for herself last November, but it will not pay for any heart-related problems for the first year.
 So Mrs. Moore is hoping with a quiet desperation that she will not need further heart surgery any time soon.
 "It can happen any time that a hole in the valve gets too big and it has to be fixed," she said. "I'm just hoping that it doesn't get bad soon. I don't know what would happen if it does. You can't be sure there will be a surgeon who will take you if you can't pay."
 Mrs. Moore said she would not really rest easy until she reached 65 and the safe harbor of Medicare.
 
The Family

 Juggling Ailments and the Bills
 But it does not take the threat of heart surgery to worry the uninsured. Even minor illnesses or injuries can pose huge problems.
 Last month, when William Price hurt his ankle playing basketball, he and his wife, Paula, went through the informal process of family triage that is becoming all too common in their Mebane, N.C., household.
 The Prices have no health insurance for themselves and their two sons because Mr. Price is self-employed and they have decided they cannot afford the available policies. So with each new medical problem, they juggle their priorities and their budget. Over the winter, they spent $35 or $40 every two weeks for their son Ben, 7, to see a doctor about his allergies.
 More recently, the Prices had to decide whether it was more pressing to take Ben to the dentist to get a cavity filled, to get Mrs. Price an ultrasound scan that might help diagnose her abdominal pains and fertility problems, or, as they decided after overnight ice packs left Mr. Price still unable to walk, to get an X-ray of the hurt ankle.
 "My wife said I had to see a doctor, so we tried to figure out whether it would be cheaper to go to the doctor, and pay $50 right away, and then probably get sent to the hospital for an X-ray, and have to pay another bill, or just to go to the emergency room and do it all in one visit," Mr. Price said. "That's what I did, and I think it was the cheapest alternative, but the bill was $140."
 The Prices already have more than $1,000 in medical debt to pay off, but their real worry is how they could afford treatment for an emergency. Indeed, concern about being uninsured caused a good part of Mr. Price's hesitation earlier this year, when he left the job he had held for five years and went out on his own selling satellite dishes.
 "I really wanted insurance in case something major happened," Mr. Price said. "I looked into buying my own insurance a while ago, but it was $350 a month for a family, and that's more than we can manage. I'm hoping that the place where my wife works will get a group policy, which they're trying to do. Until then, we just have to hope the family stays healthy."

"THE AILING HEALTH SYSTEM: A QUESTION OF ACCESS ..."
Two issues, access and cost, dominate the debate over America's health care system.
Most Americans have health insurance and receive excellent care. Except among the poor, expecially in inner cities, Americans are healthier than ever.
All the elderly are covered by Medicare but less than half of those living below the poverty line are insured by Medicaid. Yet about 33 million people live without the basic security of health insurance, and tens of millions more have inadequate coverage.
Contrary to popular belief, most of the uninsured are jobholders or their family members - the working poor.
Insurance rates have climbed faster for small businesses than large ones, and more companies, especially those that are small or have many low-wage employees, do not offer health benefits.
Whether employed or not, young people, and black and Hispanic people, are most likely to lack health insurance. Also, more Americans with chronic diseases or a history of serious illness are having trouble obtaining affordable insurance.
Figures on the number of uninsured people understate the extent of vulnerability; over a recent 28-month period, one in four Americans spent at least a month without health insurance.
In polls, most Americans say they are generally pleased with their doctors and hospitals. But there is widespread anxiety about the future of health insurance, especially as the price of medical care continues to soar.
"How Americans Are Covered," shows a breakdown of Americans' primary source of health insurance in 1989 (Source: Department of Health and Human Services); "An Index of Insecurity, tracks Americans' health insurance status -- no coverage, covered for 1-27 months, covered for all 28 months -- over a period of 28 months, with a breakdown white, black and hispanic as well as overall total, from a Census Bureau study that ended August 1987; "The Uninsured": "By Age," tracks those uninsured by age -- under 16, 16-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and over 65 -- monthly average for last quarter of 1988; "By Race," shows percentage of uninsured people by race: Hispanic: 26.5%, Black: 20.2% and White: 11.7%, as a monthly average for last quarter of 1988; "By Job Status," shows a breakdown of employment status of the head of household, for 1988, excluding the elderly, indicating unemployed: 14.8%,employed part-time: 23.2% and employed full-time: 62.0% (Sources: Census Bureau, Employee Benefit Research Institute) (pg. 28)
"... AND SOARING COSTS"
Health care now absorbs 12 percent of national income, and the share continues to climb relentlessly. Many economists fear that if the trend is not checked, health spending will erode national prosperity.
The price of health is a direct and growing worry for Federal, state and local governments, which must devote a rising share of their strained budgets to paying for health care. More than 40 percent of the nation's health bills are now covered by government programs.
Concern about cost is also mounting among companies and workers, which face steeply rising health insurance premiums that can eat into profits and wages.
Among the causes of the rise: unchecked use of ever more expensive technologies and a system that gives neither doctors nor patients much incentive to control cost, since insurers are paying the bills.
Graphs: "Who Pays the Bills..." tracks expenditures on health care -- private: $350.8 billion: 58% (individual out-of-pocket: 21%, private health insurance: 33%), Government: $253.3 billion: 42% (Federal: 29%, State, local: 13%); "...

HEADLINE: Why a Dance-World Veteran Decided to Pack It All In

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
THE STUDIO HAD GROWN PROgressively barer over the past few weeks. One day a giddy display case of worn toe shoes and performance photographs hung on the wall. A few days later it was gone. So were a bushy green plant and one packing box. And now the studio is closed and empty.
 "Cartwheel on the Gangplank" was the name Senta Driver had given to a new piece performed last month, on a program that marked her farewell as a choreographer and the end of her 16-year-old dance troupe, Harry. But this departure was more a slow, inexorable trudge than a jaunty cartwheel. It has been even harder than she expected. 
 "The thing is I love dance very much," Ms. Driver said in a recent interview in her studio in the SoHo section of Manhattan., tucked into a battered couch at the edge of the dance floor that she had stained to look like earth. "It's awful to leave it. I'm not sure if people know -- this was not voluntary. It wasn't a choice."
 Ms. Driver, 48, is one of the most imposing figures on the modern dance scene today. Both her manner and her dances are threaded through with a steely, vein of intelligence and tenacity -- qualities that have brought her both praise and controversy. But there were moments during the conversation when her eyes suddenly welled up with tears.
 Ms. Driver had been through bad times before, with financial crises occurring about every three years. But things never got so bad that she thought seriously about retiring. Now, she has decided to become a nurse, working with the critically ill newborn babies she has cared for during four years as a volunteer at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.
 Ms. Driver came to the decision to leave dance chiefly because of financial problems. But she is also fearful about the immediate future for artists in this country. In the past year or so, a number of major American dance companies have faced serious financial problems, among them American Ballet Theater, the Dance Theater of Harlem, the Martha Graham Dance Company, the Joffrey Ballet and the Pennsylvania Ballet. Smaller troupes have suffered similarly. But Ms. Driver is one of the last choreographers who might have been expected to leave modern dance. A woman of fierce intellect and passion about her work and the world around her, she made dances that authoritatively probed ideas about dance and the human body, yet were filled with a futsy physicality. "Senta Driver's choreography is both analytical and intensely physical," Anna Kisselgoff, senior dance critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1985. "One wonders how two such disparate aspects can be fused so creatively and brilliantly.
 "The hallmark of a Driver dance is its striking originality -- in the shapes and rhythms produced by moving bodies." the review continued. "Inescapably, the conclusion is that this result stems from the very marriage of Ms. Driver's cerebral approach to virtuosity requiring huge amounts of stamina and skill."
 It also required formidable concentration, according to Jeffrey Gribler, a principal dancer with the Pennsylvania Ballet who starred in Ms. Driver's 1981 "Resettings," a dance based on the August Bournonville classic "La Sylphide."
 "She stretched and modified and altered ballet technique," he said. "It was fascinating. The exercises on point were done in bare feet. Women lifted men. I found it an incredibly challenging and interesting experience.
 "There was some resistance from the dancers. She persevered. I think she expected resistance. She was patient. We had many, many sit-down rehearsals with discussions, and not just about the piece but about how we felt, why it was odd for us and important for her." Two years later, Mr. Gribler found himself dancing the lead in "La Sylphide."
 "I thought a lot about what I did with Senta," he recalled. "I think it helped me experience the character."
 Persistence was a hallmark of Ms. Driver's career. For over two decades, she had worked steadily, first as a performer with the Paul Taylor Dance Company for six years and then as the founder and director of Harry, generally considered one of the best managed companies in the field. She had named the company after Princess Mud of England, nicknamed Harry because she was courageous as a child. The company lived up to that premise of innate gutsiness, filled with dancers chosen for their "warmth, great hearts and valor," as Ms. Driver put it.
 As a consultant to the New York State Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts and as an official of Dance/USA, a national service organization, she was able to view dance from an unusually wide perspective. Over the years, she had performed in major theaters and dance festivals in 25 states and in Germany and Austria.
 But last June, Ms. Driver decided that it was time to end her artistic career. There were no bookings for the following 12 months. Though Harry's $200,000 annual budget was met by a strong mix of earned income and support from foundations, corporations and the Government, the company experienced a steady drop in public and private support since the mid-1980's. At the sametime, the demise of the National Endowment's Dance Touring Program made it harder to get engagements.
 One of Ms. Driver's best and most cherished dancers, Randy Wickstrom, was dying of AIDS. As bookings dwindled, other favorite dancers left the company, as did Dominick Balletta, the manager who had helped make 1989 one of the best years in Harry's history. Ms. Driver was increasingly alone.
 Suddenly, her work and her company seemed not to meet any of the increasingly complex, sometimes peculiar and contradictory demands of dance producers around the country. Ms. Driver had begun dipping into personal savings to buy time.
 "I found the idea of stopping so terrifying I couldn't face it," she recalled. "But that was the money I lived on." The money she would have needed to continue for another year -- about $50,000 -- was not really so much. But it simply was not forthcoming.
 "In dance, you always think if you just stay in business a little bit longer something will happen," Ms. Driver said. "You're always living on the edge of saying goodbye. Something always tears down what you're building. Something always takes away from what you need to be building. In the same mail that brings you the prize comes the crisis. But you get kind of used to all the routine miseries. If Dominick can't pull this off, I'd think, we'll find a way. And then there was no way."
 
Starting Out: The Dance Bug Bit in College
 Senta Driver grew up in Greenwich, Conn., and suburban Boston, in a middle-class family whose love of music was its only involvement in the arts. She had expected to become a historian. Then, in college, she discovered dance. Compactly built and never particularly good at sports, she fit into no popular stereotypes of a dancer. But a friend got her interested in the field, and at 18 she "got the bug." "I fought it off," she said. "Then I saw Paul's work at Connecticut College. It was an electrifying shock to my body. It was beautiful. And I wanted to do it. It was like discovering the sensation of taste."
 A Latin and philosophy major at Bryn Mawr, she often thought of quitting college to dance. "And then I graduated," Ms. Driver said. "It felt like a defeat." She went on to study dance at Ohio State University, obtaining a master's degree in physical education in 1966, then headed for New York City to absorb all she could of Mr. Taylor's teaching and choreography.
 Some critics felt that she made a mark on the Taylor dances she performed, as an implacable presence with a distinctive blend of detachment and feeling. But Mr. Taylor, who describes her in his autobiography, "Private Domain," as a determined rebel resisted what she terms her "fearsome devotion" to his work. By the time she decided to leave the Taylor company, in 1973, there was a distance between them.
 "When I left, he said to me: 'You're not going to be a choreographer. You're not going to even try.' I told him that he was certainly entitled to wait and see."
 That granite obduracy might be attributed to her New England upbringing. Ms. Driver talked of the influence of summers spent with her parents and four siblings on Naushon Island, off Cape Cod, a sheep farm owned by family friends. "It shaped my thinking, heavily." she said. "Something about plain work, hard work. You do it. You harness the horse. You learn competence."
 She had quit the Taylor company because she felt underutilized as a dancer. "I left to do my own work. I spent about six months working alone, trying to figure out what was not being done. Trying to get Paul's work out of my bones. The first thing I did was to walk around the room. Talk to myself. I made a rule not to sleep. I was reading dance history. I began to say the names I'd read. I had myself coached in accents."
 Out of these first experiments came one of Ms. Driver's most resonant dances, "Memorandum," a signature work created in 1975, in which the performer circles the room, calling out the names of great ballerinas of the past. She soon discovered the concept of movement along a diagonal and began the fascination with body mass and weight and their manipulation that would become a hallmark of her choreography.
 "I decided I would be strong enough if I trained myself to carry my 6-year-old nephew on my back," she said. "He had a look as if he were thinking about something unusual. He rode around strapped to me in a harness, his hands folded, doing his multiplication tables in his head so he had something to think about." The result was "Melodrama."
 Gradually, Ms. Driver developed a group of dances that she once descibed as portraits of herself thinking -- about traditional gender roles, about who partners whom in dance, and about how dance can be made to be seen from more than one direction.
 Despite her reputation for creating mostly "quirky" and "cerebral" dances -- terms that Ms. Driver loathes -- the pieces she feels to be key works have dealt with a variety of themes. Death and mourning were examined in "Missing Persons." Courtship was examined cheerfuly in "Avner, Rena, Bud and Roxie, Lillian and Sam." In "Video 5000" Ms. Driver played with filmed and live figures.
 
Daunting Issues: AIDS Began To Take Its Toll
 Ms. Driver is haunted by a sense that issues she raised in dance were never seriously addressed by reviewers. "My work is very controversial, including whether I should do it at all," she said, noting that a critic once described one of her pieces as resembling hippopotamuses wallowing in mud. What, she wonders, would those who never saw her work make of it based on such reviews? Will she have any place in the history dance?
 There were other concerns. Looking for strong, large dancers with "a great heart and moral presence and courage" for her five-member company, Ms. Driver increasingly began to find young performers demoralized by their drive to "do it the right way" rather than take the kinds of physical and emotional risks she demanded. She saw more and more fine dancers dying of AIDS. 'I lost a whole future with Randy." she said of Mr. Wickstrom, who died in October at age 38. "Where we would have gone, I can't go." She pointed to the spot on the studio floor where Mr. Wickstrom, trained as a gymnast, taught her new ways of moving. "My studio has a human presence," she said. "It's like a wonderful person, a sturdy person I could sit here and feel my history on the walls."
 
The Arts in a Bind: Problems Are Not Hers Alone
 But most troubling to Ms. Driver is her sense that the problems she faced are not hers alone. And the difficulties dance faces today do not spring, she believes, from a lack of public appreciation for the art.
 "There are smaller audiences and harder times. But I think dance has actually moved into the fabric of the culture in a lot of ways we don't realize. What's less popular is live performing. Not dance. People still want to see dance. They're taking aerobics all day long from the peole who urged to dance."
 Still, in an age of easily accessible home video entertainment, she added, audiences want to see performances when and where it is most convenient.
 Ms. Driver is troubled, she said, by what she sees as a drastic narrowing of both support and expectations among producers of dance and those who give money to it. "General support is eroding," she said, adding that there is growing interest in supporting or commissioning specific works rather than the day-to-day operations of a company. "The funding of projects is emphasized. I think it becomes a way to sift through the overload of applicants. But a great number of restrictions have all come together. Presenters say, 'I really like you, but the dance is too long or too short. Your budget is too small or too big. You're too old to be "emerging." You're not multicultural enough."
 "Even dealing with the good presenters who do give you commissions is daunting. One told me I had too many dancers and that there wasn't enough room for the audience. There were so many reasons I couldn't have a booking, a grant, a this or a that, that eventually I had to stop.
 "There is a strong tendency, among enemies and friends, to tell the artist in all kinds of ways to stop doing what they want to do and do something different. It won't work. If Lucinda Childs says she needs mice, then get her the money to get mice."
 Ms. Driver said that she is frightened by proposed cuts in the budget of the New York State Council on the Arts, which would reduce it by $24.8 million to $21.9 million, and what she sees as the continuing dismantling of the National Endowment for the Arts. "Forget what's happening to me," she said. "You're going to see a devastating sweep if the state cuts go through.
 "All the state councils are going down. They're all in trouble. But when New York's goes down, it will take with it a very large proportion of all kinds of artists who came here to work." And it is hard, she conceded, to lobby to save arts support, knowing that the money might come from allotments designed to deal with social problems like homelessness.
 "We're being forced into the image of these people who use the money for the homeless to create art that will frighten and offend. I have found it tremendously discouraging to see how artists are hated by the general population."
 Ms. Driver sees the recent controversey over pornography and Federal financing of the arts as indications of this feeling.
 "The artists have no friends any more, except each other," she said. "I'm not saying we can't do it without riches. People keep starting out. Choreographers will always most intimately rely on the allegiance of dancers."
 But in the end, the cumulative weight of it all became too much for Ms. Driver.
 "I would have taken any punishment to stay in this field," she said. "I had valuable help. I had some resources. I could take the punishment. I hung on until all fingers were gone. If you can stop me, then there's some real trouble."

HEADLINE: Why a Dance-World Veteran Decided to Pack It All In

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
THE STUDIO HAD GROWN PROgressively barer over the past few weeks. One day a giddy display case of worn toe shoes and performance photographs hung on the wall. A few days later it was gone. So were a bushy green plant and one packing box. And now the studio is closed and empty.
 "Cartwheel on the Gangplank" was the name Senta Driver had given to a new piece performed last month, on a program that marked her farewell as a choreographer and the end of her 16-year-old dance troupe, Harry. But this departure was more a slow, inexorable trudge than a jaunty cartwheel. It has been even harder than she expected. 
 "The thing is I love dance very much," Ms. Driver said in a recent interview in her studio in the SoHo section of Manhattan., tucked into a battered couch at the edge of the dance floor that she had stained to look like earth. "It's awful to leave it. I'm not sure if people know -- this was not voluntary. It wasn't a choice."
 Ms. Driver, 48, is one of the most imposing figures on the modern dance scene today. Both her manner and her dances are threaded through with a steely, vein of intelligence and tenacity -- qualities that have brought her both praise and controversy. But there were moments during the conversation when her eyes suddenly welled up with tears.
 Ms. Driver had been through bad times before, with financial crises occurring about every three years. But things never got so bad that she thought seriously about retiring. Now, she has decided to become a nurse, working with the critically ill newborn babies she has cared for during four years as a volunteer at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.
 Ms. Driver came to the decision to leave dance chiefly because of financial problems. But she is also fearful about the immediate future for artists in this country. In the past year or so, a number of major American dance companies have faced serious financial problems, among them American Ballet Theater, the Dance Theater of Harlem, the Martha Graham Dance Company, the Joffrey Ballet and the Pennsylvania Ballet. Smaller troupes have suffered similarly. But Ms. Driver is one of the last choreographers who might have been expected to leave modern dance. A woman of fierce intellect and passion about her work and the world around her, she made dances that authoritatively probed ideas about dance and the human body, yet were filled with a futsy physicality. "Senta Driver's choreography is both analytical and intensely physical," Anna Kisselgoff, senior dance critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1985. "One wonders how two such disparate aspects can be fused so creatively and brilliantly.
 "The hallmark of a Driver dance is its striking originality -- in the shapes and rhythms produced by moving bodies." the review continued. "Inescapably, the conclusion is that this result stems from the very marriage of Ms. Driver's cerebral approach to virtuosity requiring huge amounts of stamina and skill."
 It also required formidable concentration, according to Jeffrey Gribler, a principal dancer with the Pennsylvania Ballet who starred in Ms. Driver's 1981 "Resettings," a dance based on the August Bournonville classic "La Sylphide."
 "She stretched and modified and altered ballet technique," he said. "It was fascinating. The exercises on point were done in bare feet. Women lifted men. I found it an incredibly challenging and interesting experience.
 "There was some resistance from the dancers. She persevered. I think she expected resistance. She was patient. We had many, many sit-down rehearsals with discussions, and not just about the piece but about how we felt, why it was odd for us and important for her." Two years later, Mr. Gribler found himself dancing the lead in "La Sylphide."
 "I thought a lot about what I did with Senta," he recalled. "I think it helped me experience the character."
 Persistence was a hallmark of Ms. Driver's career. For over two decades, she had worked steadily, first as a performer with the Paul Taylor Dance Company for six years and then as the founder and director of Harry, generally considered one of the best managed companies in the field. She had named the company after Princess Mud of England, nicknamed Harry because she was courageous as a child. The company lived up to that premise of innate gutsiness, filled with dancers chosen for their "warmth, great hearts and valor," as Ms. Driver put it.
 As a consultant to the New York State Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts and as an official of Dance/USA, a national service organization, she was able to view dance from an unusually wide perspective. Over the years, she had performed in major theaters and dance festivals in 25 states and in Germany and Austria.
 But last June, Ms. Driver decided that it was time to end her artistic career. There were no bookings for the following 12 months. Though Harry's $200,000 annual budget was met by a strong mix of earned income and support from foundations, corporations and the Government, the company experienced a steady drop in public and private support since the mid-1980's. At the sametime, the demise of the National Endowment's Dance Touring Program made it harder to get engagements.
 One of Ms. Driver's best and most cherished dancers, Randy Wickstrom, was dying of AIDS. As bookings dwindled, other favorite dancers left the company, as did Dominick Balletta, the manager who had helped make 1989 one of the best years in Harry's history. Ms. Driver was increasingly alone.
 Suddenly, her work and her company seemed not to meet any of the increasingly complex, sometimes peculiar and contradictory demands of dance producers around the country. Ms. Driver had begun dipping into personal savings to buy time.
 "I found the idea of stopping so terrifying I couldn't face it," she recalled. "But that was the money I lived on." The money she would have needed to continue for another year -- about $50,000 -- was not really so much. But it simply was not forthcoming.
 "In dance, you always think if you just stay in business a little bit longer something will happen," Ms. Driver said. "You're always living on the edge of saying goodbye. Something always tears down what you're building. Something always takes away from what you need to be building. In the same mail that brings you the prize comes the crisis. But you get kind of used to all the routine miseries. If Dominick can't pull this off, I'd think, we'll find a way. And then there was no way."
 
Starting Out: The Dance Bug Bit in College
 Senta Driver grew up in Greenwich, Conn., and suburban Boston, in a middle-class family whose love of music was its only involvement in the arts. She had expected to become a historian. Then, in college, she discovered dance. Compactly built and never particularly good at sports, she fit into no popular stereotypes of a dancer. But a friend got her interested in the field, and at 18 she "got the bug." "I fought it off," she said. "Then I saw Paul's work at Connecticut College. It was an electrifying shock to my body. It was beautiful. And I wanted to do it. It was like discovering the sensation of taste."
 A Latin and philosophy major at Bryn Mawr, she often thought of quitting college to dance. "And then I graduated," Ms. Driver said. "It felt like a defeat." She went on to study dance at Ohio State University, obtaining a master's degree in physical education in 1966, then headed for New York City to absorb all she could of Mr. Taylor's teaching and choreography.
 Some critics felt that she made a mark on the Taylor dances she performed, as an implacable presence with a distinctive blend of detachment and feeling. But Mr. Taylor, who describes her in his autobiography, "Private Domain," as a determined rebel resisted what she terms her "fearsome devotion" to his work. By the time she decided to leave the Taylor company, in 1973, there was a distance between them.
 "When I left, he said to me: 'You're not going to be a choreographer. You're not going to even try.' I told him that he was certainly entitled to wait and see."
 That granite obduracy might be attributed to her New England upbringing. Ms. Driver talked of the influence of summers spent with her parents and four siblings on Naushon Island, off Cape Cod, a sheep farm owned by family friends. "It shaped my thinking, heavily." she said. "Something about plain work, hard work. You do it. You harness the horse. You learn competence."
 She had quit the Taylor company because she felt underutilized as a dancer. "I left to do my own work. I spent about six months working alone, trying to figure out what was not being done. Trying to get Paul's work out of my bones. The first thing I did was to walk around the room. Talk to myself. I made a rule not to sleep. I was reading dance history. I began to say the names I'd read. I had myself coached in accents."
 Out of these first experiments came one of Ms. Driver's most resonant dances, "Memorandum," a signature work created in 1975, in which the performer circles the room, calling out the names of great ballerinas of the past. She soon discovered the concept of movement along a diagonal and began the fascination with body mass and weight and their manipulation that would become a hallmark of her choreography.
 "I decided I would be strong enough if I trained myself to carry my 6-year-old nephew on my back," she said. "He had a look as if he were thinking about something unusual. He rode around strapped to me in a harness, his hands folded, doing his multiplication tables in his head so he had something to think about." The result was "Melodrama."
 Gradually, Ms. Driver developed a group of dances that she once descibed as portraits of herself thinking -- about traditional gender roles, about who partners whom in dance, and about how dance can be made to be seen from more than one direction.
 Despite her reputation for creating mostly "quirky" and "cerebral" dances -- terms that Ms. Driver loathes -- the pieces she feels to be key works have dealt with a variety of themes. Death and mourning were examined in "Missing Persons." Courtship was examined cheerfuly in "Avner, Rena, Bud and Roxie, Lillian and Sam." In "Video 5000" Ms. Driver played with filmed and live figures.
 
Daunting Issues: AIDS Began To Take Its Toll
 Ms. Driver is haunted by a sense that issues she raised in dance were never seriously addressed by reviewers. "My work is very controversial, including whether I should do it at all," she said, noting that a critic once described one of her pieces as resembling hippopotamuses wallowing in mud. What, she wonders, would those who never saw her work make of it based on such reviews? Will she have any place in the history dance?
 There were other concerns. Looking for strong, large dancers with "a great heart and moral presence and courage" for her five-member company, Ms. Driver increasingly began to find young performers demoralized by their drive to "do it the right way" rather than take the kinds of physical and emotional risks she demanded. She saw more and more fine dancers dying of AIDS. 'I lost a whole future with Randy." she said of Mr. Wickstrom, who died in October at age 38. "Where we would have gone, I can't go." She pointed to the spot on the studio floor where Mr. Wickstrom, trained as a gymnast, taught her new ways of moving. "My studio has a human presence," she said. "It's like a wonderful person, a sturdy person I could sit here and feel my history on the walls."
 
The Arts in a Bind: Problems Are Not Hers Alone
 But most troubling to Ms. Driver is her sense that the problems she faced are not hers alone. And the difficulties dance faces today do not spring, she believes, from a lack of public appreciation for the art.
 "There are smaller audiences and harder times. But I think dance has actually moved into the fabric of the culture in a lot of ways we don't realize. What's less popular is live performing. Not dance. People still want to see dance. They're taking aerobics all day long from the peole who urged to dance."
 Still, in an age of easily accessible home video entertainment, she added, audiences want to see performances when and where it is most convenient.
 Ms. Driver is troubled, she said, by what she sees as a drastic narrowing of both support and expectations among producers of dance and those who give money to it. "General support is eroding," she said, adding that there is growing interest in supporting or commissioning specific works rather than the day-to-day operations of a company. "The funding of projects is emphasized. I think it becomes a way to sift through the overload of applicants. But a great number of restrictions have all come together. Presenters say, 'I really like you, but the dance is too long or too short. Your budget is too small or too big. You're too old to be "emerging." You're not multicultural enough."
 "Even dealing with the good presenters who do give you commissions is daunting. One told me I had too many dancers and that there wasn't enough room for the audience. There were so many reasons I couldn't have a booking, a grant, a this or a that, that eventually I had to stop.
 "There is a strong tendency, among enemies and friends, to tell the artist in all kinds of ways to stop doing what they want to do and do something different. It won't work. If Lucinda Childs says she needs mice, then get her the money to get mice."
 Ms. Driver said that she is frightened by proposed cuts in the budget of the New York State Council on the Arts, which would reduce it by $24.8 million to $21.9 million, and what she sees as the continuing dismantling of the National Endowment for the Arts. "Forget what's happening to me," she said. "You're going to see a devastating sweep if the state cuts go through.
 "All the state councils are going down. They're all in trouble. But when New York's goes down, it will take with it a very large proportion of all kinds of artists who came here to work." And it is hard, she conceded, to lobby to save arts support, knowing that the money might come from allotments designed to deal with social problems like homelessness.
 "We're being forced into the image of these people who use the money for the homeless to create art that will frighten and offend. I have found it tremendously discouraging to see how artists are hated by the general population."

HEADLINE: Family Tends Neighbors' Heads and Hearts

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
ON a Saturday afternoon at Ashe's Barber Shop in New Haven, Chuck Ashe Jr. and his blue-smocked crew were clipping, trimming and shaving one head after another to the sound of popping soda cans and music from the movie "New Jack City." The most-requested styles included fades, slopes, boxes, twists and Gumbies, and Afros appeared to be making a comeback. Waiting time was about one hour.
"This is one of the few places these kids can go without someone approaching them to sell drugs," said Mr. Ashe, who stood with a hair pick in one hand and a razor in the other, sculpturing the hair of 18-year-old Terry McClain into a high fade and box cut. 
 "Take Terry here," the barber said, brushing the hair off the Mr. McClain's face. "Here's someone who's determined to bypass the system that has turned so many of our young people into barbarians."
Starting below the "No Smoking, Drinking or Cursing" sign, the queue of young customers curved along a mirrored wall covered with pictures of basketball stars and posters on teen-age pregnancy that advised, "Think Before You Act."
 
'Next Day, They're Gone'
 Large bay windows framed the scene on Shelton Avenue, where children danced on the sidewalk under a blue sky, and teen-age boys with fluorescent-colored sunglasses varoomed by on dirt bikes. A steady stream of cars pulled up to the curb to drop off or pick up customers.
Legendary for its social atmosphere, good music and trend-setting barbers who double as confidantes, Ashe's Barber Shop, is a rare safe haven for young people in a neighborhood rife with crime and unemployment, patrons said. Outside, drug dealers prowl for recruits and gunshots echo routinely through the streets. Inside, the barbers said, they try to persuade teen-agers not to succumb to the lure of fast money and instant status associated with the drug trade. Nevertheless, they admitted, it's an uphill battle.
"One day I'm standing here cutting their hair, and the next day, they're gone," said Mr. Ashe referring to at least 15 of his customers who have been shot and killed in drug-related incidents in the last couple of years.
"I got shot by an Uzi," said 16-year-old Darius Ferreria, who shimmied into the barber's chair and asked Mr. Ashe to give him a totally new look. "I was standing on a sidewalk, and the bullet went in one side of my thigh, then out the other. Clean through."
Three blocks down from Ashe's lies the infamous Mudhole, at the corner of Shelton Avenue and Hazel Street, a large sales outlet for drug dealers. The spread encompasses an empty lot on one side of the street and a windowless social club on the other that neighbors said was used for gambling.
 
Drugs Drive the Economy
 On this day, dozens of people, including many children and teen-agers, mingled freely on the corners. One local resident said a well-known denizen of the Mudhole was a young dealer who was shot and paralyzed a few years back and now sells drugs from his wheelchair.
Poverty and the lack of recreation or job opportunities has created an economy propelled by drug money, said Mr. Ashe, whose angry discourse on this topic easily rose above M. C. Hammer's rap lyrics.
"The lawyers, the politicians, the car dealers -- everybody's getting rich off the drug business except the black community," he said.
Behind a partition near the coffee maker, Audrey Ashe, the proprietor's sister, shaved a toothpick-thin V into Dexter Butler's left eyebrow. Her long fuchsia fingernails rested on the horizontal lines she had carved near his temple. The lines are called Kane parts, after Big Daddy Kane, a rapper, she said, and the shop was one of the first in the city to offer them.
Ashe's also set the trend for the designer signs that are shaved into the sides or backs of heads, Ms. Ashe said. Although their popularity has waned somewhat, she said, she and her colleagues get plenty of requests for Mercedes-Benz insignias, dollar signs and the silhouette of Michael Jackson.
Ms. Ashe said she much preferred working in barber shops to women's hair salons. "It's in my blood," she said. "It seems like I've been cutting hair all my life."
 
'True Success Story'
 Moments later, her father, Charles Ashe 3d, stepped through the front door for a brief visit. A tall distinguished man in a gray pinstripe suit, he owns a barber shop on Whalley Avenue that caters to older customers. As he stood next to his son, customers came up to shake his hand while small children wrapped their arms around his legs.
The elder Mr. Ashe began cutting hair 37 years ago at a place called Red's Barber Shop in New Haven, he said. He later taught all four of his children the craft. Two years after he started the shop on Shelton Avenue in 1981, he said, he turned it over to his children.
"The true success story is right here," Charles Ashe said, nodding to Chuck, who also owns a four-barber shop on Ferry Street. Charles Ashe's two other children, Eric and Karen, operate a barber shop on Kimberly Avenue.
"With four barber shops in the family, sibling rivalry is a plus," said Audrey Ashe. "The competition keeps us all on our toes."
Her father, who is also a Pentecostal minister, founded the First Pentecostal Church last year in a tidy concrete-block building two blocks from the Shelton Avenue shop. The opening of their church was a pivotal point for the family, he said.
For nearly 20 years, Charles Ashe lived with episodes of alcohol abuse and unemployment that threatened to destroy his family, he said, and the cycle repeated with his children, who also abused drugs.
 
Home From College
 "We, too, were products of our environment," said Chuck Ashe, the father of two young sons. "The thing that turned us around was discovering our spirituality, and that gave us an inner strength that enabled us to rise above the temptations in the streets."
The senior Mr. Ashe chatted with customers for a few more moments then headed back to his own shop as Lamont Young climbed into a chair. Mr. Young, a football player at a junior college in Massachusetts, was home for the weekend.
"If it weren't for sports, I'd be on the streets selling drugs," he told Chuck Ashe, who frowned and shook his head.
"This is another thing," Mr. Ashe said. "These colleges come into the community and take all of our best children. They spend the next four years filling their heads with dreams, teaching them how to shoot baskets or throw footballs, while the white children are learning how to run corporations. Then our kids come back to the community with no job skills, just shattered hopes. They come in here, look at me and say, 'Hey Chuck, where are all the jobs?' Before I know it, they're out there selling drugs."
Mr. Young asked for a box cut with Kane parts.
"That's not going to happen to me, Chuck," he said. "Football's O.K., but it's temporary. Academics come first." Mr. Ashe smiled.
 
Stop the Music
 Mr. Young, who is majoring in criminal justice, recalled that when he was a youngster, he often talked to Chuck Ashe about personal problems and school work. "Chuck probably knows more about my life than anybody," he said.
At 3 o'clock, the line of customers began to dwindle, and Darrell Barnes, one of the barbers, turned off the stereo, a signal that the shop was about to close. A young woman in a lime-green jumpsuit came in looking for her boyfriend. Wallace Coleman, a building contractor and old friend of the Ashes, brought his 11-year-old son, Jason, in for a haircut.
Mr. Coleman and Mr. Ashe talked about how cutbacks in the city's Parks and Recreation Department budget may affect the neighborhood's chances of organizing a Little League team this year.
"I bet the suburban kids don't have to worry about this," said Mr. Coleman.
Outside, street musicians gathered with bongos and began sounding a Caribbean beat. A half-moon of onlookers swelled around them. Others sat on the curb or leaned out windows. People drove by and waved and honked. Everybody seemed to know everybody.
That kind of community vitality cannot be duplicated in the suburbs, Mr. Ashe said, which is why he and his wife, Denise, a postal worker, decided to remain in the neighborhood. Resting his hands on the shoulder of one of his last customers, he paused and stared out the window.
"There's really two sides to this community," he said. "And it's this one, out there, that people tend to overlook.
"Like most people in this neighborhood, I'd like to see that inner beauty flourish. But to do that, we've got to make our young people understand that what they do today could haunt them for the rest of their lives. And that's one of the main things that Ashe's Barber Shop is all about -- changing those attitudes and changing those lives."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Nonstop Gaiety in 'Merry Widow'

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

DATELINE: MILLBURN

 BODY:
IF audiences crave excess and frivolity when the economy is in crisis, then the Paper Mill Playhouse production of "The Merry Widow" is just the flaming antidote for a current malaise that has been described as fiscal anemia.
In a new $1.4 million production that substitutes Broadway pizazz and generic vulgarism for old-style Viennese charm, Franz Lehar's infinitely melodious confection, circa 1905, survives a shamelessly campy and outrageously ornate going-over. It does so as heartily as it has outlived innumerable variations, from the ballet stage to the ice skating rink, not to mention several screen versions. And none of those were sparked by the ineffable Judy Kaye in the title role. 
 She plays the wealthy widow who is being wooed by every Frenchman in sight. But Marsovia, the mythical French-ruled kingdom where she lives, is in hock, and if her millions are spent in Paris, that's it for Marsovia. So the powers of Marsovia must be on the lookout for a local lover for the widow, and, for a touch of decadence, their wives divert the outsiders.
In Robert Johanson's adaptation, Marsovia, as in other English retellings, remains the name for the original Pontevedrinia, but the widow, Hanna, usually renamed Sonia, is still Hanna. No matter. Cafe Maxim's and the "girls, girls, girls, girls, girls" are, as ever, Lolo, Cloclo, Froufrou, Dodo and Joujou -- though they are unidentified in the Paper Mill program.
As adapter and director, Mr. Johanson takes an approach that uses a little from here, a little from there, but brings no originality or distinctiveness to any of it. A duet composed for a pair of secondary lovers (the unfaithful Valencienne and de Rosillion) has been transferred, most sensibly, to the primary ones (Hanna and Count Danilo, played by Richard White). A couple of vintage Lehar arias (from "Giuditta" and "The Land of Smiles") infiltrate the score, most agreeably, but then so does Offenbach in an all-out third-act cancan.
If Mr. Johanson's innovative powers were in line with the Paper Mill budget, what a fresh, entrancing, not just expensive "Merry Widow" this might have been. Instead, the crusty cliches of old-style operetta are supplanted by the cliches of old-hat musical comedy, with crass so-called comic relief thrown in.
For nonstop gaiety, every scene is a soiree. With cherubs, tassels and blue velvet curtains enframing the proscenium, Michael Anania's settings range from sumptuous to garish. Witness an elegant first-act embassy, with its revolving staircase; a gorgeous second-act villa, with a flower-filled garden and a revolving bridge, and a scarlet Maxim's in the third act, flanked by sequined lamps and backed by a gargantuan stained glass Art Nouveau disk that moves upward, landing overhead, as dancers in their swings descend.
In an enormous cast, those clandestine lovers, rapturously played and sung by Hallie Neill and Mark Janicello, have a more romantic thing going than the stars. Presumably because of an indisposition that caused him to miss several shows two weeks ago, Richard White's resplendent baritone sounded restrained -- more mellow than usual but unfailingly pleasing -- at the performance attended. His understudy, Joseph Mahowald, is scheduled to go on in all remaining matinees.
As Danilo, Mr. White is at his most ardent when he is dancing across the stage by himself. The Count, once in love with Hanna, is supposed to be resistant this time around, but here's a Danilo who appears so deliriously accustomed to his face that one imagines he is searching for its reflection when he gazes into Hanna's eyes. A clownish turn near the finale, when he blurts out the passion he has been holding in, hardly supports a performance so steeped in self-adulation.
It remains for Ms. Kaye's dramatic conviction to make us believe that Mr. White cares. Besides, she's a grand diva and a funny lady. It's hard to envision a more insouciant widow. The line "I'm just a simple country girl who married well" could have been written with Ms. Kaye's down-to-earth comic manner in mind.
Although the theater's overly zealous sound engineers may be imparting an unnecessary edge to the soprano's high register, her musicianship and phrasing are impeccable, and her rich middle voice and dark chest tones produce a heady effect.
If only the audience would refrain from applauding in the middle of her astonishing last note -- a meticulously shaded pianissimo that swells and softens sublimely -- in "Vilia," her second-act display pieces. The aria isn't over until it's over, folks.
When, finally, Ms. Kaye joins the dancers and negotiates a series of splits, each on a high C, in the can-can, you know that the search for a more complete musical performer is pointless. For all the vagaries of an overloaded production, it is Ms. Kaye who keeps the show rolling along, with her own sly perspective, and very merrily indeed.
"The Merry Widow" at the Paper Mill Playhouse, Brookside Drive in Millburn. Performances are Wednesday through Sunday at 8 P.M., Thursday at 2 P.M. and Saturday and Sunday at 3 P.M., through May 12. Box office: (201) 376-4343.

HEADLINE: NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Las Vegas;
Still Growing, But Not as Fast

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN SHARP

 BODY:
WHILE the influx of new residents continues to be strong in this casino city, the pace of new home sales and construction has faltered.
Candle Creek, a half-finished complex of 350 one-family homes beside a large grassy mesa, is one of many projects in the city's outskirts to feel the slowdown. 
 "Although we are still leading the country in terms of sales activity, it feels like we slammed on the brakes," is how Lawrence D. Canarelli, a Candle Creek official described the regional slowdown. "There's still tremendous growth, but it's not as brisk as it was last year." Mr. Canarelli is president of American West Development, the Las Vegas company that owns Candle Creek.
Across Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, new home sales in the first quarter of 1991 are running about a third below last year's, Mr. Canarelli said. Last year, new housing permits in the county were up 9 percent over 1989, to 27,100 one-family and multifamily units, he said.
Although 5,000 new residents a month still come in, housing permits are expected to slow substantially this year, said Keith Schwer, an economist with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Demand and supply are starting to meet after two years of brisk residential building.
Part of the slowdown results from a slower state economy. Job growth here, 9 percent last year, is projected to fall to 6 percent this year, according to the 1990 Las Vegas Perspective Survey by the University of Nevada at Las Vegas Center for Business and Economic Research.
More than 800,000 people live in Clark County, and its population is expected to reach 1 million by the year 2000, making Las Vegas one of the nation's fastest-growing cities.
But this rapid growth has strained the region's water supply, which has halted the approval of building permits. Las Vegas takes most of its water from the Colorado River system, which is already overallocated. The Las Vegas Valley Water District is considering tapping more water supplies from beneath the region's verdant valleys.
Candle Creek lies in such a valley in the Green Valley district, considered part of the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Houses in this affordable-housing project range in size from 2,000 to 3,600 square feet, with prices of $140,000 to $188,000.
Sales of existing one-family units were up 30 percent last year, to 3,500, and the median price in the county increased 7 percent, to $90,500.

HEADLINE: U.N. Needs a Supernational Supermanager

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Start the U.N. Search Now" (editorial, April 15) is a good analysis of the type of person the United Nations needs as the next Secretary General. 
 May I emphasize that the quality that will be most important in future Secretaries General is the ability to manage an organization that has developed over the last four-and-a-half decades into a maze of disparate elements, dominated by regional rivalries and virtually torn asunder by the polarization of the cold war.
A new world order is envisioned. East and West are no longer polarized but tend to cooperate with each other. The nonaligned are less and less relevant. The organization needs radical reform to deal with the emerging realities of the last decade of the 20th century.
Needed on the international scene today is a proven and respected manager, capable not only of understanding global development needs but, more important, of feeling the urgency for economic development without showing either a Western or an Eastern bias. Such a management expert must also be free from a neocolonialist mind-set.
I do not mean to imply that an American business executive or a Soviet manager should get the job, but it does seem to me that if a person who is a global corporate statesman and has genuine wide-ranging humanitarian concerns emerges as a candidate, such a person would be a superlative choice. The tide of ideological divisions is fast ebbing, while the economic inequalities are increasing at a geometric rate.
The United Nations has to develop the capacity to manage not only its own house, but also vast problems of third world poverty, environmental degradation, East European economic development, massive displacement of refugees -- all matters that require talent, energy and the dynamism of accomplished leadership.
There are qualified and visionary corporate leaders who fulfill these requirements, particularly from the Scandinavian countries, the neutrality of which would not violate the residue of sensitivity about United States or Soviet political hegemony.
One of these men or women would be an ideal choice as we near the 21st century.

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
Beazer's Growing U.S. Following

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IF they love you abroad, but not at home, why not move? That, in essence, is the idea that seems to have occurred to Brian Beazer, the 56-year-old chairman of Beazer P.L.C., a British home-building company.
Having gone deeply in debt in the 1980's to buy American companies that make construction materials -- Gifford Hill and Koppers -- Beazer has found itself out of favor at home, but with a growing American following among investors. 
 Mr. Beazer's solution, disclosed last week, is for the company to separate its European operations, and sell nearly half of that company's shares to investors. Beazer already gets about half its revenues from this country, and the sale of the stake in its European operations would leave it more American than ever. Mr. Beazer says the company may then decide to move its headquarters to the United States.
Details of the transaction will not be available for a few months, but it appears that the move will at least temporarily dilute Beazer's earnings by 5 to 10 percent. It will also enable the company to cut its debt. The company hopes the sale of the shares will bring in as much as £250 million ($422 million).
The hopes for cutting the debt aided the shares the day the idea was announced, but the warm market reaction faded.
In London, Beazer ordinary shares, at £1.81 before the announcement, jumped to a high of £1.89, but then began to settle back, and ended the week at £1.72. In New York trading, where Beazer American depository receipts trade, each including four ordinary shares, the price was $12.375 before the offer, but fell to $12 by the week's end.
Arguably, it is the American market reaction that is now the most important for Beazer. The company estimates that half its shares are now held by American institutions, up from little more than zero before the company went after Koppers in a 1988 hostile takeover that led to Congressional hearings focused on the decision by Shearson Lehman Brothers, Beazer's investment banker, to help with financing of the bid.
It is not hard to understand why the British are disenchanted, or why the Americans seem to like Beazer. The British investors have been disenchanted by the rapid growth of the company in this country, and by the poor performance of the shares, which were trading at £2.05 back in 1988, just before the Koppers bid was begun. But some Americans find the shares inexpensive at around 10 times last year's earnings.
In an interview, Mr. Beazer said the performance of the stock since his company undertook the Koppers takeover had been only slightly worse than that of the average British home-building company, but he conceded that British holders were not happy. "Our United Kingdom shareholders have made it very clear that they would like to see the debt substantially lower," he said.
For longtime British holders of the company founded by Mr. Beazer's father, the differences are striking. In 1983, the year that Mr. Beazer took over as chairman, the home builder had sales of £71 million, or $108 million at the exchange rate current at that time, and profits were £5.1 million ($7.7 million). For the 1990 fiscal year, ended last June, sales were £2.3 billion ($3.8 billion) and profits £38.9 million ($63.4 million). Then, the company made its money from British home building. Now, that is less than a fourth of the business.
Nearly all of the company's $1.3 billion in debt as of last June 30 was denominated in dollars, and stemmed from the American takeovers. That debt has come down some since then as the company has sold some operations and entered into joint ventures on others, principally concrete plants.
The most important American operations that Beazer has are in the aggregates business, producing crushed rocks used in construction. "There is a shortage of aggregates shares in the U.S.," said Mr. Beazer, explaining the apparent attraction of his stock to American investors.
The shares also have seemed cheap to some American analysts, among them Barbara Allen of Kidder, Peabody. In an interview she said she hoped the company would change its domicile to the United States, and thus adopt American accounting standards that would be more comfortable to investors here.
The standards are vastly different. The British rules would show higher reported profits, and thus a lower price-earnings ratio, but even under the American rules, the company is trading at only 10 times last year's earnings.
Those earnings could be slipping, however, as the recession and the fiscal problems confronting state governments cut into construction, especially of roads and bridges, where aggregates are heavily used. Nonetheless, many investors accept the argument that the need to fix up the nation's public works will eventually force the spending, and that Beazer will benefit.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Job Data Are Not Expected To Affect Fed Rein on Rates

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Ordinarily, most of the focus of the credit markets this week would be on the Government's report on April employment for a sign of the nation's economic condition. The report is scheduled to be released Friday morning.
But this is no ordinary period because no matter how many more nonfarm jobs vanished this month, the Federal Reserve last week repeatedly signaled that it had no intention of lowering interest rates in the foreseeable future. 
 The signals were sent when the Fed intervened six times in seven business days to drain reserves from the banking system in an effort to prop up the Federal funds rate. Not only is the funds rate the only one that the Fed controls with any degree of certainty, but it is also the rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans and is the rate from which most other interest rates are scaled upward.
 
Banks Amply Supplied
 Specifically, the consensus among money market analysts is that the Fed wants the funds rate to be 6 percent. That would make it the same as its discount rate, which is what the Fed charges banks for loans. But commercial banks have indirectly been sending their own signals -- that they are amply supplied with lendable reserves. Indeed, the Federal funds rate traded as low as 5.5 percent last week while the Fed was draining bank reserves. Last Friday, the funds rate traded at 5 7/8 percent for most of the day before briefly touching 6 percent at the close.
As for the employment data due out before the markets open on Friday, consulting economists at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei Inc. believe that the figures will show another drop of 200,000 nonfarm jobs and that the nation's unemployment rate will thus rise by two-tenths of a percentage point, to 7 percent.
 
A More Narrow Focus
 But investors and traders in Treasury and other fixed-income debt issues tend to have a more narrow focus. Late last week, many credit market participants were speculating over what effect, if any, yesterday's meeting in Washington of the Group of Seven industrialized nations would have on interest rates and the value of the dollar and, by extension, values of Treasury and other fixed-income debt issues.
The next tests of the fixed-income market are due on May 7, 8 and 9, when the Treasury will auction what is expected to be a record amount of notes and bonds. The Treasury will announce the size of the auction on Wednesday afternoon.
In the Treasury securities market last week, two successful auctions were completed. One consisted of $12 billion of two-year notes and the other was $9 billion of five-year notes.
 
Rise in Price of Long Bonds
 One measure of the market's satisfaction was seen in the rise in price of the Treasury's benchmark long bonds. The offered price of the 30-year bonds rose to 96 9/32 from 95 29/ 29 during the week, while its yield declined to 8.20 percent from 8.24 percent.
"Perhaps the Bank of America sent the clearest signal when it reversed an earlier cut in its prime lending rate to 8.75 percent and lifted it back to 9 percent," said John G. Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service. "Perhaps the big West Coast bank acted on the expectation that a near-term easing of Fed policy was significantly less likely than originally thought when it cut its prime earlier in the week."
Major commercial banks have asserted that they have to rebuild their profit margins and become more prudent in their lending practices. Still, Mr. Lonski summed up the view of many money market analysts last week, saying, "Until banks seek out loan customers more aggressively by way of narrower spreads between their prime rates and their basic cost of funds, this recession may be far from over."
 
A More Optimistic View
 A somewhat more optimistic view was offered by Eugene J. Sherman, senior vice president and chief economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. "On one hand, the monetary policy has been, and is likely to continue to be, mildly restrictive," he said. "For example, the growth of the money supply since 1987 has been half the rate of growth that prevailed in the prior 17 years. Looking ahead, we believe that the Fed will not squander the investment in conservative money management it has made over the last four years by easing excessively in the months ahead."
But Mr. Sherman said he did expect an economic pickup to put some upward pressure on interest rates in the second half of 1991. The Federal funds rate, which has been ranging from 5.75 percent to 6 percent so far in the first half, may be allowed to go as high as 6.25 percent in the second half of the year, he said. He also expects the discount rate on 90-day bills to range from 5.85 percent to 6.20 percent in the second half. In recent weeks, the bill rate has moved from 5.90 percent to 5.65 percent.
Mr. Sherman said he also expected long-term Treasury bond yields, as measured by the 30-year bond, to decline to 8 percent or 7.5 percent in the second half from the current level of 8.20 percent.

Cuomo Strategy: Spare the Rich To Help the Poor

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Both selectively quote Franklin D. Roosevelt and Kevin Phillips's "The Politics of Rich and Poor." They agree that the Federal Government has abandoned urban America. And they express deep concern about the impact of New York State's budget on the poor. Then they part company.
Tomorrow marks the next round in their Dennis and Goliath oratorical battle of the ages. This is not a sanctioned championship bout. It will merely test crowd reaction, rather than officially crown the state's political heavyweight (although Goliath -- Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- no longer reigns as the 800-pound gorilla former Mayor Edward I. Koch once called him; now in his third term, he is perceived more widely as a less dominant, but still imposing, 500-pound lame duck). 
 Dennis Rivera, a slight 40-year-old, heads Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care Employees Union. His union was instrumental in electing Mr. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins. His members are mostly poor black and Hispanic women.
His philosophy is vintage New Deal. His politics is also traditional, which means he can generate a crowd -- as he intends to do tomorrow afternoon with other unions and social-service groups for a rally in lower Manhattan against the Governor's proposed budget.
Like any good politician, Mr. Rivera naturally abhors a vacuum. He is resourcefully filling a void created by less aggressive figureheads in the Democratic Party and organized labor, including most of the unions that represent mu nicipal employees.
Supplementing $250,000 in television advertising, his union has distributed posters promoting tomorrow's "rally to save New York."
Superimposed over a picture of an AIDS patient at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan and a health-care worker is the caption: "Victims of New York's Budget Cuts."
 Below, the poster urges: "Stop the cuts. Tax the rich."
Mr. Rivera has framed the debate narrowly. But the reality is more complex.
The Governor is grappling with a projected $6 billion gap in his budget for the fiscal year that began four weeks ago. He proposes more economies than tax increases because he fears too many taxpayers would sail away to tax havens in other states, leaving Mr. Rivera's membership and other poor people haplessly waiting on the levee.
"If the quality of life deteriorates further, they will leave anyway," Mr. Rivera says of Mr. Cuomo's wealthier constituents. "What's going to happen in New York is a repeat of Detroit -- those who can escape will."
The Governor argues that income taxes should be raised, but by the Federal Government, not by states, which compete with one another.
"Dennis is confused," Mr. Cuomo says. "He says if that is your position for Washington, why don't you raise the state income tax? Because if you do it in Washington, you don't chase business to Canada and Mexico.
"What the Federal Government has done by reducing its income taxes is to push the burden of taxation to the states. That tears us apart as a nation when the rest of the world is learning the lesson of coalescence."
By shifting the state's burden to localities, Mr. Cuomo, perhaps by necessity, has jeopardized his own political coalition.
"They're saying they want to be preserved from the inconvenience of the recession, and I don't blame them," Mr. Cuomo says.
But an income-tax increase of $3 billion or more, he says, "would punish most of all the people they claim to represent."
"My budget is not going to affect education in one year," he said. "But you raise the income tax at this critical moment, with companies lining up to leave, and it would drive the remaining businesses out of New York City.
"There's no logic to their position unless you believe that business is not vulnerable, that Larry Tisch won't move, that we didn't have to pay $100 million to keep the commodities exchanges, and that Morgan Stanley is a cinch to stay.
"The union leaders are saying, 'Tax the rich.' It fits the sign; you need something that's short enough to be carried on a stick. But you don't make policy to deal with the toughest fiscal crisis in our history with slogans. What Dennis is doing is best for his union membership. Mine is a more complicated agenda."
The Governor faces two challenges. He has to balance the budget and he hints, philosophically at least, compromise with those who favor some income-tax increase.
Even more challenging is achieving a political balance and persuading his constituents that he has done so in their interest. The Governor's goal is to demonstrate that by sparing the rich from more onerous taxes, he is really protecting the poor.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Networks in a Quandary With Earlier Reruns

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Over the next four weeks, television viewers will see mostly original episodes of their favorite series, a kind of springtime treat offered by the three broadcast networks.
The problem is the networks may have already alienated quite a few viewers with a winter full of ice-cold repeats. 
 New episodes of many series will run through May because it is a ratings sweep month, when most of the nation's television markets are measured by ratings services. The stations then set advertising rates for the next quarter based on the ratings that they achieve during that month.
 
Erosion of Audiences
 But in order to save original episodes for May, the networks have increasingly loaded up on repeats in earlier months.
Steve Sternberg, the vice president of broadcast research for the Bozell advertising agency, contends that this strategy is contributing to the erosion of audiences for network television. He said that holding back new series episodes for the May sweep "has to be a factor" in the networks' losing viewers in December, January, March and April.
Mr. Sternberg said that the networks still attracted sizable audiences in May, but that they were playing their new episodes to a smaller house because of the warmer weather. "There are 9 percent fewer viewers available in May than there are in Feburary," he said.
Mr. Sternberg, who conducted a study of the network rerun patterns going back to the 1982-83 television season, said his research indicated that the networks were repeating more programs than ever in those months. (The networks rarely rerun programs in February, which is another sweep month.)
<HB'A Real Problem'
 Repeats have always attracted fewer viewers than original episodes. Comedies hold their audience better but they only average about 75 percent of the audience an episode attracted in its first run. A drama often falls off by more than 50 percent.
"Repeats are a real problem." said David F. Poltrack, the senior vice president of reserach for CBS. He acknowledged that more viewers than ever leave the three networks when they see a repeat and try out the multitude of programs now available on independent and cable channels.
"Five years ago, we used to just shift the audience around when we had repeats," Mr. Poltrack said. "The viewers went to ABC or NBC when we had a repeat and they had an original show; they came to us when one of them had a repeat. Now, a viewer watching our show often hates the shows on NBC and ABC, and when he sees a repeat he just goes on to one of those other channels."
Mr. Sternberg said the heavy use of repeats throughout a television season created an additional problem: "Using that many repeats interrupts viewing patterns." He said viewers get frustrated when they see a rerun the week after an original episode. As a result, they tune in to a cable channel and can lose some of their commitment to the network series.
Mr. Poltrack agreed that a program's continuity was affected by the use of reruns, especially for dramas like "L.A. Law" and ABC's "Thirtysomething," which follow continuing storylines through a season.
But he said the economics of the television business, as well as an increasing trend toward slower delivery of programs, compelled a network to "ration its product."
He acknowledged such a policy could hurt a series, citing the CBS show "The Flash," which was forced to repeat an episode in only its third week on the air. "The early repeats killed that show," Mr. Poltrack said.
Alan Wurtzel, the senior vice president of research for ABC, said the networks had to balance many objectives. One of those is satisfying their affiliated stations, which want a strong showing in every sweep month.
Though he said that keeping the affiliates happy was the biggest reason why May had become an oasis of original programs, Mr. Poltrack conceded that the networks did have another economic reason. "It is a premium value month for advertising," with many commercials tied to Mother's Day and graduations, he said.
"The ideal is a 52-week year of original programming," he said. "But we all know the economics of television won't support that."
Indeed, the networks rely on reruns for a substantial part of their profits. They always buy two runs of a program for a licenses fee that averages about $900,000 an hour. Advertising revenue usually meets or exceeds the cost of the license fee in the first run, so the second run of a show is more or less pure profit.
Networks generally order 22 to 26 episodes of a series. If they ordered more, they would not be able to get two runs of a program in a year.
 
Closed-for-Business Sign
 Mr. Sternberg contended that keeping more new episodes in December, January and March might help stem some of the decline in the network audience.
But Mr. Wurtzel argued that stretching out new programs through May was advantageous to the networks. "I would have a real concern about concentrating all the episodes earlier and then putting up a closed-for-business sign at the end of March." he said.
Still, the networks need to do all they can to keep the repeats from bunching together in the middle of the season, Mr. Poltrack said. "You don't want to see two repeats anywhere near each other," he said.
But, he acknowledged, the load of repeated episodes was growing heavier.
"Three years ago, you never saw repeats as close together as you see them now," he said.

HEADLINE: Chinese Pupils' Good Fortune Is Multiplied

SERIES: A Village in China - One of an occasional series.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YEJUAO, China

 BODY:
In June, Dai Manju will celebrate a personal triumph: a quiet, pint-sized 14-year-old who is an ace student, she will become the first person in her family ever to graduate from elementary school.
Perhaps her family will even celebrate by eating a bit of meat. There is the plump hog nosing around the corridor outside her mud-rick home, but the family thinks it would be a bit extravagant to eat the pork instead of selling it. 
 "Oh, we can't eat meat regularly," the girl's father, Dai Hanren, a small, 36-year-old peasant, exclaimed, shaking his head when asked if the family splurges on meat once a week or even once a month. "Our custom is to eat meat only on special festivals."
 
A $9,900 Mistake
 Miss Dai dropped out of elementary school several times in the past because of inability to pay the $13 annual school fees, including room and board. But now she and most of her classmates are planning to stay in school, thanks to a series of contributions from the United States -- and thanks also to a clerical error by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the New York bank, which mistakenly sent the school $10,000. Ten thousand dollars is more than 100 years' income for the typical peasant in this region.
There has been much rejoicing in Yejuao over the contributions, and Miss Dai says she will now be able to afford not only to complete elementary school and enter junior high, but also to attend senior high and perhaps even go to college and fulfill her dream of becoming a teacher.
"I like school, because I want to increase my knowledge and learn about everything happening in the world," Miss Dai said. "I'd like to thank the friendly Americans who sent money to keep me in school."
The peasants of Yejuao are still shaking their heads at the generosity of Americans, who would read an article and send $10,000 just like that. As for the bank, John M. Morris, a spokesman for Morgan Guaranty, said that such mistakes were very rare and that the bank would not try to reclaim the extra $9,900 that it sent.
"Under the circumstances, we're happy to make a donation of the difference," Mr. Morris said.
The error came about when 11 New York Times readers sent checks ranging from $13 to $100 to help Miss Dai and her classmates after reading an article in December about their struggle to stay in Yejuao Elementary School. Morgan Guaranty, in preparing a bank draft for Chinese yuan on behalf of one of the donors, neglected the decimal point in the exchange rate and sent $10,000 worth of yuan instead of $100 worth.
The triumphs and traumas of education in this remote part of the Dabie Mountains in Hubei Province are a window into Chinese rural life. Some 800 million of China's 1.1 billion inhabitants live in the countryside, where the expression "higher education" may mean -- as it is sometimes used in this area -- grades four through six. Going to school in little villages like Yejuao (pronounced yeh-joo-WOW) is still often regarded as a treasured opportunity, partly because it is relatively expensive.
Children like Dai Manju possess nothing but a few clothes, and their dreams. Miss Dai's home is in a collection of mud-brick huts on a hillside, a two-hour hike over mountain trails from the elementary school village of Yejuao. The Dai home has no electricity, no watch or clock, no bicycle, and no furnishings aside from beds, chairs and a coffin that the family has made for Miss Dai's 57-year-old great-aunt. She is healthy now, the adults explain, but it is best to be prepared.
Neither of the parents of Dai Manju went to school beyond the third grade, and both are illiterate. Only about a dozen people from her hamlet and the surrounding ones, with a total population of 1,300 people, have ever graduated from senior high school, none of them girls.
With the donations from American readers, Yejuao Elementary School provided scholarships, mostly ranging from 50 cents to a few dollars, to 92 of the 174 pupils. The parents of these pupils signed a roster to confirm receipt of the scholarship, or, if they were illiterate, solemnly affixed their thumbprints to the document.
Despite the scholarships -- and despite family visits by teachers -- five students dropped out of the elementary school at the beginning of the new semester after spring vacation this year. But without the money, even more would have dropped out, Li Huachun, the principal, said.
While money is the major reason why parents pull their children out of school, it is not the only one. Parents often want their children to help around the house or in the fields, and particularly for daughters, who will be married soon into other households, an elementary school education is sometimes regarded as an unessential luxury.
 
New School Is Built
 In addition to providing the scholarships, the authorities say they used most of the $10,000 from Morgan Guaranty to help build a new elementary school in the next village, to replace the Yellow Mud Elementary School, which is crowded and falling apart. The old school, which is made out of mud bricks and leaks in the snow and rain, is already jammed but is getting more children all the time.
To build the new school, the Government and a large Chinese company provided $30,000 (the corporate donor is Stone Corporation, a national computer company that is in political trouble for supporting the 1989 democracy movement and that is now trying to impress the Government with its altruism). Local peasants and officials chipped in a total of $5,000 in tiny contributions.
Funds are still a bit short, so to cut expenses hundreds of local parents have turned out to help build the elementary school.
"One of my kids is at the Yellow Mud Elementary School, and so I wanted to pitch in to build the new school," said Zhou Qishui, a barefoot 48-year-old peasant who was working with several dozen other parents on the site of the new building. Mr. Zhou, who himself dropped out of school in the fourth grade when his father died, contributed $2 to the project and is also donating 20 days of his labor.
"The kids are suffering in the old school, especially when it rains and leaks on them, so they'll be much better off here," Mr. Zhou said with satisfaction.
 
Officials Are Wary
 While local peasants and school officials seem very grateful for the gifts from Americans, the Government in the county seat 70 miles away appears to be a bit uncomfortable with the attention. County officials refused two requests to revisit the school earlier this year. Under Chinese law, a foreign journalist can travel outside Beijing only with the permission of local authorities.
When they did finally allow a return visit to the school, officials refused to allow a reporter to spend the night in the village of Yejuao itself, saying that "conditions are too backward." The officials did permit a visit to Dai Manju's home village, but once there they banned taking of any photos and attempted to ban interviews with residents other than the Mayor and the Dai family.
"This is too poor," explained Deng Jiesan, the county's director of foreign affairs, who had huffed along the mountain trails with a few other official escorts. Mr. Deng apparently believed that accounts of poverty might embarrass his county.
In some respects, conditions at rural chools are indeed miserable. Classrooms are unheated, so that in winter pupils fingers are sometimes so cold that they can barely write. Many students live in dormitory rooms six nights a week, sharing a large bed with a half-dozen classmates, and spend only Sunday at their homes.
 
No Metal Detectors
 The dormitory rooms have no running water, and the outhouses -- Yejuao Elementary School's toilet consists of three holes in the ground, surrounded by a low wall -- are putrid and unlit at night. There are no bathing facilities, and in winter the students wear the same clothes all week.
Yet if the schools get by without hot water, they also manage without metal detectors. In some respects, the spirit in Yejuao Elementary School, and others visited in various parts of China, seems more upbeat than in many urban American schools. Crime and vandalism are almost unknown, teachers are honored -- the students stand at attention and utter a respectful greeting when the teacher enters the room -- and the most popular students are not the athletes or the trouble-makers but the most gifted academically.
Naughty students are universal, however, and Yejuao Elementary School has a few. The mischief-makers are not beaten, unless they do something that risks their lives, and normally teachers rely on discussions with the students and the parents -- teachers go to the homes of all their students at least once a year -- to resolve the problems.
The teachers can also send the students to Mr. Li, the principal, who has his own method of last resort.
"If we had a really bad student, I would put up a poster describing his misbehavior and calling on him to repent," Mr. Li said. "But that would be very rare. I've been at this school for more than a year and that hasn't happened yet."

HEADLINE: Fears on Cut In U.S. Arms;
Shrinking of Industry Is Called Dangerous

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
As Pentagon budgets decline sharply, every big weapons contract takes on added importance for military contractors. But few contracts define the stakes so starkly as the selection the Navy will make soon of a company to build its next attack submarine.
 Industry executives and Government officials say that what is at stake is the survival of one of the two remaining submarine-building shipyards -- the General Dynamics Corporation's Electric Boat division in Groton, Conn. 
 Electric Boat has said that unless it receives the next Seawolf contract, which could be awarded as soon as this week, it will probably not have enough business to stay open beyond the middle of the decade. A closing of Electric Boat would mean the loss of 22,000 jobs at the company and thousands more at its suppliers and subcontractors.
That would leave the Navy totally dependent for its submarines on a single source, Tenneco Inc.'s Newport News shipyard in Virginia.
While the Seawolf program would be "a matter of relative prosperity for Newport News, it now appears to be a matter of survival for Electric Boat and much of the submarine industrial supplier base in New England," James E. Turner Jr., Electric Boat's general manager, told a Congressional hearing last month.
The situation at Electric Boat is just one example of how declining military budgets and the resulting shrinkage of the contracting business are raising fears within the Government and the industry of a permanent erosion in the nation's ability to design and manufacture weapons.
The Air Force's selection last week of a team headed by the Lockheed Corporation to build a new generation of fighter planes gave Lockheed and its partners, General Dynamics and the Boeing Company, a solid base of military aircraft orders for the next two decades. And it left the losing team, the Northrop Corporation and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, seemingly dropped from the front ranks of the combat aircraft business, and in the long run, perhaps even being forced out of the field.
The Army is down to one tank manufacturer, General Dynamics, which is struggling to win enough domestic and foreign tank orders to keep its production line open after 1995. And the Army's selection earlier this month of Boeing and the United Technologies Corporation's Sikorsky division to build a new light attack helicopter seems to doom McDonnell Douglas's helicopter operations to a long period of retrenchment.
The Grumman Corporation, formerly the premier builder of Navy aircraft, is lobbying furiously in Congress to overturn a decision by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to end the F-14 fighter program. Mr. Cheney's decision would essentially force Grumman out of the aircraft-building business.
 
Only Moderately Concerned
 So far Pentagon officials say they are only moderately concerned about the industry's diminishing size and strength and its ability to provide military superiority to the nation's forces.
In announcing the selection of the Lockheed team last week, Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice said concerns about the military contracting industry played no role in his decision. He added that the Air Force "will simply have to leave to market forces" the question of whether some companies leave the airplane business.
Some people argue that the shrinking of the industry is overdue, since it has been plagued for years with overcapacity, particularly in aircraft manufacturing. Many Government officials say it would be a mistake to start awarding weapons contracts on any basis other than merit and cost.
But as more companies approach the day when they must mothball their assembly lines, dismiss engineering and scientific staffs and cut back on research, there are growing warnings -- some, predictably, motivated by self-interest and pork-barrel politics -- that the Pentagon should slow the dismantling of the industrial base on which it has relied.
In a speech last month, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said, "Our declining defense industrial base and the long-term consequences of decisions made today about the procurement of weapons systems" amount to a "serious problem that threatens to endanger the security of the United States." He urged the Navy to give the Seawolf contract to Electric Boat.
Many industry executives and analysts and Government officials stop short of calling for the Pentagon to take an active role in managing the shrinkage of the industry. But they say the military should do more to define what it needs to insure that the appropriate industrial abilities are retained.
"We still face the question of what is the minimum capability we require and what are the necessary inefficiencies we need to put up with in order to maintain it," said Gordon Adams, the director of the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan research group based in Washington. "Even if they are making the decisions without industrial base considerations, the decisions have industrial base implications."
 
$726 Million Contract
 The implications are clear on the Seawolf program. Electric Boat won a competition with Newport News several years ago to build the first Seawolf under a $726 million contract. The Navy originally planned to buy three or four Seawolfs a year and to split the business between Electric Boat and Newport News. The Navy thought the competition between the shipyards would bring down the program's costs.
But with the cold war apparently over and Pentagon budgets being slashed, the Navy now plans on buying no more than one Seawolf a year.
"We need to honestly face the fact that long-term procurement of one submarine per year will not sustain both submarine construction yards," H. Lawrence Garrett 3d, the Secretary of the Navy, told a Congressional committee several weeks ago.
The military aircraft business is also being forced to shrink. The Northrop-McDonnell Douglas team's loss on the new fighter program last week leaves Northrop's future almost totally dependent on the B-2 Stealth bomber program, which accounts for more than half the company's revenues. If the B-2 were to be canceled after the 15 planes the Air Force has already ordered -- a step many in Congress think is likely this year -- Northrop would be left as a producer of missiles and electronics systems and as a subcontractor on a few aircraft programs.
McDonnell Douglas has a large backlog of commercial and transport aircraft orders. But over the next several years, most of its biggest combat aircraft programs will end, including the F-15 and AV-8B fighters and the Apache helicopter. Earlier this year, the Navy canceled the company's other big hope for the future, the A-12 attack plane.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Seeks A Budget Talk With All Sides

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
After a grim weekend reviewing painful proposals to slash city services, Mayor David N. Dinkins last night asked labor leaders and city and state officials, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, to join him this week for what city leaders called a crucial meeting to discuss the city's worsening plight.
City officials said that at the meeting, Mr. Dinkins would lay out a plan that would include thousands of layoffs to close a budget gap of $3.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins on July 1 and would ask for immediate concessions from the state and from unions to head off the worst of the cuts. 
 "It is clear," said First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, "if we are going to present a viable plan we are going to need help on at least those fronts."
One senior administration official said, "We are in the eighth inning now."
Behind the meeting call is a deep concern that the Dinkins administration's separate efforts to win concessions from its unions and get help from the state have been foundering, officials said. Such an appearance of continued disarray could undermine the confidence of the financial markets when city sells bonds next month, they said.
Union leaders have refused to consider cost-saving concessions until they see a complete long-term plan to solve the city's fiscal problems, including help from the state. Governor Cuomo and Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier who heads the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was set up during the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's to sell bonds for the city, have raised similar concerns about the need for long-term planning.
Mr. Steisel said that the meeting would be held later this week, the week before the May 10 scheduled release of Mr. Dinkins's budget. Officials said the budget would include the kind of service cuts -- including the closing of dozens of libraries and cuts in street sweeping and social services -- that Mr. Dinkins had been warning would be "awesome" and "painful."
"People will be shocked by the nature of the cuts," Mr. Steisel said. "There is a concern that whatever it looks like, people will believe it is a manageable plan, so there are no doubts in the financial marketplace that we are able to do it."
Stephen Villano, a spokesman for Governor Cuomo, said that Mr. Dinkins called the Governor yesterday to invite him to the meeting. He said that Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Dinkins agreed to meet separately this week to go over the city's plans and that the Governor "will have representatives" at the broader meeting.
Later, in a telephone interview, Mr. Cuomo said that he had long advocated bringing together government and labor and other constituent groups to address the city's problems and that he welcomed the Mayor's initiative. "At one point everybody must come together as we did in 1975," he said.
 
Cuomo Concerned About Cuts
 He said that the budget plan Mr. Dinkins was now drafting was crucial and had to show that the city had a "certain structural balance," with its spending plans matching its revenues for years to come. At the same time he said he was concerned that cuts in services not be too deep.
"A too-drastic cut in some services could do as much damage as any other mistake you could make," he said.
Over the weekend, Mr. Dinkins completed a review of reductions that made deep cuts in the city's capital spending, halving spending by many agencies -- including libraries, highways, cultural institutions and the Fire Department -- over the next four years to reduce the city's rapidly mounting debt-service costs.
These deep cuts, which would be needed even if the city fends off the worst of the cuts in services. would help the city reduce overall capital spending by 15 percent, to $16.2 billion. Some of the cuts would be offset by a plan to spend an extra $500 million to build more jails -- which will receive $1 out of every $10 in construction money. Deep cuts are also planned in the city's school construction program.
 
Last-Minute Reprieves
 In last-minute negotiations, Mr. Dinkins agreed to restore some planned cuts in the Parks Department -- which was preparing to eliminate most tree planting -- in economic development and in housing, in which Mr. Dinkins restored financing for a large rehabilitation program centered on Bradhurst Avenue in Harlem and Saratoga Square in Brooklyn.
Late yesterday, after a five-hour budget session in the library at Gracie Mansion, Mr. Dinkins began calling the Speaker of the Council, Peter F. Vallone, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Rohatyn and union leaders to invite them to attend.
On Saturday, Mr. Dinkins spent eight hours working through proposals sketched out by his budget officials. City commissioners will have a chance to appeal some of the proposed cuts in the next day or two.

HEADLINE: Plea by U.S. On Rate Cut Is Rejected

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
The world's largest industrial nations considered and rejected today a Bush Administration request that Europe, and in particular Germany, lower interest rates. But they agreed to consider the request in the future.
That, in effect, was the gist of an eight-paragraph communique issued after a nearly seven-hour meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents from the so-called Group of Seven nations: the United States, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Japan. 
 The communique recognized both the Bush Administration's pressure for lower interest rates as a means of ending the recession in the United States and avoiding one in Europe, and the German Government's refusal to force down rates and risk increasing inflation in that country.
 
Outcome Called a Standoff
 Various officials described the outcome as a standoff. "You come to a fight, and everything does not happen in the first round; what you saw today was the first round," said an executive of the International Monetary Fund, who insisted on anonymity. Most of the ministers will also attend the I.M.F.'s spring meeting, which starts on Monday.
United States Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, at a briefing after the Group of Seven meeting, acknowledged that he considered European interest rates, adjusted for inflation, to be too high. When asked about his differences with Germany on this point, he kept referring to a phrase in the communique that called for policies that provide "the basis for lower real interest rates and a sustained global economic recovery with price stability."
 
Both Views Recognized
 The phrasing recognized the Administration's request for lower rates, as well as the German insistence on price stability, which means minimum inflation -- a goal that central banks usually achieve by keeping rates relatively high.
Short-term rates in Germany today are roughly 9 percent, while American rates on short-term securities are around 6 percent.
The communique described the compromise as "a medium-term strategy." It added that the ministers had "agreed to monitor the situation closely and to take actions as needed within the coordination process with a view to achieving a sound recovery and a growing world economy."
While the United States struggles through a recession, most European economies are experiencing weaker economic growth this year. Mr. Brady suggested that if the recession failed to end this summer, as many economists have predicted, and Europe moves closer to a recession, then the dispute over interest rates was likely to resurface.
"We have to wait and see if economic growth returns in the summer," he said.
But the Bush Administration apparently could not get action now for a coordinated adjustment in the interest rates of the industrial countries. While the ministers did not disclose how the debate went, others said the United States probably had support from France and Britain, while concern over inflation apparently put Canada, Italy and perhaps Japan in the German camp.
The finance ministers and central bank chiefs spent 45 minutes with President Bush at a White House reception this morning, then crossed the street to Blair House, the Government's guest quarters, where their session was held.
Douglas Davidson, a White House spokesman, said the President's conversation with those at the reception was "private and personal."
Theo Waigel, the German Finance Minister, told reporters as he left the White House that Mr. Bush had spoken of the need to get interest rates down, in the United States and abroad, although he did so without reproaching the Germans for their refusal to lower rates.
The Bush Administration is concerned that the economic slowdown in Western Europe will reduce demand for American products. Exports to Europe have helped to offset the drop in sales at home, limiting the damage from the recession. If exports were to fall now, the recession might be harder to shake off, economists say.
The Administration, as a result, has urged the Europeans, and particularly Germany, which dominates the European economy, to lower interest rates as a means of stimulating growth. Lower rates would encourage people to borrow for spending.
But the Germans say they are already big importers. Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, said in a speech on Friday that German purchases of goods from other Western European countries had risen by 20 percent.
"Unfortunately, our imports from the United States have declined," he said. "I don't know the reason."
Mr. Pohl noted that western Germany was sending billions of dollars to eastern Germany to subsidize its transition to a market economy. The German Government argues that this investment will eventually pay off in rising east German demand for goods, including American goods. Meanwhile, the Germans argue that if their central bank pushed down interest rates, the extra incentive to borrow might be inflationary, creating too much demand at a time when resources are being channeled to eastern Germany.
"The answer is not to lower rates, but to accept for a period of time, high real rates," Mr. Pohl said last week. "This is the logical result of a shortage of capital."
The value of the dollar against the mark, the yen and the other major currencies, which had been such a central theme at previous Group of Seven meetings, took a back seat this time. Officials of the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve say that while the dollar has risen in value in recent weeks, it is moving up from a very low level and is not an obstacle to exports.

HEADLINE: Orders for Machine Tools Fell in March

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
New orders for American-made machine tools fell sharply in March, according to a report scheduled to be released on Monday.
The report is yet another sign of the severity of the recession. On Friday, the Government reported that the nation's economy, as measured by the gross national product, declined 2.8 percent in the first three months of the year. 
 The Association for Manufacturing Technology, an industry trade group based in McLean, Va., said new tool orders in March fell 22.7 percent from the level of a year ago and 16.2 percent from February.
Machine tools cut or shape metal and are used in manufacturing.
 
Clues to Health of Economy
 Although the market for machine tools is relatively small, its level of activity can provide clues to the health of manufacturing and the economy in general.
The level fell sharply in March to $205.5 million, down from $265.9 million a year earlier and $245.2 million in February.
Despite the decline in orders, the association's president, Albert W. Moore, took an optimistic view, saying orders in the first three months of the year were still running close to last year's level.
In this year's first quarter, new machine tool orders totaled $650.5 million, compared with $661.7 million in the 1990 quarter.
"We think it illustrates the improving competitiveness of the U.S. machine tool industry," Mr. Moore said in a statement.
The quarterly decline of 1.7 percent percent comes "despite the strengthening U.S. dollar and uncertainty and weakness in many major foreign markets," Mr. Moore said.
In its monthly report, the trade group said March shipments of machine tools totaled $278.2 million, up 37.6 percent, from $202.2 million in February, and off 3.7 percent from $288.9 million a year earlier.
Foreign orders totaled $46.4 million in March, a 42 percent drop from $80.1 million in February, and down 39.2 percent from the $76.3 million posted in March 1990.
 
Foreign Shipments Up in March
 Foreign shipments totaled $42.1 million in March, up 24 percent from $33.9 million in February, but off slightly from $42.7 million a year earlier.
The trade group said metal-cutting orders fell 17.5 percent in March, to $153.6 million, from $186.3 million in February, and were down 22.5 percent from $198.2 million a year ago.
Metal-cutting shipments rose 30.8 percent, to $174.2 million, in March, from $133.2 million in February, but were down 18.7 percent from $214.2 million a year earlier.
Total March orders for metal-forming tools were down 12 percent, to $51.9 million, from February's $58.9 million, and down 23.4 percent from $67.7 million in March last year.
Metal-forming shipments jumped 50.8 percent, to $104.1 million, from February's $69 million and were up 39.2 percent from the $74.8 million of March 1990.
The association said the March backlog for orders was $1.45 billion, down from $1.53 billion in February. In 1990, the March backlog totaled $1.68 billion.

HEADLINE: Kohlberg, Kravis Rouses Itself

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
After almost two years of struggling with its previous investments as the "junk bond" market collapsed, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the giant buyout firm that became a corporate titan in the 1980's, appears to be back on a roll.
In one week, the firm, which has not made a large purchase in two years, began to snap up corporate properties again. It backed the bid that won Federal approval to buy the assets of the Bank of New England. And K-III Holdings, a company controlled by Kohlberg, Kravis, agreed to buy nine publications from Rupert Murdoch's debt-laden News Corporation for $650 million. 
 The deals are vastly different from the firm's well-worn leveraged buyout formula. Kohlberg, Kravis became known in the 80's for breakups -- selling pieces of a company to reduce the mountains of debt used in the purchase. But in the 90's, it is turning to "build-ups," in which it enlarges existing companies by acquiring assets.
 
A Consistent Philosophy
 In both the Bank of New England and Murdoch deals, Kohlberg, Kravis used its own capital to purchase the assets of troubled companies. The firm is injecting $283 million into the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc., a financial services company, for the purchase of the Bank of New England assets. To support the Murdoch deal, it is expected to make another investment in K-III, a company formed by three former executives of the publisher Macmillan Inc. with backing from Kohlberg, Kravis.
"The two deals are very similar in philosophy," said one executive with ties to Kohlberg, Kravis. "It is an investment of their funds' capital in a program of building up a business."
The strategy is again putting Kohlberg, Kravis at the front of some high-profile deals. But even some investors with the firm say they do not believe the approach will enable the company to regain the fantastic returns on investments -- as much as 63 percent on an annualized basis on its first 16 deals -- it enjoyed in the mid-80's.
The new deals are far smaller than the firm's mega-transactions, like the $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. -- which, with financing expenses, ultimately cost Kohlberg, Kravis $32 billion -- negotiated in late 1988 and early 1989. But the deals signal that Kohlberg, Kravis is ready to start reaching into its deep pockets again. And the two new deals show that the firm is continuing to rely on borrowed money.
In large part, the switch from selling assets after a leveraged buyout to buying assets from troubled companies reflects the current condition of the economy, investment managers and Wall Street professionals say.
"I think building companies now makes extraordinary sense," said Scott Sperling, a partner at the Harvard Management Company, which runs the endowment fund for the university and is an investor with Kohlberg, Kravis. The buyout firm "has the ability to buy low," he said. "Backing a superior management team to acquire those sorts of pieces I think is a brilliant way of approaching the business."
 
Built From Scratch
 From its beginnings in 1976, Kohlberg, Kravis used leveraged buyouts to rise from next to nothing -- it had just $3 million to invest in 1976 -- to control an empire that includes RJR Nabisco, supermarket chains, like Stop and Shop and Safeway Inc., and Duracell International Inc. Since its inception, the firm has acquired 36 companies at a cost of about $65 billion.
The debt-driven buyout helped make the firm's founders extremely wealthy. Henry R. Kravis, George R. Roberts and their former partner, Jerome Kohlberg Jr., who left in 1987 over what partners said was his concern about the size of the firm's deals, are each estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. At the same time, Mr. Kravis assumed a prominent role in New York society, particularly since his marriage in 1985 to Carolyne Roehm, a fashion designer. Mr. Roberts, who is Mr. Kravis's cousin, works out of the firm's San Francisco office and tends to shun publicity.
In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors buys a company, often in cooperation with top managers, and pays for it mostly with borrowed money. In theory, the new owners begin cutting away at excess, dismissing unneeded employees and selling operations that have little to do with the core business. The company is then resold for a handsome profit.
 
Tapping Pools of Capital
 Kohlberg, Kravis raised the equity used in the buyouts by selling its investment skills to institutional investors and money managers. Since 1978, the firm has tapped its investors' capital pools six times for the formation of different buyout funds, and recently went back to investors to replenish the fund collected in 1987. The firm says it manages the money of more than 70 institutions.
In past years, when the firm put in only about 10 percent equity, it greatly increased the potential return for itself and its investors through the high degree of leverage. Now, with banks less willing to lend for highly leveraged transactions and the junk bond market essentially unavailable for raising large amounts of capital, Kohlberg, Kravis expects that the equity portion of deals could rise as high as 30 percent.
With more capital required for leveraged buyouts, the firm is exploring other investment strategies, company documents and Wall Street executives indicate.
 
Using a Minority Stake
 Kohlberg, Kravis has also adopted a so-called "toehold" approach to investing, in which it takes a minority stake in a publicly held company and uses its own investment as a signal of its confidence in the concern. The best known of those is its 9.9 percent holding in First Interstate Bancorp.
At the same time, Kohlberg, Kravis has been dipping into the capital markets to shore up the balance sheets of companies it bought in leveraged buyouts. Indeed, this month, Kohlberg, Kravis turned to the stock and bond markets six times, raising money for Safeway, Autozone Inc. and RJR Nabisco. A stock offering for Duracell International is awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
The Firm's High Fees
 The firm's investors are now wondering if the changes in investment strategy will be able to bring them returns close to those in the 80's, enough to justify paying the firm's high fees. Under the fee structure, Kohlberg, Kravis charges a 1.5 percent annual fee for managing the money invested with it, as well as investment banking fees, divestiture fees, consulting fees and a smattering of other charges.
On its four largest deals, the firm is estimated to have charged its limited partners $240 million up front. And on top of that, the firm gets to keep 20 percent of any capital gains from an investment.
Some limited partners in past Kohlberg, Kravis ventures voiced objections when the firm began seeking $1 billion to $2 billion to replenish the $5.6 billion buyout fund that the firm raised in 1987. The investors wanted Kohlberg, Kravis to cut its fees and change the method by which the firm treats gains and losses of companies in its portfolio.
 
Protected Profits
 Kohlberg, Kravis treats each company in its portfolio separately, giving itself 20 percent of the profits of every company that does well, while only taking 1 percent of the losses for the poor performers. The firm can profit even if the limited partners do not.
"They make a lot of money whether or not I as a limited partner make money," said Mr. Sperling of Harvard, who has not decided whether he will invest in the new Kohlberg, Kravis fund. "We want them to make money, but only after we make money."
Some institutional investors are finding that by using the asset-investing strategy by themselves they are able to produce returns equal to those from Kohlberg, Kravis when their costs of investing in the firm are considered. And that is leading them to stay out of this round of money raising.
But despite the grumbling, Kohlberg, Kravis's track record is still bringing in the institutional investors.
"I don't blame them for sticking to their guns on the fee issue," the manager of another fund that still invests with the firm said. "If I could get the money on those terms, I wouldn't change things either."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Saudi General Sees No Need For Big American Presence

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, April 28

 BODY:
A senior Saudi official says he does not think that Saudi Arabia would need or want a larger American military presence than it had before the Persian Gulf war. He also says no decision has been made about whether the United States would be permitted to store heavy military equipment in the kingdom.
In an interview Friday, Prince Khaled ibn Sultan, who commanded the Arab and Islamic forces in the coalition that ousted Iraq from Kuwait, said Saudi history, traditions and culture all weighed against a substantial American presence in his country. Any increase in American military personnel here should be limited to training functions, he said, adding that the number of new trainers would depend on the amount of new American arms purchased. 
 Speaking as American forces continue to pull out of Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the gulf war, the Prince suggested that American military officials should not expect, as they apparently have, the Saudi Government's agreement that the most efficient way of deterring a future threat to this oil-rich kingdom of 7 million people would be to leave behind a stockpile of American weapons in the event American troops have to return here rapidly.
 
'Give Me Time'
 "It has not been talked about," Prince Khaled said. "I would say, if I were asked, give me time. I have to study it. And I have many questions that need to be answered: What is your threat? What is your future threat?"
After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, hundreds of thousands of American troops were sent to Saudi Arabia to counter what was viewed as the imminent danger of an Iraqi attack on this kingdom. But the Prince, asked whether he thought Saudi Arabia was now so vulnerable given the destruction inflicted on Iraq, said, "I can't see that much of a threat now."
The Prince's skepticism about American plans to pre-position heavy equipment here is likely to surprise some American officials, since Prince Khaled is considered among the most pro-American of Saudi military officials, one who cooperated closely with Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of the coalition's American and British forces.
A Western official who asked not to be identified confirmed Prince Khaled's assertion that the Saudi Government had not yet made a decision on the stockpiling issue. But he expressed confidence that King Fahd would eventually decide that storing some military equipment here and elsewhere in the gulf in event of a crisis made economic and military sense.
 
U.S. Stresses Stockpiling
 American officials have made stockpiling of weapons in the kingdom a key element in their strategy to improve security and defense in the gulf after the defeat of Iraq.
[In Washington, the Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, declined to characterize the Saudis' position. saying the issue of pre-positioning military equipment was still under discussion.]
A Western diplomat said an American general had arrived in the kingdom last week to begin a joint study with the Saudi military of the security threats to the kingdom and the region.
Prince Khaled said he expected that departing American units would take virtually all their weapons and equipment back to the United States with them and that very little equipment or arms would be stored here.
"I don't recall any storage of any equipment," he said when asked about reports that the United States military planned to stockpile some equipment here and leave American soldiers behind to guard it. "There has been no discussion about it. And I don't think it will be discussed."
The best way to avert future threats and to insure that the United States would not be called upon again to rush to the kingdom's defense, he said, was to support Saudi Arabia's plans to triple the size of its armed forces and enlarge and enhance its weapons arsenal. Therefore, he added, he hoped that Congress would respond favorably to Saudi bids to purchase advanced American weapons.
"I think Americans would appreciate it more if we increased the size of our armed forces and reduced the chance of sending them back here," he said.
When asked why such advanced weapons should be sold to the kingdom if, as he maintained, it now faced little military threat, Prince Khaled said he had no objection to limiting arms sales to Saudi Arabia provided such restraints were applied "equally throughout the region, including to Israel."
An initial $7.3 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia passed Congress after the seizure of Kuwait and before the beginning of the gulf war. The rest of the $21 billion package proposed by the Administration, however, was deferred and has been mentioned recently in light of stiff opposition from Congress and budget constraints in the kingdom, which ran a $15 billion deficit in the first quarter of this year.
 
Equipment Training Favored
 Regarding the presence of American military personnel here, the Prince said: "In the future, I think we will take just the number needed to train on new equipment. It depends on how much new equipment we take."
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are both said to favor reversing American policy to allow some American ground forces to be permanently stationed in Saudi Arabia as part of any joint security arrangements in the region with Arab nations. Both are said to favor storing at least a division's worth of heavy equipment here -- tanks and other heavy arms -- to avoid the long delays in shipping such materiel to the peninsula in the event that Saudi Arabia is once again threatened.
But the issue of a large, visible or permanent American presence -- of men or American-controlled weapons -- continues to be politically delicate in the kingdom. After Iraq seized Kuwait in August, religious conservatives initially challenged American assistance here on grounds that it would lead to a permanent presence.
In the 1950's, the United States used an air force base in Dhahran. But the Americans left in the early 1960's because of protests by radical Arabs. Until the gulf war, Americans have only sent trainers here, and the kingdom has maintained a policy of refusing even joint ground exercises on Saudi soil.

HEADLINE: Medical Technology 'Arms Race' Adds Billions to the Nation's Bills

SERIES: The Price of Health - Second of five articles.

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
Dr. George M. Segall held up a set of multicolored images of a patient's heart. On one side, the red was not as sharp, indicating that blood flow to that part of the heart was lacking.
The pictures were taken with a machine, one of only 50 in the nation, that has just been installed at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital, where Dr. Segall is deputy chief of nuclear medicine. 
 The machine, known as a PET scanner, can peer into the workings of internal organs, providing doctors with previously unobtainable information. It can tell, for instance, whether heart tissue is alive or dead and whether it is worthwhile for a cardiologist to attempt open-heart surgery.
But such information doesn't come cheap. "You're talking about a five-and-a-half-million-dollar investment," said Dr. Segall, who is also an assistant professor at Stanford Medical School, referring to the cost of the scanner and of a cyclotron that makes the radioisotopes administered to the patient for the test. "It's by far one of the most expensive technologies available now."
Once, an advance like the PET, which stands for positron emission tomography, would have been welcomed into the nation's arsenal of medical tools. After all, Americans want, and feel entitled to, the best medical care, regardless of cost, and doctors want to provide it. And with insurance companies or government programs paying the bills, neither patient nor physician has had much reason to weigh the costs and benefits.
But the future of the PET scanner in medical care is far from assured. A move is afoot, driven by strapped Federal health agencies and insurance companies, to rein in what some have called a medical technology arms race. Their hope, a revolutionary one for American medicine, is to limit the uses of costly machines and procedures to instances in which the benefits have been shown to be commensurate with the expense.
Fueling this move is a growing recognition that the uncontrolled use of high-technology medical equipment and procedures, from coronary bypass surgery to new scanning machines to lithotripters that blast kidney stones with shock waves, helps drive the relentless increase in medical costs, which now account for 12 percent of the gross national product.
PET scanning comes on the heels of other major advantages in diagnostic imaging. CAT or CT scanning, which stands for computerized axial tomography, appeared in the 1970's and represented a great advance over conventional X-rays, but at a cost of up to $500 per scan. Magnetic resonance imaging, or M.R.I. scans, appeared in the mid-1980's and offered advantages over CAT scans, but again at a higher cost, up to $1,000 a scan. PET scan fees are higher still, reaching $2,500.
Moreover, there is widespread agreement that many advanced, expensive medical procedures are overused. Coronary bypass surgery, for instance, is performed 300,000 times a year in the United States and accounts for about $1 of every $50 spent on health care. But a study by the Rand Corporation a few years ago found that more than 40 percent of such operations did very little, if anything, for the patients. M.R.I. scans, doctors say, are often done to rule out a minute chance of brain injury, for example, and perhaps most of all to protect the doctor from malpractice suits.
The United States relies far more heavily on technology than other advanced nations. A 1989 study by the American Medical Association found that on a per capita basis the United States had four times as many M.R.I. machines as Germany and eight times as many as Canada. American doctors performed open-heart surgery 2.6 times as often as Canadian doctors and 4.4 times as often as German doctors.
 
Driven by Society
Breakthroughs As Birthright
Technology is only one factor in soaring health care expenses, and diagnostic imaging is only one factor in medical technology. Still, an examination of how such imaging machines are sold, paid for and used reveals much about the medical and business issues feeding the growth in medical technology and how difficult it would be to rein it in.
"The pressure of the introduction of new technologies is inexorable," said Dr. Seymour Perry, director of a program on technology and health care at Georgetown University. "Every day there's a claim of a new breakthrough. Our society wants that. We are different from other societies in the world."
The National Institutes of Health spend billions of dollars each year on medical research. A huge medical technology industry is also in place, spewing out streams of innovations and marketing them heavily, with profit rather than social utility often its prime motivator.
Nor should society try to stifle new technology, experts agree. In addition to providing better health care, technology can lower costs. A new technique for removing gall bladders, known as laparoscopy, can be finished in a day compared with the older approach, which required up to a week in the hospital.
The case of medical imaging is an example of how technology can spread virtually unchecked by considerations of cost. One reason PET machines are undergoing scrutiny is that the last great innovation in diagnostic imaging, the magnetic resonance imager, spread rapidly after it appeared in the middle 1980's. Although offering wonderful benefits, M.R.I. scans are often used to achieve marginal gains, experts say, and sometimes under conditions that raise at least a suspicion of conflict of interest.
There are now 2,000 such M.R.I. machines, which cost $1 million to $2 million each, in the United States. Analysts estimate that more than five million M.R.I. scans were performed in the nation last year, at prices of $600 to $1,000 each. That means that magnetic resonance imaging alone is adding about $5 billion to the nation's health bill.
"People want this smart test," said John Caronna, professor of clinical neurology at New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. "There's no way to shut it off. The doctors crave it, it's reassuring, and the patients crave it."
But some critics say the test is overused. "There was never any effort on the part of payers or providers or society in general to develop a rational policy on how to use them," said John L. Cova, director of medical technology assessment for the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group representing 300 insurance companies. The M.R.I. scans are "used in an inappropriate way in many instances," he said. "It's almost a joke: 'Give him an M.R.I.' "
 
Driven by Profits
Keeping Up With Rivals
A set of forces, indicative of basic traits of the nation's health system that undermine efforts at cost-control, brought about the rapid spread of M.R.I. machines and procedures. Manufacturers constantly pushed new machines on the market. The purchase of a machine by one hospital inspired others to want to keep up. Entrepreneurs, sensing big profits, set up specialized imaging centers, often attracting doctors, who could refer patients to the centers, as co-owners.
Having bought such expensive machines, hospitals and imaging centers had an incentive to push as many patients through as possible to pay off the machines. Fear of malpractice also contributed to the machines' use. And the tests were largely profitable, in part because of Medicare reimbursement rates that over-compensated radiologists, in the view of many experts, and that failed to come down as the technology became more widespread.
To be sure, M.R.I. machines can have enormous medical value. They use radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body and have been particularly useful in finding anomalies like brain tumors and spinal cord injuries. Unlike the earlier CAT scan, M.R.I. does not expose the patient to radiation. Both M.R.I. and CAT scans have largely replaced riskier and more painful procedures, like pneumo-encephalography, in which spinal fluid is removed and air pumped into the brain.
After Medicare agreed to reimburse patients for M.R.I. scans in 1985, sales of the machines rose to about $500 million a year in the United States. The leading manufacturer is the General Electric Company, followed by Siemens, Toshiba, Philips N.V. and Picker International.
Hospitals, sometimes under pressure from their own doctors, pushed to buy machines to retain their competitive status as full-service, modern health care centers.
Some states tried to limit the spread of machines under programs that require hospitals to obtain a certificate of need before buying new equipment. But private imaging centers, not subject to those controls, sprang up, including Medical Imaging Centers of America in San Diego and Health Images Inc. in Atlanta.
The New York State Department of Health, for instance, approved the purchase of 43 magnetic resonance imagers in state hospitals. But there are probably an additional 35 private imaging centers in New York City and Long Island alone, said John Milliren, director of appropriateness review for the New York State Department of Health.
Spurring the formation of these centers was the possibility of big profits. A 1988 letter seeking investors for one such center, East Bay Medical Imaging Services in Castro Valley, Calif., forecast a return to investors "in excess of 25 percent per year and in many cases substantially more." Similarly, Stuart, Coleman & Company of New York solicited investors for several imaging centers with the promise of a cash distribution of 400 percent over 10 years.
The way to realize those profits is to run many tests. A study by the New York State Department of Health estimated that a high volume imaging center could reduce the cost per scan below $250. Despite high volume, prices have not fallen.
To provide themselves with a steady stream of customers, imaging centers often sold part ownership to doctors, who could refer patients for tests. A recent survey for Florida's Health Care Cost Containment Board found that 75 percent of the imaging centers in the state had doctors as part or full owners.
Critics say this practice gives doctors a financial incentive to order tests that might not otherwise be called for.
 
'A Black Eye' for Medicine
 "It's going to give all medicine a black eye before it's over," said Daniel P. Chisholm, a radiologist in Little Rock, Ark. "There are too many studies being performed that are not necessary."
A study by Bruce J. Hillman of the University of Arizona published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December found that doctors who owned X-ray or ultrasound machines did 4 to 4.5 times as many tests as doctors who referred patients to radiologists, and also charged more for each test than radiologists did, over $100 more for the ultrasound exams.
Paying doctors a fee for each patient they refer to an imaging center would constitute an illegal kickback scheme, but a mere investment in such a center by a doctor is not illegal.
Starting next January, however, it will become illegal for doctors to refer Medicare patients for blood, urine and other tests to clinical laboratories in which they own an interest. Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, who wrote the law, has vowed to try to expand it to cover imaging centers.
 
Driven by the System
Legal Fears And High Fees
Even without the financial incentives, doctors say, there are numerous incentives for ordering diagnostic tests. One is the fear of a malpractice lawsuit if a doctor misses a problem. Malpractice suits are less of a threat in other countries because of different cultural traditions and legal approaches.
Another factor is that there are simply no incentives not to order a scan. The patient has little incentive to refuse a test because insurance usually covers it. And while doctors and patients might think twice if the imaging procedure were painful or risky, that is not the case with M.R.I., although some patients become claustrophobic inside the device during the nearly hourlong test.
"Because it's so good, it's done all the time," said Dr. Caronna, the New York neurologist.
Dr. Caronna said that 90 percent of the time that neurologists order M.R.I. scans no structural damage to the patient's nervous system is detected. Still, he said, ruling out such problems is valuable information in itself.
 
Higher Fees for Specialists
 In addition to worrying about overuse of such tests, some say their prices are needlessly high.
In part, this is because the medical system has always paid doctors more for performing sophisticated procedures than for more routine medical care. A study by Victor R. Fuchs and James S. Hahn of Stanford found that doctors in the United States are paid 80 percent more than those in Canada for routine patient evaluation and management, but three times as much for procedures.
Radiologists are the most highly paid specialists, second only to surgeons, according to the American Medical Association. The mean income after expenses for radiologists was $210,500 in 1989, as against an average for all doctors of $155,800.
One reason procedures like M.R.I. tests start out being expensive is that the technology is new. But the price did not fall even as the technology spread.
Blue Shield of California for instance, paid for 1,728 M.R.I. brain scans in 1987 at an average payment of $647. In 1989, it paid for twice as many procedures, 3,578, at an average payment of $708.
"Generally speaking, once a certain level of cost is established, it only goes in one direction from there, and that's up," said Randy Horn, a senior vice president of Mutual of Omaha, an insurance company.
 
Stepping on the Brakes
Forcing Doctors To Consider Cost
Society is now trying to contain its mushrooming health-care costs. Medicare is moving toward a system of payments to doctors based on relative value of the effort involved. The system will generally reduce payments to specialists like radiologists and surgeons.
Already, payments for radiological services are being cut about 20 percent in stages, starting in 1989. This year, Congress voted a special 10 percent cut in the Medicare payments for M.R.I. and CAT scans performed in imaging centers.
Medicare is also changing its rules on how it will reimburse hospitals for capital expenditures. The new rules will make hospitals "think twice" about buying expensive equipment like scanners, said Larry Haimovitch, a medical technology consultant in San Francisco.
In what could be the biggest change, Medicare is also planning to consider cost effectiveness, not just medical effectiveness, in deciding whether to pay for procedures and technology.
 
Ethical Questions
 But Medicare officials say they must first develop a methodology for determining cost effectiveness. Medical experts say this could involve some ethically touchy questions, like how valuable is it to keep an elderly person alive for six more months. Or what is the value of a diagnostic imaging procedure that detects a disease for which there is no treatment?
Into this more hostile environment steps the PET scanner, which is even more expensive than the M.R.I. machine and draws fees of $1,500 to $2,500. While CAT and M.R.I. scans show the structure of internal organs, PET scans show the functioning of organs by their uptake of radioactivally tagged glucose and other substances.
In heart disease, a PET scan can tell whether heart tissue that appears to be dead is in fact still alive and might be salvaged. PET scans have also proven of great value in guiding surgery to remove part of the brain in people with epilepsy, said John C. Mazziotta, a professor of neurology and radiology at the University of California at Los Angeles. PET scans also show promise for being able to diagnose neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and Huntington's, something that cannot be done with CAT or M.R.I. scans.
 
Lobbying for the PET
 But insurance companies are being cautious. So far they will reimburse for PET scans only in selected cases and are carefully weighing whether to extend coverage. The Health Insurance Association of America, for instance, has organized two seminars on PET scans for insurance company executives, the first of a series of seminars the organization plans to hold on new technologies. The Federal Office of Health Technology Assessment, which advises Medicare and other Federal health insurance programs, is also studying PET scans.
Supporters of PET scans, including manufacturers and doctors and hospitals that have used the machines, banded together a year ago to form the Institute for Clinical PET, to win reimbursement for the machines.
The group is financing clinical trials to show how PET scans can improve the outcome for patients. It has also organized conferences and studies on cost and reimbursement issues. Health experts say the fact that such a lobbying effort has to be mounted is one of the most visible signs of the changing economics of medical technology.

Chart: THE IMAGING ARMS RACE: THREE SCANNERS
 
CAT SCAN
 
In computerized axial tomography, also known as computerized tomography (C.T.), X-rays rotate around the body, producing pictures of cross-sectional slices of tissue.
 
Common uses: Diagnosis of brain disorders, sinus problems, complex fractures and abscesses. Evaluation of problems in chest and abdominal organs like liver, spleen and pancreas.
 
Cost of machine: $400,000 to $1.2 million
 
Typical fee: $300 to $500
 
Installed in 1990: 4,900
 
Advantages: Compared with conventional X-ray, provides far higher resolution and contrast in soft tissues, and useful images of adjacent "slices" of tissue. Taking only minutes, it is often best alternative for evaluating critical injuries.
 
Disadvantages: Less soft-tissue contrast than M.R.I. Exposure to radiation.
 
M.R.I. SCAN
 
In magnetic resonance imaging devices the body is subjected to radio waves in the presence of a powerful magnetic field. The waves excite atoms in body tissue, which emit detectable energy as they return to an unexcited state. Like CAT scan, produces cross-sectional pictures.
 
Common uses: Detection of brain tumors, disorders of the spinal column, multiple sclerosis. Evaluation of knees and other joints.
 
Cost of machine: $1.2 million to $2.5 million
 
Typical fee: $600 to $1,000
 
Installed in 1990: 1,990
 
Advantages: Compared with CAT, gives more subtle discrimination of soft tissue and is unaffected by bone, which limits CAT in lower head and spine. Can measure blood flow, enables study of cardiovascular structure without injection of agent to provide contrast. No exposure to radiation.
 
Disadvantages: Exam is slow, often lasting one hour; not as good as CAT for images of abdominal area.
 
PET SCAN
 
In positron emission tomography, radioactive isotopes are injected or inhaled and absorbed by organs. Energy from radioactive decay is detected, providing evidence of where the isotopes are being used.
 
Common uses: Evaluation of the health of heart tissue. Early detection of neurological diseases. Guiding surgery for epilepsy.
 
Cost of machine: $3.6 million to $4.2 million. Includes $1 million cost of cyclotron.
 
Typical fee: $1,500 to $2,000
 
Advantages: Provides valuable data on tissue function, metabolism and other subtle biochemical processes, not just structure as with other imaging devices.
 
Disadvantages: Exams may last more than an hour. Can require presence of cyclotron to generate short-lived isotopes for injection. Exposure to radiation.

No. 938 Was Slow in Arriving, but Henderson Ties Brock's Stolen-Base Record

BYLINE: By LEONARD KOPPETT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., April 28

 BODY:
Rickey Henderson got his long-awaited 938th stolen base today, tying the career record set by Lou Brock 12 years ago, as Brock watched from the stands among 40,174 spectators in the Oakland Coliseum. After being hit by a pitch on a 2-2 count with one out in the sixth inning, with Jeff Robinson pitching and Lance Parrish catching for the California Angels, Henderson stole second by a wide margin.
Almost as soon as Henderson reached the bag, Frank Loza, a groundskeeper, was racing out with a new second base, to replace the one that the Athletics' left fielder took to the dugout as a permanent memento of the milestone. The crowd gave Henderson a standing ovation, which he acknowledged by holding his hands high. Moments later, he cruised home on Jose Canseco's double into the left-field corner, extending Oakland's lead to 6-3. 
 The A's went on to defeat the California Angels, 7-3, giving Dave Stewart his second victory of the season after two straight defeats.
Before his final time at bat, Henderson had decided to come out of the game at the end of the inning because his injured leg was tightening up. "But getting hit by the pitch, I was frustrated and thought I might have a chance to do it then and there," he said.
Henderson had ended last season with 936 steals. His spring training this year was marked by controversy and criticism because he was seeking an upgrading of the four-year, $12 million contract he signed in the fall of 1989, to bring it into line with recent salary inflation. He reported late and played in few exhibition games.
But on opening night here, he got a warm reception from a capacity crowd as he received his most valuable player award for 1990. In the first inning of the game, he singled and stole second. But he was unsuccessful in two other attempts the next two days, and in the third game he strained a muscle in his left calf running out a grounder. The injury kept him out of 14 games, and when he returned from the disabled list Saturday, he played seven innings but failed to reach base in four times up.
Today, he singled in the first inning of Jim Abbott. But Abbott caught him leaning the wrong way and picked him off first. In the third, he singled again, with a man on first and none out, setting up what proved to be a four-run rally that gave the A's the lead. He went to third on Lance Blankenship's single and he and Blankenship scored on Canseco's first double.
In the fourth inning, Henderson took a called third strike. When he faced Robinson, who relieved Abbott in the fifth, it was with one out and nobody on in the sixth and the score 5-3. The 2-2 pitch hit him in the small of the back as he tried to turn away from it, but after hasty consultation with Manager Tony La Russa and the trainer, Barry Weinberg, he stayed in the game -- and promptly stole second.

HEADLINE: SIDELINES: INFLATION ROCKETS;
Hold That Line? Not for Argonauts

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI

 BODY:
To many, the deal still doesn't make sense. Why would Bruce McNall, the acquisitive owner of the Toronto Argonauts, pay Raghib (Rocket) Ismail more than he pays the rest of the team combined?
Total payroll pre-Rocket: $2 million. Rocket's 1991 salary: $3.5 million. 
 Theories abound. McNall wants to fold the team, allowing the National Football League to step in and deal with the Canadian Football League; he is putting the Rocket on pay-per-view in the States; he has lost his mind.
But the well-placed agent Barry Frank, who may be negotiating the Canadian television deal for the C.F.L., insists: "You can't look at this short range. The league is having a difficult time establishing an identity. This was a dramatic move."
Still, $18 million worth of drama?
Jon L. Edwards of San Francisco, Rocket's lawyer, describes the deal as follows:
Salary: $14 million over four years, or $3.5 million a year -- "cash, not deferred; a four-year personal services contract."
Other personal services: another $4 million guaranteed if endorsements don't reach this figure -- "compensating Raghib for losing potential income by leaving the United States."
Attendance clause: "He will participate over a certain base attendance."
Partnership with McNall and Wayne Gretzky, a part owner of the Argonauts and one of McNall's Los Angeles Kings: up to $1 million a year is earmarked for this arrangement -- "there is also a neat feature in that he will have an opportunity to be involved with Bruce and Wayne Gretzky in various enterprises."
Possible ownership: "There's been confusion here. Does he own part of the team? No. However, he has the same benefits of ownership. It is an entitlement if the team does well."
Meanwhile, the Argos are trying to improve on the C.F.L. contract of last year, which brought each team $650,000. They are trying to raise attendance from 30,000 fans a game. And McNall is sure to hear from the rest of his players, who average $57,000 apiece in income.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Gains and Losses in the Gulf

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Two months after the end of the Persian Gulf war we are beginning to have a more realistic sense of its gains and losses, the objectives that were and were not achieved. It is time for a preliminary reckoning.
Kuwait was rescued from Iraq's cruel occupation: That was the first positive result of the decision by the U.S. and its partners to go to war. 
 Second, the allied victory shattered -- at least for the moment -- the ability of Saddam Hussein's Iraq to attack its neighbors. Many of the weapons that alarmed Saudi Arabia and menaced Israel were destroyed.
Those are the only undoubted achievements. They matter. To roll back an aggression and remove a regional military threat are clear gains for international order.
But the objectives not achieved make a substantial list. At the top of it is the failure to see Saddam Hussein forced out of power. Much as President Bush insists now that Saddam's departure was never an aim of the war, everyone understood that it was a premise of the whole enterprise.
When the war ended with the Iraqi dictator still in power, U.S. intelligence sources leaked confident predictions that he would be out within a year. Those predictions have stopped. Saddam Hussein looks quite secure now, with his military forces still loyal to his commands, however brutal.
His survival has serious consequences. Neighboring governments that we hoped would work together for new understandings instead have their eyes nervously on Baghdad. There are reports already that he is rebuilding his army, finding covert ways to acquire new weapons.
We were told that the war would provide a chance to stop the Middle East arms race. That sounds like a bad joke now, with President Bush exhorting this country to compete aggressively for weapons orders from the region. Except possibly for exotic weapons, there is not going to be any attempt to limit the draining militarization of the region.
It was said that victory in the gulf would lead Arabs and Israelis to break out of their stalemate and look seriously for peace. In three trips to the Middle East, Secretary of State Baker has found the same old unwillingness to move.
Democracy was another banner as we went to war: Victory would introduce new elements of democracy and respect for human rights to the Middle East. To say that now is to invite mockery. More democracy in Saudi Arabia? More human rights in Kuwait? Feudalism and depression are the order of the day.
Last and saddest in this list of objectives not achieved is George Bush's New World Order. It would be, we hoped, an order based on respect for law and morality rather than on brute force.
But President Bush was intent on using force rather than waiting on the slower workings of diplomacy and economic pressure. And war had the consequences it always does: death, dislocation, moral disaster.
The costs of the war cannot yet be fully reckoned, because they are still occurring -- and will be for a considerable time. But they will be heavy.
The human costs, first. Fewer than 150 American soldiers died, a remarkable military achievement. But we did not pay much attention to the Iraqi casualties, which were staggering. A conservative estimate would be 100,000 Iraqi soldiers killed.
Civilian deaths are even harder to estimate, but they were and will be higher than than television's reflection of the official U.S. line led us to think. The destruction of the country's infrastructure -- electricity, water, sewage -- threatens to produce epidemics and famine.
Then there is the cost to Iraq's Kurds and Shiites, encouraged to revolt against Saddam Hussein and then slaughtered by his troops as Mr. Bush averted his gaze. And there is the environmental disaster of the burning oil wells in Kuwait.
Was the benefit worth the cost? Is the world a safer or better place after all the high moral talk about the purposes of this war? I think not.
Sanctions might not have forced Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait any time soon. But this was not Munich. We had drawn a line. He could go no farther, and the world was virtually as one in exerting pressure against him. The political and moral consequences of that course would have been better for the world, and for us.

HEADLINE: Essay;
The Decline of the East

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the aftermath of victory in the Persian Gulf war, we made three clearly discernible blunders.
1. We deceived ourselves by putting our fear of Iraq's national dismemberment ahead of the natural pressure toward ethnic autonomy. 
 2. We were wholly unprepared for the cruelty of a crumbling regime toward its own people, and for the Kurds' willingness to face catastrophic deprivation in exodus rather than the predations of the ruling elite.
3. We foolishly allowed ourselves to become prisoners of our stated policy (to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait) and thereby became powerless to pursue our real policy (to rid the world of Saddam Hussein's regime).
 Let's recognize those mistakes not to point fingers, though that can be fun, but to pave the way to answering this question: How can we apply those costly lessons of postwar Iraq to avoid worse mistakes in the aftermath of victory in the cold war? If we fail to read the gulf lessons, all three post-victory mistakes will be repeated on a global scale.
 Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin may lock each other in desperate embrace, but the central regime in Moscow is losing its legitimacy as completely, though not as suddenly, as the regime in Baghdad did. The Soviet Union is a zombie nation, an empire of the unwilling, no longer held together by an idea, or an identity, or sense of purpose; it has defeated itself as completely as Iraq did by inviting its aerial destruction.
Economic collapse looms; even the men said to be in charge in the Kremlin admit that. An exodus of the fearful and the hungry is a likelihood; the rush of a million Jews allowed to leave is an indicator of the tens of millions of other Soviets who will be drawn toward an inhospitable Europe.
 Political disintegration is a work in progress. The Baltic states are of right independent; other parts of the internal empire are determined to go; Russia and its remaining neighbor republics are lurching toward a looser union.
 We are again unprepared for victory. We are so careful to avoid the appearance of triumphalism -- with Mr. Bush murmuring his twin mantras of "mustn't gloat" and "mustn't get sucked in" -- that we risk watching the triumph of capitalism over Communism turn into a series of internal disasters posing external dangers.
 The first lesson of Iraq to apply to the Soviet implosion is this: Stop treating the union of republics as more important than the welfare of the constituent peoples. Order and stability are not always found in the status quo; on the contrary, when the tectonic plates underlying nation-states begin to move, we heighten the pressure by failing to recognize new realities.
 The second lesson has to do with our duty to intervene when a state's central leaders order their army to kill the people. We do not have the ability to intervene militarily in the self-defeated Soviet Union (or in China) as we do in defeated Iraq, but we now know we have the obligation to apply all the economic and diplomatic pressure we can bring to bear.
 In this regard, the human rights dimension can no longer be derided as goody-goody; television pictures of "bloody Sunday" and instantaneous commentary have made moral judgment and the force of global revulsion a part of realpolitik.
 The third lesson: We must not do in the ongoing Soviet collapse what we did in the sudden Iraqi collapse -- become captives of our stated goals to the detriment of our national purpose.
 In assembling a great convoy, even a superpower must go as slowly as the slowest necessary ship; that's what we did in the gulf, limiting our stated goal far short of our real, well-known and avowedly unstated purpose. But when the stated goal has been reached and the purpose is in view, we should not become crabbed by our own rhetoric; we should pursue our purpose more publicly.
 Our stated goal in the Soviet Union is stability and orderly change, but our officially unstatable purpose is to encourage the speediest move toward market salvation and the most sweeping devolution of political power.
 Thus are morality and practicality, once antithetical, now intertwined. History is just beginning; the last standing superpower cannot escape involvement in the consequences of its success and its adversary's failure. As we have seen in the microcosm of Iraq, when we pretend otherwise, we put ourselves to shame.

HEADLINE: This Fighter Will Bust the Budget

 BODY:
Peace dividend? The Air Force is acting as if it were about to cash in a war dividend. Last year the Pentagon and Congress ruled out taking advantage of a receding Soviet threat to reap sizable savings from defense. Instead, they agreed to hold the defense budget at current levels for three years.
Now the Air Force roars in with plans to procure an advanced tactical fighter, the F-22, in huge quantities. That $95 billion program would bust defense budgets wide open once the three-year hold-down ended. As the Congressional Budget Office just concluded, the Air Force can't afford to build enough of the new stealth fighters at nearly $79 million per copy and also buy new B-2 stealth bombers and C-17 cargo planes. 
 If the Air Force wants to buy all it can fly, Congress needs to make the hard choice: preferably postpone full procurement of the F-22, otherwise cancel the other aircraft to pay for the F-22.
Aerial combat requires a fighter plane that can outfly and outmaneuver enemy aircraft, and the F-22 is designed to do just that. And it uses stealth technology and sophisticated electronics to defeat enemy efforts to detect it. But all that comes at a very high price: the F-22 would be the most expensive aircraft procurement program ever.
What threat is the F-22 designed to meet? The Soviet Union and the march of technology, says the Air Force. But even if the Soviets could pose a formidable threat to neighbors, the Air Force already has two fighter planes, the F-15 at $45 million a copy and the F-16 at $20 million, that are superior to those in the Soviet Air Force or any other. And a collapsing Soviet economy is incapable of building the world's best fighter in the next decade.
That's why it makes sense to postpone procuring the F-22 and instead upgrade F-15's and F-16's to stay ahead of the field.
The Air Force now plans to trim its projected purchase to 650 F-22's from the 750 originally planned and close the F-15 and F-16 production lines in order to save some money to buy the new fighter. That may mitigate budget problems for now, but it won't avoid a budget crunch in years to come. And it leaves the Air Force without a fallback if the F-22, like other new weapons, fails to live up to advance billing or roll off assembly lines on time.
There's no reason for Congress to accept the Air Force's schedule for buying the full fleet of F-22's. It can keep the program alive by stretching out development. That would allow contractors to recoup losses in earlier stages of development and continue to produce some planes, while delaying a decision on full procurement until the next century, when the need for the fighter may become clearer.
If Congress intends to buy all or most of the 650 F-22's, it needs to cancel the questionable B-2 stealth bomber now. The B-2 was designed for nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. But the U.S. has more than enough weapons for that, especially as the number of Soviet targets declines. And the B-2 is not needed for conventional bombing, a job that B-52's, B-1's and stealth B-117's already do.
Another obvious candidate for savings is the C-17 cargo plane, which was originally supposed to be capable of ferrying materiel to shorter runways in hard-to-reach locales. Its price per copy has become exorbitant. And it no longer is designed to land on shorter runways. Buying more C-5's would be a much cheaper alternative.
The Air Force has yet to learn that nothing exceeds like excess. It's up to Congress to say so.

HEADLINE: Our Saigon Friends Still Need Help

BYLINE: By James Webb; James Webb, Secretary of the Navy during the Reagan Administration, is author of "Fields of Fire," a novel.

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
Sixteen years ago tomorrow, North Vietnamese tanks rolled into Saigon, ending a struggling democracy and handing the U.S. its most complete international humiliation. It is painful to recall how many Americans welcomed South Vietnam's fall, believing the Communists' war effort was driven more by a desire for national unification than by totalitarian ideology.
Those who accepted such assurances from Hanoi's leaders had some justification. After all, "independence and freedom" had been Ho Chi Minh's slogan. The Communist negotiators in Paris had shared a Nobel Peace Prize for the 1973 accords, which specified that "the South Vietnamese people's right to self-determination is sacred, inalienable, and shall be respected." They said that "the South Vietnamese people shall decide themselves the political future of South Vietnam through genuinely free and democratic elections under international supervision." 
 The results of North Vietnam's conquest were, of course, markedly different. The Communists sent almost the entire young leadership of the South into re-education camps, where many thousands died and the strongest languished for a decade and more, only to return as virtual non-citizens. Even their children still suffer discrimination; according to the International League for Human Rights, one in three South Vietnamese is categorized as "compromised because of family ties."
The Communist Government aligned itself closely with the Soviets and gave them their first warm-water naval bases in the Pacific. It developed a disastrous state-run economy that allowed no individual initiative and made Vietnam one of the world's poorest nations.
Internally, it continues to preach hatred toward the U.S. and those who fought alongside us. One need only visit the former residence of President Nguyen Van Thieu -- now an "exhibition house" of U.S. "war crimes" -- to see how vitriolic the propaganda remains.
These failed policies have caused unprecedented criticism from within the party, which is struggling to find new solutions to the nation's problems. Respected voices such as that of the now-exiled Bui Tin, an army colonel and deputy editor of the party daily, and Nguyen Khac Vien, Vietnam's best-known historian, have urged officials to embrace democratic freedoms or face, as Mr. Vien put it, "the last chance of the party to continue its leading role." He said that "otherwise, nothing can prevent its degeneration."
In response to the criticism and to reduced Soviet aid, Hanoi permitted economic liberalization, which has stirred the beginnings of rejuvenation, particularly in the south. But Hanoi has also intensified the repression of political dissenters. The International League for Human Rights reports that a wave of arrests that began a year ago has grown into the largest such campaign since 1975.
Nguyen Dan Que, a prominent physician arrested last June, has spent 10 of the last 12 years imprisoned without charges for leading a nonviolent democracy movement like those in Eastern Europe. When Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska repeatedly asked to see him while visiting Vietnam this month, he was coolly rebuffed by the chairman of the Council of Ministries, Do Muoi, and Interior Minister Mai Chi Tho. I was with Senator Kerrey, and the official message conveyed to me after a five-day wait was that Dr. Que was "recently arrested," that he was still "undergoing interrogation" and that it would be inappropriate for him to be visited from "the outside."
That this decision came directly from the Interior Minister indicates how tightly even nonviolent dissent is controlled. In other areas of national life, Hanoi officially proclaims equal treatment of its citizens, but officials implementing Government policy, carrying hatreds from the war, seem to practice de facto apartheid: Those who served the former South Vietnamese Government and their families are denied employment, education and medical benefits.
Bui Tin, frustrated with the lack of movement toward democracy, says the leaders "don't need good advice -- they need psychiatric help." He says, "They are . . . there for self-interest and not the common good." But Washington has not pressed this issue; instead, it has focused on Vietnam's external affairs rather than on demanding better treatment for those who fought alongside us.
For example, although the State Department announced last week that $1 million will be earmarked for much-needed prosthetic aid for amputees in the south, it received no guarantees that former South Vietnamese soldiers will get such help.
Richard H. Solomon, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, announced earlier this month that the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations could begin as soon as Hanoi met two conditions -- that it help end the Cambodian civil war and that it invigorate the effort to resolve the issue of Americans still missing in action.
While both conditions are important, neither is relevant to the reasons we severed relations in the first place. Nor will they help those who fought at our side; Hanoi considers its treatment of those "compromised because of family ties" an internal matter and has not put it on the table. But the plight of those suffering because of loyalty to the U.S. is not a matter our negotiators should waive. We simply cannot turn a blind eye to past commitments.
The restoration of relations with Vietnam involves complex emotional, diplomatic and economic issues that are perhaps without precedent in our history. We have never before abandoned an ally on the battlefield -- an ally, incidentally, whose casualty rate was 40 times ours -- and not returned. It would be ironic if we normalized relations as a reward for Vietnam's support of free elections in Cambodia while not addressing the need for democracy -- and full equality -- in Vietnam itself.
This is not to say normalization should not occur. There are sound humanitarian and economic reasons to become involved in Vietnam again. Moreover, Vietnam's loosening of economic restrictions has U.S. business worried that other countries will make irreversible inroads.
Japan is exploiting the economic liberalization. Last year, 2,000 Japanese Chamber of Commerce members visited Vietnam, and 15,000 are expected this year. France, Singapore and Australia were visibly represented during my trip to Ho Chi Minh City, which is beginning to radiate a hopeful vibrancy after the years of war and internecine retaliation.
But unless an agreement that allows U.S. investment to flow freely into Vietnam also guarantees that the benefits flow to all Vietnamese -- especially our former allies and their families -- that agreement would be viewed as little more than capitalist greed, a prop for the regime and reinforcement of the shame felt by those who supported us.
Vietnam is the great unfinished morality play of our time. The main issue the renewal of relations poses is whether we can sort through past errors while not forgetting the sincere intentions of our failed effort to preserve South Vietnam from Communism. The coming months offer Americans, no matter what their position on the war, a chance to show respect for those whom we abandoned under fire, keeping the faith when we did not. And many have paid grievously behind a wall of silence whose terrors are only now beginning to be fully unveiled.

HEADLINE: Early Returns for a Police Strategy

 BODY:
Crimes reported in New York City last year fell by a modest 0.3 percent. But behind that undramatic figure lie others that may give early, intriguing encouragement to Police Commissioner Lee Brown's ideas about crime control.
Last year, in response to rising fear, Mr. Brown announced two programs to address crime by redeploying officers, well before any expansion of the force. In one, Operation Take Back, extra foot patrol officers were sent to seven high-crime precincts; they were backed up by teams of undercover narcotics officers, detectives and others. 
 The second effort, begun in April and expanded dramatically in July, required all desk-bound officers to serve in uniform on the street one day a week. Despite much initial grousing in the ranks, the program has resulted in some 83,000 additional daily tours of duty for uniformed officers.
Now police statisticians point to encouraging results. Since the beginning of Operation Take Back last July 23, reports of homicide have fallen by 9 percent and robbery by 10 percent in the seven precincts, even though both crimes rose citywide last year and were rising in the seven precincts until the operation began. The researchers detect no displacement of crime to nearby precincts.
In addition, rates of reported crime for the city as a whole, after rising for the first half of last year, in comparison with 1989, began to fall in July and have been falling ever since.
There is room for skepticism. Crime also fell in some precincts with no special programs. And levels of crime also are affected by the economic slump and the waning of the crack epidemic.
But for now, none of that appears to explain the figures so much as the police actions themselves. In terms of time and place, the relationship between the declines, the new foot patrols and the increased focus on crime-ridden precincts is too compelling to be merely coincidental.
To that extent, the data add weight to the new theories of policing and new deployment strategies embraced by Commissioner Brown -- more foot patrol, more coordinated proactive response to crime problems and more community involvement, as well as greater manpower.
To be sure, the statistics are early indicators. A violent summer could quickly reverse their promise. For now, though, the research boosts the credibility of Mr. Brown's approach, and not only among fearful citizens.
"Too many cops in sight -- it's intimidating," one Times Square hustler told a Times reporter. "They're tightening the bolts, and crime is definitely down."

HEADLINE: U.S. PLAN TO BURN CHEMICAL WEAPONS STIRS PUBLIC FEAR

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Ky.

 BODY:
Hampered by flaws in design and operation, the Army's program to incinerate the nation's enormous stockpile of chemical weapons is falling years behind schedule, experiencing huge cost increases and stirring public protests in six states and the South Pacific.
Taxing in equal measures the nation's technological know-how, the Treasury and the public trust, the Army's Chemical Demilitarization Program is one of the extraordinarily complex and expensive projects the United States has undertaken to dispose of the wastes and destroy the deadly weapons of the cold war. 
 The project is part of the more than $200 billion the Pentagon has proposed to spend in the next 30 to 50 years to prevent the spread of poisons and clean up its contaminated bases and munitions factories. An even larger project to contain radioactive and toxic wastes at nuclear weapons plants is being managed by the Energy Department. Altogether, the Government is spending nearly $6 billion this fiscal year on military environmental projects.
 
A Treaty and a Mandate
 Driven by Congressional mandates and a chemical arms treaty President Bush signed with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union last June, the Army has proposed burning all its mustard gas and nerve agents -- 60 million to 70 million pounds of the world's deadliest chemicals -- in nine incinerators.
Eight of them are to be built at military bases in the United States where chemical weapons have been stored for decades. The weapons are at depots in this town, near Lexington, Ky.; Anniston, Ala.; Pine Bluff, Ark.; Pueblo, Colo.; Newport, Ind.; Aberdeen, Md.; Umatilla, Ore., and Tooele, Utah.
The ninth site is on Johnston Atoll, 700 miles southwest of Honolulu in the South Pacific. An incinerator has already been built on the atoll, which has been a military test site for more than 40 years.
 
Aging, Useless Weapons
 Most of the chemicals are 30 years or older and have become obsolete because age has caused the chemicals to deteriorate and because the necessary guns and launching platforms no longer exist.
Army scientists say incineration is more reliable and safer than any other technology they have studied. In 1984, a study by the National Research Council, a unit of the National Academy of Sciences, reached the same conclusion.
The Army also says the risk of an accident during incineration is much smaller than if chemical weapons were left alone. It says that some of the munitions, particularly the 69,000 rockets stored at the Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot here, are deteriorating and that handling them is becoming more dangerous every year.
But critics in Kentucky and other states say these statements are no more accurate than others the Army has made about the program. Saying there are safer and cheaper disposal methods, the critics say the Army's own studies have reported problems with experimental incinerators.
 
Legislation From 1985
 In 1985, Congress passed legislation requiring destruction of the stockpile by 1994. The directive was part of an agreement under which Congress allowed the Pentagon to produce a new generation of chemical weapons, the first built since the late 1960's.
The Army said in 1985 that the incineration technology was well proven and it estimated the cost of the program at $1.7 billion. In 1988, after the Army acknowledged trouble at its experimental incinerator in Utah, Congress amended the law and extended the deadline until 1997. The cost estimate then climbed to $3 billion.
Auditors with the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, now say the Army may not be finished before 2002, the deadline in the Soviet treaty. In addition, costs have soared to more than $4 billion.
The Army has spent $1.2 billion on the program since 1986 and in some respects it has blazed new engineering and political paths for Pentagon environmental projects, said Charles Baronian, the deputy program manager.
More than $133 million was used to try to prove the technology in a small incinerator at the Tooele Army Depot, 25 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. A larger $240 million prototype incinerator was constructed on Johnston Atoll.
The Army spent $162 million building a small advanced incinerator and safely destroying BZ, a hallucinogen, at the Pine Bluff Arsenal, 30 miles southeast of Little Rock, Ark. Last summer, despite opposition in Europe, the United States and the South Pacific, the Army spent $53 million moving more than 400 tons of chemical arms from American bases in Germany to Johnston Atoll without incident.
The Army has also spent more than $340 million studying the safety of incineration, considering alternatives, conducting environmental studies, holding public hearings and financing community groups to review the Army's conduct.
"The Army has bent over backwards to be sympathetic to the concerns of citizens," said Mr. Baronian in a telephone interview from the project's headquarters at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. "We've followed the law and done this as best as we could, as best as it could have been done."
 
Satisfaction in 2 States
 In Utah and Alabama, citizens say they are satisfied with how the Army conducted itself and have overwhelming supported proposed incinerators . Not surprisingly, the Army's first $259 million full-scale incinerator is under construction at Tooele, and a second is nearing final stages of design at Anniston.
But in the six other states, and in the island nations of the South Pacific, the Army's proposal to burn its collection of rockets, land mines, projectiles and bombs filled with chemical warfare agents has caused communities to react with disgust and horror.
The latest protest occurred last Thursday when 1,000 residents of Madison County, Ky., jammed a school gymnasium to confront Army officials who want to build a $250 million incinerator to burn thousands of rockets stored at the 15,000-acre Lexington-Blue Grass depot.
"It is just hard for us to believe that this safe little community is where chemical weapons will be burned," said Faye Lakes, the 48-year-old manager of a grocery store in Speedwell, on the southeast boundary of the depot and less than three miles downwind from the proposed incinerator site.
Opal Gentry, Faye's 70-year-old mother and the store's owner, added: "People are going to keep it out. Mind you, we will."
 
Residents See a Threat
 A green land of rolling pastures and hardwood forests on the southern edge of the Cumberland plateau, this area was settled in the late 18th century by Daniel Boone and his followers. Residents feel as though they and their ancestors purchased with their blood and their lives this land's gentle beauty and brimming prosperity.
When the Army announced more than six years ago that it intended to incinerate the rockets, it was seen as a threat to a way of life; the reaction was so striking that some residents said even they were surprised. The anger has not lessened at all.
In the last two weeks, the City Councils in Richmond and Berea, 12 miles south of here, have unanimously passed resolutions urging the Army to halt its program. The Madison County Fiscal Court, the county governing body, also passed a resolution protesting the incinerator, as did the faculty of Berea College, the student senate at Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond and a host of other organizations.
"You ever find anybody who does trust their Government?" asked Roscoe V. Buckland, an 81-year-old retired professor of education who lives in Berea. "The Army's gotten the idea they can just push people around out here. You know this is Daniel Boone country. People aren't going to be pushed around."
There is still great resentment here about the seizure in World War II of the county's best farmland to establish the depot. People became angrier in the 1970's when they learned that the military had filled 49 concrete storage bunkers at the depot with obsolete M-55 rockets containing chemicals so dangerous that a tiny drop on the skin or absorbed through the eyes is lethal.
The evidence of potential problems is overwhelming, opponents say. The Army's own studies reported problems at the new incinerator on Johnston Atoll.
At one point, the incinerator leaked trace amounts of chemicals into the air, the Army said. In other tests, the incinerator failed to function 80 percent of the time. Designed to incinerate 192 rockets a day, the equipment was capable of destroying fewer than 50 on the days it operated. Conveyor belts melted, the incinerator overheated and automatic equipment broke down.
 
$4 Million on Improvements
 Mr. Baronian, the deputy program manager, said that the Army was spending nearly $4 million to change equipment at Johnston Atoll and that subsequent tests had shown better performance.
Peter Hille, an instructor at Berea College, said residents of central Kentucky were worried about the release of cancer-causing chemicals. "There isn't an incinerator in the world that has performed anywhere close to what this one has to, to be safe," he said. "There isn't any room for error."
Other opponents said they fear that once the stockpile was burned, that would not be the end of it.
"They say it will only take a year and a half to burn rockets out there," said Katherine Flood, a retired banker from Richmond. "You can bet they have other plans for a $250 million incinerator they've only used a year or two."
Although Congress in 1985 specifically barred use of the incinerators for any other purpose, lawmakers changed their position in 1988 and asked the military to study other uses. This month, a study for the Army by the Mitre Corporation, an engineering and study group, said the incinerators would be useful in destroying surplus munitions and disposing of soil and contaminated equipment. The study said economic factors and political opposition made alternative uses at the Lexington-Blue Grass depot unrealistic.
Mrs. Flood and other critics say they want the rockets to be moved, perhaps to Utah, where far fewer people would be exposed to danger. Barring that, the Army has been asked to consider what opponents say are safer, less costly alternatives for destroying the weapons, including the use of bacteria, chemical treatment, concentrated sunlight and high-pressure steam.
Mr. Baronian said that such methods were not nearly as well-researched as incineration and that investing in their development would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and cause further delays.
As for moving the weapons from Kentucky to another base, that would also present difficulties. As William R. Bryant, the chemical safety officer at the Lexington-Blue Grass depot, put it: "We've got eight states that have nerve agents. There are 42 states that don't. And the 42 states that don't want nothing to do with shipping nerve gas across state lines."

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 29 about the Army's program to incinerate chemical weapons placed Johnston Atoll incorrectly, and an article on Jan. 26, 1990, about Kilauea Volcano placed Hawaii incorrectly in some copies. A recent letter from a geographer points out that both are in the North Pacific, not the South Pacific.

HEADLINE: U.S. Airlines Get Warning

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
The Transportation Secretary said today that if United States airlines fail to control their costs they could find Congress writing a labor agreement for them as it did recently for the railroads.
Samuel K. Skinner told the Society of American Business Editors and Writers that cost control was the biggest problem facing the American airline industry. 
 If the industry does not control its costs, he said, "it cannot grow, it cannot remain productive and we will find ourselves 10 years from now going to a situation that we all found uncomfortable last week, when Congress mandated settlements for management and labor in the rail industry."
Mr. Skinner said, "You cannot raise costs without increases in productivity at an annualized rate of 10 percent a year for your flight crews when inflation is 4 percent and claim you've got costs under control."
Mr. Skinner reiterated that the 1982 deregulation of the industry would continue to claim some carriers, but that "just because an airline goes out of business doesn't mean we don't have competition."

HEADLINE: Careers;
More Math, Well Taught, Is Her Goal

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
PATRICIA CLARK KENSCHAFT, a mathematics professor at Montclair State College, would like to see two things happen in the nation's schools. She would like to see more students, especially women, major in mathematics and she would like to see better-trained math teachers in the elementary grades to give pupils a grounding at an early age.
Ms. Kenschaft believes that many elementary school teachers, while well versed in other subjects, do not know enough about math. "I have found many elementary school teachers in New Jersey who do not understand how to find the area of a rectangle," she said last week. 
 For the pupils, the early years are critical. "Third graders are educable and eager to learn," she said, "but when students reach fifth grade without good math training, I cannot reach them."
Ms. Kenschaft is the director in New Jersey of Primes, an acronym for Project for Resourceful Instruction of Mathematics in Elementary School, which is primarily financed by the Federal Government.
"Elementary school teachers want to learn," she said, "and we are trying to reach them, because if you don't know math you cannot teach it."
Few state laws require elementary school teachers to be skilled in mathematics. Most have majored in teaching, writing, English, social studies or other areas, but few in math.
Partly because of poor teaching, many pupils get "turned off mathematics" by the time they reach the eighth grade, she said. The problem is then compounded in high school because many of these students do not take the basic courses needed to pursue a math major in college.
Deficiencies in the way math is taught seem to be hurting women in greater numbers than men, Ms. Kenschaft said. She is the co-author of a booklet, "Winning Women Into Mathematics," which lists 55 reasons why fewer women than men major in mathematics. The 78-page booklet is a publication of the Mathematical Association of America.
Some of these reasons stem from age-old misconceptions that boys have a biological edge over girls in math. But cultural reasons do seem to give boys a disposition toward math.
"Traditional games and hobbies for boys help develop their quantitative and geometric skills," Ms. Kenschaft said, mentioning activities like baseball, computer war games and scale model building.
"Boys are more apt to have a home computer than girls," she added.
Dr. Kenschaft criticized school career counseling for often failig to give girls "crucial information about mathematics," even as preparation for female-oriented careers like nursing and social work.
Another problem is a lack of role models. In four-year colleges, women make up only about 15 percent of the mathematics teachers, which means fewer role models for undergraduates who might be interested in majoring in mathematics, she said.
Many fewer women than men obtain master's degrees in math, and there is a shortage of women with doctoral degrees in the field, she said.
"In 1988-1989 about 24 percent of doctorates in mathematics were awarded to women, and in 1989-90, the last year for which I have a report, the figure was 22 percent," she said.
The percentages look as if doctoral degrees for women stayed relatively constant, but in terms of the number of degrees awarded to women, and men, the numbers show a big drop, she said. In the late 1970's, she explained, men became discouraged by the weak job demand for students with doctorates in mathematics. "The risks of getting a doctorate in the field were not worth the payoff," she said. "In the 1960's, about 6 percent of majors were in mathematics, and now it is less than one-half of 1 percent. We're going backward fast."
Ms. Kenschaft said a variety of good jobs awaited mathematicians, and not just in teaching. The fields include research, computer services, engineering, architecture, aerospace, banking and insurance. Insurance companies, for example, need actuaries -- highly trained mathematicians who figure the odds for insurance policy premiums. Another big employer is the Federal Government, which needs cryptographers, economists and others with backgrounds in mathematics.
To gain extra career flexibility, Ms. Kenschaft suggested that math students major in another subject as well. Math and computer science, English, philosophy, physics or economics are a few of the combinations that she suggested.
"Math presents a student with a wide variety of career choices," she said. Salaries for those right out of college usually are in the mid-$20,000 range, less than engineers receive but in line with other liberal arts majors.
In mathematics, she said, competence is much easier to measure than in many fields because it is more objective. "Answers usually are either right or wrong," she said.

HEADLINE: Spending Up 0.6%; Income Gains a Bit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Consumers increased their spending by sixth-tenths of a percent in March, the Government reported today. It was the second monthly advance, and analysts said it could mean the end of the recession is near.
But they also noted that the Commerce Department report included a relatively weak two-tenths of a percent increase in personal income, which could dampen a recovery. 
 Personal consumption rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.77 trillion, up from $3.75 trillion the previous month, the department said. It revised the February rate from a six-tenths of a percent advance to a 1 percent increase, the biggest gain since a 1.2 percent rise last June. It followed a five-tenths od a percent drop in January.
 
'At Least Some Spark'
 Economists were encouraged by the month-to-month growth in consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
"It suggests we came out of the first quarter with at least some spark in economic activity, suggesting that perhaps the downturn is coming to an end," said David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities firm. "But with personal income coming in at such a slow pace, it may be some time before consumers can sustain a strong pickup in spending."
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, agreed.
"The conclusion seems to be that the rate of decline is diminishing and the worst is behind us," Dr. Sohn said. "But it's too early to have an economic upturn anytime soon. In order to come to a conclusion, we will have to have employment rising for at least a couple of months."
With spending outpacing income growth, Americans' savings rate fell to 3.7 percent of after-tax income in March, the lowest since a similar rate in November 1988.
Income totaled $4.75 trillion, up from $4.73 trillion a month earlier, the Commerce Department said. It was the second consecutive two-tenths of a percent monthly gain, wiping out a four-tenths of a percent loss in January.
Disposable income, which is income after taxes, also rose two-tenths of a percent, the same as February's increase, the Commerce Department report said. It had fallen four-tenths of a percent in January.
Wages and salaries, important components of the income category, increased by a total of $4.2 billion, after falling $200 million in February. They had plummeted by a total of $13.6 billion in January.
Spending on durable goods -- items expected to last more than three years -- increased by $7.2 billion, after gaining $19.6 billion in February. The report said that motor-vehicle purchases were primarily responsible for both months' increases.

HEADLINE: Boeing Reports 2% Increase In First-Quarter Earnings

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 29

 BODY:
The Boeing Company today reported a slight increase in earnings for the first quarter, but it said sales were down, primarily because fewer 747 jumbo jets were delivered than in the period last year.
The results were in line with most analysts' estimates, and on the New York Stock Exchange today, Boeing shares closed at $45.875, down 25 cents. 
 For the quarter, Boeing said it earned $309 million, or 90 cents a share, up 2 percent from $302 million, or 87 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Sales dropped 6 percent, to $6.09 billion, from $6.44 billion in the 1990 quarter.
Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that Boeing's commercial aircraft earnings were lower than those for the 1990 period because of lower sales volume and higher research and development costs associated with the 777 program, a midsize jet transport under development. Lower losses in the military and space unit, higher income elsewhere and a lower tax rate offset the reduced sales, he said.
The comparison with last year's first quarter is distorted because nine fewer 747's were delivered this year. In the first quarter of 1990, 22 were delivered, an unusually large number, because of delays caused by a strike in the fourth quarter of 1989. The Seattle-based company said second-quarter 1991 sales and deliveries should be substantially above the first quarter, partly because of increased airline delivery requirements, and a different model mix.
"On average, sales for the next three quarters will be about 7 percent higher than they were in the year-ago periods," said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. "Traditionally, Boeing's first and third quarters are soft and we've just returned to a more seasonal pattern. In this environment, for an airline-related company to report positive earnings comparisons is not bad."
Boeing said that to date, requests by airline customers to reschedule deliveries as a result of the Persian Gulf war and the recession have been few, and no cancellations have occurred. During the first quarter, 11 customers ordered 29 commercial jet transports and 13 commuter aircraft valued at $3.3 billion, compared with orders for 91 jets and 3 commuter planes valued at $7.7 billion in the first quarter of 1990.
The company's military and space unit continued to operate at a loss, but its losses were lower than in the period a year ago. Although the unit is expected to incur an operating loss for 1991, it will be significantly less than in 1990, Boeing said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
7 Nations' Vague Promises Disappoint Dollar's Buyers

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was narrowly mixed yesterday as traders sold the currency following lack of agreement between the world's seven richest countries to lower interest rates.
Gold finished lower. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $352.10 an ounce, down $1.80 from late Friday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $352.10 an ounce, off $1.40 from late Friday. 
 The dollar was bid up in anticipation of an accord among the finance ministers and central bankers to lower interest rates worldwide. But the Group of Seven countries issued a statement Sunday that made only vague promises to take unspecified actions "as needed" to lift world growth while promoting price stability.
The dollar opened higher against the German mark in New York, but traders began selling the currency when it exceeded 1.7700 German marks, said Michael Kahn, senior foreign exchange trader at Credit Suisse.
 
Unchanged at 1.7510 Marks
 Mr. Kahn said the dollar's rise against the mark enabled traders to cover technical trades made in advance of the Group of Seven meeting. The dollar finished at 1.7510 marks, unchanged from late Friday.
Stephen Flanagan, vice president at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., described the day's trading as "buy the rumor and sell the fact." Mr. Flanagan said many speculators influenced trading, particularly on a day when the Tokyo currency markets were closed because of a national holiday in Japan, Greenery Day.
In London, the dollar was quoted at 137.60 yen. Later in New York, it fell to 136.50 yen, down from late Friday's 138.10 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6765, from $1.6860 late Friday. Sterling rose in New York, where it cost $1.6980 to buy £1, more expensive than late Friday's $1.6905.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.4730 Swiss francs, down from 1.4766; 5.9095 French francs, down from 5.9110; 1,294 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.15325 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1523.
In London, gold fell to a late bid price of $351.00 an ounce, from $353.75 late Friday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $351.00, from $353.50 late Friday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 75 cents to close at $354.10.
Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $3.88 an ounce, from $3.92 late Friday. But on the Comex, silver for current delivery was up 3 cents an ounce, to $3.915.

HEADLINE: Costs of Drug Research Seen as Overestimated

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Government economists said in a draft report circulating in Washington that the estimates of research costs frequently cited by spokesmen for drug companies were too high and based on information that could not be independently substantiated. The report questions the pharmaceutical industry's main justification for the high prices of many new drugs.
In a preliminary 741-page draft of a report to Congress, the Office of Technology Assessment, a Congressional advisory bureau, said the industry's $221 million estimate of the cost of developing a drug was "an arbitrary number with no intrinsic meaning" except to show that such costs were increasing. It said the out-of-pocket cost of a new drug that took about 14 years to develop was $128 million in 1990. 
 Jeffrey L. Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said the industry group had full confidence in its statistics. He said that the money the drug makers spend on research has doubled every five years since 1970, and will reach $9.2 billion this year.
Mr. Trewhitt said it would be "premature for us to comment because just a small portion of the study has been divulged." He added, "It is our understanding that key findings and conclusions have not been divulged." The report will be completed later this year after a review by a business and consumer advisory panel.
Some members of Congress have crticized drug companies that charge thousands of dollars for a year's supply of drugs to treat AIDS and some other life-threatening diseases. One critic, Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat, said the report was "the first objective evaluation of the cost of developing a new drug." Mr. Metzenbaum said several previous estimates were made by university researchers whose studies were financed by drug companies.
 
'They Had Control'
 And Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who heads the health subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, said, "The drug companies have consistently refused to make research and development costs available for public scrutiny and until now they had control over the debate over the reasons for high drug prices. Mr. Waxman had requested the study in 1988. Mr. Metzenbaum, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, endorsed the project.
An industry newsletter, the Washington Drug Letter, offered the report for sale last week for $129 a copy, not long after it was sent to members of the advisory panel for comment.
Industry economists said their estimates of research costs include the time it takes to develop a drug and the cost of capital expressed in accounting language as the present value of a company's future spending. The study by the Office of Technology Assessment said it found no evidence of "dramatic increases in the time required for clinical research" to explain reports of sharply rising research costs. The study also said the financial risks for large pharmaceutical companies were "very low" because they "have so little debt."
The study added that drug research does involve a "business risk" because it may take years to produce a drug. It added that the revenues have been enormous: Average sales for new drugs introduced between 1984 and 1988 were at least $40 million in the first year, the report said. Average sales for new drugs introduced between 1981 and 1983 were at least $110 million by the ninth year they were on the market.
Frederick M. Scherer, a former chief economist of the Federal Trade Commission and chairman of the panel advising on the study, said he was "appalled that it leaked." Mr. Scherer, an economics professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said he would withhold any comment until the panel meets next week to evaluate the report.
Gene Kimmelman, a panel member and legislative director with the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer advocacy group, said, "The industry has always hidden behind its research and development costs, when concerns have been raised about the high prices that consumers are paying for drugs." He said consumers had concerns about "how long the patents on drugs should run and whether the drug makers are competing actively against each other in the marketplace."
The Office of Technology Assessment study also said that the drug companies benefited from $2.4 billion in tax credits in 1987, which reduced their Federal taxes by 59 percent.

HEADLINE: Canada's National Health Plan Gives Care to All, With Limits

SERIES: The Price of Health: Third of Five Articles

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
Since a heart attack in 1989, Len Quesnelle has had a dozen tests to study the blocked arteries of his heart, spent weeks in intensive care because of chest pain and finally, in March, had a triple bypass.
He has seen his share of doctors and hospitals, but he has never received a bill, paid a health insurance premium or filled out a health insurance form. Although the price for his recent surgery, calculated in American dollars, was $14,000, he paid less than $200, for telephone calls and renting a television.
 
Comprehensive Health Insurance
 As a citizen of Canada, Mr. Quesnelle is a beneficiary of one of the world's most comprehensive health insurance programs, the Canadian national health plan, which uses tax money to provide medical care to everyone at no charge. 
 But during his 18-month ordeal, Mr. Quesnelle often had to wait weeks for tests and treatment, and he almost had a second heart attack in the three-month wait before his surgery. Such delays, typical in Canada for certain costly procedures, would be considered imprudent, if not malpractice, in the United States.
At a time when some 33 million Americans lack insurance, the Canadian health care system serves as a taunting reminder that with a few compromises it is possible to provide quality care for everyone, and for less money. In Canada there are few machines to blast apart kidney stones, but no women go without prenatal care. There is no Mayo Clinic, but there are also no emergency rooms teeming with people who cannot afford a family doctor.
 
'Embarrassment to the U.S.'
 "Canada is an embarrassment to the United States," said Vickery Stoughton, an American who is the president of Toronto Hospital.
But a majority of Americans, accustomed to receiving the most advanced medical care in an instant, without regard to price, may not be embarrassed enough to accept Canadian-style compromises.
About the time Mr. Quesnelle had his surgery in Toronto, William Beagle had elective bypass surgery at Buffalo General Hospital, across Lake Ontario from Toronto. For a nine-day stay he received more than 50 bills totalling more than $50,000, each of which he submitted with a claim form to Metropolitan Life, which paid all but $18.
Since his case was complicated and would tie up his surgeon for an entire day, Mr. Beagle waited a long time for his operation by American standards: 10 days. The Toronto Hospital looks the same as any prestigious urban American center: computers in every room, transplant patients in intensive care units, even the same antiseptic smell hanging in the halls. But the health care structure behind the facade could hardly be more different.
Every Canadian, rich or poor, is promised equal access to doctors and hospitals through provincial insurance plans that cover nearly all medical expenses. With the flash of a red-and-white card, patients can obtain everything from nutritional counseling to lung transplants. Patients select their family doctors, and doctors for the most part order whatever tests they like, without the paperwork required by insurers that eats up a growing share of American medical costs.
Despite the governmental largess, Canada spends an average of 30 percent less per person on health care than the United States, for a stable total of 9 percent of the gross domestic product. The American level reached 12 percent of gross domestic product in 1989 and continues a relentless climb.
To make sure the country lives within its allotted means, the Canadian Federal and provincial governments control hospital operating budgets with an iron fist and doctor's fees through bargaining with provincial medical associations. To rein in costs, the government limits the number of specialists who are trained, limits purchases of expensive equipment and restricts costly procedures like open heart surgery to a few university hospitals.
 
New Things Come Slowly
 To get the most for its money, the system is slow to offer expensive new machines and procedures, waiting until their medical value is solidly proved -- and, critics say, proved again.
And so the price of universal access is a degree of inconvenience and delay and, in fast-changing fields, sometimes settling for last year's treatment. Typical is the case of Albert Palmer, a 72-year-old farmer from Scarborough, Ontario. He waited from January to April for an operation to improve the blood supply to his feet, which had become agonizingly painful whenever he walked. Though there was no great danger, he had to endure the pain and supervise planting of his pea fieds from a chair.
While the quality of care remains generally high, Canada's health system is showing signs of distress. Doctors predict that a barrage of expensive new technologies and an aging, sicker population will strain finances in the coming decade, leaving patients with longer waits, outdated technology, and even overt rationing.
"The only way you can afford universal health care is to run everything like a VW, which in the end gets you from place to place" said Dr. Alan Hudson, surgeon-in-chief at Toronto Hospital who will become its chief executive in July. "The problem is we try to run everything as almost a Cadillac. As medical costs rise, we can't afford it."
 
Satisfied Patients
 
Canadians Say System Is the Best
If patient satisfaction is the measure of good medicine, then the Canadian system is a resounding success. Ask a Canadian whether he uses the national system, and you get a perplexed pause. Of course he does: medical care outside the system is virtually outlawed. But more than that, Canadians are convinced the system is without rival.
"You don't want to wait when you're in pain, but there's no other choice," Mr. Palmer, the farmer, recently said. Far from threatening a malpractice suit, he added what is almost a Canadian refrain. "But I waited because this is the best medicine in the world."
Asked if he had ever considered going to the United States for treatment, Joseph Breglia, a 53-year-old Toronto lawyer who has been battling leukemia for five years, replied simply, "Not even a thought." Even wealthy Canadians who could afford to cross the border for treatment rarely do it.
Doctors who have worked in both countries say Canadians generally shrug off the system's inconveniences in a way that Americans would not.
"Canadians are used to peace, order and good governance -- we probably seem like a dull lot," said Dr. Donald Wigle, a Toronto cardiologist. "Americans go for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I don't think they would put up with the waits."
Administrators at American hospitals agree. "If we can't provide bypass surgery in a timely fashion our patients will say goodbye and fly to Pittsburgh or Cleveland," said John Friedlander, president of Buffalo General.
 
Doctors Satisfied With the System
 Like their patients, Canada's doctors are generally satisfied with the system, though there have been bruising battles with the government over fees. Doctor's charges for services are a good deal lower than what is charged in the United States, particularly in the surgical specialties, but because administrative costs and malpractice premiums are also much lower, most doctors earn salaries comparable to those of their American counterparts.
"I never have a problem recruiting internists," said Dr. Arnold Aberman, the chief doctor at Toronto Hospital. "That might not be true if I was recruiting cardiac surgeons since no one in Canada earns $3 million a year.
"Once you accept the limitations of the system, it's a pleasant place to be," he said.
Doctors send the government a list of patient visits each month and a few weeks later receive payment. Lawsuits are very rare, in part because Canadian lawyers must work for a fee rather than a share of malpractice settlements and patients cannot sue for punitive damages.
Statistics also speak well for Canadian medicine. On average, Canadians live longer than Americans, and Canada has a lower infant mortality rate.
 
'Never Having Your Hand Tied'
 While Canada has little of the extreme poverty seen in American inner cities, its health statistics also reflect the good basic care enjoyed by everyone, including services like cholesterol checks and prenatal testing that are frequently not covered by insurance in the United States and that the poor often cannot afford.
"The overwhelming good thing about this system is never having your hand tied by the patient's financial status," said Dr. Lorne Becker, a family doctor who recently returned to practice in his native Toronto after 10 years of working in the United States. "It's a relief not having to fight with patients to get mammograms because they cost too much."
To promote access the Government maintains a ratio of general doctors to specialists of about four to one, as opposed to the one-to-one ratio in the United States.
But while basic care is good, it is rarely elaborate and the Canadians are generally less aggressive about monitoring and treating chronic conditions. For example, American doctors advise cholesterol testing for everyone over the age of 20 and treat patients with levels above 200. Canadian doctors test only those with other risks for heart disease and do not pursue further testing or treatment unless the level is over 265.
Canadian doctors say that medical studies support their low-key approach, but in their world of strictly budgeted resources, cost is always in the background.
 
Some Limitations
 
Delays and Travel, Travel and Delays
If Canada is generous with the basics, it is stingy with high technology.
Delays, travel and waits for cutting-edge treatments are intentionally built into the system, like speed bumps in a road, to make sure people proceed in health care deliberately and to prevent runaway use.
Except in cases of dire emergency, Canadians wait for weeks to months for a wide variety of expensive procedures, including advanced radiology scans, heart bypass and brain tumor operations and the destruction of painful kidney stones with a sound wave machine called a lithotripter. The supply of specialists and equipment for such procedures perpetually lags just behind demand.
"Everything is accessible to everyone, but not always accessible enough," said Dr. Irving H. Lipton, a cardiac surgeon in Toronto, a pile of X-rays on his desk from patients awaiting surgery.
He now has 54 patients in line for a cardiac bypass, 14 of whom he considers urgent. Such patients are frequently having chest pains at rest and often must wait in the hospital until surgery. Ideally, he says, he would like to accommodate the urgent patients in one to two days, but realistically the wait will be one or two weeks. Patients for whom the surgery is elective wait three or four months.
 
Calls Pleading for Patients
 Canadian surgeons also lament the scarcity of advanced diagnostic equipment, particularly magnetic resonance imaging devices, the $2 million M.R.I. scanners that have transformed the treatment of brain, spine and joint disorders in this country. There are 15 M.R.I. scanners in all of Canada, and 2,000 in the United States. The United States has more than 10 times more per person.
Dr. Walter Kucharczyk, a radiologist who runs the M.R.I. scanner at Toronto Hospital, fields telephone calls every day pleading the cases of patients and loved ones, a task that he says "stinks."
A person with a quickly progressive paralysis qualifies as an emergency and promptly obtains a spinal scan to determine the source of the problem. But patients awaiting operations for brain tumors or confined to bed by ruptured disks are considered to be merely urgent and wait one to six weeks.
"These people are watched very carefully, but imagine being 30 years old and sitting around with a brain tumor growing, even slowly, in your head," said Dr. Ben Freedman, an ethicist at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal.
 
Little Time for Elective Cases
 Dr. Kucharczyk rarely finds room for elective cases, like patients with severe headaches or knee injuries, who would be scanned for good measure in the United States. "They wait a year and at that point, either the patient's better, had surgery or dead," he said.
Since high technology and specialty care are concentrated at a few centers scattered around the country, sick Canadians must be ready to wait and then travel, or travel and then wait. Kiki Margaritas, a 53-year-old patient from North Bay, Ontario, who has breast cancer, is spending April at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto, 200 miles from home, so she can receive radiation treatments. The government pays her bus fare and the cost of a room at a residence for patients next to the hospital, but her family cannot afford to visit.
Not surprisingly, the long lines sometimes lead to charges of favoritism. Dr. Wigle said those with "influence and affluence" frequently jump to the top of waiting lists.
"There's a black market for medicine," Dr. Kucharczyk said. "People who have influence in the ministry or friends at the hospital get different treatment."
 
The Effect of Lists
 
Delays Bring Little Harm
In the vast majority of cases, the delays and inconveniences probably do no long-term harm, Canadian doctors agree. Mrs. Margaritas waited two months between her mastectomy and the start of chemotherapy. Such a gap would be unheard of across the border, though, and could theoretically make the difference between a relapse and a cure, said Dr. Kyu Shin, a cancer specialist at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo.
In theory, people who run into trouble go to the front of the line, but "absolutely, people die on the waiting lists," said Dr. Lipton, the Toronto heart surgeon. Dr. Wigle, the cardiologist, has a patient who had a major heart attack while waiting for bypass surgery. Although he survived, his heart muscle was so damaged that he is now on another waiting list, this one for a heart transplant.
Driven by the the need to make money, American hospitals survive by doing more operations and ever more tests; driven by the need to conserve their fixed finances, Canadian hospitals stay afloat by doing less.
As one of the few cardiac surgeons serving the extended Toronto region with a population of six million, Dr. Lipton would like to perform more operations at the end of the day to erase the backlog, but cannot because the hospital cannot pay overtime to the operating room staff except in emergencies.
 
Things Done Quickly in U.S.
 If Dr. Lipton needs to perform emergency surgery, he frequently has to take a less sick patient off the day's operating list. Contrast that with the United States: "Nights, weekends, we can always twist someone's arm and do another case," said Dr. Thomas Lajos, a surgeon at Buffalo General. Flexing his technological muscle, at 5 P.M. on a recent Friday he called to request an M.R.I. scan. It was done that night.
To many doctors, even more worrisome than the inconveniences is the fact that newer technologies and equipment are sometimes simply unavailable.
Dr. Hans Messner, a cancer specialist and chief of the bone marrow tranplant program at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto, says he would like to be able to use growth factors in his leukemia patients undergoing marrow transplants. These genetically engineered compounds have been shown to reduce the length of hospital stays and improve survival for the risky procedure. In the United States, they have crossed the boundary from experimental and have become state of the art.
"The government is reviewing the data, but there is significant inertia since these things are very costly," he said.
In the operating room, surgeons say that they are frequently using older equipment than their American collegues and, in intensive care, new gadgets come once a decade rather than every other year. Although Toronto Hospital has the biggest lung tranplant program in the world, it has not yet been able to buy a fiberoptic bronchoscope, a device inserted through the mouth to transmit perfect pictures of the lungs. Even many community hospitals in the United States have one.
 
Considering Cost
 
Doctors Calculate The Risks Closely
Canadian doctors have learned to consider cost in their medical decisions, something that many experts say will have to happen in the United States.
Dr. Messner, the cancer specialist, knows his budget will allow him to do only about 55 bone marrow transplants in the coming year. At $100,000 each, he says he will devote this resource to the patients most likely to survive.
"You learn to be frugal," he said. "If I filled my beds with patients who had only a 10 percent chance of survival, at the end of the year I'd have only 5 left. So instead I fill them with patients who have a 60 percent chance and end up with 35."
When waits become too long, doctors and patients often decide to make do with more primitive and accessible technologies. For back surgery, when an M.R.I. scan is unavailable this means a test called a myelogram, which involves injecting dye into the spine. It is uncomfortable, complicated by allergic reactions and requires a hospital stay.
 
Desperation Drives Patients South
 And when desperate, Canadians have a final option: to go to the United States, whose hospitals have served as a convenient pressure valve. The Canadian system generally pays American hospitals for care it cannot reasonably provide, although patients must get prior approval.
In a typical case, last year when James McGillis of Burlington, Ontario, developed excruciating pain from a kidney-stone blocking his bladder, he was sent to a private center in Buffalo to have the stones pulverized because the single lithotripter in Ontario was solidly booked. When the delays become unacceptably long even by Canadian standards, Ontario has paid for coronary bypass operations in Detroit and M.R.I. scans in Buffalo to give the health ministry time to juggle its resources.
Although Canadian doctors often wish for a new high-speed bone drill or a second scanner, some experts say that technical plenty in the United States does not always lead to better care, just to more care, while basic needs go wanting.
"Its nice to have a lithotripter in Outer Snowshoe, but that money comes from somewhere else," said Dr. Adam Linton, a kidney specialist in London, Ontario. The travel required by centralization of certain procedures makes treatment inconvenient, but also more assured in quality, he added.
And treatments are unavailable to many citizens of the United States for other reasons. Studies have repeatedly shown that black Americans benefit from high technology like heart bypass and cancer treatment far less often than whites, for example. Uninsured patients, or those on Medicaid, often can wait months for an elective M.R.I. scan or even a general check-up.
 
Pressure on System
 
Canada's Costs Are Soaring Too
Despite the Government's efforts to control costs, in Canada as in the United States the press of soaring medical prices and ever-better, more costly technology threatens to tear the system apart.
Although Canadians demand the best in health care, they are reluctant to pay more taxes for it. Already the southbound Peace Bridge from Ontario to Buffalo is crowded with shoppers driving to avoid sales taxes totalling 15 per cent, which have been driven up in part by health expenses.
Hospitals striving to offer advanced treatments on limited budgets have been increasingly forced to make unhappy compromises. "When a hospital is given a budget and starts to run out of money it has no choice but to cut services," Dr. Linton said.
 
Hospitals Sometimes Close Beds
 For many hospitals, the simplest solution is to close down beds, a drastic measure in a system already running at capacity. Other hospitals have limited the number of joints an orthopedist may replace or the number of patients who may be on dialysis.
So far, that has resulted mostly in delays being a little longer or travel distance greater.
"We have not yet had to kill anyone by not providing dialysis or a transplant, but the issue is at a flash point." Dr. Linton said. "We are running out of maneuvering room financially."
Indeed, as costly new machines and drugs are proved to treat a wide range of maladies, doctors wonder how the system will afford them. Some provinces are considering charging fees to patients, and other provinces are experimenting with health maintainence organizations like those being promoted in the United States.
"People look at Canada and think we have a panacea," Dr. Wigle said. "We do not. We both have to learn from each other."

HEADLINE: When Blacks Shop, Bias Often Accompanies Sale

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Last month, Cedric Holloway, a 20-year-old chef's helper, decided to invest $1,000 of his savings in a certificate of deposit or money-market account.
Wearing a Syracuse University Orangemen cap, baggy jeans and a shirt, he went to a branch of the Great Western Bank in Tamarac, Fla., to investigate rates. After visiting three other banks, he returned to Great Western with more questions, then left again to go over the information.
 
Accusation on Fifth Avenue
 As he sat in his car outside the bank reading brochures, he found himself surrounded by sheriff's deputies with their guns drawn. He was ordered out of the car, handcuffed and read his rights. Bank employees, thinking he might be planning a robbery, had called the police. After 45 minutes of questioning, the police accepted his explanation that he had been trying to put money into the bank. 
 While on a lecture tour in New York last year, Julianne Malveaux, a college professor and syndicated columnist, was approached by a salesclerk at Saks Fifth Avenue and accused of switching the tags on an expensive silk dress she was planning to buy. She said another salesclerk convinced her colleague that the store, not Ms. Malveaux, had switched the tags.
Mr. Holloway and Ms. Malveaux are black, their accusers are white, and the victims see these incidents not as isolated cases, but as part of a pattern of discrimination and humiliation that affects blacks in the marketplace. Businesses often say such scrutiny is used to protect not only their establishments, but also their customers.
Thirty years have passed since the lunch counter sit-ins that led to civil-rights laws guaranteeing all people "full and equal enjoyment" of the goods, services, advantages and facilities of public accommodations. But black Americans say segregation's legacy persists and such privileges are not universally available.
 
Similar Stories, No Data
 No official agency collects data on whether incidents like those Mr. Holloway and Ms. Malveaux experienced are on the rise. But in interviews, blacks of all ages, regions and economic levels tell similar stories of bad service, public humiliation and legal harassment when confronted by representatives of service industries that, the blacks say, do not acknowledge blacks' growing economic power, private resources and buying patterns.
Moreover, the discrimination is often far subtler than a face-to-face confrontation. This was illustrated earlier this month when a Hispanic woman making a purchase at a Cignal clothing store in Boston noticed that as a salesclerk was filling in information that had been stamped on the back of her personal check, there was a section marked "race" -- and the clerk left it blank. When she received her canceled check, the "race" section had been filled in.
The woman, Jacqueline Perczek, who is not black, later officially objected to the practice. Within days, Cignal, a subsidiary of Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc., in Towson, Md., dropped its policy of classifying shoppers as "W" for white, "H" for Hispanic and "07," a company shorthand for black. Company officials said nothing about the practice was racist.
"The information was not utilized for any purpose -- good, bad or indifferent," said Bruce Harrison, a lawyer for Cignal. He said the company wanted the data for identification if a check bounced.
 
Debate Over Response
 Such practices have been termed "economic racism" by some. "Economic racism, in which money and social status are used as barriers, is more pervasive than the overt racism of the past," said Ms. Malveaux, an economist who is a professor of Afro-American studies at the University of California at Berkeley. "Increasingly, black consumers are being subjected to this newer, more subtle kind of racism that deprives them of their rights."
Considerable debate has occurred among blacks about how to handle such incidents. In one camp are those who advocate buying the merchandise or service at issue, if only to prove they can afford to. But other blacks say that puts money in the pockets of the offending whites. These blacks say a more effective response is to refuse to patronize places that do not openly welcome their business. But that response, blacks on the other side say, only confirms whites' doubts about whether blacks can afford the merchandise.
When she has been slighted in a store, Gertrude Barber, a Washington tax accountant, said, "What I do is let them run my credit card through that little machine and get the approval number. Then I tell them to tear up the sales and credit slips, give them a lecture on racial prejudice, then walk out the door leaving them holding pieces of paper."
 
Statistics and Stereotypes
 Several stereotypes seem to underlie the discrimination, said Dr. Joe R. Feagin, a professor of sociology at the University of Florida who has studied discrimination in public places.
"Blacks are seen as shoplifters, as unclean, as disreputable poor," Dr. Feagin, who is white, wrote in the February issue of The American Sociological Review. "No matter how affluent and influential, a black person cannot escape the stigma of being black even while relaxing or shopping."
This perception is rooted, in part, in statistics that show that a disproportionate number of blacks are below the poverty level or are charged with crimes and incarcerated. But the numbers do not reflect the growing number of blacks with disposable incomes and an inclination to spend.
According to the Census Bureau, of the 10,486,000 black American households, 264,000 had earnings of $50,000 to $54,999 in 1989, the latest year for which figures were available; 92,000 other households earned more than $70,000 that year, and 81,000 more than $100,000.
While other racial and ethnic groups and women are also targets of discrimination in public places, blacks say they feel the brunt of such discrimination more than any other group because their color immediately sets them apart.
 
New Ways of Fighting Back
 The result has been an increasing impatience and rage among middle-class blacks. In the 1950's and 1960's, some blacks responded to white mistreatment in public accommodations with deference or resignation while others took part in demonstrations. But today, such incidents are more likely to provoke a verbal confrontation or a lawsuit.
"Black-white interaction today is being renegotiated," Dr. Feagin said. "Prior to societal desegregation, blacks were typically expected to respond to discriminating whites with great deference, stepping off sidewalks when whites went by. Since the 1960's, whites have encountered a majority of blacks who do not respond with deference when faced with discrimination. They may withdraw or deny, but they do not shuffle."
Mr. Holloway, the Florida chef's helper, for example, has filed a discrimination complaint against Great Western, seeking damages for false imprisonment. At the time, the bank branch representatives said robbers often came into a bank seeking information, then returned to rob it.
Kevin Hawkins, a spokesman at Great Western's headquarters in Beverly Hills, Calif., called the incident "a terrible error in judgment."
A similar incident last September in Wellesley, Mass., involving a professional basketball player, Dee Brown of the Boston Celtics, and his fiancee, Jill Edmondson, drew national attention. Mr. Brown was forced at gunpoint by police officers to lie on the sidewalk after a bank teller said he resembled a suspect in a robbery. The couple settled a complaint against the Wellesley police for $5,000.
 
The Role of Television
 The popular culture has also been increasingly used to prick the nation's conscience and bring the problem into the open. In recent months, episodes of television programs like "L.A. Law," "In Living Color" and "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air," have dealt with the issue.
Debbie Allen, the actress and producer-director of the television series "A Different World," said a white clerk at a Beverly Hills jewelry store not only refused to show her merchandise, but also "assumed because I was black, I couldn't afford anything in the store." Ms. Allen later produced a fictionalized account of the incident for the program.
By their nature, these incidents tend to affect blacks of some means, who are more likely to come into contact with whites in places where the presence of blacks is unusual. Many blacks said in interviews that they were convinced that the recession had heightened racial tensions, giving rise to confrontations and causing resentment among those whites who may think blacks have attained status or wealth because of preferential treatment.
"You have working-class whites doing poorly," said Ms. Malveaux, the Berkeley professor. "They see blacks doing well, and they don't process the statistics that show only a third of us are doing well, and it causes problems."
Veterans of civil-rights battles say this form of discrimination may be more difficult to defeat than the institutional racism of the past, in part because it is more subtle.
Some civil-rights advocates also say many middle-class blacks, the group most likely to prompt change, hesitate to complain.
Just as bothersome, those interviewed said, is that many blacks say they constantly have to defend claims of discrimination to whites who do not believe it is a continuing problem.
"As a white, I can corroborate their feelings," Dr. Feagin said. "Ninety-eight percent of whites have no idea what it's like to walk in black shoes. Even the most liberal white Americans think middle-class blacks pretty much have it made."
Most blacks interviewed said they often adjusted their everyday lives to try to avoid prejudicial treatment, either by wearing obvious symbols of class -- fancy pens, briefcases, suits -- or by sticking to restaurants, hotels and stores recommended by black friends and colleagues.
"I make a habit of dressing a certain way, usually a jacket and tie, when I go shopping in the city," said Lawrence Otis Graham, a 28-year-old New York lawyer.
"When I walk into a store, they don't see my Princeton undergraduate degree, my Harvard law degree, my associate law status," Mr. Graham added. "They see a black man. Credentials do not make your blackness invisible, no matter how impressive they may be."
 But while such forms of discrimination may be mere annoyances, most blacks worry more about incidents that expose them to severe violations of their rights. Last year, while waiting for a flight at Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Daniel Lamaute, the owner of the Lamaute Financial Group, a financial consulting concern in Los Angeles, said he narrowly escaped arrest by two white police officers.
"They started pushing me toward the interrogation room, when another police officer came by and said, 'That's not the one I want,' " the 37-year-old Mr. Lamaute said.
He said he later learned through airport officials that well-dressed black pickpockets were mingling with travelers. Still he complained to officials and received apologies from the Mayor of Denver and the Governor of Colorado.
Apologies aside, these discriminatory acts create what Dr. Alvin Poussaint of Harvard University and other black psychologists describe as a feeling of "dis-ease."
"What it does to our collective psyche is that it makes sure you never forget that your are black and not welcomed," Dr. Poussaint said. "It is a constant reminder that you live in a society with stereotypes of blacks that you are not free from."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Iraq Asserts Its Weakening Will Mean a Stronger Iran

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 29

 BODY:
With United Nations sanctions still in place two months after the end of the Persian Gulf war, senior Iraqi officials say the West should be concerned that Baghdad's weakening economic and military position will shift the regional balance in favor of Iran.
"Iran is more pragmatic in dealing with the outside world now, but its regional power aspirations have not changed," a senior Foreign Ministry official said. 
 Still, the internal changes that Iraq needs to make to improve relations with the West are certain to be resisted by many in the ruling Baath Party, officials here say.
The party will find it difficult politically to be open toward Israel, cooperate with American efforts in the region and soften its traditional militant pan-Arabism, which casts Iraq as the champion of poor Arabs against the rich gulf sheikdoms.
 
Signs of Reappraisal
 And there is widespread recognition among Iraqi policy makers that the United States and its allies are unlikely to be satisfied with anything short of an explicit commitment by the leadership to a new and more cooperative approach to Middle Eastern issues.
This has not come about. But there are signs that Iraq's leadership is reappraising its policies in light of the gulf war and the high priority it places on getting United Nations economic sanctions lifted.
President Saddam Hussein's decision last month to surrender the Prime Minister's post and give it to Saadun Hamadi, an American-educated Shiite Muslim, was widely seen as an effort to give the Government a more pragmatic image and distance it from his presidency.
At his first news conference as Prime Minister last week, Mr. Hamadi said a debate was under way in the Baathist leadership over the country's course. And he stressed that his priority was to comply full with the Security Council's terms for easing the sanctions.
 
Dependent on U.N. Council
 That not only means surrendering Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and paying compensation to Kuwait, but also accepting the prospect of a long military embargo that will further weaken Iraq's armed forces.
Even the restoration of normal civilian trade with the outside world depends on the Security Council's being satisfied with "the policies and practices of the Government of Iraq," a phrase that could mean almost anything.
While Iraq has begun complying with the Security Council's plans to destroy its most dangerous weapons, it is still unclear how much of its future oil income the Council will earmark for compensation payments.
Britain has suggested that this figure should be based on Iraq's past military spending, which by some estimates has run as high as 26 percent of the gross national product.
At the Foreign Ministry, officials expect the figure to be in the 15 to 20 percent range and stress the sizable financial burden that will place on a country that already has $80 billion in foreign debts.
But a weakened Iraq, officials argue, will leave Iran as the dominant power in the region and give Baghdad a new interest in cooperative approaches to security questions.
 
Syria Cooling to Soviets
 Syria, in the Iraqi view, accurately read the international scene, deciding that its alliance with the Soviet Union was becoming less valuable and that it needed more financial help from the oil-producing gulf states.
Iran, however, remains committed to extending its influence over Iraq's southern Shiite district in the view of Iraqi officials here. As the American armed forces pull out of the south, there is concern here that Iran will again push for influence in that region.
"Iran has changed on economic matters and in dealing with the West," a senior Iraqi official said. "But on regional questions it is still playing the same game, trying to export revoluton to Iraq."
Internally, Iraqi officials hope that the Government's commitment to political reform this year will also help its relations with the West and speed the lifting of sanctions.

HEADLINE: Big Law Firms' Starting Pay

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Many of the nation's biggest law firms continue to pay high starting salaries despite soft business caused by the recession and a drop in merger-related work, according to a study published yesterday.
The National Law Journal, a weekly trade publication, said first-year associates at leading firms earned from $52,000 to $83,000 annually, as of April 1. 
 That top figure is being paid at the New York-based firms of Debevoise & Plimpton, Shearman & Sterling and Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.
In some cases, starting salaries dropped from the previous year. For example, Latham & Watkins of Los Angeles is paying $65,000, down from $70,000 last year.
A sample of first-year salaries from other law firms are: $68,000 at Choate, Hall & Stewart in Boston; $52,000 at Gardere & Wynne in Dallas; $51,000 plus $5,500 bonus at Butler & Binion in Houston; $53,000 plus $3,000 stipend at Lewis, Rice & Fingersh in St. Louis; $65,000 at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in San Francisco, and $67,500 at the Washington firm of Patton, Boggs & Blow.
Entry-level lawyers who work for the Government earn far less. For example, at the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency they earn $31,116.

HEADLINE: Profit Up 2.9% At Control Data

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Minn., April 29

 BODY:
The Control Data Corporation said today that its first-quarter earnings rose 2.9 percent despite a 3.7 percent decline in revenue.
The computer company said it earned $7 million, or 16 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with earnings of $6.8 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $405.8 million for the quarter from $421.6 million in the 1990 period. 
 Lawrence Perlman, president and chief executive, said the company's revenue decline stemmed from the weak economy.
Control Data's first-quarter earnings included a net pretax restructuring gain of $5.4 million. That included gains of $42.8 million from the company's sale of 10.7 million common stock shares of Seagate Technology Inc. The company posted a $7.3 million net restructuring gain in the first quarter of 1990.
The company's stock fell 37.5 cents, to $12.625, on the New York Stock Exchange today.

HEADLINE: Mitsubishi's Big Campaign in U.S.

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 29

 BODY:
At a time when brutal competition and a recession are forcing American car makers to lay off workers and delay new models, Mitsubishi of Japan is pushing to expand its foothold in the American market.
Indeed, Mitsubishi is nearly doubling its array of car and truck models to nine in less than two years. The new entries, which include a $28,000 Diamante luxury sedan for sale next month, will be aimed mostly at affluent customers, who have previously bypassed Mitsubishi showrooms filled with workmanlike models like the Tredia, Cordia and Starion on their way to buying plush offerings from Japan's leading auto makers, like the Lexus by Toyota, the Infiniti by Nissan and the Acura from Honda. 
 With about 350 car and light-truck models to choose from in the United States, including many new luxury models, such expansion might be construed as wishful thinking, especially in light of weak demand that has hurt even foreign car makers.
But no one is scoffing at Mitsubishi's foray. In Japan, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation is a powerful auto maker that sells more vehicles than the Honda Motor Company. In the United States, Mitsubishi's growth had been restrained by its agreement to sell most of its export allocation to the Chrysler Corporation, which resold the cars as Dodges, Plymouths, Chryslers and Eagles. Nine years ago, however, Mitsubishi won the right to begin building a dealer network that has grown sufficiently to provide the economies of scale for importing more models from Japan.
But Mitsubishi's decision not to create a separate dealer network for its luxury car, as other Japanese manufacturers have done for theirs, is "a major risk," said Susan Jacobs, an automotive analyst in Little Falls, N.J., who specializes in luxury auto markets.
"Dealers often can't treat top-end buyers as well as they expect to be treated, unless they are trained to handle that sort of customer," Ms. Jacobs said. A separate dealer network -- like that of Acura, Lexus and Infiniti -- has usually provided a faster start for new Japanese luxury cars, she said, and enabled manufacturers to respond more quickly to unexpected customer reactions.
Mitsubishi executives are warning dealers that luxury-car customers need more pampering than the dealers have been giving. A survey by J. D. Power, an automotive marketing consultant, ranked Mitsubishi 26th among American franchises in customer satisfaction with sales and service personnel. Last year, Mitsubishi telephoned all its new-car buyers and relayed 40,000 reports of problems, large and small, to dealers, the company said. It added that the dealers responded to only 40 percent of the problems.
In coming weeks, Mitsubishi dealers will receive the company's newest and most sophisticated car model, and they do not have to share it with Chrysler dealers. The Mitsubishi Diamante sedan, which is slightly smaller than the big Lexus and Infiniti models, has won technical praise, including the prestigious Japan Car of the Year award.
The export version of the Diamante lacks four-wheel steering and a few other frills of the award winner but offers the smooth, powerful performance that is common to many Japanese luxury models.
But more significantly, the Diamante is designed to attract buyers put off by the $40,000 price for the Lexus and Infiniti. While the regular Diamante sells for $28,000, a less glittery version will be available starting at about $22,000.
As dealers were told at their last business meeting, the car is meant to sell for slightly less than the Acura Legend, which is better known, and only slightly more than the Nissan Maxima, which does not have the features of a true luxury car.
 
A Role Reversal
 Since 1981 Mitsubishi has operated in the shadow of Chrysler, which owns 11 percent of its shares. But now the growing influence of the Tokyo-based auto maker has been manifest in a stunning role reversal: Chrysler has been seeking Mitsubishi's financial help to stave off a potential financial crisis.
If negotiations are successful, Mitsubishi in a few months will buy all or part of Chrysler's 50 percent stake in a joint-venture assembly plant in Bloomington-Normal, Ill. Chrysler would gain much-needed cash; for Mitsubishi, the additional manufacturing capacity could open the way for further penetration of the American market. It now has 2 percent of the car market, making it the fifth-ranked foreign car maker, behind Mazda and ahead of Hyundai,
The weakness of Chrysler's sales has created opportunities for Mitsubishi dealers, who have been unhappy that Chrysler dealers sell some of the models they do. Mitsubishi dealers often have not received as many of the desirable models as Chrysler dealers have. Now the scales are tipping the other way. Mitsubishi's 500 dealers sold more Eclipse sports coupes in the first quarter than the 3,200 Chrysler dealers, who offer the nearly identical Plymouth Laser and Eagle Talon models.
 
A Warning to Dealers
 "There is no reason to remain a second-rate player," Reijiro Koriumzo, Mitsubishi's deputy director of international business, told United States dealers at a meeting in Dallas last week. "We have all the ammunition." But he warned dealers that "all will be wasted" if they failed to sell the new models aggressively.
If Mitsubishi thinks of itself as second rate, the comparison applies only with respect to other Japanese car companies. Many of its executives speak with thinly disguised contempt of Detroit's products and management practices, particularly those of Chrysler. In any case, Mitsubishi believes its potential customers are shopping among European and Japanese vehicles exclusively and do not need to be pried away from General Motors, Ford Motor or Chrysler.
Research seems to have borne out Mitsubishi's premise. The share of Asian car makers, including Hyundai of South Korea, has grown steadily, to about 30 percent of the United States car market. And that share includes a disproportionately large number of young and affluent buyers.
While Honda, Toyota and Nissan together account for almost 22 percent, the other seven Asian car makers divide the remaining 8 percent. Mazda is next largest, with about 3.3 percent of the market, based on first-quarter sales, and Mitsubishi has slightly more than 2 percent.
Mitsubishi's strategy for gaining share is to make sure "import intenders" become more aware of the company's brands. Mitsubishi also plans to increase the number of fancier models, and set prices in a way that conveys the impression of value. "My personal goal for the next five years is to overtake Mazda and become the fourth-largest Japanese car maker," said Richard Lepley, Mitsubishi's senior vice president of sales.
Like its domestic and foreign counterparts, Mitsubishi has entered the daily rental business, with its recent acquisition of Value Rent-A-Car. This gives Mitsubishi an additional outlet for its production in the event of weaker-than-expected sales.
The Mitsubishi name is not well known for vehicles. Everything from airplanes to canned shrimp are sold under the name, creating some confusion. The auto maker's reputation has been mostly as an alternative to Honda, Toyota and Nissan. "I invested in a Mitsubishi franchise because Toyota and Honda were short of cars," said Ramsay Gillman, a Houston dealer who owns several foreign and domestic franchises. "It was quite attractive when other Japanese lines were short."
Even though more and more Americans are trying Japanese cars, there is still little loyalty to individual brands. Hence Mitsubishi has pursued a strategy of pricing its cars and trucks slightly below comparable Toyota, Honda and Nissan models. Keeping prices low, Mitsubishi officials say, conveys a message of "enhanced value" to consumers.
"Mitsubishi has been very useful to me as a way to switch customers who like Honda but don't ant to pay Honda's prices," said one dealer who insisted on not being named.
At one time Mitsubishi imported mostly plain, economical cars. But top management realized that to keep dealers interested and to win new customers it had to import more expressive, higher-performance and more luxurious vehicles, like the 3000GT two-seater priced at $30,000 -- sold by Chrysler as the Dodge Stealth -- a car that has been compared favorably with European sports cars costing twice as much.
Dealers probably cannot sell more than a few dozen 3000GT's each, but they hope the car will draw more traffic to showrooms.
Last year Mitsubishi introduced its Galant sedan, a competitor to the compact Toyota Camry, Mazda 626, Honda Accord and Nissan Stanza. While the Galant has been a success, Mitsubishi recognizes that its late entry into that niche makes it hard to overcome the edge established by the Toyota and Honda models. Following the 3000GT and the Diamante, Mitsubishi this summer will introduce two mini-vans, the Expo and the Expo LRV. It will also introduce a redesigned Montero four-door utility vehicle in December.
The Expo LRV, or "light recreational vehicle," resembles a small station wagon, has room for five passengers and will start at about $10,000. The Expo carries seven passengers and will start at about $13,000; both vehicles offer four-wheel drive and anti-lock brakes.
The first reviewers of the new Montero say the Mitsubishi has improved the comfort of the vehicle so that it rides more like a car than a truck. The Galant, the mini-vans and the Montero will all be sold exclusively by Mitsubishi dealers.

Bond Funds Bulge as Rates Fall

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Investors worried about falling short-term interest rates are buying bond mutual funds at the fastest pace in years, mutual fund managers said yesterday.
"We had a smashing April," said Michael Hines, a vice president of Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund organization. "Investors are coming back into the bond market in an attempt to pick up yield." 
 The Investment Company Institute, a trade organization for the mutual fund industry, reported a net flow of $3.6 billion into bond funds in March, up from $3.1 billion in the previous month and the most for any month since March 1987.
That flow, concentrated in funds that invest in American bonds, has come as short-term interest rates have fallen, forcing investors to take more risk for higher yields.
 
Interest in Stocks, Too
 "We had our best month in bond sales in history," said Gavin Quill, a spokesman for Scudder, Stevens & Clark. "That's where all the rollover C.D. money is going."
Mr. Quill said the group's fund that attracted the largest net flow of cash buys bonds no more than three years from maturity. At the moment, rates for these bonds are substantially higher than for shorter-term bonds, those within a year of maturity.
Stock funds also continued to draw cash, with some fund groups that deal directly with customers reporting more enthusiasm than those that sell through brokers and insurance agents.
"The net cash flow in equity fund groups in April is double March's level, and is close to a record," said Steve Norwitz, a spokesman for the T. Rowe Price group of funds, a direct marketer.
At Fidelity, Mr. Hines said, sales of sector funds, which allow investors to choose particular industry groups, are the highest in several years. Overall sales of stock funds were the strongest in a year, but because redemptions also rose somewhat, net cash flow would be below March levels.
Stock funds at some other groups that are not direct marketers attracted less net cash flow. John Reilly, a spokesman for Massachusetts Financial Services, said his firm's equity funds had a small net outflow this month. And Hank Schmelzer, the president of the New England Fund Group, said, "Our equity sales are solid, but they certainly are not astronomical."
For the industry, a net flow of $1.9 billion came into stock funds in March, down from $3.1 billion the previous month. The cash-flow figures are based on sales and redemptions and include net exchanges between funds in different groups. They do not include reinvested dividends.
Over all, 1991 is shaping up as one of the best years ever for the mutual fund industry. At T. Rowe Price, Mr. Norwitz said cash flow into the group's funds for the first four months of the year was about equal to all of 1990. At Scudder, Mr. Quill celebrated "our best April in history" following the best first quarter ever.
The only unhappy news in April for many fund companies was a flow of cash out of money market funds. But several funds said investors normally took cash from these funds to pay tax bills.
The appetite for long-term mutual funds this year has been greatest for American assets. The lure of foreign stock and bond funds, very strong last year, has dulled as the dollar has risen in value this year.
In all of 1990, bond funds that invest primarily in the United States drew in a net cash flow of $3.6 billion, while those that invest overseas had an inflow of $5.6 billion. For the first three months of 1991, the domestic funds took in $7.3 billion while the overseas funds attracted only $2.6 billion.
One reason for this turnaround has been the new attractiveness of high-yield, or "junk bond," funds. They took in $492 million in March, the most for any month since January 1989. Fund managers said the gains continued in April as junk bond prices continued to rise. These funds had seen $5.1 billion flow out in 1990.
Among stock funds, the move back to American assets has also been pronounced. For 1990, funds that invest primarily in domestic stocks had a net inflow of $6.5 billion, just a few million dollars less than the flow into international and global funds. But in the first three months of 1991, the domestic funds drew in $4.8 billion while the overseas funds took in only $911 million.
In the early stages of the stock market rally that began in October, investors were more bullish than the professionals who manage the stock funds. But the fund managers have been spending cash as it has come in.
With stock prices rising, just 9.9 percent of stock fund assets were left in cash at the end of March, down from 10.6 percent a month earlier and well below the 12.9 percent record set in October. It is the first time since August that the level has fallen below 10 percent.

HEADLINE: Pepsico Net Up 12.9% on Foreign Strength

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Pepsico Inc. reported yesterday that its first-quarter profits increased 12.9 percent, aided by especially strong foreign sales in soft drinks, snacks and fast food.
Net income rose to $205.4 million, or 26 cents a share, from $181.9 million, or 23 cents a share, earned in the comparable quarter last year. 
 While sales abroad were healthy, the recession appeared to hurt domestic sales volumes and profit margins. This was attributed partly to higher marketing expenses for discounts and coupons to spur consumer spending, especially for snack foods like potato chips.
Sales in the quarter, ended March 23, totaled $4.12 billion, up 12 percent from $3.68 billion in the quarter a year ago.
The performance was roughly in line with some analysts' expectations, but investors reacted negatively to the earnings statement yesterday. Pepsico's stock skidded $1.75 a share to close at $30.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the most active stock on the Big Board, with 4.8 million shares changing hands.
"People may be concerned that these earnings mean that a monster-sized snack war is beginning out there, but it's not," said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Paine Webber.
Along with Pepsico's Frito-Lay division, Borden Inc., the Anheuser-Busch Companies and dozens of regional snack-food makers spent tens of millions of dollars in new marketing expenses to promote about $815 million in snack-food sales in the first quarter. Borden makes an array of products like Wise potato chips and Cheez Doodles, while Busch makes Eagle snacks and other items.
Pepsico's fast-food restaurants, the company's largest subsidiary, posted a 14 percent rise in sales and a 35 percent gain in profit, with a strong performance by Taco Bell offsetting a weak one at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
 
Fast-Food Earnings
 The fast-food subsidiary earned $119.4 million on sales of $1.49 billion, benefiting in part from lower ingredient costs, especially for cheese in pizza and tacos.
Pizza Hut, Pepsico's largest restaurant chain, posted a 26 percent rise in profit, to $63.4 million, with a 14 percent sales gain, to $721.4 million. Taco Bell had a 14 percent rise in sales, to $405.5 million, but more than doubled its profit, to $31.4 million.
Kentucky Fried Chicken lagged somewhat, with a 6 percent profit rise, to $24.6 million, and a 14 percent rise in sales, to $367.8 million. "The turnaround is under way, but not complete at K.F.C.," said Ken Ross, a Pepsico spokesman.
Pepsico's second-largest subsidiary, soft drinks, continued to show weakness in the United States but strength abroad, where Pepsi's market presence is still being expanded, even in the developed countries of Europe. The cheaper dollar in the early part of the first quarter helped lift international sales, as did acquisition of two franchised bottlers in Canada, which added to company revenue.
 
Loss of Burger King Account
 Domestic soft drinks' profit rose 5 percent, to $143.4 million, but sales were flat at $1.06 billion, partly because of the loss of the huge Burger King account to the company's arch rival, Coca-Cola.
Pepsico's foreign profit from soft drinks rose 45 percent internationally, to $17.7 million; sales rose 35 percent, to $344.6 million.
Snack foods showed no change from the quarter a year earlier for domestic profit and a decline of 12 percent internationally. The snack foods division, whose brands include Lays potato chips and Frito-Lay corn chips, posted a domestic profit of $133 million and a foreign profit of $42.4 million. Domestic snack-food sales rose 11 percent, to $814.6 million, and international sales rose about 35 percent, to $405.8 million.
