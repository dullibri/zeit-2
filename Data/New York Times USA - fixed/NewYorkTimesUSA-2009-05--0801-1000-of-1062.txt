HEADLINE: Live From New York, Writers for Spider-Man

BYLINE: By GEORGE GENE GUSTINES

 BODY:
The season finale of ''Saturday Night Live'' was last week, but fans wanting another taste of comedy from the series regulars Seth Meyers and Bill Hader have no farther to turn than their local comic-book stores on Thursday. 
 ''Spider-Man: The Short Halloween,'' a one-shot special issue from Marvel Entertainment, illustrated by Kevin Maguire, was written by those sketch-comedy cast mates. The comic finds Spidey, the wall crawler, dealing with a case of mistaken identity.
 The opportunity came about during the actors' appearance at Marvel's holiday party in 2007. ''Everyone was equally excited to talk to everyone else,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''They were asking a lot of 'SNL' questions, and we were asking tons of Marvel questions.''
 Thanks to the Writers Guild strike last year, Mr. Hader said, ''we had nothing but time on our hands.'' He added, ''We talked about how writing a comic would be an awesome thing to do.''
 ''Then it just kind of happened,'' he said. ''Seth and I kind of walked around his neighborhood and figured out the Spider-Man idea and wrote it.''
 The story is centered on Halloween night, with New York City filled with drunken revelers and a new supervillain team trying to make its mark. The evildoers consist of Badger Teeth, Haymaker, Mr. Think, Fumes and Gossip Girl, whose shoulders and hands have extra mouths (with a tendency to argue).
 ''I will give full credit to Bill for Gossip Girl,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''We liked the idea of creating new villains just because it's every fanboy's dream.''
 Mr. Hader agreed: ''It was crazy to add something that is now in the Marvel universe.''
 The men had only praise for Mr. Maguire. ''For the 13-year-old in me, it's a freakout,'' Mr. Hader said.
 Mr. Meyers added: ''It's like when you write a sketch for Alec Baldwin and you think it'll be funny, but he makes it 10 times funnier than you thought it would be. It just lifts your work to a higher level.''
 Between friends in the industry -- like the comic-book writers Matt Fraction and Ed Brubaker -- and their own experience writing scripts for skits, the men felt confident tackling their first comic book. ''It's like writing a sketch; there's an economy to it,'' Mr. Hader said. ''The big note we got from Matt and Ed was that we spelled 'Spider-Man' wrong.''
 Mr. Meyers said, joking, ''We spelled it with three R's.'' 
 Mr. Hader countered, ''We spelled it 'Batman,' and that really freaked everyone out at Marvel.'' They were interviewed by phone in California last month. 
 Eventually, the truth of the misspelling came out. ''We didn't put the dash in it,'' Mr. Meyers confessed.
 Getting that wrong, Mr. Hader explained, is like asking the question, What day is ''Saturday Night Live'' filmed?

HEADLINE: Indonesia's TV Makeovers Now More Extreme Than Its Politics

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia 

 BODY:
On Indonesia's hottest reality TV show, participants are reunited with long-lost friends and loved ones. On another show, a family going through a rough stretch is chosen for an extreme home makeover. A spoiled rich girl, appearing in another hit that may sound familiar, is plucked from the city and dropped in the hinterland.
 The programs are from Indonesia's rich and ever-growing array of reality television shows, with Indonesian faces and backdrops but American roots. They have become so popular that they recently displaced soap operas as the country's ratings leaders and are exploring every subgenre of reality television, like talent contests and dating shows and social experiments. 
 The United States has long worried about the fate of Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, where radical Islamic groups staged a series of attacks against Western interests in the early years of this decade. But the country's television viewers have embraced shows that, though not explicitly American, are American in their formats, conceits and, often, values. 
 The genre is ascending here as political Islam, surging five years ago, has lost momentum among voters. The success of reality television -- technically British in origin but identified here with American culture -- reinforces the results of the country's recent general election. In that election, voters seemed to be motivated by issues like good government and better living standards rather than the role of religion in society.
 ''The influence of American culture is growing, and these reality TV shows present not an innocent hope for the future, but a particular American version of it,'' said Ariel Heryanto, an Indonesian scholar and editor of ''Popular Culture in Indonesia,'' a collection of essays on Indonesian film and television.
 ''A lot of people were taken aback by the Islamization of Indonesia, and the pendulum has swung back the other way,'' said Mr. Heryanto, who recently became head of Southeast Asian studies at the Australian National University in Canberra. 
 ''We're trying to experiment with different versions of modernity, and this time American culture is in,'' he said. 
 Reality television shows have been around for a few years, but they began dominating the ratings late last year, according to AGB Nielsen Media Research, which tracks programs on Indonesia's 11 national stations as well as 10 local ones. They scored high in all social and economic categories, but especially among affluent urban viewers. 
 ''I'm not surprised that they've become popular, but I'm surprised at how huge their ratings are,'' Indriena Basarah, general manager for Asia for Fremantle Media, the London-based production company behind ''American Idol'' and the worldwide ''Idol'' franchise, said here in Jakarta. 
 These days, there are 79 Indonesian reality television shows made by local production companies. The current ratings champion, ''Termehek-Mehek,'' which roughly means ''Sobbing,'' reunites people -- anyone from long-lost relatives to wives abandoned by their husbands -- in highly emotional and often confrontational settings. Other shows have a sharper social edge, like ''Jika Aku Menjadi'' (''If I Were''), which places a middle-class or wealthy person in rural Indonesia.
 In a recent episode, a college student named Tashia, born and raised in Jakarta in a well-to-do family, is seen playing the piano in a living room out of Middle America and singing ''What a Wonderful World.'' Suddenly, she is transported to a dilapidated house in a village where she experiences how an elderly couple, Abah and Emak, survive by making and selling snacks made of coconut and sugar. There are no Paris Hilton-like putdowns of the sticks. But in the end, it is clear Tashia is happy to be going home. ''Thank you Abah and Emak for giving me this precious lesson, so I can live my life,'' she says.
 In another show, ''Tukar Nasib'' (''Fate Swap''), a poor family and a middle-class family switch houses temporarily.
 In a recent episode, ominous music played as the middle-class family struggled to live in the poor rural family's house. One daughter was so terrified that she could not fall asleep. Still, the family adapted, dutifully doing the poor family's farm work and even clearing cow manure.
 Meanwhile, happy music comes on as the poor family is seen enjoying life in the middle class, eating red apples out of a fruit bowl and, of course, watching television. The father is too lazy to take on his middle-class counterpart's job at a transportation company, but his wife gets the idea. ''We have to work harder,'' she says, ''so that our son can go to school, be smart, successful and become a rich man.''
 In a country with a wide income gap, the show offers a rare look into how others live and serves to affirm the lifestyle of the tiny urban middle class, said a psychiatrist named Dr. Andri who has written about reality television and, like many Indonesians, uses only one name. 
 The reality shows represent another chapter in the evolution of Indonesian television. During the three decades of the Suharto dictatorship, stations, whether state outlets or privately owned, hewed to the military government's point of view. Except for news, there was little original content; airtime was filled with American shows like ''MacGyver'' and ''The Golden Girls.''
 Eventually, the American diet inspired a reaction as Islam began playing a larger role in the private lives of Indonesians and in politics. The American shows gave way to additional local programming as well as less politically sensitive imports, in the form of soap operas from Latin America, Japan, Hong Kong, India and South Korea.
 ''Now we have these reality shows that are copycats of American shows,'' said Rachma Ida, an expert on Indonesian television at Airlangga University in Surabaya, in East Java. But for the most part, she said, ''people don't realize that these new shows are very much American.''
 Eko Nugroho, the president of Dreamlight World Media, a producer of reality television, said the shows succeeded not by promoting American values but by tapping into universal desires. 
 One of his shows, ''Bedah Rumah'' (''House Change''), focuses on a poor, deserving family whose house undergoes radical improvement. Mr. Eko was also responsible for ''Tukar Nasib,'' the show in which poor and middle-class families trade places.
 Mr. Eko, 41, who earned a master's degree in business administration from Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., said producing ''Tukar Nasib'' made him realize that everybody in the world had the ''same dream, no matter who you are, no matter what nationality you are.''
 ''But,'' he added, ''Americans are the ones who first promoted this dream and these values through the media, so people think this kind of dream or values is American.''

HEADLINE: Fiat Begins to Talk Up Its Opel Bid

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: MILAN 

 BODY:
The Italian automaker Fiat said Friday that its offer for Opel of Germany calls for fewer than 10,000 job cuts in Europe -- far fewer than analysts had speculated. 
 Fiat's statement Friday was its first official comment on the offer presented Wednesday for Opel and the British brand Vauxhaul, both units of General Motors.
 Fiat says the job cuts would come throughout Europe, meaning ''the impact for the work force in Germany ... would be significantly lower than speculated.'' It referred to reports that there would be 18,000 layoffs in Germany.
 The company did not elaborate.
 It intends to merge Opel and Vauxhaul with Fiat Group Automobiles to create the largest European automaker. It already has a deal to become Chrysler's controlling shareholder.
 Fiat made its comments as the bidding process began to play out. 
 The governor of the German state where Opel unit is based indicated Friday that he favored a bid by Magna International of Canada, and was critical of an offer from Fiat.
 Besides Fiat, the auto parts maker Magna and the New York-based buyout firm Ripplewood Holdings have submitted plans to G.M. to acquire or invest in Opel.
 Details of the bids have not been released.
 ''I think there is a certain ranking, in which the offer from the Magna group is certainly the one that is closest to the hopes and wishes of, I think, many in German politics but also among employees,'' the state governor of Hesse, Roland Koch, said on Deutschlandfunk radio.
 He added that ''there is a very interesting offer from a financial investor with the Ripplewood group and certainly some ... are a little disappointed that Fiat's offer is a very long way from what one perhaps hoped for in some places.''
 Mr. Koch did not elaborate in detail on the strengths and weaknesses of the various bids.
 However, he said Magna was ''counting very strongly on being able to win new markets and new customers with new ideas, while other concepts rather assume rationalization.''
 The Fiat bid in particular has raised worries among some politicians and union officials of potentially large job losses, although the chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, has sought to allay those fears.
 Opel's parent, G.M., faces a June 1 deadline to restructure or file for bankruptcy. Berlin is keen to ensure the future of Opel -- which employs some 25,000 people in Germany, nearly half G.M. Europe's total work force.
 While state officials have offered opinions of the bidders, the German federal government has remained neutral. Ministers planned to meet later Friday to discuss the bids, also involving the governors of states with Opel plants, but it was unclear what might emerge from that gathering.
 ''The German government has three concepts; we are evaluating these concepts internally, but we will not participate now in public speculation and evaluations,'' a spokesman for the economy ministry, Steffen Moritz, told a regular government news conference.

HEADLINE: As Dollars Pile Up, Uneasy Traders Lower the Currency's Value

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The dollar was on a roll just a few months ago, bounding higher against foreign currencies as investors sought a safe hiding place for their money amid a global downturn. But now, many are rethinking their decision to buy American.
 The dollar skidded to its lowest point in five months this week, battered by creeping fears that Washington's costly efforts to stimulate the economy are growing harder to finance and may set off an unwelcome bout of inflation. Analysts are increasingly concerned that a rise in prices could hurt consumer spending, deepening the recession. 
 The dollar fell more than 3 percent this week, weakening to $1.40 against the euro on Friday and to $1.59 against the British pound. Experts said the flight to quality that made United States Treasury debt and dollar holdings so valuable at the height of the financial crisis was now heading for a rough landing.
 ''Those little footsteps coming down the hallway have begun to frighten many people,'' said David M. Darst, chief investment strategist at the Global Wealth Management Group of Morgan Stanley. ''The dollar has sold off inexorably, slowly but surely. The key thing driving it is psychology.''
 The Federal Reserve is printing money from thin air, and the government is issuing trillions of dollars in new debt as it tries to spend its way out of the recession with a huge stimulus package, new lending programs, health care overhauls and automotive rescues. 
 Experts warned there might not be enough demand to sop up all those new dollars and dollar-denominated Treasury securities. That led investors to fret about the sustainability of the United States government's AAA sovereign credit rating after the Standard & Poor's ratings agency warned this week that the sovereign rating of Britain -- which is spending hundreds of billions of pounds to engineer a recovery -- is under threat. 
 On Thursday, the influential bond fund manager Bill Gross of Pimco said in an interview on Bloomberg Television that the United States might eventually lose its triple-A credit score.
 The dollar's sharp slide has renewed concern that investors worldwide were beginning to favor other currencies, foreign economies and commodities like oil and metals. 
 Stock markets fell modestly on Friday, adding to big declines from a day earlier, and demand for longer-term Treasury debt ebbed, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to 3.44 percent, its highest point in six months. The Dow fell 14.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 8,277.32 while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1.33 points, or 0.2 percent, at 887.
 Crude oil futures rose above $60 a barrel this week, and gasoline prices climbed to a nationwide average of $2.39 a gallon, according to AAA, the automobile club. The price of gold -- a hedge against inflation -- rose to nearly $960 an ounce, its highest price in two months, and investors also raised the prices of copper, wheat and corn.
 Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 22/32, to 97 9/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.45 percent, up from 3.36 percent late Thursday.
 Only recently, the economy was veering into a spiral of lower prices and lower wages that economists feared would deepen the downturn. As prices dropped precipitously at the end of last year, consumers could stretch their dollars farther. But policy makers worried that a deflationary cycle would make consumers less likely to spend money if they constantly believed prices would be cheaper in the future.
 Now, some are starting to warn about an economic beast called stagflation -- the combination of higher prices and a struggling economy. 
 ''The economy may be at greater risk of inflation than the conventional wisdom indicates,'' Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, warned in a speech Thursday. He said prices could climb 2.5 percent in 2011, a higher forecast than the Fed's expectations of 1 to 1.9 percent inflation.
 Although the United States government officially supports a strong dollar, policy makers have let its value slide in past years because a weaker dollar makes American exports cheaper and more attractive. But a weaker dollar also makes imports -- like crude oil from the Middle East -- more expensive, raising the costs of energy and transportation.
 ''Everyone says a little inflation can't hurt us,'' said Martin D. Weiss, chairman of Weiss Research. ''What they don't seem to understand is, that's inflation in a growing economy. Inflation on top of rising unemployment is another thing entirely. It's much more painful, and it could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.''
 Some experts say fears of inflation and the loss of the dollar's strength are overblown. 
 With the global economy in its worst downturn since World War II, and European banks facing up to $1 trillion in new losses from Eastern European investments, the euro may begin to weaken on its own against the dollar, they say. The United States remains the world's default reserve currency, these experts add, and Treasury debt is still considered the world's safest investment.
 The Federal Reserve's own forecasts call for inflation to hover in a ''low range,'' rising only about 0.6 to 0.9 percent this year. Consumer prices dropped sharply over the last six months as demand plummeted, and prices were flat last month after falling slightly in March.
 According to the Labor Department, consumer prices in April were down 0.7 percent from a year earlier, their biggest decline in decades. Airline tickets cost less, gasoline is cheaper than last year, and retailers are still offering deep discounts to beckon consumers.
 But while lower demand and a sluggish economy normally act to constrain inflation, some experts said the pressure on prices in the months ahead might be driven by economic activity elsewhere in the world, not just inside its biggest economy. 
 ''There is growth in the emerging markets,'' said Mr. Darst of Morgan Stanley. ''There's an international demand as well as a U.S. demand. The inflationary pressures are going to be coming from outside the walls of Troy.''

HEADLINE: Shares Fall, and Dollar Hits Low Against Euro

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Equity traders tried to set aside some of their worries about the federal government's credit rating and scooped up shares of retail stocks. But shares, which were higher for most of Friday, turned lower late in the day.
 But the currency markets were another story. The dollar kept falling Friday, notching fresh multi-month lows against the euro, pound and yen as a warning that Britain's debt level may result in its credit rating being cut ricocheted into worries about the massive deficit in Washington. 
 The euro rose to $1.4015 in morning trading from $1.3889 in New York late Thursday -- its first time above $1.40 since Jan. 2.
 The British pound rose to $1.5916 from $1.5890, peaking at $1.5945 earlier in the session, its highest point since Nov. 6.
 Meanwhile, the dollar edged up to 94.51 Japanese yen from 94.23 yen -- after earlier falling to 93.82, its lowest point since Feb. 23.
 On Thursday, Standard & Poor's said that Britain might have its rating cut because of rising debt levels. Though the ratings agency reaffirmed the country's actual long-term credit rating at ''AAA,'' it said the outlook had deteriorated because of massive borrowing to deal with the recession and the banking crisis.
 Because Britain is pursuing similar policies to the United States -- with both the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve injecting billions of dollars in their economies by buying assets from banks -- the move also weighed on American assets and the dollar. Treasurys sold off Thursday, and continued to do so Friday.
 S.&P.'s announcement ''wound up creating more problems for the U.S. dollar than for the British pound,'' HSBC analysts said in a research note.
 Oil prices held above $61 a barrel Friday, helped by the weakening dollar, which typically has an inverse relationship with crude markets. Investors often buy commodities such as oil as a protection against the inflation that can result from a weaker dollar. Crude oil settled at $61.67 a barrel, up 62 cents.
 On Wall Street, shares on Wall Street turned lower Friday afternoon.
 Several retailers posted better-than-expected results including Sears, Gap and Aeropostale, but that was not enough to sustain the markets. 
 The market's mood has turned decidedly more cautious as investors began to question whether a powerful two-month rally has been overdone. The benchmark S.&P. 500 index bounced off of 12-year lows in early March on signals of a recovery and is still up more than 30 percent since then. Many market watchers think there's more air to be let out of the balloon.
 ''Everything is overpriced,'' said Harry Rady, chief executive and portfolio manager of Rady Asset Management. ''A very long, protracted recession is still very much alive.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 14.81 points, or 0.18 percent, at 8,277.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.15 percent or 1.33 points at 887, and the Nasdaq was 0.19 percent or 3.24 points lower at 1,692.01.
 The Dow's drop Thursday was its fourth in five days, but the blue chips still begin Friday's trading with a gain of 0.3 percent for the week because of a rally Monday.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Adds Fees to Refill Insurance Fund

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal regulators adopted a new system of special fees paid by financial institutions on Friday that will shift more of the burden to bigger banks to help replenish the deposit insurance fund. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's board voted 4-1 to approve the new fees. It is intended to raise $5.6 billion in the face of a cascade of bank failures that have depleted the insurance fund. The lone dissent came from the comptroller of the currency, John C. Dugan, whose agency regulates national banks.
 The F.D.I.C. now expects bank failures will cost the fund around $70 billion through 2013, up from a previous assessment of around $65 billion.
 ''There will be some shifting of the burden'' to major banks, the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, Sheila C. Bair, said. ''The shift is not huge to them. We're asking them to pay more.''
 The seizure Thursday of the struggling BankUnited FSB in Florida is expected to cost the insurance fund $4.9 billion, the second-largest hit since the financial crisis began. The costliest was last year's seizure of the California lender IndyMac Bank, on which the insurance fund is estimated to have lost $10.7 billion. BankUnited FSB, based in Coral Gables, Fla., was the 34th federally insured institution to be closed this year.
 The new emergency premium, to be collected from all federally insured institutions, will be 5 cents for every $100 of a bank's assets minus its so-called Tier 1, or regulatory capital, as of June 30. The F.D.I.C.'s previous planned fee was 20 cents per $100 of a bank's insured deposits. A measure of a bank's health, Tier 1 capital includes common and preferred stock as well as intangible assets such as tax losses that can be used to reduce future earnings.
 Because larger financial institutions tend to rely more heavily on financing from sources other than deposits, bigger banks would end up paying a heftier portion of the new assessment. F.D.I.C. officials estimated that of the $5.6 billion the agency is seeking to raise, as much as $500 million that would have been paid by smaller banks under the previous plan could be absorbed by larger ones.

HEADLINE: Son of an Indy Champion Seeks Trophy of His Own

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS 

 BODY:
Bobby Rahal, the former champion, jotted a note the other day to his son Graham, the driving phenom. Preparing for the Indianapolis 500 was painstaking enough, Bobby Rahal wrote, but winning the race would be a result of sweating every detail on a long afternoon -- like hitting his marks on every pit stop.
 ''This race can get very frustrating at times,'' Bobby Rahal said Thursday in an interview. 
 Rahal won the 1986 Indy 500, rocketing into the lead with two laps remaining. He became a team owner, with David Letterman, the talk-show host. Their driver, Buddy Rice, won at Indy in 2004. Danica Patrick began driving for the team in 2005, and that year she became the first woman to lead at Indy.
 Graham Rahal, who lives outside Columbus, Ohio, is only 20, and he has made progress as a driver at a remarkable clip, even for the son of a champion. He won his first IndyCar Series race a year ago and has earned two pole positions in the first four races of his second season.
 He will start fourth in his second Indy 500 on Sunday, and he is widely thought to have a good chance to become the youngest driver to win the race. Troy Ruttman was 22 years 80 days old when he won the 1952 Indy 500. He did not win the race again in eight attempts.
 ''I know I've got a couple of years to get it done,'' Graham Rahal said with a smile about breaking the record.
 But opportunities vanish as quickly as a car down the straightaway here, and Graham Rahal can refer to his father's path as an owner for evidence of that. Patrick moved to Andretti Green Racing, a more powerful team, after the 2006 season, and Bobby Rahal's team declined. Rahal said in January that the team's sponsor had withdrawn because of the poor economy.
 Rahal Letterman Racing had to scramble to find corporate sponsorship for just this race for just one car, which will be driven by Oriol Servia of Spain, who finished 11th last year. Bobby Rahal is hoping that Servia, who starts 25th in the 33-car field, will drive fast enough to attract enough sponsorship money for another race.
 ''Oriol is a good driver, and we miss not being in the series on a full-time basis,'' Rahal said. ''We'd like to keep it going. We'll see what happens. You never know.''
 Rahal would also love to see his son win, too, and for more than just personal reasons. Graham Rahal is the only driver among the top six starters who does not drive for Roger Penske, Chip Ganassi or Michael Andretti.
 Rahal drives for Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing, the team started by Paul Newman. The team stayed in Championship Auto Racing Teams, later called the Champ Car World Series, as other teams like Penske's defected to the IndyCar Series.
 The IndyCar Series swallowed the remnants of Champ Car a year ago, and Graham Rahal drove in the Indianapolis 500 for the first time. He started 13th, but he hit the wall while trying to make a pass early in the race and finished last.
 ''We're not the best-funded team, and that's by a long shot, but we are among the best teams currently out there,'' Rahal said.
 Referring to Carl Haas, the team's co-owner, Rahal said, ''Carl's always been able to make the best out of what he's got.''
 When Justin Wilson moved from Newman/Haas/Lanigan to Dale Coyne Racing after the season, Rahal became the team's No. 1 driver. He drives a red No. 02 car with what is probably the most familiar sponsor in the race, McDonald's.
 ''I would not be shocked if at the start of the race he gets into his own rhythm quickly,'' Eddie Cheever, an analyst for ABC-TV, said of Rahal. ''He gets behind a driver that's got a lot of miles here like Helio Castroneves. So he will just immediately make that jump forward during the race. I think he has great potential. I would not be shocked at all if at some point he led.''
 The Newman/Haas/Lanigan team still has a mystique. Newman and Haas, both sports-car racers, started the team in 1983 with Mario Andretti as their first driver. The team, which included Mario's son Michael, won 107 open-wheel races, 107 poles and 8 championships.
 ''They stick to the basics, and they're always quick,'' Marco Andretti, a grandson of Mario who drives for his father, said of Newman/Haas/Lanigan. ''They've always been good at that.''
 Asked about Rahal, Andretti said: ''He's a tremendous talent. A nice kid.''
 Andretti is 22, with three Indy 500s behind him. A driver grows up fast here.

HEADLINE: Ford's Cheerleader And Chief

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
It's not every day that the president of the United States plugs your company's product, but it happened to Alan Mulally on Tuesday, when President Obama took to the Rose Garden to unveil the administration's new fuel economy initiative. Surrounded by environmental activists, government officials and the chief executives of the Big Three Detroit auto companies, Mr. Obama declared that by 2016, the car companies would have to produce vehicles that got, on average, 35.5 miles per gallon, a big jump from the current 27.5 miles per gallon.
 Then, just as he was leaving the podium, the president off-handedly said, ''By the way, I just want to mention, I think I still have my Ford parked in Chicago. It's a Ford hybrid. It runs great. You guys should take a look.'' Mr. Mulally, who is Ford's C.E.O., broke into a wide grin and pumped his fist enthusiastically. It was a classic Mulally gesture. 
 Back in the fall of 2006, when Mr. Mulally left his long-time job running Boeing's commercial airline division to join Ford, the company appeared to be in the worst shape of the three American auto companies. Today, the picture looks much different. If not exactly an exemplar of corporate health -- Ford lost $14.6 billion in 2008 and doesn't expect to make a profit again until 2011 -- it is certainly much better off than Chrysler or General Motors. By staying out of bankruptcy and avoiding government assistance, it has maintained much more control over its own destiny. It has shed noncore assets like Jaguar, and streamlined the organization to refocus on the Ford brand. And it is coming out with new cars -- a new Fusion hybrid two months ago; the revived Taurus this summer; the Fiesta, a small European-style auto, next year -- that has employees genuinely excited about the future. 
 As I discovered when I visited Ford this week, at least some of that excitement is due to Mr. Mulally himself. ''Alan is an exceptionally positive person,'' said Lewis Booth, Ford's chief financial officer. ''In such tough times, people need to see hope, and Alan articulates hope very well.'' In other words, in addition to being Ford's chief executive, Mr. Mulally is also its chief fist-pumper. Indeed, he can be so persuasively optimistic that when you're in his force field, it is easy to forget Ford still has a huge task ahead of it. For all its progress, it still has to get people to buy its cars again.
 I had been told, before meeting him, that Mr. Mulally would lay it on thick. He didn't disappoint. ''Come here, Joe,'' he said after we were introduced. ''You gotta see what I saw on my first day here.'' He strode quickly into his office, as I trailed behind.
 At first, I wasn't sure what he meant. Nothing in the room really stood out -- except, that is, the view, which is what he wanted me to see. ''Look,'' he said, excitedly pointing out one window. ''There's the River Rouge plant'' -- surely the most famous auto factory in the world. ''The afternoon of my first day I went over there and spent hours looking around and talking to people.'' Then he pointed in another direction. ''There's Chrysler,'' he said. He swung his finger about 90 degrees. ''And there's G.M.,'' he said, pointing off in the distance. He cackled. ''I've got 'em right where I want 'em,'' he joked.
 What people also told me was that beneath this jovial, relentlessly upbeat exterior was an intense, hard-nosed businessman. Looking at what Mr. Mulally has done so far, it would be hard to argue. He came into a company that was legendary for its fiefs, and tore them down. He held regular Thursday morning meetings with top management, where the only real sin was hiding the truth --another thing Ford had been long known for. 
 He insisted that the Taurus, once one of the company's most iconic brands but one it had abandoned, be revived. Then when he was shown the first clay model of a new Taurus, he and the other top executives gave it the thumbs down; it wasn't good enough, they concluded. And although the company was preparing to borrow billions of dollars before he was hired, Mr. Mulally insisted that Ford try to get its hands on every last penny it could. As a result, Ford hocked virtually every asset it had for a $23.6 billion loan -- money that has allowed it to survive the recession and continue spending billions on product development. Which is another thing about Mr. Mulally: he's not afraid to bet the farm.
 Mr. Booth told me Ford probably needed an outsider like Mr. Mulally to move the company forward. The auto companies are historically insular, which is a big part of the reason they've stumbled so badly. Bill Ford, the previous C.E.O. (he's still chairman, of course) had spent his life in the family business; he knew some of these things needed to be done, but he could never bring himself to pull the trigger. 
 ''I don't think an insider could have moved us so speedily to a 'one-Ford culture,' '' said Mr. Booth. In tearing down those Ford fiefdoms, Mr. Mulally has been trying to turn Ford into a truly global company, more along the lines of Toyota than a typical American car company. That means that successful cars in one part of the world can be adapted to other markets -- something that never used to happen. The introduction of the Fiesta into North America next year -- a car that has done exceedingly well in Europe -- is the paradigmatic example of the kind of moves Mr. Mulally wants Ford to make on a regular basis.
 But that still poses the question: will the Focus hybrid, the Fiesta, the Taurus and the other new cars Ford is introducing ultimately appeal to Americans? Without enthusiastic car buyers, there will be no revival, no matter how well Mr. Mulally reorganizes and re-energizes Ford.
 When I was in Dearborn, the company let me drive both a Fiesta and a Taurus (a classic ritual for visiting journalists, by the way). I found them both fun to drive with lots of impressive features. Yet I couldn't help noticing that they were both pretty small. The new Taurus is nothing like the car that was once the best-selling auto in the United States. The old Taurus was a family sedan; this one was sportier but hardly suitable for families. And the Fiesta was downright tiny. The Fusion hybrid isn't exactly a big car either; its selling point is its average of 41 miles per gallon, some 8 miles per gallon better than the Toyota Camry hybrid. But is that what Americans really want?
 Surely, that's the big question, not just for Mr. Mulally but for the country. Thanks to the new fuel economy rules, all the car companies are going to have to build more fuel-efficient autos, which means cars that are smaller and lighter. Last summer, of course, when gas at the pump hit $4 and change, that is what American consumers seemed to be clamoring for. But now gas is about half that amount, and historically, Americans have gravitated back to S.U.V.'s and other gas-guzzlers when gas prices have dropped. Those big cars, categorized as ''light trucks'' by the government, won't have to meet anywhere near the same fuel economy standards. It's a giant loophole in the rules.
 In effect, the American car companies, in stressing light trucks, ceded the car market to Toyota and Honda, and forgot how to make money in cars. But when I pushed Mr. Mulally on this point, he insisted Ford would be able to make money on its cars.
 ''We have a point of view about the future,'' he said as the interview was coming to a close. ''These are the same cars that people desire all over the world,'' he said. ''There is a great market for cars in the United States -- as Honda and Toyota have proven.''
 He continued, ''We have a point of view about fuel efficiency'' -- namely, that ultimately it is what car buyers, in the United States and around the world, are going to want. Despite the dip in gasoline prices, he said, he thought oil prices would eventually start climbing and the days when American car companies could make money solely by selling gas guzzlers was coming to a close. Shortly after the president's announcement, Goldman Sachs's auto analyst, Patrick Archambault, wrote that the new fuel standards would be difficult to achieve but that Ford was the ''best positioned'' of the Big Three to get there. That is music to Mr. Mulally's ears.
 When you get right down to it, rolling out cars like the Taurus and the Fiesta is just another big, enthusiastic, fist-pumping bet Mr. Mulally is making. For Ford's sake and for the country's, let's hope he's got it right.

HEADLINE: Obama Draws Cheers, Not Protest, at Annapolis

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: ANNAPOLIS, Md. 

 BODY:
Nobody protested President Obama's commencement address Friday morning at the United States Naval Academy. Nobody told Mr. Obama he was undeserving of an honorary degree. Instead, under a nearly cloudless blue sky, the president was treated to a 21-gun salute, a Blue Angels flyover -- and a respite from the controversy that has dogged him at two previous graduation ceremonies.
 It was Mr. Obama's first commencement speech as president to graduates of a military academy -- a rite of passage for every commander in chief -- and he pledged to harness diplomacy and economic aid alongside military power to defend the nation and provide fighting forces with everything they need to succeed in their missions. 
 ''As long as I am your commander in chief,'' Mr. Obama said, ''I will only send you into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary, and with the strategy and the well-defined goals, the equipment and the support that you need to get the job done.''
 The 23-minute address came one day after Mr. Obama, in a lengthier speech at the National Archives in Washington, offered a far-reaching defense of his antiterrorism policies, including his decision to close the American military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On Friday, he repeated his message that in an age of terrorism, he can both protect Americans from attack and uphold fundamental American values.
 As the debate on national security policy proceeds, Mr. Obama said, ''we must remember this enduring truth: The values and ideals in those documents are not simply words written into aging parchment; they are the bedrock of our liberty and our security.''
 There was a special guest among the 30,000 people who attended the ceremony: Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who ran for president against Mr. Obama in 2008, and is a 1958 graduate of the academy. Mr. McCain's son and namesake, John S. McCain IV, was among those graduating on Friday. 
 Mr. McCain sat unobtrusively in the audience with his wife, Cindy; an administration official said that out of respect for the McCains' wishes, the president made no mention of the couple or their son. But when the younger Mr. McCain was called to the podium to receive his diploma, there was a huge roar from the crowd, and Mr. Obama spent an extra few moments with him, and gave him an enthusiastic couple of claps on the shoulder.
 This has been a spring of graduation drama for Mr. Obama. Arizona State University provoked a national furor by declining to give him an honorary degree, reasoning that ''his body of work is yet to come.'' The president, in his speech there, gamely agreed. 
 At Notre Dame, abortion opponents boycotted Mr. Obama's speech. Mr. Obama did not duck the issue, but rather embraced it with a call for greater understanding, ''open hearts, open mind, fair-minded words'' in the abortion debate.
 There was no such controversy here in Annapolis, where midshipmen are more apt to say ''Yes, sir'' than to protest. Clad in sparkling summer dress whites, the graduates greeted their new commander in chief with hoots, hollers and raucous applause. Mr. Obama, in return, praised them for the path they had chosen -- a notable contrast, he suggested, to the pursuit of wealth that helped foster the current economic crisis.
 ''These Americans have embraced the virtues that we need most right now: self-discipline over self-interest; work over comfort; and character over celebrity,'' the president said. ''After an era when so many institutions and individuals have acted with such greed and recklessness, it's no wonder that our military remains the most trusted institution in our nation.''
 When all the diplomas had been handed out, the 2009 class president, Ensign Andrew R. Poulin, summoned Mr. Obama back to the podium to present him with a black flight jacket emblazoned on the back with gold block letters that read ''commander in chief.'' 
 ''It even has pockets for your Blackberry, and you will look sharp on the basketball court with this, sir,'' Ensign Poulin said. 
 Mr. Obama took off his blue suit coat, slipped on the jacket, and flashed the graduates a thumbs up.

HEADLINE: Cheney Seeks Book Deal on Bush Years and More

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and MOTOKO RICH; Jim Rutenberg reported from Washington, and Motoko Rich from New York. Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With his sustained blitz of television appearances and speeches, former Vice President Dick Cheney has established himself as perhaps the leading Republican voice against President Obama.
 Not a bad time, then, to be in the market for a multimillion-dollar book contract.
 Mr. Cheney is actively shopping a memoir about his life in politics and service in four presidential administrations, a work that would add to what is already an unusually dense collection of post-Bush-presidency memoirs that will offer a collective rebuttal to the many harshly critical works released while the writers were in office and beyond. 
 Already working hard to meet publishers' deadlines is an informal writers' workshop of historic proportions: President George W. Bush; Laura Bush, the former first lady; former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.; former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld; and Karl Rove, the former presidential political mastermind. 
 Members of the Bush group are in regular contact as they seek to jog their memories, compare notes and trade stylistic tips in their new lives as authors, according to friends and current and former aides.
 The coming crush of books reflects what former Bush officials describe as a desire to produce their own drafts of history after gritting their teeth for so long over the works of the journalists and disgruntled colleagues who penned the first, second and third drafts before them.
 Adding to the eagerness is that Mr. Bush and his team had no vocal defender in the presidential campaign last year, when even the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, often attacked their stewardship.
 ''This is a group that kept their powder dry for a long time,'' said Ed Gillespie, the former counselor to Mr. Bush, who stays in close contact with his colleagues. ''People will get a firsthand account of the real nature of the decisions and the choices this administration had to make, and maybe there are some things people weren't free to say at the time that they can say now that can shed some light on some things.''
 Then again, the money isn't bad, either.
 A person familiar with discussions Mr. Cheney has had with publishers said he was seeking more than $2 million for his advance. That sum may prove hard to get in this economic climate, especially given his generally low approval ratings, which publishers view as a potential -- but not certain -- harbinger for sales. 
 While Mr. Bush got an advance estimated to be well into the millions for a look into 12 of his most important decisions, his payout is not believed to be as large as that of former President Bill Clinton for his memoirs, which drew a $15 million advance. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld was not paid an advance by his publisher, Sentinel, of Penguin Group USA, and has committed to donating his share of any proceeds to his nonprofit foundation. (Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld, and Mr. Obama, for that matter, were represented in their contract talks by the Washington lawyer Robert B. Barnett.)
 Mr. Cheney's friends say he does not need the money and has made clear in his talks that he is eager to give a full accounting of his life in politics that will debunk his many critics.
 According to a person familiar with a meeting that Mr. Cheney had with a publisher, the former vice president is proposing a memoir that would function not only as the story of his role in four Republican administrations but also as a history of ''the entire Republican ascendancy going back to Nixon.'' This person did not want to be named because of the confidentiality of the talks.
 Mr. Cheney has talked with houses including HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster, where Mary Matalin, his close friend and adviser, is editor in chief of Threshold, the conservative imprint that is also publishing Mr. Rove's book. Marji Ross, president and publisher of the conservative publisher Regnery, said she and others at the house had talked informally to Mr. Cheney and Mr. Barnett. But Ms. Matalin's long history with Mr. Cheney has made her imprint a logical home for his book. 
 John Hannah, a senior adviser to Mr. Cheney at the White House, said that when he spoke to Mr. Cheney a few weeks ago the former vice president was trying to figure out how to strike a balance between his life story and his hotly debated tenure serving with Mr. Bush. ''The question was, Do you do the 40 years in Washington, given all his experiences in different jobs and perspectives?'' Mr. Hannah said. ''Or do you need to do something fairly quickly to answer and to discuss the last eight years?''
 As the talks continue, Mr. Cheney is writing out his thoughts longhand in an office above his garage in Virginia and is in frequent contact with the other newly minted Bush administration authors, right on up to Mr. Bush.
 A report by U.S. News & World Report about a visit by Mr. Cheney to Mr. Rumsfeld's Washington office in March prompted speculation that they were trying to match up their stories, which a Rumsfeld spokesman, Keith Urbahn, denied. He said there was likely to be a greater divergence of views in the coming books than some might expect. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld, who is working almost full time on his book, feeding dictation to aides culling his personal papers, often differed with counterweights in other departments, like Ms. Rice. ''There's a great deal of truth to the adage of where you stand is where you sit,'' Mr. Urbahn said.
 Ms. Rice has a three-book deal with Crown, Mr. Bush's publisher. Douglas Brinkley, the historian, said she indicated to him late last year that she deemed it appropriate to wait for the president to publish his book, scheduled for 2010, before she published hers on the White House.

HEADLINE: In Area Packed With Prisons, A Split on Adding Jihadists

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Dan Frosch contributed reporting from Denver.

DATELINE: CANON CITY, Colo. 

 BODY:
Prison is a way of life here, and always has been. The old territorial prison started it all in 1868 at the end of Main Street, anchoring a community and an economy with its massive tan stone walls and turrets. Generations later, more than 5,000 inmates in state and federal lockups, from minimum security to the so-called supermax, ring the town like a bracelet.
 But when it comes to the idea of transferring those suspected or convicted of terrorism from the prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba to federal high-security prisons like the one just down the road in Florence, as the Obama administration has proposed, Lyle Jacobson draws the line. 
 ''It would make us a target,'' said Mr. Jacobson, an 84-year-old retired accountant. ''I think it's very dangerous.''
 Mr. Jacobson, who said he was a prisoner of war in Germany for nine months near the end of World War II, said he was not so worried about escapes. The prisons are secure enough, he said, and in fact there have been no escapes from the Administrative Maximum prison in Florence, the only one in the federal system. Rather, it is the international attention -- a bull's-eye for terrorists and their allies -- that he fears could be drawn around this part of southeast Colorado.
 Al Ballard is just as vocal and opinionated the other way.
 ''Bring them on,'' said Mr. Ballard, who owns a tea house in town with his wife, Linda. ''I don't worry a lick.''
 Mr. Ballard said the prison in Florence was so well run and secure and isolated that people here would not notice a thing. ''We do need more guards though,'' he added.
 In a speech on Thursday, President Obama said it would be safe to transfer many Guantanamo inmates to high-security prisons in the United States, noting that the corrections system already holds hundreds of convicted terrorists. A Justice Department spokesman, Matt Miller, said 216 international terrorists were in federal prisons, as well as 139 domestic terrorists. All have been convicted and are in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.
 That kind of transfer is not a blase topic here. Opinions are instant and strong. And there is a base of experience. Many of the terrorists the president cited already reside in Florence, including Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and Ramzi Yousef, convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Ahmed Ressam, the ''millennium bomber''; Wadih El-Hage, a member of Al Qaeda convicted of the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski.
 Nonetheless, when the word Guantanamo comes up, so do questions of politics and safety, and for some, religion and culture -- taut and intertwined and loaded with emotion.
 ''People here are good Christian conservatives,'' said Tom Baron, who described himself as a struggling small-business man, co-owner with his wife, Marie, of Donuts and Dogs, a coffee shop. Mr. Baron said he thought that large numbers of Muslims -- the family members and friends of inmates -- would move into town if the transfer occurred. Property values would fall, he said, and some family members of terrorists might be terrorists, too.
 ''That would destroy this community,'' Mr. Baron said.
 Fine-print legal definitions of who exactly can be labeled a terrorist under federal law have also become bound up in the debate about transfers. Not all of those mentioned by the president were actually convicted of terrorism. The Bureau of Prisons classifies inmates it holds -- some of whom might have been convicted of, say, multiple murder counts -- as terrorists if their crimes were intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.
 Politics quickly finds a way into the discussion after that. Mr. Obama, though he carried Colorado as a whole last November, fared badly here in Fremont County, winning only about a third of the vote.
 ''I wouldn't expect people in Fremont County to favor the president's positions,'' said State Representative Liane McFadyen, a Democrat whose district in Fremont County includes 12 prisons -- eight run by the state and four by the federal bureau. Ms. McFadyen said she had mostly heard opposition from constituents. 
 And where politics and local concerns about safety collide, the mix is volatile.
 ''These people hate America; they truly hate America,'' said Glen Morlan, a disabled welder. ''Why would you want to bring them here?'' 
 Mr. Morlan said that he had not voted for Mr. Obama and that he thought the idea of closing Guantanamo was bad for national security -- and the community. And that makes him dislike Mr. Obama all the more.
 Some people do in fact shrug their shoulders about the question of detainee transfers. 
 Sherry Meins, a school aide at Garden Park High School, was enjoying the last day of school on Friday, sitting outside in the sun on a bench on Main Street. Ms. Meins said the system of security alerts in town was so elaborate and well honed as to be almost second nature, so much that she did not think Guantanamo detainees would change anything. 
 The schools, she said, regularly practice ''lockdowns'' that would take place in the event of an inmate escape. And even if a prisoner did get out, she said, he probably wanted to get out of town as fast as possible, not hang around Canon City.
 ''Our children our safe,'' Ms. Meins said.
 Ms. McFadyen, the state representative for the area, said transfers might be moot anyway unless prisoners already in Florence were moved elsewhere.
 ''On top of everything else, there's no room at the supermax,'' she said. ''It's full.''

HEADLINE: The Land That Republicans Forgot

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Colin Powell, one of the few Republicans with enough fire in his belly to stand up to his party's extremists, said earlier this week in Boston: ''Rush Limbaugh says, 'Get out of the Republican Party.' Dick Cheney says, 'He's already out.' I may be out of their version of the Republican Party, but there's another version of the Republican Party waiting to emerge once again.'' Give 'em hell, Powell! 
 It was apropos that Powell delivered this rebuke in the Northeast since that's where ''their version'' of the party is facing its most daunting challenges. 
 In 1984, Ronald Reagan won every Northeastern state. Since then, the leadership of the G.O.P. has systematically shed its idealists in favor of ideologues, reducing itself to the current Cheney-Limbaugh illusionati whose strategy is to exploit faith and ignorance by fanning fear and hatred.
 But, Northeasterners are not so easily duped. Voters there tend to be wealthier, better educated, less religious and more progressive than those in other regions. 
 According to the Census Bureau, the median household income in most of these states is higher than the national average. And, a census report released in January revealed that 31.5 percent of Northeasterners had a bachelor's degree or higher, more than in any other region.
 The American Religious Identification Survey released in March found that New England had the highest percentage of respondents who said either ''none'' or ''no religion'' when asked about faith. Nationwide, the percentage of ''nones'' nearly doubled from 1990 to 2008. In the Northeast, it more than doubled, and in some cases nearly tripled. ''Nones'' tend to be liberal and voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in November.
 Of the Northeasterners who did name a religion, the one most cited was Catholicism. According to a Gallup poll in March, Catholics are more liberal on most moral issues than the general public. 
 Even Republicans in this part of the country are more moderate. Of the 18 U.S. senators in these states, only four were Republican in February when three of them broke ranks and gave Obama the votes he needed to pass the stimulus bill. And one of them, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, has since defected to the Democrats. 
 That's because the entire region is awash in moderates, and Republicans are losing ground with them. According to a report on Monday by Gallup, Republican support among moderates fell by 9 percent from 2001 to 2009.
 Are the Republicans softening some positions to reverse the trend? Of course not. As a Gallup report on Wednesday noted: ''Most of the uptick in support for conservative positions over the past year is the result of Republicans (including independents who lean Republican) moving to the political right in their views.''
 It's no wonder then that Republican presidential candidates have lost every Northeastern state since 1992, with the exception of New Hampshire in 2000. In fact, four of the five states that delivered Obama his biggest margins of victory were in the Northeast. 
 The Republicans need Powell's version of the party to re-emerge now. The question is: What are they waiting for?

HEADLINE: Bank of Japan Upgrades Its Outlook for Economy

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The Bank of Japan upgraded its assessment of the nation's economy for the first time in three years Friday, saying a rebound in global demand could mean that the record contraction last quarter represented the worst of the recession. 
 The bank also said it would start accepting foreign bonds as collateral for loans to ease strains on the banking system, but analysts said its more upbeat tone on the economy suggested that it might postpone any plans to return to full quantitative easing. The bank kept its target interest rate at 0.1 percent. 
 ''There have been expressions like free-falling or cliff-diving,'' the bank governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, said after a two-day policy meeting 
 ''We are no longer in that sort of situation.'' 
 ''The economy has been moving in line with the projection we made in the outlook report'' last month, Mr. Shirakawa said. The bank said on April 30 that gross domestic product would shrink 3.1 percent this fiscal year and expand 1.2 percent the next year. 
 On Wednesday, Japan reported that in the first quarter of 2009, G.D.P. shrank 15.2 percent on an annualized basis. It was a fourth consecutive quarter of contraction and the biggest decline since Japan began keeping records in 1955. Mr. Shirakawa said Friday that G.D.P. would improve sharply in the second quarter, but did not elaborate. 
 In the last few months, some signs have emerged that the global economy is stabilizing. Steep declines in Japanese exports have leveled out and industrial output rose 1.6 percent in March, the first gain in six months. 
 Mr. Shirakawa said the recent uptick in demand was mainly because of companies replenishing depleted inventories, and it was too early to tell if there would be a sustained recovery in consumer spending. 
 ''The key is how strong final demand will be after inventory adjustments are over,'' he said, adding, ''We think consumption and capital spending will be weak for the time being.'' 
 Friday's comments echoed more upbeat assessments of the global economy. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Friday that the ''free fall'' was over. 
 But the Federal Reserve, in minutes released from its April policy meeting, cut its outlook for United States growth over the next three years and said a full recovery could take five or six years. 
 Like the Fed, the Bank of Japan has been buying government bonds, corporate debt and other assets to revive bank lending. The bank said Friday that it would expand the range of collateral accepted for its market operations to include American British, German and French sovereign debt, indicating it was still worried about Japanese banks' ability to raise funds. 
 The central bank did not mention if its less bearish outlook had affected its views on whether it should buy more Japanese government bonds, which would push more money into the economy to spur growth. 
 But Seiji Adachi, senior economist at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo, noted that ''accepting foreign bonds as collateral is a way to refrain from buying more Japanese government bonds.''

HEADLINE: When Did Cowboys Get Wimpy?

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Out of all the problems we have run into in dealing with the giant hairball that is known as the Bush War on Terror, one of the weirdest is the reaction to President Obama's plan to close down Guantanamo.
 In the rank of threats to public safety, putting the Guantanamo inmates in maximum-security prisons in the United States has got to come in way behind, say, making it easy for customers to purchase firearms at gun shows. 
 But to hear the howls coming from Congress, you'd think the Obama administration was planning to house the prisoners in suburban preschools. ''Terrorists. Coming soon to a neighborhood near you,'' warned a Republican Web video, which mixed pictures of accused terrorists with road signs in states where the G.O.P. predicted they might be sent. In another production, the occasionally loyal opposition resurrected the infamous ''Daisy'' countdown ad to show a little girl picking petals off a flower while the president prepares to close Gitmo.
 ''To bring the worst of the worst terrorists inside the United States would be cause for great danger and regret in the years to come,'' snarled Dick Cheney in his ''no middle ground'' speech. Although really, for the sake of the national mental health, it might be better if we all just ignore the former vice president until he agrees to undergo therapy. Forget I ever mentioned it.
 Instead, consider the case of Hardin, Mont., a community of 3,400 people just down the road from the place where Custer made his Last Stand. 
 Lately, things have not been going any better for Hardin than they did for the general. Unemployment is rife. ''You go look at our downtown, there's many closed businesses ... you'll see drunks laying in the street. It's not a pretty sight,'' the head of the town's economic development authority told National Public Radio. The town built a $27 million, 464-bed prison under the theory that other parts of the state would pay to have Hardin look after their problem residents. But it's been empty since it was declared open for business nearly two years ago, and the construction loans are in default.
 So, with the town council's enthusiastic support, Hardin volunteered to take the Guantanamo prisoners. 
 It's unlikely that the White House would have accepted the offer, but it was certainly an example of pluck and you'd think everyone would give Hardin three cheers. Instead, Montana's Democratic senators went ballistic. 
 ''We're not going to bring Al Qaeda to Big Sky Country -- no way, not on my watch,'' said Max Baucus.
 ''If these prisoners need a new place, it's not going to be anywhere near The Last Best Place,'' said Jon Tester.
 This shows us two things:
 1) Montana has given itself many nicknames.
 2) Montanans are more easily frightened than Manhattanites.
 Think about it. New Yorkers live in the top terror target in the nation. This week four new would-be terrorists were arrested for plotting to blow up synagogues in the Bronx. On the same day, President Obama announced that the first Guantanamo prisoner to be tried in the United States would be coming to court in Lower Manhattan. 
 Even though it appears the guys involved in the Bronx case were deeply, deeply inept, this is still not the kind of news package you want to hear. But nobody had a fit over it. ''Bottom line is we have had terrorists housed in New York before,'' said Senator Charles Schumer.
 New Yorkers aren't the only ones who have learned to calmly resist both international terrorism and national hysteria. The small town of Florence, Colo., has a 490-bed high-security facility known as Supermax, which houses 33 terrorists, including Ramzi Yousef, who led the first World Trade Center bombing; the failed shoe-bomber Richard Reid; and Zacarias Moussaoui, convicted of conspiring in the Sept. 11 attacks.
 The local residents seem fine with it, possibly because they know the prisoners spend 23 hours a day in their cells, which are made of poured concrete and furnished with concrete tables and bunks. 
 Nobody escapes from maximum-security prisons. But even if they did, who would you rather have on the lam in your neighborhood -- a native of Afghanistan whose history suggests an affinity for jihad? Or a resident of your own state whose history suggests an affinity for breaking into people's houses, tying them up and torturing them?
 The nation, as we all know, is divided into crowded states and empty states, and I was always under the impression that folks in the empty places were particularly brave and self-reliant. Those of us who live in the crowded parts have many good qualities, but we are not necessarily all of pioneer stock, given the critical importance we assign to restaurants that deliver at 2 in the morning. 
 Who knew we were tougher than Montanans?

HEADLINE: A Rebirth in Britain As a Driver Revives A Career and a Team

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Brad Spurgeon contributed reporting from Monaco.

DATELINE: BRACKLEY, England 

 BODY:
In many ways, the story of the Brawn Grand Prix racing team, which makes its headquarters in this sleepy country town, is a parable for dismal times, a real-life tale demonstrating the wisdom of Rudyard Kipling's advice, in his poem ''If,'' to treat the impostors of triumph and disaster just the same.
 It is a story of a small, high-tech company confronted, literally overnight, with a decision by Honda Motor executives 6,000 miles away in Japan to abandon Honda's decades-long, mostly unavailing struggle to compete successfully in Formula One. That decision, in early December, left 700 people at Honda's racing team, based here 50 miles from London, with the prospect of sudden unemployment, little hope of new jobs and the brutal end of an elusive dream. 
 Five months later, on the eve of Formula One's showcase race at Monaco on Sunday, the story is one to lift hearts everywhere, even among Brawn's rivals in Formula One. A tight-knit group of people, reconstituted under the name of Ross Brawn -- the 54-year-old, stubble-bearded engineer who masterminded the long-running Formula One dominance of Michael Schumacher and Ferrari -- has found a way to snatch triumph, on a stunning scale, from what had seemed, through much of the winter, to be an inescapable demise.
 Whatever happens in Monaco, where Brawn is competing for its fifth win in the season's first six races, it is a story of another, equally striking rebirth. Jenson Button, the 29-year-old Englishman who is the team's principal driver, alongside the Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, has won all four of the races Brawn has taken this year, and finished third in the only race he didn't win. In nearly 60 years of the Formula One world drivers' championship, no driver who has won four of the first five races has failed to win the crown.
 Up to this year, Button had spent nine mostly underachieving years in Formula One, six of them with Honda and its precursor team, running Honda-engined cars under the banner of the British-American tobacco company. Those years had brought him a single Grand Prix success, a fluky win in Hungary in 2006. By 2008, when he turned in a succession of back-of-the-field performances in what he described as a virtually undrivable car, the talk in the pit lanes was of a driver who was in his sunset years.
 Privately, those in the sport who were preparing to write Button's professional obituary said he had squandered an enormous natural talent that won him a place at the pinnacle of world motorsports when he was barely out of his teens. Earning millions and partying ostentatiously on the yacht he moored in Monte Carlo, where he made his home, his narrative seemed to be one drawn from the world of F. Scott Fitzgerald, of a charming, carousing playboy who flew too close to the sun.
 As he prepared for the Monaco race this week, the sense that he had come back from the brink of oblivion hung heavy in the air. Until barely three weeks before the season's first race in Melbourne in March -- when Brawn and another former Honda racing executive, Nick Fry, won Honda's agreement to provide the 2009 budget of around $150 million to $200 million that made it possible for the team to survive, while disassociating Honda from the effort -- Button seemed destined to sit out the season, or hunt for last-minute opportunities with a smaller team.
 Last season, Button spent much of his off-track time at the races hunkered down in the Honda garage, reluctant to talk about his woes. This year, he is an effervescent presence in the Grand Prix paddock, displaying an affable personality that was too often hidden in his dog-day past. He told interviewers at Monaco this week that he was so committed to racing this year that he spends his rest days in Monaco studying performance data e-mailed to him from the team's headquarters rather than dallying in the harbor. He said he risked becoming a ''right boring'' companion to his girlfriend, the 24-year-old Japanese-Argentine model Jessica Michibata.
 As for the Monaco race, he said that driving around the twisty, plunging, 1.9-mile circuit, running between tight guardrails at speeds up to 190 miles an hour, was a tough challenge for his driving style -- regarded as one of the smoothest and most precise in the history of the sport, on a par with that of Jim Clark of Scotland, the three-time world champion who was killed at a race in Germany in 1968. ''You've got to wring the car's neck around here,'' he told reporters.
 One of the most renowned of the journalists who regularly cover Formula One, Maurice Hamilton, commentating on the BBC Web site's coverage of the Monaco practice, offered his own plaudit. ''It's the mood of a man who was facing the gallows, and who's got a reprieve, and he's appreciating it full-time,'' Hamilton said.
 Though unspoken by Button, at least part of the ''fun'' he is having this year likely comes from the fact that he no longer resides in the shadow cast by Lewis Hamilton, the 24-year-old Englishman who last year became a sensation in the sport by winning the world championship for the McLaren-Mercedes team in only his second year in Formula One. McLaren is in a slump this season, and Hamilton's popularity took a beating when he and his team were penalized for lying to race stewards about an on-track incident after the season's opening race in Australia. At the last race, in Spain, Button, on his way to the checkered flag, lapped Hamilton shortly before the end.
 Brawn believes his driver's past setbacks may be a firmer preparation for a championship bid than, say, the quickfire success earned by Hamilton, who has turned sullen in his public appearances and blamed his troubles on his McLaren-Mercedes team giving him a ''bad car.''
 ''The fact that Jenson has been through these difficult periods has prepared him better for what he's doing now, just as gaining success too quickly doesn't always prepare you for the hard times,'' Brawn said.
 ''There will be a downturn for this team, there will be horrendous races,'' he added, ''and Jenson will know the things that he has to do get back to winning, because he's known what it is to lose.''
 Though both Button and Brawn say it is too early in the 17-race season to feel confident about a championship, he is the strong favorite to take the crown won 7 times in 11 years up to 2004 by Schumacher, the German driver whose metronomic victories, often start-to-finish, contributed to a slump in the sport's worldwide television audiences. According to surveys done for the Federation Internationale de L'Automobile, the sport's Paris-based governing body, Button and Brawn have helped reverse that trend, with millions of viewers saying they have been drawn back to the sport by their up-from-the-ashes achievements.
 The idyll, though, has not been without its dark side. A tour of the team's Brackley headquarters shows bare desks where 250 of the 700 Honda employees once worked before the layoffs that followed Honda's agreement to finance the team for this year. Brawn and Fry hesitated for three months before deciding to take over the team on their own, forfeiting millions of dollars in personal contractual payments from Honda if they had shuttered the Brackley plant and walked away.
 Now, they are hopeful that Button's on-track successes will bring them the sponsors that will enable the team to survive when the Honda money runs out. But as they wait, they remain indebted to Honda, which has had to watch as a car built with its money, but now using a Mercedes-Benz engine and carrying no trace of the Honda name, has finally won the Formula One success that eluded Honda for 40 years.
 After each Brawn victory, the team has received a congratulatory letter from Honda's president, Takeo Fukui. For him, Button's victories must have had a bittersweet edge, though Brawn believes Honda's financial situation, amid a worldwide slump in car sales, would have prompted the company to quit in any case in any case. 
 ''They have been most gracious,'' Brawn said. ''But I think that they were in such a stressful situation that the fact that we had a car that could win races wasn't really a factor anymore.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 28, 2009

 CORRECTION:
 An article on Saturday about Jenson Button, a British Formula One driver who has experienced a rebirth this season along with his racing team, misstated the number of world championships won by Jim Clark of Scotland, who was said to have had a similarly precise and smooth driving style. It was two championships, not three.

HEADLINE: More Takers For 15-Year Loans

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
THE 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has traditionally been the go-to loan for borrowers who want stability and lower payments. Adjustable-rate mortgages, by contrast, are often seen as more suitable for risk takers and those who expect to sell their homes in a short time.
 More recently, there has been increased activity in another loan alternative: a fixed-rate mortgage with a 15-year term. 
 Brokers and mortgage industry executives say that these loans are becoming especially popular among people who want to shed debt more quickly, and in light of the current economic atmosphere, that goal is perhaps more widely applicable than ever.
 Of course, debt shedding comes at a price. Those borrowing $400,000 on a 15-year loan, with a 4.375 percent interest rate, the average rate earlier this month, can expect to pay about $3,034 a month, compared with about $2,056 a month for a 30-year fixed-rate loan with a 4.625 percent average rate. (The payment excludes costs like property taxes and insurance.) 
 Because a 15-year loan also has 180 fewer interest payments than a 30-year loan, the borrower with that 15-year loan would pay $194,000 less in interest over the life of the mortgage.
 Brad German, a spokesman for Freddie Mac, a federally chartered business that buys mortgages from lenders, said that the company's economists did not have data to track the volume of different mortgages, but that anecdotal evidence suggested a rise in 15-year fixed-rate loan activity during the refinancing boom of the past several months. 
 ''The thinking is that many baby boom mortgagors are taking advantage of the low rates to refi into a mortgage that will enable them to live a relatively care-free retirement life -- i.e. free and clear of mortgage debt,'' Mr. German said.
 The number of 15-year mortgages issued in February jumped to 74,497 from 42,178 in January, according to First American CoreLogic, a real estate consulting company in San Francisco. And according to Bloomberg News, $15.9 billion worth of 15-year mortgages were issued in March, more than twice the $7.5 billion issued in February. 
 Cameron Findlay, the chief economist at LendingTree, an online mortgage company, said, ''Those levels have been sustained in April and are projected to grow slightly in May.'' 
 Rates on all loans have dropped this year, but in February and April in particular, rates on 15-year loans fell more sharply than their 30-year counterparts, according to Mr. Findlay. 
 More recently, rates on 15-year loans have been about a quarter of a percentage point lower than those of 30-year loans.
 At an average of about 4.5 percent since January, rates on 15-year loans are as low they have been since June 2003, when they reached 4.41 percent, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 Borrowers, though, may need a strong stomach and much confidence in their employment status to choose a higher monthly payment in the current economic environment.
 Bruce Hirschfeld, the president of Montvale Mortgage in Hackensack, N.J., says that since January he has received more calls about 15-year loans, though he often counsels clients to choose 30-year mortgages. 
 Mr. Hirschfeld says he tells these borrowers the amount they would pay if they chose the 15-year loan and suggests they pay that amount toward their 30-year load. ''That way, if they really want, they can pay it off in 15 years, even if it's at a slightly higher interest rate,'' he said. ''But if something happens with your job or you hit some other bump in the road, you can make the lower payment instead.''
 Fifteen-year mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which are typically sought by first-time home buyers who have lower credit scores and less money for down payments, have generated more demand than conventional loans, Mr. Hirschfeld said.
 Interest rates on the F.H.A.'s 15-year fixed-rate mortgages were 4.2 percent earlier this month, compared with 4.75 percent for 30-year loans.
 But those who receive such loans face higher closing costs and must pay private mortgage insurance. On a $400,000 loan, that insurance adds $183 to the monthly payment, though it is tax deductible.
 Still, Mr. Hirschfeld said, ''for a person with a 620 credit score, or someone who can only make a down payment of 3 percent, it's a phenomenal program.''

HEADLINE: Safe and Sleek, but Not a Sipper

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
AMERICAN drivers, whether strait-laced or on the wild side, know the safe word is Volvo.
 In the enviable way that Toyota has made itself synonymous with hybrids, Volvo is associated with fewer bruises and breaks in crashes. Skeptics may ask if a Volvo is demonstrably safer than a comparable Mercedes or Honda, to mention just two companies that also seem committed to low-anxiety travel. But even if the competitive edge is overstated, there's no question that the security level of the 2010 Volvo XC60 could be the envy of the C.I.A.
 For people who associate Volvo with its old-school days -- boxy and boring, and I mean that in a good way -- the real surprise is the XC60's style. Too many crossover S.U.V.'s in this overpopulated field come off as U.F.O.'s: Unidentified Family Objects. But instead of inflicting another two-ton blob on the suburbs, Volvo has delivered a handsome standout. 
 Leading with a trim snout and tasteful grille, the XC60 flows into a wedgy tall-wagon profile. Its backside juts skyward like a runner in the starting block. The rear end offers Volvo's signature design cue, oversized taillamps that spill from the roof and over the flanks like a double ladling of strawberry sauce. In combination with the cheeky C30 hatchback, the XC60 shows Volvo playing its hottest hand ever in design.
 Buyers can consider the XC60 the tweener of Volvo's family haulers. Matching length with the Audi Q5 and Toyota RAV4, the XC60 is roughly eight inches shorter than the XC90 crossover and the V70 and XC70 station wagons -- but four inches longer than the compact V50 wagon. Naturally, it holds a bit less cargo than its bigger brothers. 
 Starting at $38,025, the XC60 costs $200 more than the basic 6-cylinder XC90, but about $9,000 less than the V-8. 
 But unless you really need the XC90's additional space, which includes available third-row child-size seats, the XC60 beats that wagon in important ways. First, the heavier XC90 corners as though it has a side of beef strapped to its roof. But the XC60 is built on the latest S80 sedan platform, a sportier and more solid chassis than the previous-generation architecture of XC90. 
 The XC60 is assembled in Ghent, Belgium, with engines from Britain and transmissions from Japan. And like most any Volvo it delivers a reassuring and comfortable ride. Yet by shaving inches and pounds from the typical midsize crossover -- the Acura MDX weighs 360 pounds more and the 6-cylinder BMW X5 is 800 pounds heavier -- this Volvo feels surprisingly fleet and nimble. The steering has an Audilike heft and precision. 
 Later this year, Volvo will add an optional Active Chassis system that lets the driver select three shock absorber settings for even sharper handling. 
 Strapped to a turbocharged 3-liter in-line 6 with 281 horsepower and an eager 295 pound-feet of torque, the Volvo will rush from a stoplight to 60 miles an hour in barely 7 seconds. That 6 cylinder emits a pleasant snarl when you mash the throttle. And at higher speeds where chunkier rivals start gasping, the turbo-happy Volvo feels as if it's just getting started. 
 All-wheel-drive is standard, though Volvo will soon bring out a less costly front-drive version. 
 The downside is below-average fuel economy for this class: the XC60 is rated at 16 m.p.g. in town and 22 on the highway. Premium fuel is ''recommended,'' but Volvo says the XC60 will run fine on regular.
 On a weekend trip from New York to Rhode Island, I managed just 20 m.p.g. over four hours of cautious toddler-in-back cruising. Some far larger and roomier crossovers, including the Ford Flex and Chevrolet Traverse, get similar or slightly better mileage.
 Buyers wondering whether the Volvo fits their life style should first make sure it fits their inseam: the chief demerits are narrow front footwells and a low-slung dashboard that can impinge on wide stances and long legs. The leather seats, however, are attractive and supportive. The back seat has ample room for two adults and a center perch that's more comfortable for short hops than those in some rivals. Although the XC60 has roughly 30 percent less space behind the second row than the XC90, it easily swallowed our small family's luggage.
 The cabin blends simplicity, luxury and quirks in a very Volvo way. What some will see as blessedly modern Scandinavian design, others may consider a bit cool and monochromatic. I'm a fan of 20th-century furniture, but even I've been questioning whether Volvo interiors are too unrelieved in colors and textures. 
 And enough with Volvo's central ''waterfall'' panel that seems to float from the dashboard. A cool novelty five years ago, it now just seems like an example of questionable ergonomics; the design offers no storage save for a hidden, hard-to-reach tray behind the panel. (In my test car, the piece did have a handsome blond wood inlay, for $295 extra.)
 The crowded phone-style keypad for audio and vehicle functions can be tricky for thick-fingered users, but its logic becomes apparent eventually. It is nice to have 10 preset buttons for radio stations, especially with satellite radio. The navigation system is marred by a fuzzy-looking screen and weak mapping, with minimal labeling of streets and cities that you need to, um, navigate. 
 That navigation system features back-of-the-steering-wheel controls that seem awkward at first but prove useful; you can use them without taking your hands off the wheel. 
 Safety is the prime consideration there, which brings us to a perennial Volvo selling point. Besides the expected gear -- electronic stability control, antilock brakes, head curtain air bags, tire-pressure monitors, antiwhiplash seats -- Volvo crams in additional safety features. 
 The latest is called City Safety. At 19 m.p.h. and below, a windshield-mounted laser sensor measures the distance to the car ahead and the closing speed. If a driver is daydreaming or looking over the shoulder when the car ahead suddenly stops, the system automatically brakes to prevent a crash. 
 I tested the unit with a Volvo engineer, charging toward an inflatable car at up to 10 m.p.h. and resisting my gut-churning urge to hit the brakes. The technology worked beautifully, stopping the XC60 before impact. It seems a tailor-made defense against New York cabbies who unpredictably slam on their brakes as if auditioning for stunt work. 
 If you sail toward a stopped car between 9 and 19 m.p.h., the system won't necessarily prevent a collision, but it will markedly slow your Volvo to mitigate damage and potential injury. The system shuts down below 2 m.p.h., so it isn't set off simply by crawling through traffic or a drive-through lane. And no, cynics, the system won't encourage drivers to watch ''Colbert Report'' reruns at the wheel: braking comes on late and hard, a jarring experience for driver and passengers.
 City Safety can apply up to 50 percent of braking power, quite a lot at low speeds. Above 20 m.p.h., a separate collision warning system works with the adaptive cruise control to flash a warning and prepare the brake system to apply maximum stopping power the instant the pedal is depressed. That system can apply 10 percent braking power, but steps aside when the driver takes evasive action. 
 Another electronic system purports to alert a sleepy driver by comparing steering wheel movements against lane markers on the road. (It's looking for the small steering corrections that a drowsy pilot tends to make.) But at one point, my wife was wide awake and driving just fine when a coffee-cup graphic flashed on and urged her to take a break.
 I'm not dazzled by some of these electronic nannies, which strike me as mostly designedfor ninnies. I'll grant that lane-departure warning might be useful at 3 a.m. on the Interstate. But the systems, like those on other cars, are so intrusive -- beeping if your tires accidentally brush a lane marker -- that you tend to switch the thing off and lose the potential benefit. The same goes for the high-speed collision-warning system that occasionally flashed and beeped in freak-out fashion when there was no danger. At least that system can be adjusted to allow closer following distances before it blares. 
 A blind-spot warning system is optional, as is a pair of built-in two-position child booster seats.
 Options aside, any buyer benefits from Volvo's obsessive attention to seats, air bags and cutting-edge crashworthiness. Volvo's roof-crush standards vastly exceed federal regulations, but the Ford-owned company rarely mentions this, perhaps to avoid calling attention to the standards of Ford's own models.
 As with most luxury makers, some of the safety gadgets cost extra or are available only within expensive option packages. A $1,695 technology package bundles adaptive cruise control, the sleepy-driver alert, collision and lane-departure warnings. 
 At $38,025 to start, the Volvo costs $175 less than the Audi Q5 and $1,250 more than Mercedes's competitor, the new GLK with all-wheel-drive. All told, my test Volvo reached $44,240, and it tops $47,000 fully loaded. For any of those models, that's serious cash for a compact S.U.V.; a Toyota RAV4 V-6 with leather, navigation and all the toys is $33,000. But that's the price of luxury. And for Volvo, the price of safety.

HEADLINE: The Case for Working With Your Hands

BYLINE: By MATTHEW B. CRAWFORD. 
Matthew B. Crawford lives in Richmond, Va. His book, ''Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry Into the Value of Work,'' from which this essay is adapted, will be published this week by Penguin Press.

 BODY:
The television show ''Deadliest Catch'' depicts commercial crab fishermen in the Bering Sea. Another, ''Dirty Jobs,'' shows all kinds of grueling work; one episode featured a guy who inseminates turkeys for a living. The weird fascination of these shows must lie partly in the fact that such confrontations with material reality have become exotically unfamiliar. Many of us do work that feels more surreal than real. Working in an office, you often find it difficult to see any tangible result from your efforts. What exactly have you accomplished at the end of any given day? Where the chain of cause and effect is opaque and responsibility diffuse, the experience of individual agency can be elusive. ''Dilbert,'' ''The Office'' and similar portrayals of cubicle life attest to the dark absurdism with which many Americans have come to view their white-collar jobs.
 Is there a more ''real'' alternative (short of inseminating turkeys)? 
 High-school shop-class programs were widely dismantled in the 1990s as educators prepared students to become ''knowledge workers.'' The imperative of the last 20 years to round up every warm body and send it to college, then to the cubicle, was tied to a vision of the future in which we somehow take leave of material reality and glide about in a pure information economy. This has not come to pass. To begin with, such work often feels more enervating than gliding. More fundamentally, now as ever, somebody has to actually do things: fix our cars, unclog our toilets, build our houses. 
 When we praise people who do work that is straightforwardly useful, the praise often betrays an assumption that they had no other options. We idealize them as the salt of the earth and emphasize the sacrifice for others their work may entail. Such sacrifice does indeed occur -- the hazards faced by a lineman restoring power during a storm come to mind. But what if such work answers as well to a basic human need of the one who does it? I take this to be the suggestion of Marge Piercy's poem ''To Be of Use,'' which concludes with the lines ''the pitcher longs for water to carry/and a person for work that is real.'' Beneath our gratitude for the lineman may rest envy.
 This seems to be a moment when the useful arts have an especially compelling economic rationale. A car mechanics' trade association reports that repair shops have seen their business jump significantly in the current recession: people aren't buying new cars; they are fixing the ones they have. The current downturn is likely to pass eventually. But there are also systemic changes in the economy, arising from information technology, that have the surprising effect of making the manual trades -- plumbing, electrical work, car repair -- more attractive as careers. The Princeton economist Alan Blinder argues that the crucial distinction in the emerging labor market is not between those with more or less education, but between those whose services can be delivered over a wire and those who must do their work in person or on site. The latter will find their livelihoods more secure against outsourcing to distant countries. As Blinder puts it, ''You can't hammer a nail over the Internet.'' Nor can the Indians fix your car. Because they are in India. 
 If the goal is to earn a living, then, maybe it isn't really true that 18-year-olds need to be imparted with a sense of panic about getting into college (though they certainly need to learn). Some people are hustled off to college, then to the cubicle, against their own inclinations and natural bents, when they would rather be learning to build things or fix things. One shop teacher suggested to me that ''in schools, we create artificial learning environments for our children that they know to be contrived and undeserving of their full attention and engagement. Without the opportunity to learn through the hands, the world remains abstract and distant, and the passions for learning will not be engaged.''
 A gifted young person who chooses to become a mechanic rather than to accumulate academic credentials is viewed as eccentric, if not self-destructive. There is a pervasive anxiety among parents that there is only one track to success for their children. It runs through a series of gates controlled by prestigious institutions. Further, there is wide use of drugs to medicate boys, especially, against their natural tendency toward action, the better to ''keep things on track.'' I taught briefly in a public high school and would have loved to have set up a Ritalin fogger in my classroom. It is a rare person, male or female, who is naturally inclined to sit still for 17 years in school, and then indefinitely at work. 
 The trades suffer from low prestige, and I believe this is based on a simple mistake. Because the work is dirty, many people assume it is also stupid. This is not my experience. I have a small business as a motorcycle mechanic in Richmond, Va., which I started in 2002. I work on Japanese and European motorcycles, mostly older bikes with some ''vintage'' cachet that makes people willing to spend money on them. I have found the satisfactions of the work to be very much bound up with the intellectual challenges it presents. And yet my decision to go into this line of work is a choice that seems to perplex many people.
 After finishing a Ph.D. in political philosophy at the University of Chicago in 2000, I managed to stay on with a one-year postdoctoral fellowship at the university's Committee on Social Thought. The academic job market was utterly bleak. In a state of professional panic, I retreated to a makeshift workshop I set up in the basement of a Hyde Park apartment building, where I spent the winter tearing down an old Honda motorcycle and rebuilding it. The physicality of it, and the clear specificity of what the project required of me, was a balm. Stumped by a starter motor that seemed to check out in every way but wouldn't work, I started asking around at Honda dealerships. Nobody had an answer; finally one service manager told me to call Fred Cousins of Triple O Service. ''If anyone can help you, Fred can.'' 
 I called Fred, and he invited me to come to his independent motorcycle-repair shop, tucked discreetly into an unmarked warehouse on Goose Island. He told me to put the motor on a certain bench that was free of clutter. He checked the electrical resistance through the windings, as I had done, to confirm there was no short circuit or broken wire. He spun the shaft that ran through the center of the motor, as I had. No problem: it spun freely. Then he hooked it up to a battery. It moved ever so slightly but wouldn't spin. He grasped the shaft, delicately, with three fingers, and tried to wiggle it side to side. ''Too much free play,'' he said. He suggested that the problem was with the bushing (a thick-walled sleeve of metal) that captured the end of the shaft in the end of the cylindrical motor housing. It was worn, so it wasn't locating the shaft precisely enough. The shaft was free to move too much side to side (perhaps a couple of hundredths of an inch), causing the outer circumference of the rotor to bind on the inner circumference of the motor housing when a current was applied. Fred scrounged around for a Honda motor. He found one with the same bushing, then used a ''blind hole bearing puller'' to extract it, as well as the one in my motor. Then he gently tapped the new, or rather newer, one into place. The motor worked! Then Fred gave me an impromptu dissertation on the peculiar metallurgy of these Honda starter-motor bushings of the mid-'70s. Here was a scholar. 
 Over the next six months I spent a lot of time at Fred's shop, learning, and put in only occasional appearances at the university. This was something of a regression: I worked on cars throughout high school and college, and one of my early jobs was at a Porsche repair shop. Now I was rediscovering the intensely absorbing nature of the work, and it got me thinking about possible livelihoods. 
 As it happened, in the spring I landed a job as executive director of a policy organization in Washington. This felt like a coup. But certain perversities became apparent as I settled into the job. It sometimes required me to reason backward, from desired conclusion to suitable premise. The organization had taken certain positions, and there were some facts it was more fond of than others. As its figurehead, I was making arguments I didn't fully buy myself. Further, my boss seemed intent on retraining me according to a certain cognitive style -- that of the corporate world, from which he had recently come. This style demanded that I project an image of rationality but not indulge too much in actual reasoning. As I sat in my K Street office, Fred's life as an independent tradesman gave me an image that I kept coming back to: someone who really knows what he is doing, losing himself in work that is genuinely useful and has a certain integrity to it. He also seemed to be having a lot of fun.
 Seeing a motorcycle about to leave my shop under its own power, several days after arriving in the back of a pickup truck, I don't feel tired even though I've been standing on a concrete floor all day. Peering into the portal of his helmet, I think I can make out the edges of a grin on the face of a guy who hasn't ridden his bike in a while. I give him a wave. With one of his hands on the throttle and the other on the clutch, I know he can't wave back. But I can hear his salute in the exuberant ''bwaaAAAAP!'' of a crisp throttle, gratuitously revved. That sound pleases me, as I know it does him. It's a ventriloquist conversation in one mechanical voice, and the gist of it is ''Yeah!'' 
 After five months at the think tank, I'd saved enough money to buy some tools I needed, and I quit and went into business fixing bikes. My shop rate is $40 per hour. Other shops have rates as high as $70 per hour, but I tend to work pretty slowly. Further, only about half the time I spend in the shop ends up being billable (I have no employees; every little chore falls to me), so it usually works out closer to $20 per hour -- a modest but decent wage. The business goes up and down; when it is down I have supplemented it with writing. The work is sometimes frustrating, but it is never irrational. 
 And it frequently requires complex thinking. In fixing motorcycles you come up with several imagined trains of cause and effect for manifest symptoms, and you judge their likelihood before tearing anything down. This imagining relies on a mental library that you develop. An internal combustion engine can work in any number of ways, and different manufacturers have tried different approaches. Each has its own proclivities for failure. You also develop a library of sounds and smells and feels. For example, the backfire of a too-lean fuel mixture is subtly different from an ignition backfire. 
 As in any learned profession, you just have to know a lot. If the motorcycle is 30 years old, from an obscure maker that went out of business 20 years ago, its tendencies are known mostly through lore. It would probably be impossible to do such work in isolation, without access to a collective historical memory; you have to be embedded in a community of mechanic-antiquarians. These relationships are maintained by telephone, in a network of reciprocal favors that spans the country. My most reliable source, Fred, has such an encyclopedic knowledge of obscure European motorcycles that all I have been able to offer him in exchange is deliveries of obscure European beer. 
 There is always a risk of introducing new complications when working on old motorcycles, and this enters the diagnostic logic. Measured in likelihood of screw-ups, the cost is not identical for all avenues of inquiry when deciding which hypothesis to pursue. Imagine you're trying to figure out why a bike won't start. The fasteners holding the engine covers on 1970s-era Hondas are Phillips head, and they are almost always rounded out and corroded. Do you really want to check the condition of the starter clutch if each of eight screws will need to be drilled out and extracted, risking damage to the engine case? Such impediments have to be taken into account. The attractiveness of any hypothesis is determined in part by physical circumstances that have no logical connection to the diagnostic problem at hand. The mechanic's proper response to the situation cannot be anticipated by a set of rules or algorithms.
 There probably aren't many jobs that can be reduced to rule-following and still be done well. But in many jobs there is an attempt to do just this, and the perversity of it may go unnoticed by those who design the work process. Mechanics face something like this problem in the factory service manuals that we use. These manuals tell you to be systematic in eliminating variables, presenting an idealized image of diagnostic work. But they never take into account the risks of working on old machines. So you put the manual away and consider the facts before you. You do this because ultimately you are responsible to the motorcycle and its owner, not to some procedure.
 Some diagnostic situations contain a lot of variables. Any given symptom may have several possible causes, and further, these causes may interact with one another and therefore be difficult to isolate. In deciding how to proceed, there often comes a point where you have to step back and get a larger gestalt. Have a cigarette and walk around the lift. The gap between theory and practice stretches out in front of you, and this is where it gets interesting. What you need now is the kind of judgment that arises only from experience; hunches rather than rules. For me, at least, there is more real thinking going on in the bike shop than there was in the think tank.
 Put differently, mechanical work has required me to cultivate different intellectual habits. Further, habits of mind have an ethical dimension that we don't often think about. Good diagnosis requires attentiveness to the machine, almost a conversation with it, rather than assertiveness, as in the position papers produced on K Street. Cognitive psychologists speak of ''metacognition,'' which is the activity of stepping back and thinking about your own thinking. It is what you do when you stop for a moment in your pursuit of a solution, and wonder whether your understanding of the problem is adequate. The slap of worn-out pistons hitting their cylinders can sound a lot like loose valve tappets, so to be a good mechanic you have to be constantly open to the possibility that you may be mistaken. This is a virtue that is at once cognitive and moral. It seems to develop because the mechanic, if he is the sort who goes on to become good at it, internalizes the healthy functioning of the motorcycle as an object of passionate concern. How else can you explain the elation he gets when he identifies the root cause of some problem? 
 This active concern for the motorcycle is reinforced by the social aspects of the job. As is the case with many independent mechanics, my business is based entirely on word of mouth. I sometimes barter services with machinists and metal fabricators. This has a very different feel than transactions with money; it situates me in a community. The result is that I really don't want to mess up anybody's motorcycle or charge more than a fair price. You often hear people complain about mechanics and other tradespeople whom they take to be dishonest or incompetent. I am sure this is sometimes justified. But it is also true that the mechanic deals with a large element of chance. 
 I once accidentally dropped a feeler gauge down into the crankcase of a Kawasaki Ninja that was practically brand new, while performing its first scheduled valve adjustment. I escaped a complete tear-down of the motor only through an operation that involved the use of a stethoscope, another pair of trusted hands and the sort of concentration we associate with a bomb squad. When finally I laid my fingers on that feeler gauge, I felt as if I had cheated death. I don't remember ever feeling so alive as in the hours that followed. 
 Often as not, however, such crises do not end in redemption. Moments of elation are counterbalanced with failures, and these, too, are vivid, taking place right before your eyes. With stakes that are often high and immediate, the manual trades elicit heedful absorption in work. They are punctuated by moments of pleasure that take place against a darker backdrop: a keen awareness of catastrophe as an always-present possibility. The core experience is one of individual responsibility, supported by face-to-face interactions between tradesman and customer.
 Contrast the experience of being a middle manager. This is a stock figure of ridicule, but the sociologist Robert Jackall spent years inhabiting the world of corporate managers, conducting interviews, and he poignantly describes the ''moral maze'' they feel trapped in. Like the mechanic, the manager faces the possibility of disaster at any time. But in his case these disasters feel arbitrary; they are typically a result of corporate restructurings, not of physics. A manager has to make many decisions for which he is accountable. Unlike an entrepreneur with his own business, however, his decisions can be reversed at any time by someone higher up the food chain (and there is always someone higher up the food chain). It's important for your career that these reversals not look like defeats, and more generally you have to spend a lot of time managing what others think of you. Survival depends on a crucial insight: you can't back down from an argument that you initially made in straightforward language, with moral conviction, without seeming to lose your integrity. So managers learn the art of provisional thinking and feeling, expressed in corporate doublespeak, and cultivate a lack of commitment to their own actions. Nothing is set in concrete the way it is when you are, for example, pouring concrete.
 Those who work on the lower rungs of the information-age office hierarchy face their own kinds of unreality, as I learned some time ago. After earning a master's degree in the early 1990s, I had a hard time finding work but eventually landed a job in the Bay Area writing brief summaries of academic journal articles, which were then sold on CD-ROMs to subscribing libraries. When I got the phone call offering me the job, I was excited. I felt I had grabbed hold of the passing world -- miraculously, through the mere filament of a classified ad -- and reeled myself into its current. My new bosses immediately took up residence in my imagination, where I often surprised them with my hidden depths. As I was shown to my cubicle, I felt a real sense of being honored. It seemed more than spacious enough. It was my desk, where I would think my thoughts -- my unique contribution to a common enterprise, in a real company with hundreds of employees. The regularity of the cubicles made me feel I had found a place in the order of things. I was to be a knowledge worker.
 But the feel of the job changed on my first day. The company had gotten its start by providing libraries with a subject index of popular magazines like Sports Illustrated. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, it now found itself offering not just indexes but also abstracts (that is, summaries), and of a very different kind of material: scholarly works in the physical and biological sciences, humanities, social sciences and law. Some of this stuff was simply incomprehensible to anyone but an expert in the particular field covered by the journal. I was reading articles in Classical Philology where practically every other word was in Greek. Some of the scientific journals were no less mysterious. Yet the categorical difference between, say, Sports Illustrated and Nature Genetics seemed not to have impressed itself on the company's decision makers. In some of the titles I was assigned, articles began with an abstract written by the author. But even in such cases I was to write my own. The reason offered was that unless I did so, there would be no ''value added'' by our product. It was hard to believe I was going to add anything other than error and confusion to such material. But then, I hadn't yet been trained.
 My job was structured on the supposition that in writing an abstract of an article there is a method that merely needs to be applied, and that this can be done without understanding the text. I was actually told this by the trainer, Monica, as she stood before a whiteboard, diagramming an abstract. Monica seemed a perfectly sensible person and gave no outward signs of suffering delusions. She didn't insist too much on what she was telling us, and it became clear she was in a position similar to that of a veteran Soviet bureaucrat who must work on two levels at once: reality and official ideology. The official ideology was a bit like the factory service manuals I mentioned before, the ones that offer procedures that mechanics often have to ignore in order to do their jobs.
 My starting quota, after finishing a week of training, was 15 articles per day. By my 11th month at the company, my quota was up to 28 articles per day (this was the normal, scheduled increase). I was always sleepy while at work, and I think this exhaustion was because I felt trapped in a contradiction: the fast pace demanded complete focus on the task, yet that pace also made any real concentration impossible. I had to actively suppress my own ability to think, because the more you think, the more the inadequacies in your understanding of an author's argument come into focus. This can only slow you down. To not do justice to an author who had poured himself into the subject at hand felt like violence against what was best in myself. 
 The quota demanded, then, not just dumbing down but also a bit of moral re-education, the opposite of the kind that occurs in the heedful absorption of mechanical work. I had to suppress my sense of responsibility to the article itself, and to others -- to the author, to begin with, as well as to the hapless users of the database, who might naively suppose that my abstract reflected the author's work. Such detachment was made easy by the fact there was no immediate consequence for me; I could write any nonsense whatever.
 Now, it is probably true that every job entails some kind of mutilation. I used to work as an electrician and had my own business doing it for a while. As an electrician you breathe a lot of unknown dust in crawl spaces, your knees get bruised, your neck gets strained from looking up at the ceiling while installing lights or ceiling fans and you get shocked regularly, sometimes while on a ladder. Your hands are sliced up from twisting wires together, handling junction boxes made out of stamped sheet metal and cutting metal conduit with a hacksaw. But none of this damage touches the best part of yourself.
 You might wonder: Wasn't there any quality control? My supervisor would periodically read a few of my abstracts, and I was sometimes corrected and told not to begin an abstract with a dependent clause. But I was never confronted with an abstract I had written and told that it did not adequately reflect the article. The quality standards were the generic ones of grammar, which could be applied without my supervisor having to read the article at hand. Rather, my supervisor and I both were held to a metric that was conjured by someone remote from the work process -- an absentee decision maker armed with a (putatively) profit-maximizing calculus, one that took no account of the intrinsic nature of the job. I wonder whether the resulting perversity really made for maximum profits in the long term. Corporate managers are not, after all, the owners of the businesses they run. 
 At lunch I had a standing arrangement with two other abstracters. One was from my group, a laconic, disheveled man named Mike whom I liked instantly. He did about as well on his quota as I did on mine, but it didn't seem to bother him too much. The other guy was from beyond the partition, a meticulously groomed Liberian named Henry who said he had worked for the C.I.A. He had to flee Liberia very suddenly one day and soon found himself resettled near the office parks of Foster City, Calif. Henry wasn't going to sweat the quota. Come 12:30, the three of us would hike to the food court in the mall. This movement was always thrilling. It involved traversing several ''campuses,'' with ponds frequented by oddly real seagulls, then the lunch itself, which I always savored. (Marx writes that under conditions of estranged labor, man ''no longer feels himself to be freely active in any but his animal functions.'') Over his burrito, Mike would recount the outrageous things he had written in his abstracts. I could see my own future in such moments of sabotage -- the compensating pleasures of a cubicle drone. Always funny and gentle, Mike confided one day that he was doing quite a bit of heroin. On the job. This actually made some sense. 
 How was it that I, once a proudly self-employed electrician, had ended up among these walking wounded, a ''knowledge worker'' at a salary of $23,000? I had a master's degree, and it needed to be used. The escalating demand for academic credentials in the job market gives the impression of an ever-more-knowledgeable society, whose members perform cognitive feats their unschooled parents could scarcely conceive of. On paper, my abstracting job, multiplied a millionfold, is precisely what puts the futurologist in a rapture: we are getting to be so smart! Yet my M.A. obscures a more real stupidification of the work I secured with that credential, and a wage to match. When I first got the degree, I felt as if I had been inducted to a certain order of society. But despite the beautiful ties I wore, it turned out to be a more proletarian existence than I had known as an electrician. In that job I had made quite a bit more money. I also felt free and active, rather than confined and stultified.
 A good job requires a field of action where you can put your best capacities to work and see an effect in the world. Academic credentials do not guarantee this. 
 Nor can big business or big government -- those idols of the right and the left -- reliably secure such work for us. Everyone is rightly concerned about economic growth on the one hand or unemployment and wages on the other, but the character of work doesn't figure much in political debate. Labor unions address important concerns like workplace safety and family leave, and management looks for greater efficiency, but on the nature of the job itself, the dominant political and economic paradigms are mute. Yet work forms us, and deforms us, with broad public consequences.
 The visceral experience of failure seems to have been edited out of the career trajectories of gifted students. It stands to reason, then, that those who end up making big decisions that affect all of us don't seem to have much sense of their own fallibility, and of how badly things can go wrong even with the best of intentions (like when I dropped that feeler gauge down into the Ninja). In the boardrooms of Wall Street and the corridors of Pennsylvania Avenue, I don't think you'll see a yellow sign that says ''Think Safety!'' as you do on job sites and in many repair shops, no doubt because those who sit on the swivel chairs tend to live remote from the consequences of the decisions they make. Why not encourage gifted students to learn a trade, if only in the summers, so that their fingers will be crushed once or twice before they go on to run the country?
 There is good reason to suppose that responsibility has to be installed in the foundation of your mental equipment -- at the level of perception and habit. There is an ethic of paying attention that develops in the trades through hard experience. It inflects your perception of the world and your habitual responses to it. This is due to the immediate feedback you get from material objects and to the fact that the work is typically situated in face-to-face interactions between tradesman and customer. 
 An economy that is more entrepreneurial, less managerial, would be less subject to the kind of distortions that occur when corporate managers' compensation is tied to the short-term profit of distant shareholders. For most entrepreneurs, profit is at once a more capacious and a more concrete thing than this. It is a calculation in which the intrinsic satisfactions of work count -- not least, the exercise of your own powers of reason.
 Ultimately it is enlightened self-interest, then, not a harangue about humility or public-spiritedness, that will compel us to take a fresh look at the trades. The good life comes in a variety of forms. This variety has become difficult to see; our field of aspiration has narrowed into certain channels. But the current perplexity in the economy seems to be softening our gaze. Our peripheral vision is perhaps recovering, allowing us to consider the full range of lives worth choosing. For anyone who feels ill suited by disposition to spend his days sitting in an office, the question of what a good job looks like is now wide open.

HEADLINE: India in Queens, With a Caribbean Accent

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
The A train rumbles to a halt at the Ozone Park/Lefferts Boulevard stop in central Queens. To the east, a dozen blocks of Liberty Avenue unfold in a series of roti, sari and gold shops that make up the fragrant spine of Richmond Hill, a community of immigrants who descend from Indians sent to the Caribbean to work on sugar plantations in the 19th century. 
 One must first reconcile the sight of saris and turbans with lilting English inflected with Creole. Then there is the juxtaposition of Hindu temples and gritty convenience stores, and thumping West Indian dance-hall music pouring out of religious shops. On weekend mornings, locals bring their black finches to Phil Rizzuto Park, formerly known as Smokey Oval Park, for chirp-off contests. 
 1 P.M. Eat lunch at Sonny's Roti Shop, 118-06 Liberty Avenue, (718) 835-7255, right under the train station. Sonny's may not be as well known as Brown Betty's, Sybil's or the Little Guyana Bake Shop, but the owner, Steven Rajkumal, a Trinidadian immigrant known as Sonny, is happy to introduce newcomers to the dishes. Order rotis ($5.50 for chicken, $8.50 for oxtail), or try snacks and desserts with cool-sounding names like jalibee and paymee ($2 each).
 2 P.M. Within a block of the subway station, there are more shopping options than in some entire towns. You can buy a washer-dryer set at G&R Electronics, 114-04 Liberty Avenue, then walk next door to the Outlook Fashions gift shop, 119-03 Liberty Avenue, for a sitar, then take a safari through the crystal jungle of chandelier shops like B.Q. Gifts, 124-02 Liberty Avenue. Anjee Sherman, the owner of Anjees, 123-11 Liberty Avenue, (718) 843-6108, enjoys helping hip Western women try on saris, which start at $10 and can top $1,000 for wedding silks; her shop also carries small idols of Hindu gods, known as murties, worship offerings called pooja, and holiday fare like prasad.
 3 P.M. Among the halal butchers and open-air markets stocked with South Asian spices are stores specializing in Guyanese gold, which is particularly glittery and is often used in ornate pendants.
 4 P.M. At Rishi Video Palace, 103-44 124th Street, the owner, Raj Dutt, will guide you through the Bollywood classics and CDs of chutney and soca (think calypso on steroids, with singing in Hindi or English).
 5 P.M. For tropical refreshment, sidewalk vendors on every other block sell sliced mango flavored with hot sauce, lemon and salt. At other stalls, a worker with a machete will chop open a coconut and stick in a straw for $3. Or, have your palm read by any of a half-dozen psychics; Marie Sanchez, between 128th and 129th Streets, is offering a $5 recession special. The sidewalk entertainment includes young men in cars with tinted windows and flashy metal rims creeping along Liberty Avenue, blasting soca, dance-hall or reggaeton music.
 6 P.M. Relax at Rani Spa, 126-08 Liberty Avenue, (718) 641-7600, which offers eyebrow threading, mehndi (temporary henna tattoos on the hands) and shirodhara, a massage that includes the pouring of warm oil on the forehead ($50 for a half hour). The manager, Rumi Begum, will put you at ease, and the friendly locals sitting around the salon will make you laugh.
 7 P.M. At the Ranch Restaurant and Bar of Guyana, 134-01 Liberty Avenue, (718) 206-2333, drink Red Stripe, Carib and Banks beer, or a Guyanese overproof rum known as High Wine while playing pool and watching cricket. Order fried shark or jerk chicken appetizers at the bar ($8). A short walk east is Club Tobago, 147-02 Liberty Avenue, (718) 658-9600, which on weekend nights is a hot dance hall popping with big crowds and live DJs.

HEADLINE: The Sorry State of the States

 BODY:
Is California next in line for a bailout? Facing a $21 billion budget gap, California has asked for federal aid, probably in the range of $5 billion to $10 billion. Whatever form it might take, say loans or loan guarantees, taxpayers nationwide would be kicking in to help clean up California's mess. 
 So far, the administration has correctly declined to help, but there is no doubt that a fiscal meltdown in California -- one of the world's largest economies -- would be a fiasco. If Washington is forced to intervene, it must do so in a way that does not simply create a long line of states demanding relief as well.
 Nearly all of the states face budget shortfalls. Though California's is the worst in sheer dollar terms, cumulative state deficits over the next two years are estimated at $350 billion to $370 billion. Federal stimulus spending will offset about 40 percent of that. To close the gap, most states have cut spending and many have raised taxes, or are seriously considering tax increases. 
 California enacted big spending cuts and tax increases in February, but they were not enough. Last week, voters rejected budget measures that would have eased the state's dire condition. If federal aid were to allow California to go on delaying necessary reforms, other states would want the same slack. 
 Like other states, California is suffering from a collapse in tax revenues brought on by the recession. Unlike other states, it suffers from severely dysfunctional politics, including gridlock-inducing budget procedures and a deeply anti-tax strain that plays itself out in endless voter referenda, dating back to the Proposition 13 property tax cap from the 1970s. As a result, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared recently that more tax increases are politically impossible. Yet, his proposed spending cuts are also unappealing, if not impossible, including slashing education and health care funds and releasing prison inmates early. 
 What the Obama administration should make clear is that a bias for spending cuts -- and against tax increases -- is the wrong approach for California and other states. Both spending cuts and tax increases are harmful in a downturn, because they reduce already weak consumer demand. But most states are required by law to balance their budgets, so when deficits emerge, they are forced to do one or the other, or both. 
 Contrary to conventional wisdom, raising taxes may be better than spending cuts because tax increases, especially if they are focused on wealthy taxpayers, have less of a negative impact on consumption. Spending cuts hit consumption hard, depriving the economy of money that would otherwise be spent quickly. They also have the disadvantage -- so evident in the cuts proposed by Mr. Schwarzenegger -- of falling heavily on the needy. 
 If California cannot or will not solve its problems and emergency federal aid is deemed necessary, the administration must attach strings -- perhaps by limiting the ways the money can be spent. An onerous quid pro quo would send a message to other states that bailouts are not worth the hassle -- that there are no pain-free ways out of this downturn.

HEADLINE: Shareholder Bill of Rights

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''No Bill Needed'' (Breakingviews.com, Business Day, May 20) clearly agrees that the principles in our Shareholders Bill of Rights Act like ''say on pay,'' eliminating ''staggered boards'' and separating the position of chairman and chief executive are sound. 
 And the article is certainly correct that many companies are already carrying out some or all of the changes we propose. But it misses the point of the bill.
 We are not pursuing this legislation to go after those companies doing the right thing, but rather to address the significant number of outliers who are shirking these reforms. Companies with overly dominant C.E.O.'s can wreak havoc that goes far beyond their shareholders and employees -- it can affect the whole economy. Witness the problems of C.E.O.-dominated companies like A.I.G. and Bear Stearns.

HEADLINE: A Long Goodbye for Old-School Cool

BYLINE: By IRWIN ARIEFF

 BODY:
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY rules that take effect on Jan. 1, 2010, are part of a gradual shift to a new class of refrigerants for window units, central air-conditioning systems, heat pumps and the chillers used to cool large residential and office buildings. 
 Some heating and cooling companies are suggesting replacing old equipment now to accommodate the new refrigerants, and some utilities are offering rebates. But there is nothing in the regulations to compel getting rid of an old system before its time. 
 For years, the refrigerant of choice has been R-22, also known as HCFC-22 (short for hydrochlorofluorocarbon) or Freon 22, a brand name.
 But R-22, when released into the atmosphere, eats away at the ozone layer, which shields the earth from hazardous ultraviolet radiation. In 1990, the federal Clean Air Act was amended to prohibit putting newly made R-22 into equipment made after Dec. 31, 2009.
 The main replacement for R-22 in residential cooling is a hydrofluorocarbon called HFC-410A. Sold under names like Puron, Genetron AZ-20 and Suva, it was recognized by the E.P.A. as an R-22 substitute in 1996.
 But it's not just a matter of draining the old coolant and putting in the new. Systems must be more heavily built to accommodate high-pressure HFC-410A, making them more efficient.
 The equipment designed for the new coolants, said Julius Banks, the E.P.A. team leader for refrigerant recycling programs, ''typically is built better, and will have lower leaks and greater energy efficiency. So over its lifetime, you will save money and protect the environment.''
 Along with lower electric bills, some manufacturers and utilities are offering rebates on the new equipment, including the Carrier Corporation and Connecticut Light and Power, although no rebates are in effect in New York State at this time. In addition, the federal economic stimulus bill provides a tax credit of up to $1,500 for the purchase, this year or next, of highly efficient residential heat pumps and central air-conditioning systems. 
 Old equipment should be disposed of with care to avoid the release of refrigerant; local jurisdictions offer guidelines.
 Alice Dobles, an office worker at Hellas Air Temp., a heating and cooling contractor in Norwalk, Conn., says the company has alerted customers about the new rules and many are considering new units. 
 ''We have homes that have had their units in there for 25 years, and the usual life span is 15 to 20 years,'' Ms. Dobles said, ''so they are eventually going to have to replace them anyway.''
 The government wants consumers to know that they are not obliged to buy any new equipment and has taken steps to try to ensure that there will be enough R-22, either newly made or recycled, to maintain existing equipment throughout its lifetime, Mr. Banks said. ''People can continue to use their existing units, and continue to service them,'' he said.
 But some industry officials fear R-22 supplies could tighten in about five years, pushing up prices, as the phase-down proceeds and equipment becomes increasingly dependent on recycled rather than newly made R-22. 
 Mack McFarland, the chief atmospheric scientist at DuPont, which makes a range of refrigerants, says equipment can be retrofitted to run on alternative coolants. Maintenance firms should also plug leaks and recover any refrigerant being taken out and make sure it is recycled, he added. 
 Environmentalists, meanwhile, say the shift to HFC-410A is only a halfway measure because the new refrigerant, while good for the ozone, still throws off heat, contributing to global warming.
 While HFC-410A's warming potential is lower than R-22's, ''to some people that is still too high,'' said Charlie J. McCrudden, the vice president for government relations at the Air Conditioning Contractors of America, a trade association in Arlington, Va. But so far, there is no widely accepted replacement for HFCs, Mr. McCrudden said. ''The first rule of wing-walking is you don't let go with one hand until you get a grip with the other.''
 But Kert Davies, the research director for Greenpeace USA in Washington, said that alternatives were already widely used in Europe and Asia but not feasible in the American market because of national and local regulatory obstacles, including building codes and safety concerns.
 ''We are on this chemical treadmill,'' Mr. Davies said. ''We have been replacing one chemical with another, and they are all bad for global warming. In the process of cooling our homes and our beer, we are heating up the planet. We need to get off the treadmill.''

HEADLINE: New Requirements on Border ID Stir Worries at Crossings

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After years of delay and hundreds of millions of dollars in preparations, Customs and Border Protection officials said new security measures would go into effect on June 1, requiring Americans entering the country by land or sea to show government-approved identification.
 Currently, Americans crossing borders or arriving on cruise ships can prove their nationality by showing thousands of other forms of identification. But after the start of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, Americans will be required to present a passport or one of five other secure identification cards. 
 Coming as the summer vacation season starts, the measure is expected to lengthen lines at least temporarily at border crossings and seaports. But the biggest impact is expected along the nearly 4,000-mile border that the United States shares with Canada, which both countries once boasted was the world's longest undefended frontier. 
 Before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Americans and Canadians crossing that border were required to do little more than state their nationality. Security has been gradually increased since then, causing longer lines and a steady drop in casual cross-border excursions, according to business and travel associations that monitor border traffic. 
 Now some local and state officials are concerned that the new measures might further disrupt a major trading relationship for the United States and drive apart border communities that have deep economic and cultural ties.
 ''We treat Canada like going to Ohio or to Chicago for the weekend,'' said Sarah Hubbard of the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce. ''We have families living on both sides of the border. We have business partnerships on both sides of the border.
 ''We believe our community is unique because it is bi-national,'' Ms. Hubbard added. ''It's seamless in many ways.'' 
 Nearly 20 percent of all land trade between the United States and Canada -- valued at an estimated $130 billion -- crosses the Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Ms. Hubbard said some 461,000 trucks, buses and cars crossed the Ambassador Bridge each month. 
 She said an estimated 4,000 Canadian health care workers commuted into Detroit to work. And the manufacturing industry is so transnational, she said, that a single car can be sent back and forth across the border 12 times before the finished product is ready to be shipped to a dealer.
 Still, she said, cross-border traffic has fallen since Sept. 11. Traffic across the Ambassador Bridge is down by nearly 100,000 crossings a month this year compared with last year, Ms. Hubbard said. Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, said that at border crossings in her state, traffic was down 13 percent to 19 percent this year from what it was last year. 
 Ms. Hubbard said some of the decline had been caused by the recession. But some of it she attributed to ''confusion about documents and hostile treatment by border officials.''
 ''We have many people who come from Canada and tell us they don't feel welcome when they cross the border,'' she said. ''We talk about those complaints with our friends on the border, and they tell us their job is security, not customer service.''
 Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary who forged her political career on the southern border and plans to travel to the northern border next week, makes no apologies for the tightened security measures, including using unmanned Predator aircraft from Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota to patrol the border with Canada. 
 Ground sensors were added along the border in Vermont, and towers equipped with cameras and sensors are being built around Buffalo.
 ''One of the things that I think we need to be sensitive to is the very real feeling among southern border states, and in Mexico, that if things are being done on the Mexican border, they should also be done on the Canadian border,'' Ms. Napolitano said at a recent conference on the northern border at the Brookings Institution. 
 Her comparisons between the northern and southern borders have stirred outrage in Canada, where 80 percent of the population lives within 100 miles of the border and the government considers itself one of America's most reliable allies.
 Seizures of illegal drugs and the detention of immigrants along the northern border are a small fraction of what they are along the southern one, which is considered the busiest transshipment point for illegal immigrants and drugs in the world.
 Still, Canadian officials said that their government, like the United States, had become much more sensitive to terrorism threats since Sept. 11. Canada has invested heavily, they said, in improving immigration controls, upgrading security at airports and seaports, sharing intelligence with its allies, and establishing its own homeland security agency, which includes joint American-Canadian border enforcement teams. And Canadian border guards began getting their first weapons in 2007, after years of debate about whether they should be armed. 
 A Canadian diplomat in Washington said his country's biggest diplomatic problem had been dealing with the American perception that Canada poses a threat because of its open immigration policy and concerns that it is a haven for terrorists. ''We spend a lot of time trying to explain the fact that just because you don't have the National Guard or a fence along the border, it doesn't mean it's not secure,'' said the diplomat, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of his comments.
 Plans to put the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative into effect two years ago were postponed because of a significant backlog in passport applications and delays getting sufficient staff and equipment in place. 
 In a meeting with reporters on Wednesday, Jayson P. Ahern, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said Congress had allotted $350 million to help the agency resolve those problems.
 Mr. Ahern said recent surveys of drivers across the border suggested that more than 80 percent of them had the required identification. The State Department, he said, has issued a million passport cards, wallet-size identification. And at least two million other people have gotten one of the four other kinds of acceptable border crossing cards.
 ''I don't expect any major delays or traffic jams as a result of this program,'' Mr. Ahern said. ''There will be no story on June 1.''

BYLINE: By ELSA DIXLER

 BODY:
A VOYAGE LONG AND STRANGE: On the Trail of Vikings, Conquistadors, Lost Colonists, and Other Adventures in Early America, by Tony Horwitz. (Picador, $18.) Visiting Plymouth Rock, Horwitz realized that ''I'd matriculated to middle age with a third grader's grasp of early America.'' So he set out to educate himself, blending self-tutorial with reporting and driving around (the same mix that worked in his earlier ''Confederates in the Attic''). The result is a lively and accessible popular history that demonstrates the survival of the past in our present-minded country. 
 DEFEAT: Losing Iraq and the Future of the Middle East, by Jonathan Steele. (Counterpoint, $16.95.) ''The central problem'' in Iraq ''was not that the Americans made mistakes,'' writes Steele, a British journalist who visited Iraq eight times starting in 2003. ''The occupation itself was the mistake.'' He says that Iraqi history, nationalism and opposition to American policies in the region would have doomed the intervention even with competent planning and execution. THE BALLAD OF ABU GHRAIB, by Philip Gourevitch and Errol Morris. (Penguin, $16.) Interviews with some of the soldiers who appeared in the infamous pictures from Abu Ghraib are the core both of Morris's movie ''Standard Operating Procedure'' and of this book. Gourevitch, its writer, provides a context for the images, showing their roots in Bush administration policies. FINAL SALUTE: A Story of Unfinished Lives, by Jim Sheeler. (Penguin, $16.) Sheeler received a Pulitzer Prize in 2006 for the feature writing on which this book is based. Following a major who notifies and supports the families of Marines killed in Iraq, it is ''quietly horrifying'' but not maudlin, Janet Maslin said in The Times. ''It bears witness to the ways in which casualties from Iraq are shielded from sight.'' 
 PEACE, by Richard Bausch. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.95.) The main characters in Bausch's 11th novel, set in Italy in the winter of 1944, are American soldiers who witness a war crime committed by their commanding officer. Bausch's theme, explored in economical prose that matches the soldiers' laconic speech, is how to preserve personal integrity amid the insanity of war. 
 WILD NIGHTS!: Stories About the Last Days of Poe, Dickinson, Twain, James, and Hemingway, by Joyce Carol Oates. (Ecco/Harper Perennial, $13.99.) This ''hilarious and harrowing new collection,'' as our reviewer, Brenda Wineapple, described it, imagines the last days of five writers. It's ''a gem of a book . . . about creativity and age and the complicated, anxiety-ridden relationship between the two,'' she said, as well as ''a cycle of morality tales about sexual power.'' 
 SLEEPING IT OFF IN RAPID CITY: Poems, New and Selected, by August Kleinzahler. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16.) Kleinzahler's ''strongly accented free verse'' is ''among the most articulate and alive sounds American poetry is currently making,'' Dwight Garner said in The Times. Kleinzahler writes about loneliness, masculinity and American places, particularly New Jersey, where he grew up: ''I have loved the air outside Shop-Rite Liquor / on summer evenings / better than the Marin hills at dusk.'' 
 HUBERT'S FREAKS: The Rare-Book Dealer, the Times Square Talker, and the Lost Photos of Diane Arbus, by Gregory Gibson. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $14.95.) In 2003, Gibson's friend Bob Langmuir, a fellow rare-book dealer, bought a collection of papers from a man who once worked at Hubert's Museum, a seedy Times Square attraction that closed in the 1960s. To his surprise, they included photographs by Diane Arbus as she was beginning to find her true subject. Gibson combines the history of Hubert's, the story of Arbus and an account of the effect of his discovery (breakdown, divorce) on the neurotic Langmuir. 
 CITY OF THIEVES, by David Benioff. (Plume, $15.) Benioff's third work of fiction (he is also a successful screenwriter) follows an awkward Jewish teenager and a handsome Russian deserter in their search for a dozen eggs in the starving city of Leningrad during its siege. 
 STORMING LAS VEGAS: How a Cuban-Born, Soviet-Trained Commando Took Down the Strip to the Tune of Five World-Class Hotels, Three Armored Cars, and Millions of Dollars, by John Huddy. (Ballantine, $15.) From 1998 to 2000, a Cuban refugee terrorized the strip in a series of attacks on armored cars. (He also robbed the main cashier's desk at the Bellagio.) This true-crime drama has stakeouts, car chases and a charismatic villain. 
 THE LOST CITY, by Henry Shukman. (Vintage Contemporaries, $15.95.) A young man who has recently left the British Army searches for a lost city in Peru in a haze of heat, sickness, fear and dubious motives in this lyrical novel, which is part adventure story, part quest. 
 WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?: A Memoir, by Alyse Myers. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $15.) Myers recalls growing up in working-class Queens in the 1960s and '70s with a cruel, desperately unhappy mother, and tells of her own struggle to break free.

HEADLINE: In a Rocky Job Market, New Pressure on Moms

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
MEN have been hard-hit by this recession, accounting for about 80 percent of United States job losses, and that is pushing more women into the work force. Many of those women are former stay-at-home mothers, thrust back into jobs sooner than they had planned. 
 Linda Stolberg is one of them. Until last November, Ms. Stolberg's days were devoted to raising her two children and managing the family's home in suburban Chicago. Her husband, Gary, works on a commission basis, selling time on local television to advertisers, and his earnings have dropped 20 percent this year from last. 
 Bracing for further declines, Ms. Stolberg, a former human resources benefits manager, started looking for work.
 ''I checked every job board, not even necessarily ones in my field, because I had been out of the work force for six years,'' she said. ''I applied at Trader Joe's; I even pursued jobs with a funeral home and managing a doctor's office. I wanted something flexible so we wouldn't have to pay for child care.''
 After responding to an ad on Craigslist, Ms. Stolberg landed a job in her previous profession, working 20 hours a week at the Lake Forest Graduate School of Management as a payroll benefits coordinator. 
 Her days of volunteering at the elementary school are gone, as is almost any time she used to have for herself. ''I'm really time-stretched, but I'm way more organized,'' Ms. Stolberg said. ''I have a calendar a month out what I'm cooking for dinner.''
 From the Depression through the recessions of the early 1980s and '90s, financial necessity has forced women at home with children to head into the work force, said Katherine A. S. Sibley, chairwoman of the history department at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, who researches women's history. 
 During World War II, about 36 percent of American women worked outside the home, Ms. Sibley said. During the recession of the early 1980s, about 48 percent of women were working and, in the downturn of the early 1990s, about 54 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Today, 55 percent of women are working, and they make up nearly half the work force.
 Allison O'Kelly, chief executive of Mom Corps, a staffing firm in Atlanta, has noticed a change in the last year among her clients, 90 percent of whom are mothers. ''In the past, they wanted to work to make a little extra money for themselves or the kids' summer camp, things like that,'' she said. ''Now it's an urgent necessity that they work.'' Women are also being less picky, she said. The type of job, as well as its hourly schedule, isn't as important. 
 Kathryn Sollmann, co-founder and managing partner of Women@Work Network, a recruitment firm in Wilton, Conn., says the biggest obstacle these women face can be a lack of confidence. Because they have been so focused for years on parenting, it is often hard for them to switch gears and repackage themselves as professionals, she said. 
 That includes creating a resume that reflects both previous career experience and skills gained while out of the work force. ''If you have been running the book fair at school, for example, that is marketing and advertising with results that can be measured in revenue,'' Ms. Sollmann said. ''I can't tell you how many times women have done part-time work, volunteer work, been active in industry associations and they ask me, 'That counts?' '' 
 Career transition advisers usually recommend that mothers who want to re-enter the work force take the time to do a thorough skills assessment, to rebuild their network of professional contacts and to decide whether they want to return to their previous careers.
 But those in dire financial straits do not have the luxury of time, and must often return to a previous career by default. 
 Women with gaps in employment must also overcome employers' concerns that they are not technologically current. Ms. Stolberg brought herself up to speed on software programs like Microsoft Excel and Word by using free tutorials at the public library. 
 Karen Roth, a director at Hyatt Leader, an administrative and human resource staffing firm in New York City, said she advised mothers needing a job quickly to do temporary work.
 ''Your resume won't necessarily be scrutinized, you build your confidence and computer skills, reacquaint yourself with the corporate environment and meet people that might be able to help you find permanent work,'' Ms. Roth said. ''And every day you temp is like an eight-hour interview because every person you meet at that temp job is a networking opportunity.'' There is also the chance a temporary position will become a permanent one.
 Even though the additional income often eases financial worries, the sudden change from stay-at-home to working mother can take an emotional toll.
 LAST May, when Loreen Madsen's husband, Erik, was laid off as an organizer for the Teamsters in San Diego, she began looking for a job immediately. Ms. Madsen already waited tables a few nights a week for extra money and spent her days managing the house and ferrying the couple's 12-year-old daughter, Jenna, to dance lessons and regional competitions. Ms. Madsen found a job at Wawanesa Insurance as a support clerk. 
 She says she is concerned about the effect her time away from home could have on her daughter. ''I feel like I'm disconnected to her school and schoolwork,'' Ms. Madsen said. ''I'm very stressed, but I try really hard not to show it.'' 
 Recently, though, Jenna wrote a note to her parents in which she listed what she called ''Rules for the House.'' 
 The rule for her mother? ''Be happy again.''

HEADLINE: Old McDonald Had an Intern? Summer Jobs Are Going Organic

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
Erin Axelrod, who graduated from Barnard College last week with an urban studies degree, will not be fighting over the bathroom with her five roommates on the Upper West Side this summer. Instead she will be living in a tent, using an outdoor composting toilet and harvesting vegetables on an organic farm near Petaluma, Calif. 
 As the sole intern at a boutique dairy in upstate New York, Gina Runfola, an English and creative writing student, has traded poetry books for sheep. 
 And Jamie Katz, an English major at Kenyon College in Ohio, is planting peach trees at Holly Tree Farm in Virginia. 
 These three are part of a new wave of liberal arts students who are heading to farms as interns this summer, in search of both work, even if it might pay next to nothing, and social change. 
 They come armed with little more than soft hands and dog-eared copies of Michael Pollan's ''The Omnivore's Dilemma,'' which takes a dim view of industrial agriculture. 
 A few hope to run their own farms. Others plan to work on changing government food policy. Some are just looking for a break from the rigors of academia. But whatever the reason, the interest in summer farm work among college students has never been as high, according to dozens of farmers, university professors and people who coordinate agricultural apprenticeships.
 Andrew Marshall, who began organizing apprenticeships for the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association in 2003, used to see an average of 75 applications a year. This season, he has fielded over 200, with more coming in every day. 
 Katherine L. Adam, who runs the National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service, financed by the Department of Agriculture, said 1,400 farms sought interns this year, almost triple the number two years ago. The number of small farms, which attract the new agrarians and can use the cheap, enthusiastic help, has grown sharply since 2003, according to the department.
 Of course, employing people who know a lot about food systems but nothing about farming can be as much a headache as a help. Manure spreaders get broken, carrot shoots get pulled instead of weeds, and people sleep in. It is not all hayrides and flowers for the apprentices, either. Ms. Adam sometimes gets complaints from interns who say the amenities are not good enough or the farmers work them too hard. 
 Still, during a recession, a summer on the farm provides respite from grim job hunts and as much bohemian cachet as backpacking through Europe. But for many students, farm life is a way to act on the growing enthusiasm for locally raised food and the increased concern over food safety and the environmental impact of agriculture. 
 Some students say food is the political movement of their time. ''I no longer wish I was born in the '60s,'' said Mr. Katz, 20, who discovered farming as an outgrowth of his interest in environmental issues. 
 But food policy is much more personal than deforestation or global warming. ''Everyone eats, and everyone has a vested interest in this,'' he said.
 The new rush from campus to country is not among conventional agricultural students from land-grant schools. Many of those still seek internships on large-scale farms or with companies like Monsanto, although interest in studying conventional agriculture has been in decline for at least a decade, said John P. Reganold, a soil science professor at Washington State University. To counter that, Washington State in 2006 became the first university to offer an organic farming degree, he said. 
 About a third of the new agrarians will receive college credit, he and other professors estimated. The rest have to be satisfied with room, board and a stipend that can be as little as $25 a week and as much as $300 a week or more at larger farms.
 At 3-Corner Field Farm in Shushan, N.Y., Karen Weinberg hires one intern to help her raise lambs and make sheep's milk cheese. This year she had more than 20 applicants, a significant increase over last year. 
 She picked Ms. Runfola, who had already worked for her selling cheese at the Greenmarket in Union Square in New York.
 Ms. Runfola, who grew up on the Jersey Shore and has never even gone camping, will plot her next move from a small trailer parked a half a city block away from the Internet connection in the main farmhouse. 
 Although she has come to understand a lot more about where food comes from, she is not as strident as some of her new agrarian friends.
 ''Working on the farm really doesn't pay that much, so it's not helping me economically,'' said Ms. Runfola, 22, who has left New York University and plans to attend a less expensive college. ''But it's free room and board while I figure out my next move.'' 
 Dru Rivers has had more than 150 people fill out the online application to be one of four interns working her 200 acres of organic fruits and vegetables at Full Belly Farm in Northern California. That is three times as many as last year.
 Ms. Rivers, who began farming organically 25 years ago, said her generation had inspired the next. 
 Alex Liebman, 19, is part of that new wave. He is taking a leave from working on his biology degree at Macalester College in St. Paul to spend a year at Full Belly Farm. 
 His parents, who raised him in Holyoke, Mass., are environmentalists and supporters of local agriculture. His father would refuse to drive him to soccer practice because he thought using a car to travel somewhere to exercise was ridiculous.
 This will be Mr. Liebman's third farm internship. He has come to love the muscle fatigue that sets in at the end of a day. The rhythm of farm life is a welcome break from cellphones and Facebook. And the work makes him feel as if he is doing something to better the world.
 ''I'm not sure that I can affect how messed up poverty is in Africa or change politics in Washington,'' he said, ''but on the farm I can see the fruits of my labor.'' 
 ''By actually waking up every day and working in the field and putting my principles into action, I am making a conscious political decision,'' he added.
 Sometimes, the interns can get a little too political. Recently, an intern in Florida wanted to report her organic farmer for using antibiotics on sick sheep. Under national organic regulations, that is permitted as long as the treated animal is separated from the herd -- a fact the young agrarian did not know. 
 She called Ms. Adam, who set her straight. ''She thought the farmer wasn't P.C. enough,'' Ms. Adam said. ''A lot of these students are very idealistic in terms of farming.''
 Rick and Kristie Knoll, who for 30 years have worked a 10-acre plot in Brentwood, Calif., used to hire interns who were eager to be part of a farm that supplies restaurants like Chez Panisse. But it got to be too much work.
 ''These are kids who are not used to living in a small trailer or doing any kind of work,'' Ms. Knoll said. ''Most of them are privileged and think they want to try something new. They need structure. We need farmhands.''

 BODY:
AFTER federal and state investigations earlier in this decade into possible conflicts of interest among Wall Street analysts, the securities industry made important changes in its practices.
 One change imposed by the National Association of Securities Dealers required firms to be more transparent by disclosing the proportion of their stock-picking advice that fell into the categories of buy, hold and sell. Another requirement, part of a settlement by big brokerage firms and investmentbanks with regulators, bound Wall Street to spend $450 million to provide clients with independent research. Unlike the first change, this one had a five-year limit. It will end this July, with a likely result that small investors will have less access to independent research. 
 Unfortunate though that may be, Wall Street's proprietary research has already come to more closely resemble that of the independents, and there is reason to believe that its overall quality will be sustained. 
 That's because the greatest shift in Wall Street stock analysis since those changes appears to be a sharp decline in the number of buy recommendations, according to Brad M. Barber, finance professor at the University of California, Davis. The probable cause of this, he said, was the change that will remain in effect -- the one mandating greater transparency in reporting, formally known as N.A.S.D. Rule 2711.
 In a study in the April 2006 issue of the Journal of Accounting & Economics, Professor Barber found that in the first year after N.A.S.D. 2711's adoption in 2002, the percentage of Wall Street recommendations in the buy category fell by one-third. Crucially, that was before regulators began making Wall Street firms provide independent research to clients.
 (Professor Barber was a co-author of this study, with Reuven Lehavy of the University of Michigan, Maureen F. McNichols of Stanford, and Brett Trueman of the University of California, Los Angeles.) 
 The investigations into Wall Street practices found that stock analysts might have felt pressure from the investment banking and brokerage sides of their firms to have a buy-side bias that would please executives of the companies being analyzed. 
 Professor Barber said the transparency rule, in itself, appeared to have cut down on this buy-side bias. By the time Wall Street firms began distributing independent research, he said, there was no significant difference between them and independents in their share of buy, hold and sell recommendations.
 Other than this shift, the overall quality of proprietary Wall Street research hasn't changed much in recent years, he said, although he said that there isn't enough data to yield more than a tentative conclusion. 
 BEFORE N.A.S.D. 2711, stocks receiving buy recommendations from Wall Street analysts didn't perform as well, on average, as the ''buys'' of independents. But when it came to sell recommendations, Wall Street analysts were more on target: stocks getting their sell signals performed worse, on average, that those with ''sells'' from independents. 
 This isn't so surprising, Professor Barber said. Because buy signals were so common on Wall Street, the more discriminating independent analysts, on average, could be expected to fare better. But on the other side of the coin, Wall Street analysts were stingier with sell recommendations -- and, sure enough, came out ahead.
 A separate, forthcoming study in the Review of Financial Studies has also found that the difference between Wall Street and independent stock research has largely disappeared. (It was conducted by Ohad Kadan of Washington University of St. Louis; Leonardo Madureira of Case Western Reserve; Rong Wang of Singapore Management University and Tazchi Zach of Ohio State.)
 Professor Barber offered another factor to consider in interpreting a Wall Street analyst's research report: the buy, hold, and sell recommendations may be less valuable than supporting data and analysis. And when measured along other dimensions, Wall Street analysts often compare favorably with independents. For example, he says, a number of studies have found that Wall Street analysts' earnings forecasts are more accurate, on average. 
 The bottom line is this: It's doubtful that investors will be worse off come July, when the regulatory arrangement expires, especially if they look beyond specific buy-hold-sell advice and focus on the underlying data and analysis.

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN

 BODY:
Not long ago, Aaron Patzer, the founder of a personal-finance Web site called Mint, posted an update to his Facebook page, marking a milestone for his company, which is based in Silicon Valley: ''To celebrate our one-millionth user, we took the whole team to Napa for the day.''
 Napa. Nice. I admire Patzer's Facebook presence. It suggests that he leads a full life. He plans to head to Costa Rica for surfing and Spanish lessons. He ran a marathon. And on behalf of Mint, he will accept two 2009 Webby Awards in June. Mint also won second prize in the Edison Best New Product Award competition. 
 Mint absolutely deserved the awards -- as well as the praise it has received from just about every quarter. The site helps you track how much money you have, how much you spend and how much you owe. Artfully designed, it comes off like a patient and discreet friend who knows your awkward financial secrets and stands by you anyway. ''There are a number of people we've heard from that say Mint is literally the first thing they look at every single morning with their cup of coffee,'' Patzer told me recently by e-mail. I'm not quite first-thing yet myself, but still: Mint opens on my desktop every weekday.
 The service seems simple enough, though Patzer says there are five separate patents pending to the technology. All I know is that once you slip Mint the user names and passwords for your online accounts, the site collates your mortgages, bank accounts, credit and debit cards, I.R.A.'s, 401(k)'s and more. (Mint, which is connected to about 7,500 financial institutions in the United States, does not itself view or store the information.) Mint can also show trends in your cash flow. It sends you weekly financial summaries via e-mail, while also alerting you to anomalies like unusually high bank fees or sudden surges in expenses. Ordinarily, dealing with banks and credit-card companies requires personal vigilance. With Mint, someone seems to watch over you. And that love comes free of charge.
 Mint's seductive interface has a very gentle, almost-diaphanous graphic scheme that centers on a sprig of mint. (The tacit part of the conceit -- ''mint'' as in U.S. Mint -- is, visually, nowhere to be found.) Open the Mint window, and a translucent, vernal interface greets you. A sample pie chart shows, in laxative-ad hues, a mythical Mint user's monthly expenditures: $1,200 in rent, $400 in groceries, $750 in auto. Halcyon.
 Under the pie chart, amid tufts of pretty green grass, Mint presents options to ''Understand Your Money,'' ''Pay Your Student Loans'' and ''Create a Budget.'' You can visit your own accounts and survey them and customize the way that Mint categorizes them.
 Significantly, the site also proposes seemingly advantageous ways to switch credit cards or take advantage of various other financial deals. This is where Mint makes its money: it advertises financial-service companies directly to users whose economic circumstances suggest a need for them. If you click on ''Ways to Save,'' for instance, you're not given advice on how to darn socks or make stews you can freeze. Instead, logos and promotions for companies like American Express, Starwood and Discover come up. This makes Mint seem somewhat less benevolent. In fact, it's downright sinister. Unlike other personal-finance guides, Mint does little, if anything, to discourage credit-card use; rather, it encourages users to find ''better'' cards. Hasn't the option of hopping from one zero-percent mirage to the next helped to sustain America's credit delusions?
 My anxiety about Mint -- that users come to budget and stay to borrow -- is quickly allayed by a return to the main interface. Phew: no logos but Mint's own. And Mint is suffused with a consoling, feel-good quality, as hard to resist as Citigroup's old ''Live Richly'' campaign.
 By my lights, the best Mint feature is one that lets you compare your own financial freakiness to other people's. Bar graphs in a beachy palette compare how much you spend at Neiman Marcus or Trader Joe's, say, with how much money people nationwide -- or people just in your state -- spend in those franchises. By running my expenses up against those of other household economies, Mint has permitted me raptures of smugness at the thought that, for example, I don't own a car. It has also chagrined me for days with the realization that I've retained so many chump habits from 2006 and am still blowing way too much money at Starbucks.
 Joy and chagrin -- I'd say those are the emotions activated by Mint. Not bad, right? At least they supplant the anxiety, compulsion and misery that are my usual responses to personal finance. On the service's testimonials page, users express a kind of soft-rock ardor. ''Mint has truly helped my wife and I see light at the end of the financial tunnel,'' writes one. 
 Such emotional reactions suggest that the site is, at its core, something other than a mere bookkeeping tool. After only a few weeks, I was regularly on Mint and essentially playing with it, as with a crossword puzzle: analyzing my spending habits, lowering my monthly caps on this or that category and calling my bank to contest Mint-flagged charges. This new diversion was -- I noticed -- distracting me from other sites, namely eBay and Etsy. That was rich. Where eBay had once turned shopping into a game, Mint had now turned saving into one.
 Lately when I use Mint, I try to ignore what Patzer said when I asked if Mint had a house ideology: he described his crew as ''quite a free-market bunch'' and said that there are ''a number of objectivists and/or libertarians at Mint.'' Is Mint an Ayn Rand shop? Should I care? Mint offers a video of Patzer making an industry presentation in 2007. At that time, the occasion of his site's unveiling, Patzer told the audience that he hoped with his advertiser tie-ins to achieve an ''audacious'' goal: to help America learn to save. I think Mint has helped me save. And if I'm saving so that the men and women of Mint can go wine-tasting -- well, that shouldn't bother me. Should it? Maybe profiting off people's recent compulsion to budget is a new American way. 
 POINTS OF ENTRY: THIS WEEK'S RECOMMENDATIONS
 FRUGAL: Let go of fear and frenzy and slip into Mint.com. Give up your bank passwords and surrender your cares; then face the numbers, but in the patented vague haze that only Mint can induce.
 HANDMADE:Etsy.com, a huge online crafts fair, offers toys, graduation gifts, wedding dresses and zillions of other things, all handmade. Arguably, you're saving money because -- no, it's just spending. But Etsy offers beautiful things. For ideas about what to buy there, or how to make your own stuff, see also Threadbanger.com, the fantastic site for people who make their own clothes.
 CONSCIOUS:Unconsumption.com is a new blog -- featuring the magazine's own Rob Walker -- about consuming less and consuming more efficiently. At unconsumption.tumblr.com, Unconsumption cites new books, articles and ideas for living more happily with all the things we buy, find and have.

HEADLINE: It's Tee Time. Where Is Everybody?

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

DATELINE: Montverde, Fla. 

 BODY:
 OFF the turnpike here in central Florida, hidden behind stucco walls, sits a sprawling Tuscan-style clubhouse on a hill overlooking a string of lakes, a golf course and green fields. 
 This 1,900-acre property, called Bella Collina, was designed to hold 800 homes. Today, only 48 houses dot the landscape, and just three are occupied. The clubhouse, though open, is eerily quiet, and a promised swimming pool and equestrian center have yet to be built. 
 Bella Collina, the brainchild of Robert Edward Ginn III, looks like a ghost town. So does Tesoro, another resort opened by Mr. Ginn near Port St. Lucie, where just 150 houses sit on 900 lots. And the Conservatory in Palm Coast, also from Mr. Ginn, is even more barren: 335 out of 340 lots are empty. 
 As the real estate boom expanded in recent years, developers and home buyers believed that residential golf resorts were a sure-fire bet. Many buyers looked to buy properties that they could flip for a quick profit. Others were lured by stunning views, club services and security. While there is no reliable data on the growth in residential golf resorts, analysts say the market is well past its peak -- particularly in the Sun Belt -- and there is now an overabundance of developments. 
 ''The aggressive building of new resort courses continued from the mid-1990s into the 2000s, contributing to an increasing glut of inventory that finally found no market,'' said Joe Beditz, chief executive of the National Golf Foundation, a trade group that tracks data on the golf industry. 
 Mr. Ginn, 60, was able to cash in on the boom despite a spotty record that included some well-publicized failures on Hilton Head Island, S.C., in the 1980s. But when the real estate market began to tank in 2007, his empire came undone. ''As property values plummeted, many investors had property worth less than their loans, and they were unprepared to pay their club and association fees,'' says Toby Tobin, a Florida real estate agent. 
 Other golf resorts are also struggling. WCI Communities, which built resorts in Florida, Virginia and the Northeast, filed for bankruptcy in August. So did the Yellowstone Club in Big Sky, Mont., and three other resorts that, like some of Mr. Ginn's, had loans arranged by Credit Suisse. Even the venerable Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia has sought bankruptcy protection. 
 For Mr. Ginn, a man who could sell 400 lots in a single day during the height of the real estate boom, it has been a huge comedown. While other developers may have built more golf resorts, few did so as grandly or as extravagantly. The tab for the 116,000- square-foot clubhouse at Tesoro reached $48 million.
 ''Most developers used consultants,'' recalled Dean Adler, co-founder of Lubert-Adler Partners, a private equity firm in Philadelphia that invested in Mr. Ginn's projects. ''Bobby had a feel. He could be handed a topography map at a site and sketch out the entire resort.''
 An amiable Southerner with a casual personal style, Mr. Ginn was a virtuoso at selling investors his vision of the luxe lifestyle. 
 ''Bobby is very smooth and very likable,'' said Hilton Wiener, a lawyer who bought an investment property at Tesoro. ''He is a down-home guy who is not a pushy kind of salesperson.''
 But when a new resort was in the works, Mr. Ginn knew how to generate a buying frenzy by holding lavish parties where potential buyers greatly outnumbered available lots, say agents and investors who attended the events. 
 ''You would come to one of Ginn's sales weekends and you would be drinking and thinking, 'I hope I get chosen as one of the select few who gets to buy a lot,' '' Mr. Wiener recalled. ''The setting is very lush: hand-rolled cigars, fancy parties, vans with the Ginn name plastered on them.''
 The high times ended when the market turned two years ago. Sales stalled, and Mr. Ginn had trouble paying off loans. Two of his properties, Tesoro and Quail West in Naples, Fla., filed for bankruptcy in December 2008 and were later sold for a fraction of what he had put into them. He sold Laurelmor, a resort in North Carolina, to another developer for $32 million. Mr. Ginn's network of companies still owns the facilities at Bella Collina and the Conservatory.
 Not all of Mr. Ginn's 13 golf resorts are in such dire straits. But even at some of the most successful, like Reunion near Orlando, the Ginn Companies is considering programs to attract more buyers by offering fractional ownership at lower prices. 
 Mr. Ginn says his remaining properties will eventually pay off. ''My belief is that when the depression ends, there will be a pent-up demand for happiness,'' he said in an interview at his offices at the Hammock Beach Resort near Daytona Beach. ''Sometime between 2035 or 2040, Florida will double in size.''
 In the meantime, he faces dozens of lawsuits from angry investors alleging that his companies used deceptive and misleading trade practices in representing the demand for and value of his properties. ''We will vigorously defend against these false allegations,'' Mr. Ginn said.
 BOBBY GINN grew up in Hampton, S.C., where his father was a small homebuilder. ''I dropped out of school when I was 19 to go into the business because I always had a passion for building,'' he said. 
 When Mr. Ginn was in his 30s, he worked with the Butcher brothers, Jake and C. H. Jr., Tennessee bankers who went to prison for bank fraud. In 1986, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation sued Mr. Ginn, contending that he had participated in a scheme with the brothers to defraud banks under the pretense of developing a property in that state. Mr. Ginn said he settled with the F.D.I.C. in the early 1990s and paid $500,000, without admitting wrongdoing. An F.D.I.C spokesman said the agency did not have documents from that period detailed enough to confirm Mr. Ginn's account. 
 In 1985, he bought several resort and residential developments on Hilton Head Island, including such landmarks as the golf course where the Heritage Classic was played. ''I liked the resort business more than building condos and shopping centers,'' Mr. Ginn said. ''Selling fun is more enjoyable.'' 
 But his Hilton Head project did not prove to be a good investment. Some critics argue that he took on too much debt. As his cash-flow problems grew, a local radio station carried bulletins announcing when Ginn employees could safely cash paychecks and bumper stickers began appearing that said: ''Honk if Bobby Owes You.''
 Mr. Ginn sold his Hilton Head assets in 1986 to pay off debts, and declared personal bankruptcy two years later.
 He resuscitated his career by working for Rochester Community Savings Bank in New York as a consultant on its investment in Wild Dunes, a North Carolina resort.
 He got a big break in 1997, when Lubert-Adler started investing in his projects. Over the next decade, the firm, whose investors include the endowments for Harvard and Princeton, pumped about $800 million into his properties. Their partnership was structured such that the private equity firm put up all the money and took 80 percent of the profits. 
 The timing of the relationship couldn't have been better. ''Their business really took off after Sept. 11, when people turned from financial investments to hard assets,'' said Robert Gidel, a former president of the Ginn Companies. 
 Mr. Ginn's development style was unusual: he didn't build clubhouses or other services until a large number of lots were sold. ''Typically, developers start with a hotel or amenities because skeptical buyers want to see things,'' Mr.Gidel said. ''But here the market was so strong, and people wanted to believe.'' 
 Dan Gerner, who owned a home in Quail West, one of the few developed properties that Mr. Ginn bought, said Mr. Ginn's lavish spending ornamented his operation with all the trappings of success. At Quail West, Mr. Gerner said, Mr. Ginn ''spent $12 million remodeling the clubhouse, and when the members didn't like it, he spent $4 million more changing it.'' 
 Many buyers bought several properties and hoped to flip them for a profit. 
 Even Mr. Adler, the Lubert-Adler chief, was personally involved in at least one deal at Tesoro. According to property records, he bought a parcel in 2004 and quickly sold it for a $205,000 profit. 
 A partnership formed by Mr. Adler and Mr. Ginn, A & G, also bought and sold five properties at Bella Collina for a $2.5 million profit over a period of weeks. 
 Those transactions raised possible conflict-of-interest questions, experts in private equity say, because the partnership bought property in developments that were also assets held by private equity funds that Mr. Adler was helping to oversee. Steven N. Kaplan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago, said that transactions such as this can be problematic because investors in a fund are deprived of profits that potentially accrue to insiders who buy assets for themselves. 
 Mr. Adler says that although he bought the single property at Tesoro in his own name, he had actually ''made a loan to two individuals to purchase that property.'' He said that they -- not he -- kept the profits from the transaction and that they repaid him with interest. 
 As for the five properties purchased by A & G, Mr. Adler said the situation was ''rectified.'' 
 ''I transferred my investment back to Mr. Ginn and never participated or received a penny of profit,'' he said. Mr. Ginn confirmed Mr. Adler's account. 
 The A & G deals are cited in a class-action suit filed last week in federal district court in Florida, alleging a scheme to sell properties based on fraudulent appraisals. Although Mr. Adler and Mr. Ginn are cited in the case, their firms, and not they as individuals, are named as defendants. Mr. Adler said he was no longer a partner in A & G when the transactions took place and denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Ginn said he had not seen the suit but also denied allegations of wrongdoing.
 In 2006, Mr. Ginn's partnership with Lubert-Adler borrowed $675 million from Credit Suisse, out of which it took a distribution of $332 million. (Mr. Adler said that his firm put back roughly that amount after sales slowed.) The partnership used the balance of the Credit Suisse loan to finance four resorts.
 But the next year, the real estate market began to enter a free fall, and by 2008 the partnership couldn't make payments on the Credit Suisse loan. Tesoro and Quail West filed for bankruptcy, and Laurelmor was sold. ''There were no buyers and no market,'' Mr. Tobin said. 
 Mr. Ginn says he now faces about 30 lawsuits.
 According to one filed in a Florida circuit court, buyers were required to turn over their power of attorney to Richard T. Davis, a partner in a law firm that represented several Ginn companies, in order to buy land in Tesoro. The suit alleges that Mr. Davis signed documents that never provided detailed disclosures about costs, as the government requires. Since Mr. Davis was the companies' closing agent, the suit contends, he knew that the disclosures were incomplete.
 ''I assure you that we tried to disclose everything that was out there,'' Mr. Ginn said. Mr. Davis's lawyer said the allegations were without merit. 
 The Florida suit also alleges that Mr. Ginn worked to artificially inflate the prices of parcels in his development. In one case, according to the lawsuit, a buyer bought two properties for a total of $1.007 million, and Mr. Ginn's title company recorded the respective sale prices as $1.007 million and $1. The company then used the larger price as a ''comparable'' figure in an appraisal for Roy Bridges, a British financial adviser who bought a property for $1.195 million, according to appraisal records. Mr. Bridges's property is now in foreclosure. 
 Mr. Ginn contends that ''the county recorded it incorrectly.'' 
 According to a transcript of a video obtained by a law firm representing property owners in the suit, a Ginn salesman told a group of potential buyers at Bella Collina that ''Lot 5 sold for $2.1 million this morning.'' But property records showed that the parcel sold for just $416,900, according to the lawsuit. 
 Mr. Ginn said he was ''shocked because the salesman deviated from company practices.'' 
 MR. GINN'S partnership with Lubert-Adler still has three properties left to develop and owns some land at existing resorts. ''At this point, we have invested more than we have distributed back to investors,'' Mr. Adler said. ''We got hit by the economic tsunami, and we did not anticipate how tough it would be.'' 
 Mr. Ginn says he is ''ready to sell properties in trophy locations'' when the market turns around. 
 ''If you can't sell,'' he said, ''you die.''

HEADLINE: Market Edges Up, Despite Debt Worries

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market edged up slightly for the week, despite concern in the bond and currency markets about rising United States government debt. 
 The difficulties of the dollar and the 10-year Treasury note were exacerbated by a warning directed at Britain. Standard & Poor's said that the pristine rating of Britain's sovereign debt might be downgraded if economic conditions deteriorated further and the British debt load continued to grow. The situation of the United States bears some similarities to Britain's, although there are significant differences -- among them, the dollar's global status as a reserve currency.
 Still, the dollar weakened to $1.4011 to the euro, its lowest level since January, while the price of the 10-year Treasury note plummeted, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, soared to 3.45 percent from 3.13 percent the previous week. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 8.68 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 8,277.32. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.12 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 882.88.

HEADLINE: The Hidden Hunger

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
Thomas L. Friedman and Maureen Dowd are off today.

DATELINE: BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau 

 BODY:
 The most heartbreaking thing about starving children is their equanimity.
 They don't cry. They don't smile. They don't move. They don't show a flicker of fear, pain or interest. Tiny, wizened zombies, they shut down all nonessential operations to employ every last calorie to stay alive.
 We in the West misunderstand starvation -- especially the increasing hunger caused by the global economic crisis -- and so along with Paul Bowers, the student winner of my ''win-a-trip'' contest, I've been traveling across five countries in West Africa, meeting the malnourished. 
 At the extreme, they were like Maximiano Camara, a 15-month-old boy here in Bissau, who was so emaciated that he risked failure of major organs. His ribs protruded, his eyes were glassy, his skin was stretched taut over tiny bones.
 (Doctors try to help but are overwhelmed: One was showing me Maximiano when a nurse rushed in from another room carrying a baby who had stopped breathing. The doctor paused, revived that child on the next bed, handed her back to the nurse, and then calmly resumed his discussion of Maximiano.)
 Even if Maximiano survives, hunger may leave him physically stunted. Or poor nutrition may have already withered the development of his brain. 
 It's impossible to know if Maximiano was starving because of the economic crisis or because of chronic malnutrition here, but the hardships in the developing world have been exacerbated by elevated food prices and declining remittances from workers abroad.
 The World Bank has estimated that United Nations goals for overcoming global poverty have been set back seven years by the global crisis. It calculates that increased malnutrition last year may have caused an additional 44 million children to suffer permanent physical or mental impairment.
 Yet one of the great Western misconceptions is that severe malnutrition is simply about not getting enough to eat. Often it's about not getting the right micronutrients -- iron, zinc, vitamin A, iodine -- and one of the most cost-effective ways outsiders can combat poverty is to fight this ''hidden hunger.''
 Malnutrition is not a glamorous field, and so it's routinely neglected by everybody -- donor governments, poor countries and, yes, journalists. But malnutrition is implicated in one-third to one-half of all child deaths each year; the immediate cause may be diarrhea, but lurking behind it is a deficiency of zinc.
 ''That image of a starving child in a famine doesn't represent the magnitude of the problem,'' notes Shawn Baker of Helen Keller International, a New York-based aid group working in this area. ''For every child who is like that, you have 10 who are somewhat malnourished and many more who are deficient in micronutrients.
 ''Lack of iron is the most widespread nutrition deficiency in the world, and yet you can't really see it,'' he added.
 In my column last Sunday, I wrote about women dying in childbirth. One reason so many die of hemorrhages is that 42 percent of pregnant women worldwide have anemia, according to the World Health Organization. And here in Guinea-Bissau, 83 percent of youngsters under age 5 suffer from iron deficiency.
 An American or European typically has a hemoglobin, or Hb, level of 13, while anemic women and children in Africa are sometimes at 5 or below.
 ''In Europe, we get worried when Hb drops to 9, and then we consider a transfusion,'' said Dr. Annette Krober, a German working at a Doctors Without Borders clinic for malnourished children in Sierra Leone. ''Here, when we get Hb up to 6, we're very happy.''
 The general rise in food prices (in part because of American use of corn for ethanol) is leading to more micronutrient deficiencies. One study found that a 50 percent rise in food prices in poor countries leads to a 30 percent drop in iron intake.
 One solution is to distribute supplements to vulnerable people, or to fortify foods with micronutrients. A panel of prominent economists produced the ''Copenhagen Consensus'' on which forms of aid are most cost-effective, and it ranked micronutrient supplements as No. 1 (malaria prevention was No. 12, sanitation No. 20, and microfinance No. 22).
 Americans typically get micronutrients from fortified foods, and the same strategy is possible in Africa. Helen Keller International is helping Guinea's leading flour mill fortify its products with iron, folic acid and vitamin B (zinc is coming soon). We visited the mill, and managers said that the fortification costs virtually nothing -- a tiny fraction of a penny per loaf of bread -- yet it will reduce anemia, maternal mortality and cognitive impairments around the country.
 None of this is glamorous, but it's hugely needed -- and truly a bargain.

 BODY:
IT has been a busy week or two for the ethics police -- those within The Times trying to protect the paper's integrity, and those outside, ready to pounce on transgressions by Times journalists. 
 Thomas Friedman, the star columnist, returned a $75,000 speaking fee after accepting it from a California government agency in violation of a Times guideline. Maureen Dowd, another star columnist, was roughed up on the Internet for using a paragraph from a blogger without attribution. And Edmund Andrews, an economics writer, began promoting a memoir describing how he took out subprime mortgages he couldn't possibly repay even as he covered the subprime mess -- including efforts to help homeowners in danger of default, like him.
 Each situation raised a different issue. Here is a look at each:
 Covering your own crisis 
 In the fall of 2007, Andrews went to his editors with a book proposal. He wanted to tell how the subprime mortgage crisis happened -- greedy lenders, regulators who looked the other way and people like himself who made foolish choices. 
 Though the timing was terrible for The Times -- Andrews was the main Washington reporter on the story -- he burned to illuminate a national crisis through his personal experience. And he had another strong reason: He needed money.
 ''I was desperate,'' he said. He still is. Seven months behind on his mortgage, he may lose his home unless ''Busted,'' which comes out this week, is a hit.
 When Craig Whitney, the standards editor, read Andrews's proposal, he asked, ''Can you really keep covering this issue if you're personally involved?'' Andrews said he did not think any policy decisions would affect him, but if they did, it would not be much different from a reporter covering taxes who stood to benefit from a middle-class tax cut.
 After an article adapted from ''Busted'' was published in last week's Sunday magazine, Bradley Laue, a lawyer in Greeley, Colo., asked how Andrews could continue covering economics. Laue said it would be ''like me being disbarred and then reporting on the ethics of lawyers.''
 Dean Baquet, the Washington bureau chief, disagreed. Andrews used poor judgment, he said, but it was legal and encouraged by the lending system. 
 Baquet said that Andrews's own experience gave him a perspective shared by millions of Americans, an advantage. Kelly McBride, an ethicist at the Poynter Institute, agreed. With vigilance by editors, she said, ''this guy could be the perfect person to cover this story.''
 I do not think Andrews is the same as a disbarred lawyer, but I do not think he is the same as a reporter covering tax cuts, unless that reporter is way behind in paying his taxes. 
 Baquet said he saw no conflict in Andrews's personal situation and his beat, but he knew that some people would perceive one, so he tried to minimize the reporter's involvement in ''covering things directly related to the housing collapse.'' Andrews told me: ''I shy away from articles about the pros and cons of this approach or that approach in aiding homeowners. I would have too much at stake.''
 But Baquet acknowledged they have not been rigorous about it. Andrews shared a front-page byline when President Obama announced his plan to help homeowners in danger of foreclosure. He wrote about details of the plan, demands by senators that foreclosures be delayed, and an agreement to freeze interest rates on some subprime mortgages.
 Andrews is an excellent reporter who explains complex issues clearly. There are plenty of them to cover without assigning him to those that could directly affect whether he keeps his own house. He is too close to that story.
 He can't be too cautious. On Thursday, he came under attack from a blogger for The Atlantic for not mentioning in his book that his wife had twice filed for bankruptcy -- the second time while they were married, though Andrews said it involved an old loan from a family member. He said he had wanted to spare his wife any more embarrassment. The blogger said the omission undercut Andrews's story, but I think it was clear that he and his wife could not manage their finances, bankruptcies or no. Still, he should have revealed the second one, if only to head off the criticism.
 Borrowed words
 Last Sunday, Dowd's column on Dick Cheney and torture picked up a paragraph, with one minor word change, from Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo, without identifying the source. Another blogger noticed, and the Internet was soon aflame with charges of plagiarism.
 Dowd said she had not read Marshall's Web post, but was talking with a friend who suggested the wording without telling her where it came from. An attribution was added to the column online, and The Times ran a correction the next day.
 Her explanation was unconvincing to some. How could a friend -- whom Dowd has not identified -- repeat verbatim a 42-word paragraph? I heard from readers demanding that Dowd be fired.
 Dowd told me the passage in question was part of an e-mail conversation with her friend. She noted that she had credited two other bloggers for other information in the column, so there was no reason to intentionally slight Marshall.
 Marshall posted his view: ''We're too quick to pull the trigger with charges of plagiarism.'' He said he didn't think Dowd acted intentionally, and the correction was ''pretty much the end of it.''
 I do not think Dowd plagiarized, but I also do not think what she did was right.
 Andrew Rosenthal, the editorial page editor, said journalists collaborate and take feeds from each other all the time. That is true with news articles, but readers have a right to expect that even if an opinion columnist like Dowd tosses around ideas with a friend, her column will be her own words. If the words are not hers, she must give credit.
 Rules long ignored
 When Friedman accepted $75,000 -- his standard rate -- for speaking to a regional government agency in Oakland this month, he ran afoul of a Times rule that staff members may take fees ''only from educational and other nonprofit groups for which lobbying and political activity are not a major focus.''
 Friedman is his own brand. He has five international best sellers in print and said he gives 15 or more paid lectures a year, many more for free, and posts them on his Web site. But he is bound by the same ethics guidelines as others. When his agent presented him with an invitation to a ''climate protection summit,'' Friedman said, he assumed it was a nonprofit forum. ''I just wasn't paying attention,'' he said.
 Reporters in California brought the matter to everyone's attention. ''It was my fault,'' Friedman said. ''No excuses.'' He returned the check.
 But the incident highlighted a larger issue: The Times has not been abiding by all its rules on speaking fees for years. For example, the paper requires any staffer making $5,000 or more a year from speaking fees to file an itemized annual accounting of the appearances. Almost no one has been doing so. 
 Rosenthal and Bill Keller, the executive editor, sent a memo last week reminding everyone of the rule and acknowledging that they had been lax in enforcing it. I think the rules are vague and need a fresh look. They seem, for example, to be less stringent for staffers on book tours, even if they accept fees.
 Friedman said he hoped for more clarity. ''Bottom line for me: The people in Oakland got a free lecture, and I got a free lesson,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Heeeere's . . . Conan!!!

BYLINE: By LYNN HIRSCHBERG. 
Lynn Hirschberg is editor at large for the magazine.

 BODY:
 On a chilly Thursday night in late January, four weeks from his last show as host of ''Late Night,'' Conan O'Brien was strumming a guitar behind his beat-up desk in his cluttered office at Rockefeller Center, figuring out how to say goodbye. After 16 years and 2,725 shows, O'Brien would be moving, along with almost all his staff, to Universal City in California to take over ''The Tonight Show.'' He'd had time to ponder his farewell. In 2004, when O'Brien's contract was up and other networks were aggressively wooing him, NBC promised him their flagship. ''But they wanted me to wait five years to be the host of 'The Tonight Show,' '' O'Brien told me. ''And in 2004, 2009 sounded absurdly far away. 
I thought that in 2009, we'd be flying around with jet packs and our dinners would be in pill form. It was like being given a car when you're 11 years old and being told, When you're 16, you get to drive it. So I put my blinders on, and I went back to work. And, then, two years ago, I began to feel the barometric pressure changing. When it was a year away, I sat bolt upright in my bed. And now. . . '' O'Brien's voice trailed off as 3 of his 15 writers arrived for their weekly meeting. ''And now, we're stuck between two worlds. We're putting on a show here while we're imagining another show there.''
 O'Brien began playing ''Dazed and Confused'' on an unplugged aqua blue electric guitar as his staff assembled. When he's not on camera in a sleek suit and tie, O'Brien nearly always wears a uniform of jeans, T-shirt and V-neck sweater in various shades of blue, brown or gray. He is skyscraper-tall, with most of his length in his legs, and his red hair rises above his forehead in an elongating airborne pouf. Because of his pale skin, freckles and college-dorm wardrobe, O'Brien, who is 46, looks boyish, but his off-camera manner is almost scholarly. He was the president of The Harvard Lampoon for two years and started his professional career as a writer for shows like ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''The Simpsons.'' O'Brien's approach to comedy and television is analytical and exact. There's a split in his psyche: he can be goofy, but he obsesses over the nuances of that goofiness. He's constantly trying to puzzle out how best to be funny five nights a week for an audience of millions.
 He learned on the job. In the early days of his show, O'Brien, who had almost no experience as a performer and was plucked from obscurity by Lorne Michaels, the producer of ''Saturday Night Live,'' was constantly at risk of cancellation. At one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to put him on a week-to-week contract. ''There were so many doubters the first year,'' says Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC Universal. ''They said Conan jumped around too much in front of the camera, that he was too smart, too East Coast, too sophisticated, too young and even too tall to be successful. But Conan proved everybody wrong. We learned that you underestimate Conan at your own peril.''
 Within a year, O'Brien began to work out a kind of comedic formula for ''Late Night.'' In addition to the usual glittering array of guests, the show combined the lewd and wacky (regulars included a masturbating bear and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog) with more elegant, narrative-driven short films (which are called remotes) in which O'Brien left the studio and reported on, say, a historic baseball league or a station in Houston that refused to carry his show at its normal hour. The apotheosis of the ''Late Night'' remotes centered on the realization in 2006 that O'Brien bears a striking resemblance to the (female) president of Finland. ''We took the show to Helsinki for five days,'' O'Brien recalled, ''where we were embraced like a national treasure.'' After that first year, his audience, which was largely young and male (a coveted demographic), grew steadily, and, for the last 15 seasons, ''Late Night'' beat all competitors. ''Lorne always says, 'The longer you're there is the longer you're there,' '' says Jeff Ross, an executive producer of ''Late Night.'' ''Meaning, if you can weather the storms -- and we had major storms -- over time other shows will disappear and you will start to seem like part of the family.'' 
 O'Brien's office was a living scrapbook of his show. Leftover props (a Hillary Clinton can opener, a Bill Clinton corkscrew) leaned against caricatures of Conan sent in by fans. There were framed photos on the walls (his wife, Liza Powel O'Brien; their two children; Johnny Carson). Above a shelf full of awards for writing hung a large cork bulletin board. The board, which was once devoted to blue index cards denoting guests and comedy bits scheduled for ''Late Night,'' had been colonized by a battalion of yellow index cards, on which were written ideas for ''The Tonight Show.'' The suggestions, most of them for remotes, offered glimpses of a new mentality: ''Conan as car valet,'' ''Conan as Mexican-wrestling star,'' ''Conan cleans pools,'' ''Conan goes canoeing on the Los Angeles River.'' Most of the ideas utilized the notion of O'Brien as an outsider, alien to the ways of Hollywood. ''Conan takes a cheerful spin on the 'Psycho' set,'' read one card; ''Conan tries to be a stunt man,'' suggested another. ''Conan has 2,318 dollars and tries to get in on the California bailout.''
 ''None of those ideas are certain yet,'' O'Brien explained, as the rest of his writers piled into his office. ''It's Darwinian on the board and Darwinian in our meetings. What I learned about this show when we were struggling is that ideas have to fight for survival.'' But before the new show could begin, ''Late Night'' needed a send-off, a proper ending. The head writer, Mike Sweeney, and his team of guys in their 30s and 40s (there were no women on the writing staff) were sprawled around the room on a beat-up sofa and stained chairs. Some were sitting on the carpeted floor. ''We have to remember that we're not going off the air forever,'' O'Brien said, playing the guitar. 
 ''You could end the show,'' Sweeney said, ''by leaving the studio and getting into a cab and saying, 'I want to go to Los Angeles,' and the driver says, 'WHAT?' '' O'Brien continued to play. He said nothing. ''How about,'' Sweeney went on, ''a locker-room celebration? Bob Costas comes into the frame and does a play by play of Conan O'Brien leaving his show.'' O'Brien shook his head. ''That's maybe a little too sketchy. We don't want to be too ha-ha.'' The room was silent. 
 ''I keep thinking of something happening at night on the street,'' O'Brien said. ''It might be nice if it didn't require dialogue. What would Jacques Tati do? What would our parents think was really funny? What has never been done?'' There was a long pause. Finally, a writer wearing an Illinois sweatshirt suggested that O'Brien casually crawl into the trunk of a car, which prompted another writer to suggest that O'Brien steal a car, and ''then we see a road sign that says, 'Los Angeles, 3,000 miles.' ''
 No one spoke. ''What if we shot three different endings,'' Sweeney finally said. ''Fake endings, rejected endings, emotional endings.'' O'Brien liked that notion. ''That's a really funny idea,'' he said. ''I don't really want to end with a joke. And I want to make sure they know I'm not retiring.'' O'Brien looked over at the corkboard. The yellow cards were beckoning. ''Why do I suddenly have 9,000 ideas about the tour bus at Universal?'' he joked. ''It's like Eskimos writing jokes that involve snow.'' He paused. ''I think we're ready to leave. We've scraped the ice cream container clean in New York. There's maybe one chocolate chip left, and it's the last show.'' 
 While O'Brien was concentrating on his final show and his plans for ''The Tonight Show,'' Jay Leno was becoming more and more unhappy about the idea of retiring from late-night television. Nearly five years ago, in September 2004, he honored NBC's wish to replace him with O'Brien. Leno made the announcement on the 50th anniversary of ''The Tonight Show,'' saying that he would exit the stage in 2009, when he would be nearly 60. ''You can do these things until they carry you out on a stretcher, or you can get out when you're still doing good,'' Leno told the audience. ''I'm not quitting show business, but I realized I'm not spending enough time with my cars.'' Leno, who has more than 100 vintage cars, which he stores in an airplane hangar in Burbank, began to reconsider his farewell two years ago. 
 ''We're still on top,'' Leno told me when I visited him at ''The Tonight Show'' in early May. Leno was dressed in a blue work shirt tucked into worn jeans, and we spoke in a small, anonymous backstage dressing room. His dark green, sharklike car (he drives a different one every day), a rare model called a Tatra, was parked right outside the studio; its exoticism provided a vivid contrast with Leno's regular-guy-ness.
 ''Five years ago,'' Leno continued, ''I think they thought we wouldn't still be on top. Back then, I said, 'Whatever you want.' I don't have an agent. I don't have a manager. If the girl doesn't want to sleep with you, that's O.K. I'm not one of those guys who says, 'Why don't you want to sleep with me?' I say, 'O.K., great -- let's be friends.' You want to make a change? That's great -- we'll make a change.''
 As he became increasingly disgruntled, Leno began entertaining offers from other networks. Although viewership on network TV is shrinking and advertising is migrating to cable and (to a lesser degree) to the Web, topical shows with comedy and celebrity guests are inexpensive to produce and maintain a consistent appeal. Leno is a name brand -- he could easily move to ABC or Fox and become O'Brien's competition, which is what NBC feared. ''It became clear that Jay wanted to continue telling jokes on television at 11:30,'' Zucker said. To entice him to stay at NBC, Zucker offered Leno a daytime show, a cable show, a series of specials. When Leno turned all those down, Zucker proposed a half-hour show, five nights a week at 8 p.m. The idea was that Leno would just do his monologue, riffing off the events of the day. ''Eight p.m. doesn't work,'' Leno explained to me. ''I never assume anyone is watching because I'm good-looking. You're selling a product. In my particular instance, the product, hopefully, is jokes. With 'The Tonight Show,' you have the jokes plus Angelina Jolie, and that's a little more enticement. A half-hour monologue every night doesn't seem like enough enticement.''
 Zucker made his final plea: an hourlong show at 10 p.m., five nights a week. To Zucker's surprise, Leno agreed. ''I have believed, for a long time, that there should be a daily prime-time program with a topical format,'' Zucker told me. ''I've never said this publicly before, but I approached Oprah Winfrey about her doing a daily hourlong show in prime time. She turned me down, but I rekindled the idea with Jay. The advantage of a show like that is it's easy to join, DVR-proof due to its topicality and different. Too much on television is the same show recycled. This will be a show that can provide an answer for the changing times we live in.''
 It's also cheap to make. ''We can do five of my new show for the cost of one 'CSI: Miami,' '' Leno bragged. ''At 10 p.m., the shows on the other networks will be about murder and killing people. I'd like to beat 'CSI' when it's in reruns. When they're on the murder for the second time, we'll be doing original shows, talking about what's happening right now.''
 Leno would not reveal how his new show would be different from ''The Tonight Show.'' He told me he didn't plan to have a desk, that the desk belongs to ''The Tonight Show.'' (''I guarantee he'll have the desk,'' says someone close to ''The Tonight Show,'' who asked not to be identified for fear of offending Leno.) And that bands will not perform on the last segment of the show because they traditionally are thought to contribute to ratings drops. ''Research tells us that the audience expects a bigger show,'' said Rick Ludwin, the NBC executive who will oversee Leno's new show and has worked with every late-show host from Carson on. ''But viewers say loud and clear, Don't change our Jay. They want that same blue-collar guy who could be their next door neighbor. That's what has made 'The Tonight Show' so popular all these years.''
 Leno's popularity will be tested at 10 p.m. Senior-level executives at NBC, who requested anonymity because they work for Zucker, say they fear that his new show will be trounced by hourlong dramas (especially on CBS) and viewers will venture elsewhere, well before 11:30 and O'Brien. Many see Leno's move to 10 p.m. as a boost for David Letterman. Leno and Letterman have been rivals since NBC chose Leno to be Johnny Carson's successor and Letterman moved to CBS. Letterman was Carson's pick -- when Carson retired, he appeared twice on Dave's show and never on Jay's -- and he's revered in the tight-knit community of comedy writers, many of whom, like O'Brien, grew up watching him. Letterman's cool irony (especially when compared with Leno's genial demeanor) can make him seem unkind, but it can also create thrilling comedy out of unexpected situtations. On Feb. 11, Letterman's interview with a heavily bearded, quasi-comatose Joaquin Phoenix not only offered up Letterman at his best but demonstrated why talk shows endure even as the TV audience becomes increasingly fragmented. By allowing Phoenix, who was unable to speak for stretches at a time, to dictate the pace of the interview, Letterman created strange, uncomfortable and riveting live television. ''When Dave is good,'' O'Brien told me the day after the Phoenix episode, ''no one is better. At moments like that, I can't touch him.''
 While Letterman is his direct competition at 11:30, O'Brien also has to contend with the double bill of Jon Stewart and, to a lesser degree, Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central. Topical humor has proved to be popular, especially with young men. That's why Zucker wanted Leno to do a nightly monologue, riffing off the events of the day, and why the network just scheduled ''Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursdays'' as a half-hour prime-time show. Last fall, during the presidential campaign, ''Weekend Update Thursdays'' specials averaged nearly two million more viewers than the Emmy Award-winning ''30 Rock,'' also on NBC. Audiences preferred to see Tina Fey as Sarah Palin rather than Tina Fey as a character on a funny sitcom. ''They want reality,'' Zucker told me.
 Similarly, last year, Stewart and Colbert reached their biggest audience ever. Their popularity may have contributed to a decline in O'Brien's ratings on ''Late Night'': he went from 2.6 million viewers in 2007 to 1.9 million in 2008. Networks, in general, are scrambling to retain audience share, but no one believes that ''The Tonight Show'' should adopt Stewart's faux-news format. ''I've always wondered why Conan lost the Emmy to Jon Stewart,'' Michaels told me ruefully. ''I think it's because they think this generation gets their news from Jon Stewart, that he's doing important work, while Conan is only doing comedy.''
 The biggest competition for ''The Tonight Show'' may come from NBC itself: Leno's continued nightly presence makes it more difficult for O'Brien to assume full ownership of the show. Their back-to-back time slots set up an inevitable comparison between O'Brien's more upscale persona and Leno's heartland approach. ''There is a reason President Obama went on with Jay to promote his plans for the economy,'' Ludwin boasted. ''It was the best way to reach the middle-class voters.'' In addition to doing his nightly show, Leno does 160 stand-up engagements a year -- usually 3 a week -- all over America, and he recently organized and performed at a free show in Detroit. ''It's the best way to take the temperature of the country,'' Leno said. ''When you live in L.A. or New York, you realize that a funny joke about the president is a smart-ass Hollywood-y joke in the rest of the country. On the show, I never called President Bush an idiot. I'd say, 'I don't think the president quite understands.' That's the sensibility of 200 miles in on either coast. And that's what tends to work for 'The Tonight Show.' ''
 The not-so-subtle message here is that O'Brien (like his time-slot adversary, Letterman) does not have Leno's cozy relationship to the Middle American viewer. While Carson deftly married sophistication, topicality, sophomoric humor and sex, today's late-night talk shows rarely have that range. In Carson's day, there were also vastly fewer choices on television -- he hosted the best dinner party around. It's much harder now, and the search for a loyal constituency (which Leno seems to have) forced NBC to scramble. 
 And yet, after waiting all these years for ''The Tonight Show'' to be his, O'Brien was surprised when Zucker told him in December that Leno would be back on the network at 10 p.m. ''My first reaction was to calculate my self-interest,'' O'Brien said a month later, over dinner at a restaurant near his apartment on the Upper West Side. ''It took me about 45 minutes of, 'Really?' I think, realistically, that Jay will be doing the same show he's doing now. I knew that there was this thing that was starting to brew that poor Jay was being pushed out by Conan. Jay was clearly becoming unhappy, and it had the makings of a situation that would make me unhappy. I like Jay. I don't want to be an unpleasant chapter in his life. Or he in mine.''
 O'Brien paused. ''What I realized is, I'm still doing 'The Tonight Show.' That was my dream. When I can't sleep and it's 3 in the morning, I'm not thinking about Jay. I'm thinking about all the things I want to do on the show. And I'm not thinking about how I'm going to change myself to fit a certain demographic. I just have to block that nonsense out. In entertainment, you have to stake out what you think is right, you have to put out that signal, make sure it's pure and then do it and do it and do it and know that they will come. And if they don't, you have to pack up your bags and say: 'I enjoyed my time here. Sorry it didn't work out.' But the biggest mistake would be to alter my signal to make sure that I reach all these different people. Because then you're lost.''
 Conan O'Brien was exhausted. It was 3:20 on Feb. 20, less than two hours before O'Brien would be taping his final ''Late Night'' show in Studio 6A, and he was pacing around his soon-to-be destroyed set, the set he lived in for the past 16 years, in a strangely calm state. ''I'm too tired to be nervous about tonight,'' he said, while friends and family sat in the studio audience and sought refuge in his dressing room. Andy Richter, O'Brien's sidekick until 2000, was sitting behind the show desk talking to Robert Smigel, the first head writer for ''Late Night'' and the man who doubles as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog. It was a reunion mixed with a wake. ''Everything big that's happened in my life has been a result of this show,'' O'Brien said. ''But now we have to go. I feel like I've been in high school for 16 years. A great high school, but it's time to graduate.''
 He huddled briefly with Jeff Ross, one of the executive producers, who was already dressed for the show in a suit and tie, and then settled behind the drum kit of the ''Late Night'' band, the Max Weinberg Seven. O'Brien began drumming as the band played ''On the Road Again.'' ''Music and comedy are so linked,'' O'Brien said earlier, as he walked up and down the halls of his offices, playing one of his many guitars. ''The rhythm of comedy is connected to the rhythm of music. They're both about creating tension and knowing when to let it go. I'm always surprised when somebody funny is not musical.'' O'Brien smiled. ''And, you know, Johnny loved to play the drums.''
 The third of six children -- ''It's the role he can't escape: Conan is always the middle child,'' Lorne Michaels said, when he heard that Leno was moving to 10 p.m. -- O'Brien grew up in Brookline, Mass., watching Johnny Carson with his father, a microbiologist. ''He would let me stay up for the monologue,'' O'Brien told me earlier. ''I was interested in this guy who made my dad laugh. In the '70s, Johnny was a harmonious place for me and my dad: the show was such an American ritual that it covered the mainstream and the counterculture. Everybody laughed at Carson -- they all watched him. I started analyzing the show then. Since I was a teenager, I have been thinking about what's funny and what's not funny almost all the time. Not much in my life has changed since I was a kid. 
 ''When all the writers are packed into Sweeney's office,'' Conan continued, ''it's very comfortable for me, because that's how I grew up. My older brothers, Neal and Luke, slept in twin beds, and I was in a cot at the foot of their beds. I loved it. When you're Irish Catholic, you learn to do comedy at the foot of your brothers' beds. It's all about trying to make your family laugh. And I employ the same muscle today. It's just that now I make a living out of it.''
 O'Brien wrote his thesis at Harvard on Flannery O'Connor and William Faulkner (''Let's just say that during my discussions with Pauly Shore, it doesn't come up much''), and in 1983 and '84 he was elected president of The Harvard Lampoon for a rare two consecutive terms. After graduation in 1985, O'Brien and Greg Daniels (who went on to produce ''The Office'' for NBC) became writing partners and moved to Los Angeles. They immediately got a job on HBO's ''Not Necessarily the News.'' ''Greg Daniels and I were shackled together like 'The Defiant Ones,' '' O'Brien recalled. ''We shared an apartment, a car and an office with iron desks that faced each other. You quickly become a married couple. If one of us had a chance at having a date, we would have to ask the other to borrow the car.'' While he was writing for television, O'Brien began performing with the Groundlings, a comedy troupe in Los Angeles that jump-started the careers of, among others, Pee-wee Herman and Will Ferrell. In 1988, he moved East to write for ''Saturday Night Live,'' and in 1991, he moved West again to work on ''The Simpsons.'' With his 30th birthday approaching, O'Brien decided he wanted to reinvent himself as a performer. He got a new agent, Gavin Polone (who is now his manager), and he began thinking about hosting a talk show. I met O'Brien around this time; he was well regarded as a writer in the concentric comedy circles of ''SNL,'' ''The Simpsons'' and ''Seinfeld,'' but he had virtually no experience performing on television. It was audacious to think that he could host a nightly show. He had never even been a head writer. 
 And then, on April 26, 1992, after a whirlwind courtship, O'Brien was picked to replace David Letterman. ''It's fair to say that it was unprecedented,'' Lorne Michaels told me, calling from his office one evening. Michaels was obligated, as an executive producer, to find the ''Late Night'' host (just as he eventually picked Jimmy Fallon to replace O'Brien). ''I liked that Conan was young, intelligent and that he had, like Johnny Carson, good manners. A good host always obeys the rules of hospitality, and Conan has an essential decency and work ethic that were obvious from the start. Sadly, talent and character do not often reside in the same person, but they do in Conan. And that was never more evident than when his show was fighting for its life.''
 Critics attacked him (Tom Shales suggested in The Washington Post that ''the host resume his previous identity, Conan O'Blivion''), and the NBC executives were anxious to replace him with Greg Kinnear, who was on the network at 1:30 a.m. ''One executive,'' O'Brien recalled, ''particularly despised Andy [Richter]. He told me I'd never succeed until I 'got rid of that big fat dildo.' That was the tone of the conversations between us and the network.''
 Slowly, things improved. Kinnear didn't want the job (he left hosting to become an actor), and there were no easy replacements for O'Brien. That bought him time. Stars like Tom Hanks agreed to appear on ''Late Night,'' which boosted audience awareness. Even Letterman, who admired O'Brien's comic sensibility, came on to register his support. Mostly, though, O'Brien's performance improved. ''Conan always knew he had the product,'' Leno told me. ''He said it kind of dopey, but what he was saying was clever and smart. And then he learned how to say it well.''
 He never quit. One key to O'Brien's character is his quiet confidence that if he applies himself, he will eventually succeed. He's not arrogant, but he's willing to live and breathe the show. ''The thing that saved my life was that I didn't really know what I was in for,'' O'Brien said, an hour before taping his last show. ''If they had explained to me exactly what was involved, I might have run. But I did not want to fail. And now I'm addicted to the feeling of what it's like to do a good show. There are 35 variables every night -- what comedy do we have? What's the audience like? Who are the guests? What time of year is it? What's my mood? You need 15 cherries to line up to pay out the jackpot. And, every now and then, the stars align. And you keep chasing after that feeling.''
 O'Brien ran off -- he needed to check on Will Ferrell, who was appearing on the show as George W. Bush that night and was also rehearsing a kind of striptease. His parents and his older brother Luke had arrived from Boston, and they were waiting with Conan's wife, Liza, in his dressing room. O'Brien met his wife through ''Late Night.'' In 2000, he was doing a remote at the ad agency where she worked. After the segment was taped, O'Brien asked Sweeney to make certain that he compiled everyone's name and address. ''It's the blonde, isn't it?'' Sweeney replied. 
 ''I immediately knew Liza was the one,'' O'Brien told me earlier. ''I couldn't say, Oh no, I'm not ready -- I need to be with a few drug-addicted supermodels with rage issues. It's my nature to be the opposite of a self-destructive person: something inside of me usually makes me do the right thing.'' This applies to the show as well. Unlike Letterman and Carson, O'Brien doesn't seem to have a dark side. His humor is not mean -- he'd rather laugh with the audience than at them. And unlike Stewart, he's not on TV to educate through mockery. It's impossible, for instance, to imagine O'Brien sparring with someone like Jim Cramer, the CNBC money guru, as Stewart recently did. O'Brien is too respectful to be angry; like Leno, he works hard to be polite. 
 Which is why, despite many meetings and dozens of pitched ideas, the last ''Late Night'' did not finish with a comedy bit. Instead, O'Brien spent 11 minutes thanking his staff, his family and, particularly, Lorne Michaels for believing in him. He singled out David Letterman's comic genius and enormous influence while politely, dutifully, thanking Leno for his ''support.'' O'Brien was choking back tears and he only briefly attended the crowded after-party in Studio 8H. Jeff Zucker was there with O'Brien's agent, Rick Rosen. ''I'm going to have to lay off 10 people to pay for this party,'' Zucker said, as he popped a caviar-and-blini hors d'oeuvre into his mouth. He was half-joking. ''Conan better be a success at 11:30.''
 In the kitchen of O'Brien's new house in Los Angeles, there is a map of America that he clipped from USA Today. Crisscrossing lines connect cities coast to coast. ''That's what I've been doing for the past two months,'' O'Brien said. ''I moved to Los Angeles on March 9, and I've only slept here two nights in three weeks.'' It was an evening in early April, and Conan, Liza, their two children, Beckett and Neve, and the golden retriever, Bosco, were having dinner (Liza prepared lasagna with a green salad and fruit for dessert) at home. Knowing that they would be moving in 2009, they bought a brand-new house in West Los Angeles more than a year ago. The many huge rooms, most of which have double-height ceilings, are sparsely furnished with overstuffed sofas and chairs. The walk-in closets are so spacious that Conan has an elliptical trainer in his and Liza has a desk in hers. Naturally, there's a pool in the backyard, and I lost count at four guest rooms and three dens. ''I have moments of 'Whose life is this?' '' O'Brien said as he gave me a tour. ''I get up in this house, I get in my car and I drive to work, and it's like I've adopted a new personality. A lot of the early stage of the show will probably play off my feeling of being on the moon.'' O'Brien sat down at the kitchen table, where he had placed the USA Today map. ''That's why, as nice as this is, it was so important that I went to see the affiliates. It's good to remember that 'The Tonight Show' is not just shown in New York and L.A.''
 Network television comprises a web of stations that have pledged their allegiance to a particular company and its programming slate. ''There really is no NBC,'' Leno told me. ''There are the affiliates that own NBC. So, you go see them and say, 'Hey, here's what I plan to do.' And they say, 'We like you.' America's a football -- whoever controls the ball, controls the game.''
 Leno speaks from experience. In 1992, NBC gave him ''The Tonight Show'' over David Letterman partly because he had the staunch backing of the affiliates. (He visited them; Letterman didn't.) Wooing the affiliates is not unlike garnering support during a presidential campaign, with particular attention paid to the cities and states that don't understand or favor the candidate on offer. ''They never really liked Conan in the Southeast,'' Rick Ludwin said. ''And we strongly suggested that he visit those stations.'' 
 Even before ''Late Night'' ended, O'Brien was doing two shows on Thursday and flying on Friday to meet the affiliates. He'd visit two cities a day, often with Jeff Ross, who will be the executive producer of ''The Tonight Show.'' ''I felt like Lyndon Johnson in the hill country, running a grass-roots campaign,'' O'Brien said, as his daughter came to say goodnight. ''In places like Oklahoma City, everyone was wearing Conan wigs and they brought a Clydesdale out of a truck. I grabbed a cowboy hat and rode in circles in front of the station. There were cheerleaders doing cheers for me and banners with my name on them. I kept thinking, I came into show business through the back door of 'S.N.L.' and 'The Simpsons,' and now I'm in the carnival. Which I love. If you want to host 'The Tonight Show,' you need to go to Kansas City and Cleveland and Milwaukee and San Jose and Oklahoma City. There's something about the show that does belong to those people.''
 In most cities, he made a regular stump speech about watching Johnny Carson with his father and how much the show mattered to him. In early April, the NBC affiliate in Boston dropped a bombshell: they did not want to carry Leno's new 10 p.m. show. Instead, they would put on the local news. NBC reacted immediately, threatening to strip the station of its network affiliation. ''They had to be aggressive,'' said Jeff Ross. ''They couldn't risk a trend.'' After a heated two-week battle, the network prevailed: Leno's 10 p.m. show will now be shown in Boston. Interestingly, Leno made an appearance in Boston during the two-week dispute. ''Don't bitch and moan,'' he told me. ''Do something if you want the ball back.''
 On his affiliate tour, O'Brien never visited Boston; it was considered a reliable city for him. ''I'm sure I'll end up going,'' he said. ''But there's work to do here.'' It was less than two months before ''The Tonight Show'' would have its June 1 premiere, and O'Brien knew he had to establish his show with a new 11:30 audience before Leno began broadcasting in September. ''The anticipation of doing the show is getting hard,'' he continued. ''I have to talk about things endlessly rather than doing them. It's all buildup. I need to get back to a room full of writers and come up with ideas. I need to actually do the show.''
 Around the same time that Conan O'Brien was named the next host of ''The Tonight Show,'' General Electric, NBC's parent company, purchased Vivendi Universal Entertainment and fused the two divisions. A newly hatched NBC Universal moved most of its West Coast operations from Burbank to Universal City. This means that the new ''The Tonight Show'' will not hail, as it did for decades, from Burbank. ''I was worried that we would be the least-exciting attraction at the Universal theme park,'' O'Brien said in late April, as he stood outside his new offices. The nondescript five-story building was constructed for ''The Tonight Show'' on what was once a parking lot. The offices are connected to an existing soundstage, which will house the studio. ''In 1961, Jack Benny filmed his show here,'' O'Brien said, pointing to his new home. ''And then, in the '80s, 'Knight Rider' was shot here. But I prefer to associate with Benny.'' O'Brien walked toward the soundstage. ''They wanted to put my name on the building, but Rule No. 1 in Hollywood is don't put your name on anything,'' O'Brien said. ''All I imagine is them putting my name in cement and then having to jackhammer it out.''
 The Universal lot could not be more different from Rockefeller Center. Located in the San Fernando Valley, Universal is an old-fashioned working back lot, where Spielberg (and others) still shoot parts of their movies. Where Rockefeller Center, in all its deco splendor and history, is urban, charmingly chaotic and rather cavelike, Universal is vast and sunny and seems to have been designed by dozens of architects with no interest in comparing notes. There are low bungalows that look as if they belong to silent-film stars next to office buildings that resemble swinging-singles apartment complexes from the '70s.
 The show's offices, which are just inside the studio's gates, are completely generic. ''I wanted it that way,'' O'Brien said, as he took the elevator to the fourth floor and walked down the hall to his new home. ''I said, I don't want a desk made of onyx and baboon skulls.'' He shipped his old metal desk from his New York office; the same cork bulletin board that hung there was mounted on the wall here. The color coding has changed: yellow index cards now connote comedy ideas; blue, possibilities for remotes; white, material for O'Brien to perform at the desk; and each pink card, the name of a scheduled guest. The lineup for the first show, on June 1, was set: Will Ferrell and Pearl Jam. (Interestingly, O'Brien will be Leno's guest on his last show.)
 Ideas were starting to take shape, too, many of them inspired by the back lot itself. ''Jaws'' was a huge hit for Universal, and one writer suggested that Bruce, the mechanical shark, could occasionally drop by the show. ''In our mind, he sounds like Paul Lynde,'' O'Brien explained. ''He dishes dirt about his co-stars.'' The show had an exact replica of O'Brien's desk built onto the front of a golf cart and, later that day, O'Brien was scheduled to take a short road trip through the studio. ''We're going to drive up to the 'Psycho' house and try and interview Norman Bates at the desk,'' O'Brien said. ''And maybe we'll take a break during 1869 in Western Town. And then we'll swing by the 'Desperate Housewives' set and try to see Eva Longoria in her trailer for an interview.
 For O'Brien, the open landscape of California may be both inspiring and isolating. In his ''Late Night'' show in New York, O'Brien was able to define himself as a smart outsider, but ''The Tonight Show'' is, by its nature, a different game for a different crowd. Traditionally, it has mirrored the mood of the country. ''Johnny's the one I look back to,'' O'Brien continued. ''The constant is Johnny. He was very sophisticated, but he was also a clown. As a kid, I was fascinated by the fact that while he was clearly the coolest guy in America, he could dress up like an old woman or have a raccoon crawl on his head. He surrendered his dignity, and it only made him cooler. There aren't a lot of hosts who will put on a skimpy bathing suit and jump into a hot tub with Don Rickles.'' O'Brien picked up a guitar. ''When I first got 'Late Night,' '' he said, ''I was whisked to John Cheever Connecticut to a 50th birthday party for Bob Wright, who was then the head of NBC. They said, 'We want you to get up and be funny.' And then I realized that Johnny Carson was there, too. I was petrified. Johnny was wearing dark glasses and he was ramrod straight and perfectly coiffed. He was very shy. I wanted to kill myself. And I had to go first. I had prepared a thing -- the idea was I didn't know who Bob Wright was -- and it worked. People really laughed. And Johnny nodded. Then he got up, made his toast and blew the roof off the place. Afterward, he came over to me and said, 'Good luck to you.' He said, 'Just be yourself -- that's the only way it can work.' '' O'Brien paused, ''There's an opportunity to put my stamp on this show. I've got an ego, and I want to do my 'Tonight Show.' ''
 O'Brien was interrupted by Jeff Ross, who wanted him to go downstairs to the stage. When the set was being designed, O'Brien's main concern was that the space not feel too big. ''We want to have a parade of elephants if we need it,'' Ross explained as we went through the stage doors, ''but we still want the audience to feel like they're close to Conan.'' These decisions matter: for the first two years of Leno's tenure, Letterman was regularly beating him. Then Leno changed studios, switching from Carson's old arrangement, which put him at a distance from the audience, to a closer configuration. As a stand-up comedian, Leno played more to the crowd and needed to see faces. It may have been a coincidence or a national change in taste, but when he altered his set, Leno started to win in the ratings. And then, in 1995, Hugh Grant was arrested for soliciting a prostitute and didn't cancel his ''Tonight Show'' booking. When an abashed Grant sat down, Leno asked, ''What the hell were you thinking?'' There was a huge laugh, and ratings soared. From then on, Leno was No. 1. 
 ''Do you think it was the set or Hugh?'' I asked Ross. 
 ''Well,'' he said, ''I couldn't come up with five names living that will guarantee a rating. News-generated guests will be big, but everything has been diluted by the entertainment shows. Everyone is everywhere four or five times a day. So unless you have a sitting president like Barack Obama on, or a big scandal, you're better off with a set that helps.''
 The new ''Tonight Show'' set has the usual elements: band shell stage left, desk stage right and a mesh curtain made of metal in the center. But the curtain is curved and, like the rest of the set, is deco in style. It evokes the mood of 30 Rockefeller Plaza but is much grander than O'Brien's former set in Studio 6A. There are nearly double the number of seats, and there are many more lights flashing. ''I liked the set,'' Lorne Michaels told me later, ''but I wonder if it's the movie version of a talk show.''
 As he wandered around the stage, O'Brien looked comfortable, at home. ''The hardest thing in L.A. is a destination,'' he said. ''I'm spoiled. I've had the destination in New York: Rockefeller Center. It's the high temple of American TV, and we were smack-dab in the middle of it. L.A. is different. Everything can feel like the lunar landscape out here.''
 He paced around the set. The set wasn't finished: there were at least 25 workers installing lights or checking plans or hammering. ''I'm happy when I'm in the studio,'' O'Brien said. ''I'm eating my meals here now.'' O'Brien's desk wasn't finished yet, and there were three folding chairs where the guests would be. ''I miss doing the show,'' he said. ''I miss the audience. The other day, I was at my daughter's school to read to the kids, and I started acting out all the characters. I ran into Liza on my way out, and she said, 'How did it go?' I said, 'I killed in there!' She looked at me and said: 'They're a bunch of 4-year-olds. You're just supposed to read the book.' '' 
 O'Brien laughed. He walked over to an X that had been taped to the floor. When the show starts, that will be where he'll stand when he emerges from the curtain to address the audience. ''I come here at night, after everyone's gone home, and I practice giving the monologue,'' he said. ''Every night. For hours. I just stand on the X and imagine the rest.''

HEADLINE: When 'Affordable' Is Still Out of Reach

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
IN the current skittish housing market, even some homes in the city's affordable-housing programs, normally in such great demand that the buyers are chosen through lotteries, have not sold out. This is leading developers to put $282,000 one-bedrooms in Harlem and $323,840 studios in downtown Brooklyn on the open market.
 Dozens of these units will now be sold by the developers on a first-come-first-served basis, although buyers still must meet the city's income and resale restrictions. 
 City officials and brokers say that while such affordable units are usually snapped up, they have lingered because the thousands of people who entered lotteries for the homes either decided that now was not the time to buy or simply could not find lenders that would give them mortgages to close their deals.
 There are at least 45 affordable units on the open market. That total is higher than it has been in previous years, according to Seth McM. Donlin, a spokesman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. ''We think it's largely related to the current market and has to do with people's ability to find financing,'' he said.
 The affordable units have significant discounts from market rates. For instance, at Beacon Towers, an eight-story condominium in Harlem, the affordable units are selling for $282,000 to $424,000, while the market-rate units are asking $399,000 to $575,000.
 City programs generally allow buyers to make a down payment as low as 5 to 10 percent of the purchase price, he said. But since most banks are now requiring down payments of 20 percent or more, some people who have qualified for units and have been assigned them have had to walk away because they cannot come up with the cash for much larger down payments.
 ''Many of the units have ended up going to the open market because of a change in lending practices from the time people entered the lotteries and the time when the units were ready to close,'' Mr. Donlin said.
 The available affordable units range from single-family homes on Staten Island for $235,000 to one-bedroom condominiums in downtown Brooklyn for $464,370. The prices are not negotiable, although in some cases the developers might be offering other concessions.
 The buildings carry annual income restrictions that range from $88,320 to $192,000 per household, depending on the property. Resale restrictions require the homeowners to pay the city a gradually diminishing portion of the sale price if they sell the property within 20 years of the original purchase.
 Halstead Property is marketing 22 one- or two-bedrooms at Beacon Towers; two one-bedrooms at the Langston, a condo in Hamilton Heights; and five studios and one-bedrooms at Toren, a 38-story tower in downtown Brooklyn.
 Stephen G. Kliegerman, the executive director of development marketing at Halstead, says that in general there is widespread interest in the affordable-housing program, but that sometimes there is a lack of applicants for a specific development or a shortage of applicants who actually qualify.
 For the buildings now being offered, however, there certainly was plenty of interest when the city held its lotteries in the last year or two. Beacon Towers had more than 2,000 applicants for a total of 54 affordable units; the Langston had nearly 9,000 applicants for 121 affordable units; and Toren had about 2,000 applicants for 42 affordable units.
 Mr. Kliegerman said he expected more affordable units to come on the open market in the future. (The attraction for builders is that they can wind up getting direct or indirect subsidies toward development costs.) ''There are a lot more affordable units coming up,'' he said, ''and with the market more challenged than in the past, it's not just the fair-market-rate apartments that are lingering. Some of the affordable are lingering too.''
 Beth Berns, a vice president of the New York City Housing Partnership, a nonprofit agency that works with the city to create middle-income housing, also blamed the economy for the increased number of affordable units coming on the open market. 
 This year, she said, potential homeowners are very wary of extending themselves financially. ''People at all ends of the market are a little bit shy to go back in the water to buy a home,'' she said.
 The affordable units can be found on Halstead's Web site: www.halsteadpdm.com/sales/. They are also on New York City's Web site: www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/buyers/lotteries.shtml.

HEADLINE: Turning the Infrastructure Into Profits

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
WANT to buy a bridge, or at least invest in a company that builds one? (No, that bridge is still not for sale.)
 As they search for better returns, more investors are discovering that the road to riches could lie in the vast global infrastructure: an assortment of companies that build or manage highways and tunnels, water and waste systems, parking garages, airports and other properties. These rather obscure investments offer predictable cash flow, largely impervious to economic and market fluctuations. 
 Big institutions like pension funds are putting money into private funds and looking into direct investments in projects. But even individual investors are finding a number of options, many of them fairly new, through private equity funds, separately managed accounts and limited partnerships, along with exchange-traded and mutual funds.
 There are also shares of infrastructure-related companies, including businesses involved in public works projects and suppliers of building materials. And industry analysts say it's only a matter of time before infrastructure real estate investment trusts are formed. 
 Money managers say demand is rising. ''There's a tremendous amount of interest right now; a lot of investors have noticed strong attributes of infrastructure investing,'' said Jay L. Rosenberg, the portfolio manager for the First American Global Infrastructure fund, a mutual fund that was rolled out in late 2007 to institutional investors and opened to individuals last summer. 
 The Morgan Stanley Global Infrastructure fund was also recently opened to the public after raising $4 billion from institutions and high-net-worth individuals, far exceeding its original target.
 Michael D. Underhill, the chief executive of Capital Innovations, an investment firm in Hartland, Wis., that oversees $2.5 billion in infrastructure-focused investments, says that people are searching for bright spots in an otherwise dim investment climate. ''They are evaluating every asset in their portfolio, trying to find ways to generate some performance,'' he said. ''Sewage and power plants weren't sexy -- now they're called infrastructure and everyone's interested in it.''
 Citing data from Standard & Poor's, Mr. Underhill noted that infrastructure stocks had an annualized return of 10.86 percent from Nov. 30, 2001, through Dec. 31, 2008, versus 0.83 percent, annualized, for common stocks in general and 6.52 percent for bonds.
 Returns, though, have been less than stellar so far this year. Share prices of the First American Global Infrastructure fund, for example, were off 0.6 percent from the first of the year through last Thursday, while the iShares S.& P. Global Infrastructure Index fund, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S.& P. Global Infrastructure Index, was down about 6 percent. 
 Many money managers see infrastructure as a sort of nascent asset class, beyond the realm of commercial real estate. (Also included in the mix are transportation as well as energy and Internet grids.) For the most part, ''it has a low correlation to common stocks, bonds and other assets,'' said Mr. Underhill, whose first book, ''Handbook of Infrastructure Investing,'' is scheduled to be published next year by John Wiley & Sons. 
 And they see potential for tremendous growth as the need to maintain and improve aging and dilapidated facilities becomes more imperative. A recent report by CIBC World Marketsin Toronto predicts that global spending on infrastructure could reach $35 trillion over the next 20 years. 
 ''Much of the infrastructure in the developed world was built 40 or 50 years ago, and they have 30-, 40-, or 50-year life spans,'' said Craig Noble, a portfolio manager at Brookfield Redding, which focuses on infrastructure. The company runs the Brookfield Redding Global Infrastructure fund, which made its debut last year and is distributed through the AIC Mutual Fund Company. 
 In the United States, $50 billion to $85 billion of the $787 billion economic stimulus package has been earmarked toward infrastructure spending. 
 Industry experts, however, say that much more is needed to get the country's bridges, roads and other systems up to acceptable levels. The American Society of Civil Engineers -- which this year gave the nation's infrastructure an overall grade of ''D,'' unchanged from the last report card, in 2005 -- puts that number at $2.2 trillion over the next five years. 
 Budgetary constraints and tight credit markets are likely to make financing future projects harder for many states and municipalities. One solution, said Howard Roth, a partner in global real estate at Ernst & Young, is for governments to forge partnerships with the private sector; such arrangements have become commonplace in Australia and Europe, and are only now taking hold in the United States. 
 ''We're just in the beginning stages of private capital ownership outside the public sector,'' said Mr. Roth, whose firm released a report with the Urban Land Institute calling for improved infrastructure to maintain a competitive edge. ''The huge funding gaps that most states have creates a clear economic need for other sources of capital.''
 At the end of last year, there were 15 roads in 10 states in private hands, according to a recent report by the Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, and an additional 79 roads in 25 states are under consideration for some form of privatization. 
 Chicago was the first American government entity to lease an existing toll road to private investors. Four years ago, the city agreed to turn over the 7.8-mile Chicago Skyway toll bridge system to a joint venture of the Macquarie Infrastructure Group of Australia and the Spanish company Cintra (short for Cintra Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte) for 99 years in exchange for $1.83 billion. The consortium keeps all toll revenue, and in return, is responsible for maintenance, improvements and other operating costs. 
 Cintra has other partnerships, including road projects announced this year -- a portion of Interstate 635 in Dallas, and, nearby, a project involving a segment of the North Tarrant Expressway. The Dallas Police and Fire Pension System is an equity partner in those two projects. Cintra was also granted a lease-concession contract for portions of State Highway 130 near Austin, Tex. 
 Grupo Ferrovial holds a majority stake in Cintra. 
 Many infrastructure funds offered in this country are chock-full of international companies like Cintra. Among the other commonly held holdings is Abertis Infraestructuras, a Spanish company that builds and operates toll roads. The company makes up part of the portfolio of the Kensington Global Infrastructure fund and the iShares S.& P. Global Infrastructure Index Fund, the E.T.F., as does the Transurban Group of Australia, a toll road developer and investor.
 Mr. Rosenberg also favors Transurban. ''The company owns assets around the world; they are mature assets, which really provides stability during the downturn,'' he said. He likes the French airport operator Aeroports de Paris, and his portfolio includes Digital Realty Trust, a REIT that owns and operates buildings that house data centers, which some consider part of the infrastructure domain.
 Another infrastructure E.T.F., the First Trust ISE Global Engineering & Construction Index fund, meanwhile, includes companies engaged in large public- and private-sector infrastructure projects. The largest holdings include Vinci of France, a building and civil engineering firm; Group ACS (or Actividades de Construccion & Servicios), a Spanish company whose principal activities include the development, construction and management of infrastructures; and Leighton Holdings, the Australian developer.
 Although infrastructure hasn't been entirely immune from the financial market crisis, Mr. Noble, the manager of the Brookfield Redding infrastructure fund, says that these companies are likely to perform well, in part because of the money allocated to various ventures worldwide and because infrastructure projects ''have a higher barrier to entry,'' which means that there are often obstacles to new development.
 ''With an office building, there's obvious competition,'' he said, ''but the likelihood of a competing road being built is very low.''

HEADLINE: In Hollywood, Lace and Velvet Along With Bukowski and Liszt

BYLINE: By SAMANTHA BONAR

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 INCONGRUOUSLY planted next to a Borders Books and Music on Vine Street, an easily missed neon sign optimistically announces Ivan Kane's Cafe Wa s. (It originally read ''Cafe Always Open,'' but only the red W, A and S still lighted up when Ivan Kane, the owner, unearthed it from a ''neon graveyard'' in Las Vegas.) 
 Stepping over Angela Lansbury's Walk of Fame star into the steel-and-concrete former Schwab's is somewhat akin to falling down the rabbit hole, if it was in New Orleans Square in Disneyland. The French-bistro-style cafe's interior is a bohemian burst of vintage forest-green wallpaper, artfully torn, featuring a pair of strolling Parisian poodles; fringed silk lampshades; old gilded mirrors; thick velvet curtains over black lace sheers; sooty wrought-iron railings; black lacquer tables, and red velvet booths. A painting of the composer Franz Liszt is placed on its side over the doorway leading to the (Charles) Bukowski Lounge, its walls haphazardly papered with pages from his novels. A staircase leads nowhere, and balconies are alight with candles. One might call the look shabby-chic bordello. 
 Mr. Kane also created the Forty Deuce burlesque nightclubs in Hollywood and Las Vegas, and the clubs Kane and Deep in Los Angeles, which are all now closed. In a nod to the economy, his new club offers ''flask service'' in place of the once-popular bottle service, serving hard liquor bottles in brown paper bags. 
 The center of the space, which opened in Hollywood in September, is dominated by a slowly revolving 1924 Mason & Hamlin grand piano. The live music makes it seem like a ''cool, New York-y jazz club'' said Amy Rocha, 29, a public relations executive dining on crab cakes and beet salad with three girlfriends. ''It's more of an adult Hollywood club.'' 
 But the ivory-tickling displeased a pair from San Diego sitting in the mezzanine bar sipping absinthe cocktails. ''It reminds me of Nordstrom's or a cruise ship,'' said one of them, Susan Sutton, 45, a registered nurse. The two planned to abandon the joint after finishing their drinks. This would have been impossible on a cruise ship.
 When the pianist takes a break, a not-too-imaginative classic rock and jazz selection -- Dylan, the Grateful Dead, the Stones, the Animals, John Coltrane, Leonard Cohen, Radiohead -- plays over the sound system.
 ''When I heard they had souffle, I was very excited to come,'' said Rosie Pondeva, 21, a journalism student at California State University, Northridge. ''It's a nice, relaxing atmosphere.'' 
 The food may take a little too much of a Frenchified turn for those grossed out by frog-leg drumsticks and spongy fried brains. 
 Hemingway famously called Paris a moveable feast, but who knew it could pop up down the street from Smoothie King and Game Stop?

OUTPOSTS On a day not long after Californians showed they may be ready to pull the plug on the bankrupt citizen-democracy they have created, it's worth going back a few years to a moment when this divorce could have been predicted. 
 The prison guards' union, having swelled its well-paid ranks after voter mandates helped to produce a system where 750,000 Californians are either locked up, on parole or on probation, was upset at Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger for balking at their demands. The union trolled a billboard around town of a nearly naked and decidedly unbuff Governator in a thong. That'll show him who's the girly man.
 With overtime, some guards now make $100,000 annually. Every year, enough people to fill three Dodger Stadiums apply for jobs in California incarceration, the fastest-growing public expense. This spring, trying to keep the prison guards and other state workers from taking to the streets with cuts from a $21 billion deficit, the governor said voters had to pass emergency budget measures or the state would become ''a poster child for dysfunction.''
 It already is. Yawn. And so an extraordinarily small number of voters showed up Tuesday to add to the mess. The vote gave all sides something to sneer at. 
 -- TIMOTHY EGAN, from
 ''California Will Survive Its Crackup''
 THE WILD SIDE The mathematics of cities was launched in 1949 when George Zipf, a linguist at Harvard, noticed that if you tabulate the biggest cities in a given country and rank them according to populations, the largest city is always about twice as big as the second largest, and three times as big as the third largest, and so on. In other words, the population of a city is approximately inversely proportional to its rank. Why this should be true, no one knows.
 The newest inquiries into the mathematics of cities have to do with how city size affects other things we care about, like the amount of infrastructure needed to keep a city going.
 For instance, if one city is 10 times as populous as another one, does it need 10 times as many gas stations? No. The bigger a city is, the fewer gas stations it has per person. Put simply, bigger cities enjoy economies of scale. In this sense, bigger is greener. The same pattern holds for other measures of infrastructure.
 Now comes the spooky part. The same law is true for living things. That is, if you mentally replace cities with organisms and city size with body weight, the mathematical pattern remains the same. On a pound for pound basis, the cells of an elephant consume far less energy than those of a mouse.
 -- STEVEN STROGATZ,
 from ''Math and the City''

HEADLINE: For This Guru, No Question Is Too Big

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

DATELINE: Boulder, Colo. 

 BODY:
 JIM COLLINS calls his third-floor offices in the heart of this mountain-ringed city a ''management lab.'' But little distinguishes his workspace from most others, save for a few things. 
 There is, for example, the small sign outside the door: ''ChimpWorks.'' In case anybody doesn't get the point, a large Curious George doll sits in a leather chair, delivering the we-ask-a-lot-of-questions-here punch line. And in a corner of the white board at the end of his long conference room, Mr. Collins keeps this short list: 
 Creative 53%
 Teaching 28% 
 Other 19%
 That, he explains, is a running tally of how he's spending his time, and whether he's sticking to a big goal he set for himself years ago: to spend 50 percent of his workdays on creative pursuits like research and writing books, 30 percent on teaching-related activities, and 20 percent on all the other things he has to do. 
 These aren't ballpark guesstimates. Mr. Collins, who is 51, keeps a stopwatch with three separate timers in his pocket at all times, stopping and starting them as he switches activities. Then he regularly logs the times into a spreadsheet. 
 He has a good jump, too, on another overarching goal he's set for himself: to produce a lasting and distinctive body of work. 
 Within the sprawling and overpopulated world of self-styled gurus dispensing advice on management and leadership, Mr. Collins is in rare company. His last two books -- ''Built to Last'' and ''Good to Great'' -- were breakout hits, selling about seven million copies combined.
 Rather than presenting silver-bullet formulas that are easily forgotten, Mr. Collins's books offer tangible frameworks for understanding why organizations succeed. His winning streak is about to be tested with his just-released book, which takes a turn, as he says, to the ''dark side,'' focusing on why companies fail. At any other time, it would seem a long shot, in that it lacks the upbeat message of his previous books. But his timing, given the number of once-great companies now in ruin, couldn't have been better. 
 It seems that Mr. Collins, for all his exacting approaches to time management and research, has been blessed with something he cannot control: repeated bouts of flat-out luck.
 He started researching his new book, titled ''How the Mighty Fall: And Why Some Companies Never Give In,'' in 2005. Back then, the Dow Jones index had passed 10,000 and was still climbing, eventually to more than 14,000, and Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, General Motors and Fannie Mae still had bright futures. 
 Now the stages of decline that he maps out in the book -- hubris born of success; undisciplined pursuit of more; denial of risk and peril; grasping for salvation with a quick, big solution; and capitulation to irrelevance or death -- offer a kind of instant autopsy for an economy on the stretcher. 
 He writes that he's come to see institutional decline as a ''staged disease'' -- harder to detect but easier to cure in the early stages -- which is likely to foster a sense of corporate hypochondria in many readers. 
 He started working on his previous book, ''Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap ... and Others Don't,'' in the mid-1990s, smack in the middle of New Economy fever. 
 ''Good to Great'' was finally published in late 2001 -- not long after the dot-com bubble burst, the pixie dust surrounding visionary leaders had fallen away, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks shook the country to its core. The book struck a chord with its back-to-basics message: Quiet but determined leaders who remained focused on clear and simple goals were the real success stories of corporate America.
 It won a following, about four million copies' worth, that extended well beyond the business world and included football coaches, pastors and school principals.
 ''We were really slow, and so it comes out right after everything is falling apart,'' Mr. Collins recalls. ''If we had come out in 1998, I don't think anyone would have read it.''
 His first best seller, ''Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies,'' another five-year project, which he co-wrote with Jerry I. Porras, came out in 1994, on the heels of the re-engineering craze in corporate America; it also went on to sell millions of copies. 
 And his next book, which he is writing with Morten T. Hansen and is due out in two or three years, is about why certain companies manage to thrive through tumultuous times. 
 ''I think it's just pure luck,'' says Mr. Collins, parsing his track record in an interview here. ''You flip a coin and it comes up heads, and you flip a coin and it comes up heads, and you flip a coin and it comes up heads, and one day you have four heads in a row. You can't really say you made it come up heads.''
 But it's not all luck, of course.
 PART of the Jim Collins method borrows from other hypersuccessful people. He approaches every aspect of his life with purpose and intensity.
 Consider a few examples.
 Four days after his first date with Joanne Ernst in the spring of 1980 -- an eight-mile run when both were students at Stanford -- they were engaged, and married later that year.
 When she announced over breakfast one day that she thought she could win an Ironman Triathlon, Mr. Collins gave up his job at Hewlett-Packard to help her train, be her roadie and negotiate her sponsorships with companies like Nike and Budweiser. Joanne won the 1985 Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon. 
 Back then, he says, his wife was the better-known half of the couple, and everyone assumed that his name was Jim Ernst. 
 For his 50th birthday -- his ''gift to myself,'' as he put it -- Mr. Collins, a lifelong climber, trained for 18 months to try a climb El Capitan, the 3,000-foot vertical rock formation in Yosemite National Park. 
 Most climbers take a few days for the ascent. He wanted to do it in less than 24 hours. So he trained with a younger, stronger partner. He studied weather patterns at Yosemite going back almost 100 years to figure out the best window for an attempt. They climbed the first 1,400 feet in the dark, and completed the ascent in 19 hours.
 Oh, he sleeps with vigor, too. He figures that he needs to get 70 to 75 hours of sleep every 10 days, and once went to a sleep lab to learn more about his own patterns. Now -- surprise, surprise -- he logs his time spent on a pillow, naps included, and monitors a rolling average. 
 ''If I start falling below that,'' he says, pointing to the short list on his whiteboard, ''I can still teach and do 'other,' but I can't create.'' 
 Mr. Hansen, his co-author on the current turbulence project, occasionally teases Mr. Collins about his relentless self-improvement. 
 ''I always laugh about the sleep log,'' he says.
 Mr. Collins also is quite practiced at saying ''no.'' Requests pour in every week for him to give speeches to corporations and trade associations. It could be a bustling sideline, given that he commands a top-tier fee of $65,000 to dispense his wisdom. But he will give only 18 speeches this year, and about a third of them will be pro bono for nonprofit groups.
 Companies also ask him to consult. But he mostly declines, agreeing only if the company intrigues him and if its executives come to Boulder to meet him. Over two half-day sessions, for $60,000, he will ask pointed questions and provide very few answers.
 ''I am completely Socratic,'' he said, ''and I challenge and push; they come up with their own answers. I couldn't come up with people's answers.''
 Book tours? No. Splurging with the millions he's earned from his books? No, too. 
 He and his wife still live in the 2,500-square-foot Craftsman-style house they bought when they moved back from California 14 years ago to Boulder, their hometown. He keeps his overhead low, with a staff of five people, and adds students for research work as needed.
 This orientation -- a willingness to say no and focus on what not to do as much as what to do -- stems from a conversation that Mr. Collins had with one of his mentors, the late Peter F. Drucker, the pioneer in social and management theories. 
 ''Do you want to build ideas first and foremost?'' he recalls Mr. Drucker asking him, trying to capture his mentor's Austrian accent. ''Zen you must not build a big organization, because zen you will end up managing zat organization.''
 Therefore, in Jim Collins's world, small is beautiful.
 ''We could have had a big consulting firm and training firm and it would have been a huge lucrative machine,'' he says. ''But I want to answer the questions.''
 THOSE questions have a certain good-dumb flavor. Why do certain companies enjoy enduring success? How did some companies make the transition from good to great? Why do certain companies thrive in turbulent times? 
 Whenever an intriguing question arises, usually spawned by a good conversation, Mr. Collins becomes obsessed with it. ''Like a wolf, it grabs me around the throat and it won't let go,'' he says. 
 His new book, ''How the Mighty Fall,'' grew out of a discussion he led in the fall of 2004 at West Point, with 12 Army generals, 12 chief executives and 12 leaders of nonprofit organizations. 
 Mr. Collins put this question on the table: ''Is America renewing its greatness, or is America dangerously on the cusp of falling from great to good?''
 At a break, one C.E.O. pulled him aside and asked him a question that boiled down to, ''How would you know if your successful company is on a path to decline?''
 An article trying to answer that question grew into his current book. He looked for useful matched pairs -- similar companies whose performance clearly diverged at a certain point. 
 Once he narrowed the field, he compiled decades of data and articles on each company to help explain what led to an inflection point, then kept sifting the data for patterns, divining theories from the data, and seeking out arguments to tell him why the theories were flawed.
 It's roughly the same method he's used for all of his books. 
 ''Jim is a very interesting combination of things,'' said Mr. Porras, his co-author on ''Built to Last'' who taught Mr. Collins many of the research techniques he uses today. ''He's amazingly creative, amazingly disciplined, amazingly thorough. He has strong opinions about things, but after a lot of arguments, he certainly would change his mind. A lot of people who have strong opinions never really let go of them.''
 For each book, he hires a research team of university students, up to a dozen at a time, to help him during long summers of work. He is picky about whom he hires, typically from Stanford and the University of Colorado. They're not always business students; they might be studying law or engineering or biochemistry. 
 He prefers to learn as much as he can about them before he meets them. ''Because if I meet them, I may like them, and then all the assessment of the person is going to be filtered by the fact that I like them, and what I really want to see is the quality of their work,'' he says.
 So he will look at their transcripts. ''If they even have a small glitch in their academic record over the last year, they don't really get considered,'' he says. ''I need people who have that just weird need to get everything right.'' 
 He gives the candidates a list of different academic activities, including field work and lab work, and makes them rank the activities in order of preference, to give him a clear idea of their interests. 
 If they clear other hurdles, he will finally meet them in person. He's looking for four intangibles: smart, curious, willing to death-march (''there has to be something in their background that indicates that they just will die before they would fail to complete something to perfection'') and some spark of irreverence (''because it's in that fertile conversation of disagreement where the best ideas come, or at least the best ideas get tested'').
 ''So I look for somebody who on the one hand was an Eagle Scout, because that's death-marching,'' he explained. ''And, on the other hand, somebody who took time off to travel to 14 third-world countries on no money.'' One of his researchers, an M.B.A. student, had studied medieval literature at Princeton and served in the Marines.
 The research on his books can cost up to $500,000. (For the first two, he was writing personal checks out of his and his wife's personal savings.) With the research complete, Mr. Collins retreats into ''cave mode'' for months and months, seven days a week -- a period when his wife says he is ''there, but not there.''
 He will read through every page of every binder that's been assembled, making notes that he will then use for a first draft.
 ''I call it monk mode, and I love monk mode,'' he says. 
 Writing is not so much fun -- ''painful,'' ''excruciating'' and ''brutal'' is how he describes the process. It's not that he's after a certain lyricism. His writing is clear and unadorned. But it does feel as if every sentence has been pressure-tested and carefully calibrated so that it doesn't go beyond what he can back with evidence from one of his binders. 
 It is slow going. 
 ''If I'm going really, really fast, I can do a page of finished text a day, on average,'' he says. A 36-page monograph he published, ''Good to Great and the Social Sectors,'' took him the better part of two years to write. It sold 400,000 copies. 
 He then gets feedback from a large circle of people. To make sure they don't hold back, he refers to them as his ''critical readers,'' and types in large letters atop the manuscript, ''Bad First Draft.'' 
 ''That gives them the freedom to say, 'Jim already knows it's bad, so let me tell him how it's bad,' '' he says.
 THE findings are by no means pure science -- everything does get filtered through Mr. Collins's brain, after all. And there are plenty of critics, taking issue with what they say are generic and obvious points, based on research methods that are not as ironclad as they appear.
 Others have pointed out that some of the companies he held up as models in ''Good to Great,'' including Fannie Mae and Circuit City, no longer look so good or great -- or, in the case of Circuit City, are even in business.
 On his Freakonomics blog, Steven D. Levitt wrote last year that the message of a book like ''Good to Great'' is ''that the principles that these companies use not only have made them good in the past, but position them for continued success.'' He added, ''To the extent that this doesn't actually turn out to be true, it calls into question the basic premise of these books, doesn't it?''
 Mr. Collins takes issue with the criticism, even devoting a long passage in his new book to defending ''Good to Great'' in light of the subsequent failures of some companies it praised. 
 ''Just because a company falls doesn't invalidate what we can learn by studying that company when it was at its historical best,'' he writes.
 He says the merits of analyzing the reasons for a company's long winning streak -- or, for that matter, a sports team's -- are just as valid even if the company or team can't maintain the winning formula. If people eat right and exercise, then stop doing so, it doesn't make those habits any less valid, he writes.
 Still, anyone looking for code-cracking formulas for success in business is going to be disappointed by Mr. Collins's books -- and every other book, for that matter. What he offers are provocative models for assessing why companies succeed and fail, supported by research that fills dozens of boxes now stored in his basement. 
 He also has a deft touch with metaphors that enliven what might otherwise read like dry case studies -- flywheels and doom loops, hedgehogs and foxes, and a bus analogy borrowed from ''The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'' by Tom Wolfe. 
 VIGOROUS debates continue on blogs about the merits of Mr. Collins's books. One of the more thoughtful comments, on Business Pundit, says, ''The points in the Good to Great book may seem very general, however you'll be amazed that not many people understand 'general' concepts like that things don't happen overnight or the importance of facing facts.''
 Given that every company and industry is different, the books' real value may be not so much in the answers they provide, but in the questions they raise -- the kind that every company and manager should be asking. 
 Mr. Collins's success has provided him with a financial cushion that allows him to search around, without worry, hoping to stumble upon more of those throat-grabbing wolves. ''Now, fortunately, I can probably spend the rest of my life picking any question I want to, regardless of whether it will be profitable,'' he says. ''I can just let my curiosity wander unleashed.''

HEADLINE: Decline and Fall: A View From 2089

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE future is now. To see how history mightlook back on our economic crisis, we bring you this excerpt from ''The Decline and Fall of the United States of America,'' Beijing University Department of Western Hemisphere History (Beijing Press, 2089):
 The demise of an economy as mighty as that of the United States as of 2000 cannot be accounted for by anything less than deeply mistaken and foolish decision-making within that nation's ruling circles. 
 No amount of foreign competition or resource shortage has historically caused such a catastrophe. However, policy actions undertaken without proof or even evidence of their efficacy have historically done so. (See ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,'' Gibbon, 1776.)
 Starting from an extremely strong economic and fiscal position in the year 2000, with surpluses running far into the future in the federal budget and a highly positive outlook for its ability to handle its future pension and health obligations, the United States, under the administration of George W. Bush, a Republican, undertook one of the most mystifyingly self-destructive policy actions yet seen in a democracy.
 Taxes were lowered sharply for well-off and other taxpayers, while government expenditures rose in almost every area, civil and defense. This, in short order, led to a multiplication of the size of the federal budget deficit.
 The theory behind this puzzling behavior was known as ''supply-side economics.'' Magically, it was supposed to increase productivity, the number of hours worked, and tax receipts to the point that the losses in federal revenue were more than offset. There never was any historical evidence that this would happen, at least not as a consequence of the tax cuts, and the deficit, in fact, grew. So did class antagonisms over the ever-larger share of the national income taken by the wealthy.
 There was also a steep increase in liquidity after the notorious terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. This, combined with federal regulations that virtually eliminated regulation of lending and banking in general, led to the great Credit Collapse stagflation in the period after 2006.
 At this time, the nation's finance sector had to become a virtual ward of the state, with public shaming of the leaders of the banking sector in front of Congressional committees -- a sort of Great Cultural Revolution in America. 
 There was a spectacular constriction of credit, despite the flooding of the economy with dollars.
 Whether this had to do with the fear generated by the Credit Collapse or fear of further public shaming is still in debate.
 The Credit Collapse and the government's conflicting response to it -- shoring up the banks and expanding reserves on the one hand, while putting lending officials at risk for aggressive lending on the other -- led to a prolonged slowdown in the economy.
 At the same time, the confidence that American lenders had in the rule of law, probably one of the main pillars of the economy, was demolished by government actions that invalidated some lenders' long-held legal rights in favor of ad hoc attempts to please various political constituencies. 
 Confidence was further eroded as the government embarked upon unprecedented ''stimulus'' moves costing trillions of dollars in the aggregate. These were rushed into law as a crisis measure immediately after the inauguration of Barack Obama, a Democrat, as president in January 2009. Most of the startling sums involved, however, were not spent until years later, by which time public confidence was so low that even these measures were not meaningful in stimulating the economy. 
 In retrospect, it is not clear upon what evidence the stimulus packages were based, because no one had ever been able to prove that taking money from taxpayers, and having the government spend it instead, would meaningfully enlarge the scale of economic activity. (See ''John Maynard Keynes and the Suicide of the West,'' 2039, Hong Kong Press.)
 By 2012, after a substantial victory by President Obama over Jeb Bush of Florida, brother of George W. Bush, the United States had been mired in recession for six years. (The Obama victory was greatly aided by the unopposed secession of Texas and Alaska from the nation.) 
 The flood of liquidity into the economy had translated into unnerving inflation as sellers constantly anticipated higher prices, while labor demand remained soft as buyers resisted buying, especially durable goods. The heavy industry and refining segment of the American economy, once by far the largest in the world, atrophied further as environmental and other regulation made it impossible for executives to compete with the industry of countries that ignored such issues as the environment.
 By 2014, the federal government's debt had reached $25 trillion, while the economy had shrunk to roughly $10 trillion in annual output (at 2006 prices). At that point, the Treasury began to announce that it would suspend payment of interest to foreigners on United States federal debt except by the issuance of so-called P.I.K., or payment-in-kind, notes of the Treasury. These were simply payments by promises instead of by money.
 At that point, only the Federal Reserve remained as a buyer of United States Treasury debt. Foreign holders sold as quickly as they could. The dollar collapsed, and the yuan replaced it as a global reserve currency. The resulting hyperinflation in the United States and the accompanying collapse of the republic are by now known to every schoolchild. ...

HEADLINE: The New Math: Teachers Share Recession's Pain

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Bankers, lawyers and journalists have taken pay cuts and gone without raises to stay employed in a tough economy. Now similar givebacks are spreading to education, an industry once deemed to be recession-proof.
 All 95 teachers and five administrators in the Tuckahoe school district in Westchester County agreed to give $1,000 each to next year's school budget to keep the area's tax increase below 3 percent. In the Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow district, 80 percent of the 500 school employees -- including teachers, clerks, custodians and bus drivers -- have pledged more than $150,000 from their own pockets to help close a $300,000 budget gap.
 And on Long Island, the 733 teachers in the William Floyd district in Mastic Beach decided to collectively give up $1 million in salary increases next year to help restore 19 teaching positions that were to be eliminated. 
 New York State's powerful teachers' unions have rarely agreed to reopen contract negotiations in bad economic times, let alone make concessions. But as many school districts presented flat budgets to voters in recent weeks, teachers in at least a dozen suburban areas have opened the door to compromise to save jobs, preserve programs and smaller class sizes, and show support for the towns and villages where many of them have taught generations of families.
 Richard C. Iannuzzi, president of the New York State United Teachers, said the last time teachers made so many concessions was during the 1970s. 
 ''In a normal school year, in a normal economic situation, we would see very little of what's going on now,'' he said.
 In New York City, where the Bloomberg administration said last week that schools would face a 5 percent cut, the United Federation of Teachers said there had been no discussion of reopening its contract, which runs through October. And in New Jersey and much of Connecticut, where districts face similarly tight times, calls for teacher givebacks have largely been ignored, or rejected.
 The teachers' union in Ridgewood, N.J., voted this spring against a district proposal to renegotiate salaries.''We're sympathetic to the economic situation, but we just don't believe that teachers and school employees are overpaid,'' said Steve Baker, a spokesman for the New Jersey Education Association. ''Our members are the same middle-class people feeling the pinch of this recession as well, so we don't feel it's appropriate to target them for givebacks.'' 
 Even in some of the places where unions have voted to help out management, some members have balked. In the William Floyd district, 60 teachers -- about 8 percent of the total -- voted against giving up what amounted to $1,190 apiece, while 580 teachers voted to do so (those who voted no still have to forgo the money). In Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow, donations have been kept confidential.
 ''We didn't want people to feel that it's some kind of contest,'' said Howard Smith, the Tarrytown superintendent.
 Richard Perugini, a physical education teacher who is president of the Tarrytown teachers' union, said he had pledged to give money even though his wife, Carmen, a teacher's aide, is to be laid off from a nearby school district in June. ''We'll be living paycheck to paycheck,'' he said.
 Tarrytown's budget for next year is $62.5 million, a 3.8 percent increase. That is about half the amount that budgets grew in recent years, leading the district to cut four teaching spots, four teaching assistants and 10 bus drivers and monitors. White Plains's increase, by contrast, is 0.74 percent, to $185.7 million, the smallest in decades. 
 Yonkers, Westchester's largest school system, has a planned budget increase of 0.81 percent (to $487.1 million), after increases of at least 5 percent in each of the past two years. District officials say they must buy fewer supplies, negotiate lower rates for food and busing, suspend supplemental teacher training and pare special education costs by more than $3 million to cover rising expenses for salaries and benefits. 
 ''There's a real sense that we've reached a limit, and in many communities, that translates into, 'We can't even raise it one dollar,' '' Dr. Smith said.
 In most districts, personnel costs are the largest expenses, so renegotiating terms with teachers is one of the only ways to avoid cuts in the classroom. 
 In Cambridge, N.Y., about 50 miles north of Albany, the 980-student district had proposed to lay off a teacher, two teaching assistants and five aides. Instead, the teachers agreed, in a vote of 68 to 22, to reopen their contract and accept smaller stipends for advising clubs, coaching teams and chaperoning events. Savings to the district: $67,868. 
 ''I laid out the problem,'' said Daniel Severson, the superintendent. ''Everybody knows everybody because it's small; we all live in the same town.''
 William Floyd teachers averted the layoffs of nine teachers, and helped the 9,600-student district restore 10 other teaching positions, by agreeing to give up part of their raises. 
 ''We did not want to see any of our teachers lose their jobs, or good programs suspended, and that's what was going to happen,'' said Karen D'Esposito, a high school social studies teacher who is president of the union.
 In Tuckahoe, teachers already contribute $10 annually to a $1,000 scholarship awarded to a graduating student. But last fall, Michael V. Yazurlo, the superintendent of the 1,000-student district, approached the union about trying to keep next year's property tax increase at 2.88 percent, the lowest in more than a decade.
 The teachers' union had initially proposed that its members voluntarily contribute between $200 and $600, based on salary, to support the school budget. But that amount was rejected -- as too little -- by many teachers. The final amount was $1,000 per teacher. 
 Marianne Amato, a 12th-grade English teacher and president of the teachers' union, said, ''Everybody really understood that this is a different time and we have to do something to help as a community of teachers.''

HEADLINE: It Started at the Gas Pump

BYLINE: By LINDA COOK and PATRICIA R. OLSEN. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I GREW up in a large family in a suburb of Kansas City, Kan. I'm one of six siblings, and we had more than 50 cousins in the community. 
 My grandparents, German immigrants, started a dairy. When I was young, my father and his brother ran the business, and my siblings and I helped out. I learned about business by working there. I did the payroll and worked as a receptionist and in the lab, testing milk.
 The summer I was 16, I got bored and convinced my father to let me work at a gas station next to the dairy. I pumped gas for the delivery trucks and other customers. I tell people that it was my first job in the oil industry. 
 I was good in math and science and received a scholarship in chemical engineering, unsolicited, from the University of Kansas. After my first year, I realized I wasn't crazy about the field. Then I took a course in geology and fell in love with the subject. 
 The challenge was to find a major that required geology and had a strong business dimension. I landed on petroleum engineering. I love the industry because it combines technology, economics and a political element. In many countries, the state owns the oil and gas resources and the government controls them.
 There was only one other woman in my engineering classes. I hung out with the guys and joined them for poker nights. I had learned from growing up in a large family that you have to get along to survive, so being mostly with men was easy for me. 
 In 1980, when I graduated, there was peak demand for petroleum engineers. I had offers from almost every oil company in the country. I joined Shell as a reservoir engineer in the exploration and production area. One of the first requirements is to supervise a process called logging the well on a drilling rig. A crew drills a well and then lowers tools and takes measurements. The data provides information about the rock formations a mile or two below the surface. 
 I was one of the first women to supervise the logging jobs, and was sent to a remote area of Michigan. It was a bit of a shock for both me and the men. The work can take up to three days, and there were no separate accommodations. I slept in the same mud loggers' trailer as the guys, in one of four bunks. I took the approach that I might not have been comfortable, but the men weren't either. Today we have separate accommodations for women.
 My family and I moved to the Netherlands in 1998 for my current position. Having a dual-career family and raising three kids has been one of the hardest things that my husband, Steve, and I have ever done. 
 Once Shell asked me to relocate to California from Houston, so Steve's company found him a job there, too. Then his company asked him to return to Houston for a promotion, so I asked Shell to accommodate me. The company found a position for me, but a California manager said I needed to recognize this might be the end of my career. That was 20 years ago. Since then, I've held a number of executive positions, including C.E.O. of two Shell companies. I redeemed myself in their eyes.
 I would advise women to keep their options open. Some women may think that they'll never go back to work after having children, or that they'd never be able to relocate. I would tell them that you just don't know what curveball life is going to throw you, and your circumstances may change, so don't close any doors before you have to. 
 I visit the United States about six times a year. I have strong ties to the University of Kansas, and I remain a loyal Jayhawk fan even though I am living overseas. It's not unusual for me to watch the team's basketball games on my laptop, at all hours of the night, alone in hotel rooms in the Middle East or Asia.

HEADLINE: Reality Check for Real Estate Shows

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

DATELINE: BALTIMORE 

 BODY:
 IT'S not often that a television host advocates for fewer minutes on the air. But one senses that Mike Aubrey, the real estate agent who assesses homes for the coming HGTV series ''Real Estate Intervention,'' would be happy to have fewer homeowners to counsel. Mr. Aubrey is part agent, part therapist on the show, which shows distressed homeowners how to cope with the collapse of the housing market. Standing on the porch of a charming two-bedroom home on a leafy street here recently, Mr. Aubrey noted that if ''Real Estate Intervention'' had been in production five years ago at the height of the housing boom, ''the show would be about 30 seconds long.''
 ''I'd walk in, I'd tell them to add $10,000 to the price of the home, I'd write 'for sale' on a pizza box, and I'd leave,'' he said in between takes here for an episode. Nowadays Mr. Aubrey typically convinces the homeowners that their prized properties are overpriced in a depressed real estate market and they need to deal. 
 ''Real Estate Intervention,'' which will have its premiere in July, is a product of HGTV's retooling to reflect these economic times. The cable channel -- more closely associated than any other with the country's housing crisis and the perils of easy credit and living beyond one's means -- has shelved some episodes of certain shows, edited others and ordered entirely new series in an extensive effort to set the right tone in a somber economy.
 Onstage before advertisers in New York last month, the channel's president, Jim Samples, started his presentation with the chestnut that ''homes are much more than investments.'' He lauded the ''no-nonsense advice'' on ''Real Estate Intervention'' and emphasized the programs that will help first-time home buyers make sense of the market. And for those homeowners who are staying put, he showcased hosts who would help them ''fall back in love with the home they're in.''
 The gist was lost on no one in the ballroom: the Home & Garden Television Network, the channel of ''House Hunters'' and ''Rate My Space,'' which celebrated the conspicuous consumption of the housing boom, was programming for the Great Recession.
 Reality shows of all stripes have had to acknowledge the chill on Wall Street and Main Street. MTV and VH1 have dialed down the over-the-top extravaganzas like ''My Super Sweet 16'' for more uplifting fare like ''T. I.'s Road to Redemption.'' On a coming Fox reality show called ''Someone's Gotta Go,'' employees of small companies will select which of their co-workers should be fired. Even the women of the ''Real Housewives'' franchise on Bravo brag about being sensitive to hard times -- albeit as they flaunt their familial wealth. 
 Cable channels are ''all looking for some way to reflect the new economy,'' said Michael Davies, an executive producer of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and other unscripted shows. But ultimately, he added, their essences remain mostly unchanged; many of them ''are completely and utterly escapist.'' 
 HGTV, because of its subject matter, may have done more calibrating than any other channel. It has to acknowledge the crisis while still providing viewers with an escape. ''We can't stick our head in the sand,'' Mr. Samples said. ''We don't want to become a news network either.''
 Although he consciously shies away from the V-word, viewers will always want to be real estate voyeurs. It's human nature to want to peek into other people's homes and by extension their lives. The channel's centerpiece continues to be the 10-year-old ''House Hunters,'' which tells buyers' tales as they tour homes. Since its start in 1994 the channel has relied on a diet of real estate, remodeling, design and construction shows. Along with the Food Network, it is the premier brand of Scripps Networks, a company that also owns FLN, formerly known as Fine Living Network, and DIY, short for Do It Yourself. More than 1.1 million viewers watch HGTV in prime time, enough for it to rank among cable's 20 most popular channels.
 While HGTV avoided programs about house-flipping during the boom (''Flip This House'' was on A&E and ''Flip That House'' on TLC), it acted as a cheerleader for the market with shows like ''My House Is Worth What?,'' a half-hour-long celebration of home investment, and ''Designed to Sell,'' which promised to show how to ''turn a tired house into a showpiece'' with a budget of only $2,000. 
 The backlash has been minimal compared with the fury felt toward Wall Street -- but still detectable. In January an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal labeled HGTV a villain of the meltdown because ''you couldn't watch these shows without concluding that you must be an idiot and a loser if you lived in a house you could actually afford.'' And in March, Burton Jablin, the programming chief for Scripps, was named by Time magazine as one of the 25 people to blame for the financial crisis. Scripps executives tried to laugh away the inglorious ranking by saying that Mr. Jablin was near the bottom of Time's list. But Mr. Samples acknowledged that the company executives had some soul-searching conversations. ''We honestly asked ourselves, 'Have we been part of this?' '' he said. ''I think we reflected the enthusiasm that people had around their homes. In some cases that meant that people were making big investments in their homes, and we tried to help them make smart decisions. But it's a stretch, and I think it's unfair, to say that HGTV fueled a housing bubble.''
 Mr. Samples, who arrived at HGTV in October 2007 from the Cartoon Network, said that as the housing market deteriorated and subprime mortgages became fodder for dinner table conversations, the market changes ''became an increasingly important component'' of the channel's weekly programming meetings. By early 2008 he had instructed each of his programming directors to analyze every show in the lineup to see which were relevant to the newly downsized times and, more important, which ones were not. Some of the decisions were simple. If an episode showed a homeowner marveling at the bidding war over a home, it was shelved. In other, more subtle cases, episodes were tweaked in the editing stages to make them more applicable to a sluggish market. Viewers hear fewer mentions of ''zero money down'' loans now. ''There wasn't a tremendous amount of it,'' Mr. Samples said. ''But I felt it was important to really scrub the air to make sure we maintained our credibility with the viewers.''
 Amid the economic downturn HGTV has played up a marketing campaign that says, ''Life's biggest moments start at home.'' 
 ''It's a campaign to say 'We get it,' '' said Lori Asbury, the network's vice president for marketing.
 New programs are trying to instill the same message. Last month HGTV added a series simply titled ''For Rent.'' Next Sunday it will introduce a four-family design competition show, ''$250,000 Challenge,'' which pledges to help the winning group pay off its mortgage. Another show, ''The Unsellables,'' tries to help the owners of homes that have sat on the market for months. 
 One of the ''$250,000 Challenge'' couples invested their life savings into a home at the height of the market, and are now feeling the brutal effects. Those sorts of real-life stories are central to the mission of HGTV, said Freddy James, the network's senior vice president for programming development. And they are resulting in documentary-style shows like ''Real Estate Intervention.'' On a leafy Baltimore street where the ''for sale'' signs feel more like exasperations than exclamations, Mr. Aubrey was leading Rebekka Popov, a 30-year-old homeowner struggling with a ballooning mortgage payment, through a home similar to hers that had yet to sell. With a camera crew following, he ticked off the advantages and disadvantages that a buyer might spot. 
 Much of Mr. Aubrey's advice is difficult to digest. When Ms. Popov speaks admiringly of the comparable house's bathroom renovations and declares that she wants to make similar upgrades, he glares at her.
 ''Do you have the money to do it?''
 ''No.''
 ''So it's not an option.''
 ''No, it's not.''
 The message is crystal clear, at least to the viewer: it's a buyers' market. 
 CableU, a company that studies cable programming, said in a recent report that HGTV's programming makeover ''has helped focus the network to match the mood and needs of its viewers.'' After months of stagnant ratings, the network started to show some slight growth in March, around the same time that housing prognosticators were calling the bottom of the market. 
 While the shows that are having their premieres now are geared for the downturn, Mr. Samples and Mr. James are already thinking ahead to the housing recovery. The executives at HGTV now receive regular e-mail updates about housing sales and economic indicators from the company's research team. They are keeping a particularly close eye on the figures about first-time home buyers. Somewhere, they hope, new housing-television viewers are entering the marketplace. 
 Real estate novices are the ''first glimmer of hope that we're seeing,'' Mr. Samples said.

HEADLINE: A Potential Justice Who Has a Sparse Legal Record to Scrutinize

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY; Karen Ann Cullotta contributed reporting, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
Not quite a year after defeating a Republican and becoming Michigan's first new attorney general in nearly four decades, Jennifer M. Granholm, the highest-ranking and most-talked-about Democrat in the state, faced what turned out to be a defining hurdle.
 It was 1999, and the state was controlled by Republicans. The Legislature sought to fast-track a measure that would have stripped her office of core powers, including the right to sue the state, represent individuals and have official opinions carry the force of law. 
 But Ms. Granholm, 40 at the time and a political neophyte in her first statewide role, came out swinging with unexpected gusto and beat back the challenge in arguments with the lawmakers. 
 ''It was such a P.R. disaster for the Republicans -- they backed down,'' Bill Ballenger, editor of the newsletter Inside Michigan Politics, said in an interview. Mr. Ballenger and other political experts said the showdown was the launching pad from which Ms. Granholm, a former federal prosecutor and Wayne County counsel, rocketed to the governor's office just three years later. 
 Now Ms. Granholm, nearing the end of a second term as governor that has been defined more than anything else by the economic crisis in her state, is among the small number of people being considered to succeed Justice David H. Souter on the Supreme Court. But her fast ascent to the state's top political job and lack of judicial experience has left only a lean record for scrutiny of her legal thinking. 
 ''As the A.G., in my judgment, she never showed a strong passion for the right or left of center,'' said Steven A. Freeman, a criminal defense lawyer in Lansing, Mich., who estimates that he faced off in court with Ms. Granholm's team on at least 60 cases. ''If you didn't know her, you couldn't tell if she was a Democrat or a Republican, conservative or liberal.''
 To some, Ms. Granholm's legal style, or absence thereof, is a clear asset because it shows that she put the issues of the law ahead of any personal agenda. Despite favoring abortion rights, for instance, she defended the more conservative views of the Republican administration in Michigan in the late 1990s on abortion. In one opinion as attorney general, she stated that taking RU-486, known as the abortion pill, was legally tantamount to having an abortion. 
 As governor, however, she has generally opposed anti-abortion legislation. She twice vetoed bans on a particular procedure called partial-birth abortion by critics. And while she has stopped short of supporting same-sex marriage, she has ensured legal protection of domestic partnerships and issued an executive nondiscrimination order for state employees.
 Supporters say her charisma, empathy and real-world government experience are the qualities she would take to the Supreme Court, currently populated exclusively by former federal appellate judges. 
 ''A court of nine Jennifer Granholms -- something's missing,'' said Richard D. Friedman, a law professor and Supreme Court expert at the University of Michigan. ''The question is whether one seat on the court should be going to someone like her. And I just don't think that's a problem. Given that perspective, she brings something very valuable.''
 But some Democrats fear that while she is a strong-willed voice for the concerns of her state, and is often characterized as a liberal Democrat, they do not know enough about her legal philosophy to count on her being a champion for liberals on the Supreme Court. Many Democrats are hoping for a nominee who can stand up to the court's powerful conservative voices, including that of Justice Antonin Scalia. 
 ''She doesn't have a history of liberal leanings,'' said James W. Burdick, a criminal defense lawyer and supporter of Ms. Granholm's who said he nonetheless had been ''pained'' by some of her judicial appointments. ''Some of the judges she has appointed are very middle of the road or even conservative.''
 Mr. Ballenger, the Inside Michigan Politics editor, said Ms. Granholm would make a great justice because of her time governing a state in crisis. (Michigan has been suffering a deeper and longer recession than the country as a whole.) But asked about a defining moment in her legal life or as attorney general, he said, ''Nobody can remember an opinion by Jennifer Granholm.'' 
 ''She didn't leave an impression,'' he added. ''She really didn't have time to leave an impression.''
 Jennifer Mulhern Granholm (she took the last name of her husband, Daniel, as her middle name, and he did the same with her last name), 50, was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and moved with her family to the United States as a child. Ms. Granholm, who has three children, is perhaps best known outside her state as an advocate of the automobile industry, a role that has given her national prominence and close proximity to the Obama administration. 
 Like Mr. Obama, she graduated from Harvard Law School, where she was editor in chief of The Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review. 
 ''Jennifer was a bright light amongst the students and exhibited an incredible intellect,'' recalled Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a law professor at Harvard. 
 She began her career as a clerk for Judge Damon J. Keith on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, who was first named to the federal bench by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Later, she served as a federal prosecutor in Detroit. In 1994, she was appointed Wayne County corporation counsel, the county's top legal job. 
 Four years later, she won election to the attorney general's office. She opened a high-tech crime unit and focused on consumer protection. 
 ''One thing that impressed me about her is that she did try to do the right thing by the law, even if it happened not to be the policy answer she would have preferred,'' said Thomas L. Casey, a former Michigan solicitor general who worked during Ms. Granholm's tenure as attorney general. ''Her four years were very good years, and I had a lot of respect for her.''
 Term limits bar Ms. Granholm from running for governor again in 2010. Her office declined a request for an interview for this article. Kelly Keenan, former legal counsel to the governor, described her as someone who ''tries to make things work.''
 ''If President Obama wants somebody who understands what the law means and its impact on the people, Jennifer Granholm would bring that to the court,'' Mr. Keenan said. ''She's out there every day, at factories, dealing with workers, with students, working to bring in new jobs and save the old ones. She's not from the cloistered halls.''

HEADLINE: Have We Already Lost Iran?

BYLINE: By FLYNT LEVERETT and HILLARY MANN LEVERETT. 
Flynt Leverett directs the New America Foundation's geopolitics of energy initiative and teaches at Penn State's School of International Affairs. Hillary Mann Leverett is the president of a political risk consultancy. Both are former National Security Council staff members.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 PRESIDENT OBAMA'S Iran policy has, in all likelihood, already failed. On its present course, the White House's approach will not stop Tehran's development of a nuclear fuel program -- or, as Iran's successful test of a medium-range, solid-fuel missile last week underscored, military capacities of other sorts. It will also not provide an alternative to continued antagonism between the United States and Iran -- a posture that for 30 years has proved increasingly damaging to the interests of the United States and its allies in the Middle East.
 This judgment may seem both premature and overly severe. We do not make it happily. We voted for Barack Obama in 2008, and we still want him to succeed in reversing the deterioration in America's strategic position. But we also believe that successful diplomacy with Iran is essential to that end. Unless President Obama and his national security team take a fundamentally different approach to Tehran, they will not achieve a breakthrough. 
 This is a genuine shame, for President Obama had the potential to do so much better for America's position in the Middle East. In his greeting to ''the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran'' on the Persian New Year in March, Mr. Obama included language meant to assuage Iranian skepticism about America's willingness to end efforts to topple the regime and pursue comprehensive diplomacy.
 Iranian diplomats have told us that the president's professed willingness to deal with Iran on the ''basis of mutual interest'' in an atmosphere of ''mutual respect'' was particularly well received in Tehran. They say that the quick response of the nation's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- which included the unprecedented statement that ''should you change, our behavior will change, too'' -- was a sincere signal of Iran's openness to substantive diplomatic proposals from the new American administration.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Obama is backing away from the bold steps required to achieve strategic, Nixon-to-China-type rapprochement with Tehran. Administration officials have professed disappointment that Iranian leaders have not responded more warmly to Mr. Obama's rhetoric. Many say that the detention of the Iranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi (who was released this month) and Ayatollah Khamenei's claim last week that America is ''fomenting terrorism'' inside Iran show that trying to engage Tehran is a fool's errand. 
 But this ignores the real reason Iranian leaders have not responded to the new president more enthusiastically: the Obama administration has done nothing to cancel or repudiate an ostensibly covert but well-publicized program, begun in President George W. Bush's second term, to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to destabilize the Islamic Republic. Under these circumstances, the Iranian government -- regardless of who wins the presidential elections on June 12 -- will continue to suspect that American intentions toward the Islamic Republic remain, ultimately, hostile.
 In this context, the Saberi case should be interpreted not as the work of unspecified ''hard-liners'' in Tehran out to destroy prospects for improved relations with Washington, but rather as part of the Iranian leadership's misguided but fundamentally defensive reaction to an American government campaign to bring about regime change. Similarly, Ayatollah Khamenei's charge that ''money, arms and organizations are being used by the Americans directly across our western border to fight the Islamic Republic's system'' reflects legitimate concern about American intentions. Mr. Obama has reinforced this concern by refusing to pursue an American-Iranian ''grand bargain'' -- a comprehensive framework for resolving major bilateral differences and fundamentally realigning relations. 
 More broadly, President Obama has made several policy and personnel decisions that have undermined the promise of his encouraging rhetoric about Iran. On the personnel front, the problem begins at the top, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. As a presidential candidate, then-Senator Clinton ran well to the right of Mr. Obama on Iran, even saying she would ''totally obliterate'' Iran if it attacked Israel. Since becoming secretary of state, Clinton has told a number of allies in Europe and the Persian Gulf that she is skeptical that diplomacy with Iran will prove fruitful and testified to Congress that negotiations are primarily useful to garner support for ''crippling'' multilateral sanctions against Iran. 
 First of all, this posture is feckless, as Secretary Clinton does not have broad international support for sanctions that would come anywhere close to being crippling. More significantly, this posture is cynically counterproductive, for it eviscerates the credibility of any American diplomatic overtures in the eyes of Iranian leaders across the Islamic Republic's political spectrum. 
 Even more disturbing is President Obama's willingness to have Dennis Ross become the point person for Iran policy at the State Department. Mr. Ross has long been an advocate of what he describes as an ''engagement with pressure'' strategy toward Tehran, meaning that the United States should project a willingness to negotiate with Iran largely to elicit broader regional and international support for intensifying economic pressure on the Islamic Republic. 
 In conversations with Mr. Ross before Mr. Obama's election, we asked him if he really believed that engage-with-pressure would bring concessions from Iran. He forthrightly acknowledged that this was unlikely. Why, then, was he advocating a diplomatic course that, in his judgment, would probably fail? Because, he told us, if Iran continued to expand its nuclear fuel program, at some point in the next couple of years President Bush's successor would need to order military strikes against Iranian nuclear targets. Citing past ''diplomacy'' would be necessary for that president to claim any military action was legitimate. 
 Iranian officials are fully aware of Mr. Ross's views -- and are increasingly suspicious that he is determined that the Obama administration make, as one senior Iranian diplomat said to us, ''an offer we can't accept,'' simply to gain international support for coercive action. 
 Understandably, given that much of Mr. Obama's national security team doesn't share his vision of rapprochement with Iran, America's overall policy is incoherent. For example, while the administration recently completed a much-ballyhooed review of Iran policy, it has made no changes in its approach to the nuclear issue. Administration officials argue, with what seem to be straight faces, that the Iranian leadership should be impressed simply because American representatives will now show up for any nuclear negotiations with Iran that might take place.
 Similarly, some officials suggest that the administration might be prepared to accept limited uranium enrichment on Iranian soil as part of a settlement -- effectively asking to be given ''credit'' merely for acknowledging a well-established reality. Based on our own experience negotiating with Iranians, and our frequent discussions with Iranian diplomats and political figures since leaving the government, we think that it will take a lot more to persuade Tehran of America's new seriousness. 
 Tehran will certainly not be persuaded of American seriousness if Washington acquiesces to Israeli insistence on a deadline for successful American engagement with Iran. Although the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, had told reporters that no such deadline would be imposed, President Obama himself said, after his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, that he wants to see ''progress'' in nuclear negotiations before the end of the year. He also endorsed the creation of a high-level Israeli-American working group to identify more coercive options if Iran does not meet American conditions for limiting its nuclear activities.
 More specifically, Secretary Clinton and Mr. Ross have been pushing the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany to intensify multilateral sanctions against Iran if Tehran has not agreed to limit the expansion of its nuclear-fuel cycle program by the time the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York at the end of September.
 This diplomatic approach is guaranteed to fail. Having a deadline for successful negotiations will undercut the perceived credibility of American diplomacy in Tehran and serve only to prepare the way for more coercive measures. Mr. Obama's justification for a deadline -- that previous American-Iranian negotiations produced ''a lot of talk but not always action and follow-through'' -- is incorrect as far as Iranian behavior was concerned. For example, during talks over Afghanistan after 9/11 in which one of us (Hillary) took part, Tehran deported hundreds of Qaeda and Taliban operatives who had sought sanctuary in Iran, and also helped establish the new Afghan government. It was Washington, not Tehran, that arbitrarily ended these productive talks. 
 Beyond the nuclear issue, the administration's approach to Iran degenerates into an only slightly prettified version of George W. Bush's approach -- that is, an effort to contain a perceived Iranian threat without actually trying to resolve underlying political conflicts. Obama administration officials are buying into a Bush-era delusion: that concern about a rising Iranian threat could unite Israel and moderate Arab states in a grand alliance under Washington's leadership. 
 President Obama and his team should not be excused for their failure to learn the lessons of recent history in the Middle East -- that the prospect of strategic cooperation with Israel is profoundly unpopular with Arab publics and that even moderate Arab regimes cannot sustain such cooperation. The notion of an Israeli-moderate Arab coalition united to contain Iran is not only delusional, it would leave the Palestinian and Syrian-Lebanese tracks of the Arab-Israeli conflict unresolved and prospects for their resolution in free fall. These tracks cannot be resolved without meaningful American interaction with Iran and its regional allies, Hamas and Hezbollah. 
 Why has President Obama put himself in a position from which he cannot deliver on his own professed interest in improving relations with the Islamic Republic? Some diplomatic veterans who have spoken with him have told us that the president said that he did not realize, when he came to office, how ''hard'' the Iran problem would be. But what is hard about the Iran problem is not periodic inflammatory statements from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or episodes like Ms. Saberi's detention. What is really hard is that getting America's Iran policy ''right'' would require a president to take positions that some allies and domestic constituencies won't like. 
 To fix our Iran policy, the president would have to commit not to use force to change the borders or the form of government of the Islamic Republic. He would also have to accept that Iran will continue enriching uranium, and that the only realistic potential resolution to the nuclear issue would leave Iran in effect like Japan -- a nation with an increasingly sophisticated nuclear fuel-cycle program that is carefully safeguarded to manage proliferation risks. Additionally, the president would have to accept that Iran's relationships with Hamas and Hezbollah will continue, and be willing to work with Tehran to integrate these groups into lasting settlements of the Middle East's core political conflicts. 
 It was not easy for President Richard Nixon to discard a quarter-century of failed policy toward the People's Republic of China and to reorient America's posture toward Beijing in ways that have served America's interests extremely well for more than 30 years. That took strategic vision, political ruthlessness and personal determination. We hope that President Obama -- contrary to his record so far -- will soon begin to demonstrate those same qualities in forging a new approach toward Iran.

HEADLINE: Energy Plans Often Run Out of Gas

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
-- Ordinary light bulbs are supposed to disappear in the next few years as exotic new lighting technologies become common. Much of our electricity will be generated by wind and sun. Car fuel will be extracted from trees and grass. So lawmakers have mandated.
 Now President Obama has proposed a new energy initiative, one of the most ambitious in decades, that would require the average car to get 40 percent more miles on each gallon. 
 At least, that's what is supposed to happen. But as the ups and downs of the nation's energy policy have demonstrated over the last 35 years, much of what presidents sought and Congress mandated never came to be. Political will sometimes exceeded technology. In other cases, the market place simply didn't support the policies.
 Consider the trajectories of some past energy initiatives announced with similar enthusiasm as the president's new fuel economy plan, which calls for new cars to average 35.5 miles a gallon by 2016. In 2007, for example, Congress set quotas for ethanol made from plant matter to displace gasoline. Next year, refiners are required to use 100 million gallons. The problem is, no one has figured out yet how to produce it in commercial quantities. ''The soup's not quite cooked yet,'' said Mitch Mandich, a director of Range Fuels, one of the companies trying to build such a refining operation. 
 In 2005, Congress passed an energy law requiring that the standard incandescent light bulb be 25 to 30 percent more efficient, beginning in 2012. But engineers are still working on a way to meet that goal.
 More than half the states have mandated ''renewable portfolio standards'' requiring that some percentage of their electricity come from nonfossil fuel sources. But would-be developers of these energy alternatives have had trouble lining up money, equipment and production sites fast enough to meet the goals in some states. 
 In 1992, soon after American forces chased Saddam Hussein's army out of Kuwait, Congress passed a law to reduce the nation's dependence on gasoline. By 2000, 10 percent of new cars were supposed to be able to use a second fuel in addition to gasoline; the expectation was that it would be natural gas. But when the price of oil collapsed, so did efforts behind the handful of natural gas models in production. 
 In 1980, Congress created the Synfuels Corporation, and planned to spend tens of billions of dollars on projects to make gasoline from tar sands, heavy oil and other resources that did not have to be imported from the Middle East. President Reagan killed it after world oil prices collapsed.
 The list goes on. In California, for instance, car makers were required to sell enough ''zero emission vehicles,'' or electric cars to make up 2 percent of sales by the late 1990s and 10 percent later on. State officials gave up when it became obvious the technology was not ready.
 So what about President Obama's emissions and mileage plan?
 The technology exists to build cars, light trucks and S.U.V.'s with the fuel efficiency that the president is demanding. But at present, the two ways to do that both have their downsides. One way is to make cars much smaller and less powerful than those that Americans are used to driving -- and like to drive. The other way is to add equipment and materials that will make the cars significantly more expensive.
 The question is, will there be a market for them, or will the auto industry return to Congress, as it has done successfully in the past, to try to water down the standards? The industry might also be joined by the public. 
 The policy's chances of survival may depend on the year-to-year price of oil, said Andrew N. Kleit, a professor of energy and environmental economics at Pennsylvania State University. An average of 35.5 miles per gallon is ''perfectly reasonable when oil is $140 a barrel, and incredibly expensive when the price is $30,'' he said. 
 He predicted the mileage standards would be irrelevant. High oil prices either would drive people to fuel-efficient cars, or, if fuel was cheap, the standards would be abandoned as the public's taste for cars that are both big and zippy re-asserted itself.
 ''This is just deja vu all over again,'' Professor Kleit said.
 But that is not the view of Philip R. Sharp, who served 20 years in the House of Representatives as a Democrat from Indiana, and is now president of Resources for the Future, a nonprofit group.
 He said that after a burst of energy legislation in the early 1980s --some of which he wrote -- the nation's mood changed. President Reagan argued that energy problems should be left to the market to solve. And, Mr. Sharp said, government intervention ''actually fell out of favor with the Democratic wonk leaders as well'' after some initiatives failed.
 Then, the impetus was high oil prices, but those prices fell. Now, Mr. Sharp said, the impetus for Mr. Obama's fuel efficiency plan and many other energy proposals is the growing concern about global warming.
 But even if the president's plan falls short and other energy initiatives miss deadlines or are less effective than hoped, he said, progress will be made and technology will advance.
 Deja vu, he said, ''is not necessarily a negative thing.''

HEADLINE: Who Says Innovation Belongs to The Small?

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
FOR more than a decade, the prevailing view of innovation has been that little guys had the edge. Innovation bubbled up from the bottom, from upstarts and insurgents. Big companies didn't innovate, and government got in the way. In the dominant innovation narrative, venture-backed start-up companies were cast as the nimble winners and large corporations as the sluggish losers.
 There was a rich vein of business-school research supporting the notion that innovation comes most naturally from small-scale outsiders. That was the headline point that a generation of business people, venture investors and policy makers took away from Clayton M. Christensen's 1997 classic, ''The Innovator's Dilemma,'' which examined the process of disruptive change. 
 But a shift in thinking is under way, driven by altered circumstances. In the United States and abroad, the biggest economic and social challenges -- and potential business opportunities -- are problems in multifaceted fields like the environment, energy and health care that rely on complex systems.
 Solutions won't come from the next new gadget or clever software, though such innovations will help. Instead, they must plug into a larger network of change shaped by economics, regulation and policy. Progress, experts say, will depend on people in a wide range of disciplines, and collaboration across the public and private sectors. 
 ''These days, more than ever, size matters in the innovation game,'' said John Kao, a former professor at the Harvard business school and an innovation consultant to governments and corporations.In its economic recovery package, the Obama administration is financing programs to generate innovation with technology in health care and energy. The government will spend billions to accelerate the adoption of electronic patient records to help improve care and curb costs, and billions more to spur the installation of so-called smart grids that use sensors and computerized meters to reduce electricity consumption.
 In other developed nations, where energy costs are higher than in the United States, government and corporate projects to cut fuel use and reduce carbon emissions are further along. But the Obama administration is pushing environmental and energy conservation policy more in the direction of Europe and Japan. The change will bolster demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly systems for managing commuter traffic, food distribution, electric grids and waterways.
 These systems are animated by inexpensive sensors and ever-increasing computing power but also require the skills to analyze, model and optimize complex networks, factoring in things as diverse as weather patterns and human behavior. 
 Big companies like General Electric and I.B.M. that employ scientists in many disciplines typically have the skills and scale to tackle such projects. Their advantage is in ''being able to integrate innovations across these complex systems,'' said James E. Spohrer, a scientist at I.B.M.'s Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif.
 Technology trends also contribute to the rising role of large companies. The lone inventor will never be extinct, but W. Brian Arthur, an economist at the Palo Alto Research Center, says that as digital technology evolves, step-by-step innovations are less important than linking all the sensors, software and data centers in systems.
 Today, Mr. Arthur said, the unfolding ''digitization of the economy'' is in some ways a modern rerun of past technology waves, from steam power to electricity. ''It's not individual inventions that matter so much, but when large bodies of technology come together and have an impact across the economy,'' he said. ''That's what we're seeing now.''
 In computing, some technological frontiers require size and deep pockets. To be competitive in Internet search and some other Web services, which cater to hundreds of millions of users worldwide, a company must build data centers of gargantuan size, and only a handful of companies can design and afford them, led by Google and Microsoft.
 ''There are just a few companies in a position to do computing and process data in a way never done before,'' observed Richard F. Rashid, Microsoft's senior vice president for research.
 The innovation tilt toward big companies, to be sure, is a rebalancing. There is still plenty of bottom-up innovation, including promising start-ups in the environmental and energy businesses. At the individual level, tinkering users have made significant contributions in fields as diverse as software and sporting goods.
 STILL, the pendulum of thinking on innovation does seem to be swinging toward the big guys. In health care, institutions that have done best in improving the health of patients with chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes have been larger, integrated systems like Kaiser Permanente in California, Intermountain Healthcare in Utah and the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania. They have the scale and incentives to invest in things like wellness programs and electronic health records.
 In a new book on health care, ''The Innovator's Prescription,'' Mr. Christensen and the co-authors, Dr. Jerome H. Grossman and Dr. Jason Hwang, say that such large integrated systems ''have the scope to create within themselves a new disruptive value network.''
 In an e-mail message last week, Mr. Christensen, a professor at the Harvard Business School, said that big companies do tend to resist disruptive innovation but that size need not spell failure. ''The good news is that, once they recognize the benefits of disruptive thinking,'' he wrote, ''the big companies have all the resources necessary to induce change.''

HEADLINE: Healthy Credit

BYLINE: By DAVID GIBSON, CARLA HALL and SYLVIA HARRIS; David Gibson, Carla Hall and Sylvia Harris are graphic designers and directors of Design for Democracy, a nonprofit group that promotes accessible and transparent civic communications.

 BODY:
Last week, President Obama signed legislation that limits the credit card industry's ability to raise rates, penalize late payers and issue credit cards to people under 21. As consumers, we are thrilled. But as professional communicators, we believe that Congress and the White House have overlooked a simple innovation that could be as powerful as these reforms, if not more so. 
 Inspired by the Nutrition Facts label found on food packaging, we designed its equivalent for credit cards: an easy-to-understand chart that would simply and clearly lay out interest rates, card fees and payment terms so consumers could understand their accounts. Just as Nutrition Facts help us make smart choices about food, Credit Card Facts would enable consumers to make informed choices about acquiring and using credit cards. 
 This is an example of the disclosure chart that has appeared on American credit card solicitations since 2000. A great idea at its inception, the box has been unable to keep up with our increasingly complex credit card offerings. The type is too small, the headings are not prominent enough and many critical facts are buried in the fine print below the actual chart. 
 Unless credit card companies are told what they have to disclose and exactly how they have to disclose it, the consumer will still be drowned in text. As Mr. Obama recently said, ''You shouldn't need a magnifying glass or a law degree to read the fine print that sometimes doesn't even appear to be written in English.''
 The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 mandated a standard format for essential nutrition information. The Nutrition Facts box was designed to be bold and clear and to stand in contrast to promotional packaging. Because the layout and typographic style are now standard, it is easy for consumers to scan labels, glean the facts and compare products quickly.
 Our proposed Credit Card Facts box is written with the cardholder in mind. Everything the consumer needs to know is presented in a bold, straightforward layout. Simple language describes charges and payment activity as well as the consequences of late payment. The essential facts are not buried in a thicket of dense fine print. 
 Would a simple box like this on every credit card offer and statement make a difference to overwhelmed and confused customers? If the success of the Nutrition Facts label is any indication, the answer would have to be yes.

HEADLINE: Some Obama Enemies Are Made Totally of Straw

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Democrats often complained about President George W. Bush's frequent use of a rhetorical device as old as rhetoric itself: creating the illusion of refuting an opponent's argument by mischaracterizing it and then knocking down that mischaracterization. 
 There was much outrage in 2006, for example, when Mr. Bush said that when it came to battling terrorists, ''I need members of Congress who understand that you can't negotiate with these folks,'' implying that Democrats backed talks with Al Qaeda. That assertion was promptly, and angrily, disputed by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. 
 Now that there is a new team at the White House, guess who is knocking down straw men left and right? To listen to President Obama, a veritable army of naysayers has invaded Washington, urging him to sit on his hands at the White House and do nothing to address any of the economic or national security problems facing the country.
 ''There are those who say these plans are too ambitious, that we should be trying to do less, not more,'' Mr. Obama told a town-hall-style meeting in Costa Mesa, Calif., on March 18. ''Well, I say our challenges are too large to ignore.'' 
 Mr. Obama did not specify who, exactly, was saying America should ignore its challenges. 
 Similarly, the next day in Los Angeles, Mr. Obama took on Wall Street and Washington, two of his favorite straw men. ''I know some folks in Washington and on Wall Street are saying we should just focus on their problems,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It would be nice if I could just pick and choose what problems to face, when to face them. So I could say, well, no, I don't want to deal with the war in Afghanistan right now; I'd prefer not having to deal with climate change right now. And if you could just hold on, even though you don't have health care, just please wait, because I've got other things to do.''
 Mr. Obama continued on the offensive against straw men that day in Los Angeles, pointing out that critics told him not to go on ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' on NBC because ''I can't handle that and the economy at the same time.'' Then, his audience primed, he delivered his standard kill line: ''Listen, here's what I say. I say our challenges are too big to ignore.'' 
 And who can argue with that? Like most straw men, Mr. Obama's are not complete fabrications. White House officials correctly pointed out that Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, took a crack at Mr. Obama for appearing on the Leno show, saying that his ''suggestion is that he come back, since he's taken full responsibility, and get his people together'' to confer on the budget. 
 But that is still a ways from the tortuous construct which Mr. Obama ended up with, that turned Mr. Kyl's remark into one that somehow needed the ''our challenges are too big to ignore'' rebuttal, since it suggests that one of those challenges was apparently appearing on Leno. 
 ''Here's the trick: Take your opponent's argument to a ridiculous extreme, and then attack the extremists,'' said William Safire, the former presidential speechwriter who writes the ''On Language'' column for The New York Times Magazine. ''That leaves the opponent to sputter defensively, 'But I never said that.' ''
 The telltale indicators that a straw man trick is on the way are the introductory words ''there are those who say'' or ''some say.'' 
 ''In strawmanese, you never specify who 'those who' are,'' Mr. Safire said. ''They are the hollow scarecrows you set up to knock down.''
 Mr. Obama's straw men are not limited to the economy. On his maiden overseas trip, he shot down one after another in quick succession, for the benefit of students in Istanbul. ''Some people say that maybe I'm being too idealistic,'' he said. ''I made a speech in Prague about reducing and ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons, and some people said, ah, that will never happen. And some people have said, why are you discussing the Middle East when it's not going to be possible for the Israelis and the Palestinians to come together? Or why are you reaching out to the Iranians, because the U.S. and Iran can never agree on anything?''
 Who would not be ready to cheer the knockdown of such pessimism after all that? ''If we don't try, if we don't reach high, then we won't make any progress,'' Mr. Obama concluded.
 To Mr. Obama's credit, several pundits, including the Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum (who called his no-nukes speech ''quixotic''), dumped cold water on the idea of getting to a nuclear-free world anytime soon. And White House officials pointed to columns in both The New York Times (William Kristol) and The Washington Times (Jeffrey Kuhner) that criticized Mr. Obama for trying engagement with Iran's leaders. 
 But by saying ''Iranians,'' instead of the more specific ''Iran's leaders,'' Mr. Obama took that criticism a step further, before knocking it down. He did the same thing in his video message to the Iranian people in March. ''There are those who insist that we be defined by our differences,'' he said, before going on to quote a Persian poet who said ''the children of Adam are limbs to each other, having been created of one essence.''
 Jason DeSanto, a Democratic speechwriter and lecturer at Northwestern University, said Mr. Obama's rhetorical device reflected his search for common ground among foes. ''Some might say he pushes the various poles of the argument too far to the left and the right to find a middle ground,'' Mr. DeSanto said. ''It does project his own world view, but it can make him appear more reasonable.'' 
 Mr. Obama's backers say his use of straw men does not approach the level of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Indeed, just Thursday, Mr. Cheney offered this one: ''I might add that people who consistently distort the truth in this way are in no position to lecture anyone about values.'' 
 ''Intelligence officers of the United States,'' Mr. Cheney said, ''were not trying to rough up some terrorists simply to avenge the dead of 9/11.''

HEADLINE: People Magazine Still Has a Bikini Body

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: Generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
EVERY week, the multimillion-dollar question for Larry Hackett, the editor of People magazine, is whom to put on the cover. ''The cover sells the magazine,'' he said. ''The cover brings people into the big tent.''
 The difference between the top-selling People cover of 2008 (Angelina, Brad and their twins) and a bottom seller of 2008 (Madonna divorcing another husband) was 1.5 million newsstand copies and $6 million in revenue.
 So Mr. Hackett, 49, and his staff choose their covers wisely. Some weeks the winning formula calls for breaking reality-show news: Will Jon and Kate Gosselin, parents of eight children under the age of 9 and the stars of TLC's ''Jon & Kate Plus 8,'' split up over Jon's alleged affair with a 23-year-old third-grade teacher in Reading, Pa.? ''Kate Gosselin Talks to People: 'I Have a Lot of Anger,' '' (May 25, 2009). 
 Other weeks, it's a bit of crafty enterprise ginned up by People's body editor. ''Yes, we have a body editor,'' Mr. Hackett said. ''She's the one who alerted me that Valerie Bertinelli was offering to pose for us in a bikini.''
 Mr. Hackett wasn't sure a teenage star from a 1970s sitcom would sell, until he saw the photos. ''Valerie looked amazing,'' he said. ''She looked fantastic.''
 His instincts were good: ''Valerie Bertinelli Lost 50 LBs. Bikini Body at 48!'' (April 6) is the second-best-selling People cover this year, beaten out only by the Obama inauguration cover.
 Twenty- and 30-somethings falling in and out of love. Aging boomers growing out of and into their clothes. All part of a demographic formula that has kept People prospering while so many publications are reeling in these hard times.
 Most celebrity coverage skews young, but People has attained something unusual, attracting the young (18- to-34-year-olds are its biggest constituency, 38 percent of readership) while holding on to aging boomers (45 to 59 are second, 28 percent of readership).
 ''We need to satisfy both,'' Mr. Hackett said. There's a good economic reason. ''Compared to most, boomers remain economically sound,'' he said.
 And so, People is having a boomer year: there have been 10 covers featuring boomers in the first five months of 2009, compared with 11 in all for 2007. 
 While circulation at most celebrity magazines was down in the second half of 2008 -- In Touch Weekly (down 29 percent, to 899,000); Life & Style Weekly (down 31 percent, to 472,000); Us Weekly ( down 1.3 percent, to 1.9 million) -- People grew 2 percent to 3.7 million. The latest 2009 figures show the magazine's readership up 1.2 percent.
 OF course, it's tricky business as to which boomers will still sell and not chase away the young. ''We're constantly asking, 'Is this person going to vibe too old?' '' Mr. Hackett said.
 When People made its debut 35 years ago, as the magazine of mainstream American pop culture, boomer cover celebs were young, beautiful and in their prime. The annual top-selling covers in those years: Cher and Gregg (1975); Cher, Gregg and baby (1976); Olivia Newton-John (1978); Farrah Fawcett (1979).
 Today? ''Boomers are at an age when certain things happen to them,'' Mr. Hackett said. And they do. Take the all-boomer May 18 cover. In the left-hand corner was Elizabeth Edwards, cheated upon. In the right-hand corner, Farrah's final cancer fight. And smack in the center: Kirstie Alley, ''Yes, I Gained 83 LBS!''
 It's still possible for boomer men to get a cover just for being a hunk, but hardly ever true for women. In the last 10 years, five of People's annual ''sexiest men alive'' covers were boomers: George Clooney, Johnny Depp, Pierce Brosnan, Brad Pitt, Richard Gere. Not one of the annual 10 most beautiful women covers during that time was a boomer. The last ''most beautiful woman'' boomer cover? Michelle Pfeiffer in 1999 at 41. 
 People editors were slow to realize how well death sells. When Elvis died in 1977, he got one paragraph on the Star Tracks page. Since then, five of the six all-time best-selling covers on the newsstands have been about deaths: Sept. 11, 2001 (4.1 million); Goodbye Diana (2.9 million); John F. Kennedy Jr. (2.8 million); John Lennon (2.64 million); Princess Grace (2.62 million).
 It has been said that the three great cover moments are match, hatch and dispatch, and that does not leave boomers in a good spot. The 2006 cover of Steve Irwin, 44, the Animal Planet star killed by a stingray, sold over two million copies. (''It wouldn't have been as big if he'd been hit by a bus,'' Mr. Hackett said.)
 The cover on Tim Russert's death at 58 was a top-10 seller of 2008. In contrast, that week, In Touch did ''Angelina Speaks About Their Crisis at Home.'' 
 Against Ms. Bertinelli's bikini, In Touch did ''Angelina and Brad the Break Up.'' Against Ms. Alley's 83 unwanted pounds, In Touch did ''Jen and Brad Together Again.''
 ''The culture has not thrown up enough new celebrities,'' Mr. Hackett said. ''And if you keep going to the same ones over and over, you get reader fatigue.''
 Mr. Hackett has found multigenerational, multicover appeal to roller-coaster weight sagas like Ms. Alley's. ''It's like Kirstie's out there again,'' he said. ''She's like family -- we have traveled this road with Kirstie.''
 But Madonna, who is tied for 10th on the all-time list of People cover appearances with 13 (Princess Di ranks first with 54), was a case of going to a boomer once too often. ''People don't care anymore,'' Mr. Hackett said. ''They never bonded with her husband Guy Ritchie. There's a tsk, tsk and inappropriateness to her behavior.''
 Last week, for the June 1 cover, Mr. Hackett had four possibilities, including an exclusive interview with Bristol Palin, accompanied by photos of her in a high school graduation robe holding her baby.
 ''We're also on Farrah watch,'' he said. ''At this point Farrah has to die. It's the only cover left for her.''
 They were considering a second cover in a row on the troubled reality show couple, the Gosselins. ''If I could Hoover up some decent news,'' he said. ''They're on the boil.''
 The body editor had a story on a onetime teenage TV star in her 30's who'd put on the pounds, but was now ready to pose in a bikini for People. (''I'd appreciate if you don't use the name,'' Mr. Hackett said to me. ''I don't want to lose the element of surprise.'')
 AT a daily staff meeting, editors noted the Palin story's multigenerational appeal. They discussed ways to advance the Gosselin story. ''Anything about how the kids are doing?'' Mr. Hackett asked. ''Not going to their soccer games? Shows we're paying attention to the right things.'' He wanted a reporter watching the house. ''Let's be there when the guy goes to buy groceries.''
 They discussed the former teenage star now in her 30s, and an editor said: ''Speaking of bikini, should we catch up with Valerie Bertinelli? It's been two months.''
 ''Has it been that long?'' Mr. Hackett asked.
 Over the weekend, Mr. Hackett made the final cover call. There was no news on Farrah. ''Out of my control,'' he said. There was no big Gosselin breakthrough. ''Just drive-by reportage not worthy of a cover.'' The former teenage star now in her 30's and ready to pose in a bikini could hold a week.
 ''Bristol Palin,'' Mr. Hackett said. The photos were great, the appeal multigenerational: a baby, a proud grandmother, a young woman graduating high school and on the boil.

HEADLINE: When the Mind Is a Casualty of War

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I applaud Bob Herbert's insightful column ''War's Psychic Toll'' (May 19).
 Having served as a Navy psychiatrist during another unpopular war, Vietnam, I want to underline that much of the political and mental health fallout that we are seeing from this war is the unintended consequence of an all-volunteer military.
 Because there is no draft, the sons and daughters of most of our citizens are not being pressed into danger. Our leaders are largely insulated from the political consequences of having involved this country in a pointless and unending war. 
 The small size of our forces and the length of the war make repeated deployments inevitable. It has been clearly documented that two tours is the limit that most of our soldiers can take without serious psychic damage. With each tour after that, serious mental health problems increase exponentially. 
 In addition, the very real stigma regarding mental health issues prevent many from seeking treatment. In a professional army, one visit to a psychiatrist, or one prescription for Prozac, can ruin a career.
 We have put our people in an impossible situation. Voices like that of Bob Herbert will push our leaders to take this seriously.
 Robert L. Pyles Wellesley, Mass., May 20, 2009
 The writer is chairman of the American Psychoanalytic Association's Committee on Government Relations.
 To the Editor: 
 We at Veterans Across America have watched with dismay as the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts have dragged on, knowing the grim result: that thousands of badly scarred (physically and psychologically) young veterans will struggle to readjust to civilian life, wrestling with depression, homelessness, suicide -- or murderous rage.
 Bob Herbert mentions the ''psychic stress of the wars,'' which he rightly links to multiple tours of service. We would add that a significant portion of ''psychic stress'' is often economic stress -- which can be overwhelming for returning veterans. The Army sergeant accused of five killings at a counseling center in Iraq, John Russell, had fallen into debt on a $1,500-a-month-mortgage, and feared losing his paycheck and pension. 
 In our experiences with returning veterans, the stresses of remaking life after military service -- in the face of unemployment, lost jobs, crumbling marriages, home foreclosures, long delays in psychological treatment, and the psychic ravages of post-traumatic stress disorder -- can make life on the home front just as terrifying as life in a battle zone.
 We have conducted research on the need for business mentors as an economic lifeline for returning veterans. As a nation, we owe it to service members to ensure that the overwhelming stresses on them are substantially reduced. 
 Wes Poriotis Ray Healey New York, May 20, 2009
 The writers co-founded Veterans Across America in 2002.
 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert's assessment of the psychic toll of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan should open the eyes not only of the military in its handling of these cases, but also those of the public.
 Unfortunately, the stigma of psychological illness and diagnosis plagues our troops. Mental illness is still treated differently than a physical illness. A number of men and women in the military do not get treatment because post-traumatic stress disorder and depression that develop in war have no quick fixes, and they cannot be seen like an amputated limb and so go undiagnosed (or not believed).
 Until there is parity in treatments for all disabilities, both physical and psychological, we will continue to see terrible incidents like the one at the counseling center in Iraq.
 Gail T. Waters Durham, N.C., May 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 In psychoanalysis, a good interpretation can have the effect of shaking an analysand out of his defensive slumber. Bob Herbert's column did just that. Mr. Herbert courageously directed our attention beyond the body count of war to the often hidden psychological effects that can persist long after peace treaties have been signed.
 The need for mental health services for our veterans and their families is crucial. Mental health providers must understand the hidden impacts of trauma on families, particularly on developing children, and the potential for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. 
 One of the difficulties with post-traumatic stress disorder is that the readiness or need for treatment may emerge years after the trauma. Therefore, veterans and their families need long-term treatment options and long-term access to treatment, even if symptoms are not present at their time of discharge. 
 William H. Braun New York, May 19, 2009
 The writer is a psychoanalyst.
 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert says a lot of correct things in ''War's Psychic Toll,'' but none more accurate than that ''we should all be engaging in some form of serious sacrifice, and many more of us should be serving.'' After decades of ''volunteer service,'' producing the psychological morass we find many of our troops in, it's past time to reconsider the draft.
 Like solving the future of Social Security and Medicare, the draft has been a third rail our leaders will not touch. I believe that if they addressed these problems, they would find, instead of a resentful electorate, one thankful that the veil of doubt and fear of an unknown future is lifted.

The worst advertising market in decades has had a devastating, and well-documented, effect on newspapers, magazines and television networks. But now another recipient of ad dollars is being hurt by the market slump at a time it can little afford it: mass transit.
 In recent months, a company that sells many of the ads that appear on buses and trains and in stations in New York, Boston, Minneapolis and other cities has come up short in its payments to transit agencies, citing a sharp drop in ad rates and sales. 
New York is among the hardest hit. 
 The company, Titan Worldwide, fell short a total of $7.5 million in mandatory payments to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority from February through April, citing lower than expected ad sales. That would be enough to buy 16 new buses for the authority, which recently received a state bailout in the face of multibillion-dollar budget deficits over the next few years. 
 ''This is another example of the M.T.A.'s exposure to the global economic recession,'' said Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the authority, which plans to raise fares and tolls by about 10 percent in June. 
 Titan sells ads that appear on buses and in Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road trains and stations, including Grand Central Terminal. 
 Another company, CBS Outdoor, sells ads in the subway system, and it fulfilled its contractual requirement of making a $55 million lump-sum payment to the authority in January for all of 2009.
 A CBS spokeswoman, Jodi Senese, said that subway sales in New York remained strong, in spite of the overall industry slump, partly because of new types of ads in the system, like those on the exterior of subway cars.
 Companies like Titan and CBS make money by contracting with transit agencies and agreeing to sell ads that appear in their buses, trains and stations. The ad company agrees up front to make guaranteed payments to the transit agency or pay it a percentage of the receipts, whichever is greater. The company keeps the rest for expenses and profits. 
 At the end of the year, both Titan and CBS may be required to increase their payments to the authority, if a designated percentage of total sales exceeds what has already been paid. 
 Titan still owes the authority an additional amount for last year's ad sales. The company would not say how much it owed but said it intended to make the payment this year.
 The authority is negotiating with Titan over its inability to make its required monthly payments, and neither side would give details of the talks. 
 ''We're trying to work with them to find a way to keep this contract in place,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''Our goal is to work it out and minimize the impact on the M.T.A.'s bottom line.''
 Titan's chairman, William Apfelbaum, said that ad rates and sales have plummeted with the distressed economy, pushing the company's sales revenue this year down about 25 percent. 
 ''In my 30-plus years in the business there's never been a year that was down versus the prior year,'' he said. ''This is a first.''
 Mr. Apfelbaum said that he hoped to renegotiate his agreements with transit agencies ''to keep us from suffering catastrophic losses.''
 Titan's problems are much the same nationwide. 
 In Boston, Titan fell $321,000 short in its payment for March and April to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and it has told the authority, according to a spokesman, Joe Pesatauro. 
 ''This news from Titan certainly is not helping the situation,'' said Mr. Pesatauro, explaining that the authority is grappling with a projected budget deficit of $160 million for the fiscal year that starts on July 1.
 In Minneapolis and St. Paul, Titan paid Metro Transit, which provides bus and light rail service, about $100,000 less than the required $1 million payment for the first three months of this year, according to Bruce Howard, the transit agency's director of marketing. He said that ad sales during the period were about 20 percent below what they were the previous year. 
 Transit officials in Chicago, Philadelphia and with San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit system said that they had also been approached by Titan to renegotiate contract terms.
 The slump comes at an inopportune time for transit agencies, which have been hit hard by shrinking tax revenues and, in some cases, decreasing ridership. 
 Ad revenues make up only a small portion of total revenues at the agencies, but transit officials have been seeking to maximize income from such sources to help relieve the pressure for fare increases.
 According to the Federal Transit Administration's National Transit Database, transit agencies nationwide reported $334 million in ad revenue in 2007. That was about one percent of total operating funds.
 In New York, bus ad rates vary depending on what part of the city the buses travel, with rates in Manhattan being the highest, though the rates have been lowered in response to the slumping ad market. In Manhattan, an ad that covers one side of a bus typically sells for about $1,500 a month. At this time last year, the same ad sold for about $1,800, Mr. Apfelbaum said. 
 ''Warner Brothers came to us and said, 'We want the same exact schedule as last year but we're going to pay 20 percent less or you're not going to get it,' '' Mr. Apfelbaum said, referring to the number of ads placed by the entertainment company. 
 Mr. Apfelbaum said that while there are also fewer ads being sold, his company makes sure it keeps the ad spaces on buses and trains and in stations filled, because empty space would look bad. 
 Sometimes, he said, Titan will put up more ads than a customer has paid for, to fill what would be empty space. 
 Titan was created in 2001 and it has worked aggressively to win transit contracts.
 The company received the New York bus and commuter rail contract in December 2006. It agreed to make a minimum guaranteed payment of $823 million over the course of the 10-year contract, $103 million more than the next-highest offer. The minimum payments this year come to $5.4 million a month.
 As part of the contract, the company also agreed to pay the authority 72.5 percent of sales each year, if that amount was greater than the minimum payment. Mr. Apfelbaum said that is the highest percentage in the industry.
 But Mr. Apfelbaum said he had not overbid to win the contract. 
 ''This contract, in any kind of normal time, any year in my 35 years in the business except for 2009, is a profitable contract,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Power of a Nudge Toward Thrift

BYLINE: By TEDDY WAYNE

 BODY:
In ideal economic models, consumers weigh every purchase against a hypothetical alternative for that money -- the opportunity cost. But a paper forthcoming in The Journal of Consumer Research argues that people generally neglect opportunity cost unless they are prompted to consider it. 
 In a range of studies, consumers preferred the cheaper option in greater numbers when the price difference was made explicit -- when price difference was specified as residual cash, and when other uses of the money were suggested -- thus generating an opportunity cost in their minds. Consumers classified as frugal are evidently more predisposed than spendthrifts to calculate opportunity costs without cues.
 ''Sellers of expensive goods should trivialize opportunity costs,'' whereas marketers of cheap goods should suggest options for leftover cash, said Nathan Novemsky, an associate professor of marketing at the Yale School of Management who is one of the paper's authors.
 The researchers also say that neglect of opportunity cost plays a significant role outside of products. They contrast the 2002 State of the Union speech by President George W. Bush maintaining that the defense budget ''is never too high'' with a 1953 speech by President Dwight D. Eisenhower comparing the cost of a bomber plane with numerous foreclosed civic projects.

HEADLINE: With Billions at Stake, Trying to Expand the Meaning of 'Renewable Energy'

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The definition of renewable energy seems clear cut: The sun continues to shine, so solar energy is renewable. The wind continues to blow, so wind turbines churn out renewable power. 
 But industries are now pushing to have a growing number of other technologies categorized as renewable -- or at least as environmentally advantageous. They include nuclear power plants and the burning of garbage and even the waste from coal mines. 
 The lure of the renewable label is understandable. Federal tax breaks for renewable energy have been reauthorized, and quotas for renewable energy production have been set in 28 states, accompanied by extensive new grants, loans and other economic advantages. And legislation is moving through both houses of Congress to establish national quotas for renewable energy sources, including the climate bill passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday. 
 With billions of dollars at stake, legislators have been besieged by lobbyists eager to share in the wealth. 
 ''They've been queuing up outside staff offices, everyone with all their ideas as to what should be included,'' said Bill Wicker, the spokesman for the Democratic majority on the Senate energy committee, which is considering a national quota.
 In some states, the definition of ''renewable'' or ''alternative'' has already expanded. In Pennsylvania, waste coal and methane from coal mines receive the same treatment as solar panels and wind turbines. In Nevada, old tires can count as a renewable fuel, provided microwaves are used to break down their chemical structure. 
 About half of the 28 states with renewable mandates include electricity generated by burning garbage (the District of Columbia also has a quota for renewable energy). In Florida, the nuclear power industry is lobbying to be included but has not yet succeeded.
 Government incentives for renewable energy were intended to give an economic boost to technologies like wind and solar power that were not yet economically competitive with coal and natural gas, which together provide more than two-thirds of the country's electricity. 
 The benefits that go with the designation include renewable energy credits, which promise to be a valuable commodity if a national renewable energy standard becomes law and utilities with high levels of renewable sources can sell credits to those with less.
 If a source of electricity already widely used by some utilities -- hydropower or nuclear power, for example -- is deemed renewable, it allows utilities to meet the new renewable-energy requirements while doing little to add wind or solar power to the electrical grid. House Republicans tried unsuccessfully last week to have nuclear energy included under the climate bill passed by the House committee. 
 Environmental groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists, Environment America and the Natural Resources Defense Council say they are frustrated by the increasing elasticity of the word ''renewable'' in legislators' hands. 
 ''Usually this is a very political process, and not driven in any way, shape or form by any strict scientific or ecological definition of renewables,'' said Nathanael Greene of the N.R.D.C. 
 But some of the industries that have claimed the renewable mantle argue that they deserve it.
 ''A banana is renewable -- you can grow them forever,'' said Bob Eisenbud, a vice president for government affairs at Waste Management, which receives about 10 percent of its annual revenues of $13.3 billion from waste and landfill energy generation. ''A banana that goes into garbage and gets burned,'' he added, is ''a renewable resource and producing renewable energy.''
 But environmentalists argue that one of the goals of renewable energy is to cut back on the heat-trapping gases emitted from burning most things, whether fossil fuels or bananas. When there is no fire, there are no emissions. The waste-to-energy technology described by Mr. Eisenbud was not included in the original draft of the climate legislation that received House committee approval, but it was contained in the version that moved out of the committee, thanks to language inserted by Representative Baron P. Hill, Democrat of Indiana. A new $227 million waste-to-energy plant was already planned in northern Indiana, outside his district. 
 On the Senate side, an effort to get the benefits of the renewable designation for advanced coal-burning technologies failed, however. 
 Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico and chairman of the Senate energy committee, said that if too many new technologies beyond core renewable sources like wind and solar were to be included, ''the whole purpose of the renewable electricity standard is defeated.''
 The goal, he said, is ''to encourage the development of some of these newer technologies and bring the price down.''
 He added, ''If you throw in everything else'' and call it renewable, ''then your numbers get way out of whack.''
 Leon Lowery, a Democratic staff member for the committee, said that both environmentalists and industry had tinkered with the common-sense understanding of renewable sources to make definitions fit policy goals. 
 ''If you try to assign a sort of conceptual definition, you find yourself in strange places,'' Mr. Lowery said. ''Anyone would acknowledge that hydropower is renewable, but do we want to give credits to the Grand Coulee Dam?'' 
 To do so, he added, would give hydropower -- which already benefits from rich federal subsidies that make it some of the cheapest energy available -- the same status as solar or wind technologies.
 Among states that have already adopted quotas for renewable energy, the standards vary from Wisconsin's, which requires that 10 percent of all power come from renewable sources by 2015, to those of Oregon and Minnesota, which call for 25 percent from renewable sources by 2025. California is raising its mandate to 33 percent by 2020, though its utilities have already indicated that the existing quota -- 20 percent by 2010 -- will be difficult to meet.
 In some states, quotas for renewable energy are paired with mandates for advanced technologies that are not necessarily renewable. For example, Ohio, which currently receives nearly two-thirds of its electricity from burning coal, requires that 25 percent of the state's electricity must come from renewable or advanced technologies by 2025, but of that, half must come from core renewable sources, and some of the remainder can come from burning chemically treated coal.
 Graham Mathews, a lobbyist representing Covanta Energy, another waste-to-energy company, said the political horse-trading on renewable energy legislation was typical of all energy measures. ''Energy policy is balkanized by region, and that dictates the debate. The politics become incredibly complicated,'' he said. 
 ''Stepping back and looking at it,'' Mr. Mathews added, ''it sometimes doesn't make a lot of sense.''

HEADLINE: Let There Be Light, and Color, on Fifth Avenue

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Music has been restored. 
 That is to say, the 77-year-old painted Gothic Revival window of that name -- a stained-glass celebration of the glory of religious music -- has been refurbished and is returning, piece by piece, to St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street in Midtown. 
 For several weeks now restorers have been toiling outdoors on scaffolding 50 feet up, reinstating 12 windows to their rightful place at the north and west sides of the church. Built in 1914, St. Thomas is renowned for its London-made windows, its choir school and for recitals on its Ernest M. Skinner organ. 
 The 32-by-18-foot ''Music'' with its 18,000 pieces of colored glass was one of 12 windows removed from the church last year as part of a formidable two-year-long restoration intended to renew the splendor of its 33 windows with 9 million panes of glass designed by the firm of the architect Ralph Adams Cram. The windows' absence was hidden by great translucent vinyl window scrims, printed with stained-glass images, suspended 55 feet above the church sanctuary. 
 The real windows were transported to nine glass-restoration studios from Massachusetts to California, where the glass was cleaned and patched, and then releaded. The renovation of the largest windows required 4,500 worker hours: the equivalent of the labor of one artisan for two and a half years. The scrims are expected to come down -- revealing the north windows' full majesty -- by the end of the summer. 
 ''This is exacting work,'' said Julie L. Sloan, a glass-conservation consultant from North Adams, Mass., who is overseeing the project. Each window section weighs 20 to 50 pounds, thanks to the heft of the lead that holds the panes in place. ''The windows are robust, yet the glass is fragile.'' 
 The windows, installed from 1927 to 1974, were mostly created by James Powell & Sons of Whitefriars in London, a long-shuttered, but still revered, maker. Each Powell & Sons window is marked with a distinctive, diminutive signature portrait of a white-robed friar. 
 On a recent afternoon, with music from the Skinner emanating from inside the church, the restorers sweated to reinstall the windows, each protected within a 30-foot-high plywood construction shed that provided a platform for the laborers and kept weather out of the church. 
 The windows had been covered in grit through the decades, and some panes had cracked. Worse, the lead holding the glass together had corroded, causing some windows to bow out, jeopardizing their structural integrity. 
 Ms. Sloan pointed to a broken piece that had been painstakingly repaired with a silicone adhesive. There, the Glory of God had been cracked: that is, a 7-inch-long piece of a 25-inch panel proclaiming, in capital letters, ''To the Glory of God,'' had fissured through the generations from the incessant pressure of freezing and thawing water.
 The beauty of transmitted light is the essence of these windows' art, but ''you couldn't even see the broken glass for all the dirt,'' Ms. Sloan said. ''It is glorious now to see the light shining through these clean panes.'' 
 The $22 million window restoration project was announced last spring as the most expensive ever undertaken in the United States. Now St. Thomas expects to spend $9 million to $10 million to complete the initial 12 windows. Given the recession and its impact on the church's finances, the second phase -- the southern windows -- ''will be postponed for a period of time,'' said William H. Wright, the church's senior warden. 
 He added: ''Last fall the economic environment radically changed. We remain a healthy institution, but our finances and support have changed markedly. In the future we are looking at the potential of addressing windows individually, not as a group. But any window that is in imminent danger will be attended to.'' 
 The windows were difficult to dislodge, since their ancient glazing putty was rock hard, and chisels and days of effort were required to release the larger windows. They haven't been all that much easier to install. ''This work is a lot of heavy lifting, yet it's fussy,'' Ms. Sloan said. 
 On the scaffold, Andy Cushen, 43 -- a conservator from Jack Cushen Studio Restoration Inc. in East Marion, N.Y., on Long Island -- was muscling a newly refurbished 20-pound segment into place. The crew was installing it not with putty or sealants, but with a mortar of lime, which is expected to last for a century. 
 ''It's a great feeling now,'' Mr. Cushen said as he peered through the rainbow of glass, ''to be able to see the light.''

HEADLINE: Webcast Your Brain Surgery? Hospitals See Marketing Tool

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

 BODY:
The point of Shila Renee Mullins's brain surgery was to remove a malignant tumor threatening to paralyze her left side. 
 But Methodist University Hospital in Memphis also saw an opportunity to promote the hospital to prospective patients.
 So, a video Webcast of Ms. Mullins's awake craniotomy, in which the patient remains conscious and talking while surgeons prod and cut inside her brain, was promoted with infomercials and newspaper advertisements featuring a photograph of a beautiful model, not Ms. Mullins.
 This time, Methodist did not use billboards as it has with other operations, deeming this procedure too sensitive. But its marketing department monitors how many people have watched the Webcast (2,212), seen a preview on YouTube (21,555) and requested appointments (3). 
 ''The goal is to further our reputation as well as to educate the community, who will ask their physicians about our care,'' said Jill Fazakerly, Methodist's marketing director. 
 Faced with economic pressures and patients with abundant choices, hospitals are using unconventional, even audacious, ways of connecting directly with the public. Seeking to attract or educate patients, entice donors, gain recognition and recruit or retain top doctors, hospitals are using Twitter from operating rooms, showing surgery on YouTube and having patients blog about their procedures. 
 They consider the methods inexpensive ways to stand out in an era of reality TV and voluminous medical information available online. 
 Some ethicists and physicians say the practices raise questions about patient privacy and could paint overly-rosy medical pictures, leaving the hospitals and patients vulnerable if things go awry. 
 Jeffrey P. Kahn, a University of Minnesota bioethicist, sees ''value in demystifying medical care,'' but said this ''creates an aura of sophistication and high-tech ability'' that may not represent ''quality of care at a hospital.''
 ''Do we really want to treat health care like other consumer goods?'' he asked.
 Tony Cotrupi, a health care marketing consultant, said hospitals ''have come to marketing dragging and kicking, but because things are so competitive they have to.'' Patients ''used to go like sheep wherever the doctor sent us,'' he said, and spent ''more time researching what kind of toaster to buy.'' 
 ''But now, you have the curious consumer,'' Mr. Cotrupi said, ''and hospitals are doing all they can to open up the kimono.''
 Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit uses Twitter from the operating room. 
 Bill Ferris, the hospital's Web services manager, said that during an operation to remove a man's kidney tumor, the surgeon, Dr. Craig Rogers, worried that the unexpectedly large tumor would require total kidney removal. 
 ''Gosh, this is big,'' Dr. Rogers said. ''Could I have picked a harder case for this?'' So an observing chief resident tweeted: ''Dr. Rogers is saying because the tumor is large he may have to do a radical (total) nephrectomy.''
 Then, ''some bleeding needed to be controlled,'' but ''we just tweeted right through it,'' Mr. Ferris said. Other Twitter-casts included a hysterectomy and a craniotomy, during which the hospital posted video on YouTube and photos, and the surgeon would ''literally scrub out for an hour and twitter.'' Hospitals say patients give consent and are not compensated.
 Mr. Ferris said: ''One concern is what happens if something goes wrong -- you're making this public in a very real-time way. Our general plan is we would gently take a break from the twittering if the situation became very dire. You don't necessarily want to be tweeting that somebody might be dying on the table, and God forbid the patient's family learns about it that way.'' 
 Methodist Hospital records an identical surgery on another patient, so if ''something unforeseen happens and you need the camera to cut away from the surgery, you can fall back on your previous surgery,'' Ms. Fazakerly said.
 E. Haavi Morreim, an ethicist at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, said ''If you don't show the bad along with the good, people can end up misinformed or with excessively optimistic expectations.'' 
 More than 250 hospitals now use YouTube, Facebook, Twitter or blogs, said Ed Bennett, Web strategy director for the University of Maryland Medical System.
 ''There's a lot of surprise hospitals are even doing this -- hospitals are extremely conservative,'' he said. 
 Scripps Health, which manages four hospitals in San Diego, searches Twitter daily for mentions of itself and tweets those people. Marc Needham, Scripps's Web technology director, likened the tweeting to ''a concierge service.'' But, he said, aware that ''it's very big brothery,'' he avoids contacting people who might respond '' 'Why the hell are you looking into my tweets?' '' 
 To a woman who tweeted about ''a $377 bill for a 5-minute pediatrician visit for my 2 kids. Seriously Scripps? Gouge much?,'' Mr. Needham tweeted, ''Sorry to hear about your frustrations.'' 
 The University of California at San Francisco's Memory and Aging Center's YouTube channel and Facebook page have drawn participants for hard-to-fill clinical trials and ''numerous people who say, 'Aha, that's what my loved one suffers from,' and seek care,'' said Dr. Bruce L. Miller, the center's director. Still, he said, because of ''legal issues about how much advice our staff can give,'' its Facebook page includes no doctors. 
 Genesis Health System in Davenport, Iowa, has patients blogging about their bariatric surgery. In California, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center's foundation used YouTube and blogging to gain support for its a long-shot campaign for a new earthquake-safe hospital. (It passed overwhelmingly.) 
 Not everything is high-tech. Tufts Medical Center recently covered floors under pregnancy-test racks in pharmacies and supermarkets with pitches ''to spend the next nine months with you'' to lure expectant mothers. 
 Dr. Oren Sagher, a neurosurgeon for the University of Michigan Health System, views these strategies with mixed feelings. A television advertisement includes him performing a craniotomy as Michigan fight song lyrics scroll by. ''Patients come to see me because 'You're the guy in the commercial,' '' he said. Still, he said, when promotions make ''second-rate'' hospitals seem like ''the cat's meow, that's not fair.''
 Ms. Mullins, 42, of Oakland, Tenn., agreed when Methodist asked ''if I would mind if they videotaped so other people could see what it was like.'' 
 The video, which unlike Methodist's other Webcasts was not shown live, vividly shows Ms. Mullins reciting ABCs while doctors separate tumor from brain. The surgery removed her tumor but could not prevent partial paralysis of her left arm, leaving her unable to work. The video includes her testimonial praising Methodist's care. 
 The neurosurgeon, Dr. Allen Sills, said he ''was sold on the concept from our marketing people that this would be a contribution to our patients and families and to future patients.'' 
 ''They do what they do, yes, to help market our center,'' he added, but ''we make it a point not to alter our routine.'' 
 In one unexpected marketing success, after Methodist advertised a coming brain-surgery Webcast, a man called, volunteering to be the patient. Methodist agreed. ''He told Dr. Sills that if he was operating live on the Web, he must be pretty darn good,'' Ms. Fazakerly said.
 Brain Webcasts also ''build business for our other departments,'' she said.
 One craniotomy viewer, Lang Wiseman of Arlington, Tenn., said that ''it enhances their image'' and that he was surprised ''something like that was going on in Memphis.''
 That is called ''the halo effect,'' said David Marlowe, past president of the American Hospital Association's Society for Healthcare Strategy and Market Development. ''If you can transplant my heart, you can probably fix my knee.''

HEADLINE: Work Losses Hit Mortgages Seen as Safe

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and JACK HEALY

 BODY:
As job losses rise, growing numbers of American homeowners with once solid credit are falling behind on their mortgages, amplifying a wave of foreclosures.
 In the latest phase of the nation's real estate disaster, the locus of trouble has shifted from subprime loans -- those extended to home buyers with troubled credit -- to the far more numerous prime loans issued to those with decent financial histories.
 With many economists anticipating that the unemployment rate will rise into the double digits from its current 8.9 percent, foreclosures are expected to accelerate. That could exacerbate bank losses, adding pressure to the financial system and the broader economy. 
 ''We're about to have a big problem,'' said Morris A. Davis, a real estate expert at the University of Wisconsin. ''Foreclosures were bad last year? It's going to get worse.''
 Economists refer to the current surge of foreclosures as the third wave, distinct from the initial spike when speculators gave up property because of plunging real estate prices, and the secondary shock, when borrowers' introductory interest rates expired and were reset higher. 
 ''We're right in the middle of this third wave, and it's intensifying,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''That loss of jobs and loss of overtime hours and being forced from a full-time to part-time job is resulting in defaults. They're coast to coast.''
 Those sliding into foreclosure today are more likely to be modest borrowers whose loans fit their income than the consumers of exotically lenient mortgages that formerly typified the crisis. 
 Economy.com expects that 60 percent of the mortgage defaults this year will be set off primarily by unemployment, up from 29 percent last year. 
 Robert and Kay Richards live in the center of this trend. In 2006, they took a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage -- a prime loan -- borrowing $172,000 to buy a prefabricated house. They erected the building on land they owned in the northern Minnesota town of Babbitt, clearing the terrain of pine trees with their own hands.
 Mr. Richards worked as a truck driver, hauling timber from a nearby mill. His wife oversaw the books. Together, they brought in about $70,000 a year -- enough to make their monthly mortgage payments of $1,300 while raising their two boys, now 11 and 16.
 But their truck driving business collapsed last year when the mill closed. Mr. Richards has since worked occasional stints for local trucking companies. His wife has failed to find clerical work.
 ''Every month that goes by, you get a little further behind,'' Mr. Richards said.
 Last June, they missed their first payment, and they have since slipped $10,000 into arrears. They are trying to persuade their bank to cut their payments ahead of a foreclosure sale.
 From November to February, the number of prime mortgages that were delinquent at least 90 days, were in foreclosure or had deteriorated to the point that the lender took possession of the home increased more than 473,000, exceeding 1.5 million, according to a New York Times analysis of data provided by First American CoreLogic, a real estate research group. Those loans totaled more than $224 billion.
 During the same period, subprime mortgages in those three categories increased by fewer than 14,000, reaching 1.65 million. The number of similarly troubled Alt-A loans -- those given to people with slightly tainted credit -- rose 159,000, to 836,000.
 Over all, more than four million loans worth $717 billion were in the three distressed categories in February, a jump of more than 60 percent in dollar terms compared with a year earlier.
 Under a program announced in February by the Obama administration, the government is to spend $75 billion on incentives for mortgage servicing companies that reduce payments for troubled homeowners. The Treasury Department says the program will spare as many as four million homeowners from foreclosure.
 But three months after the program was announced, a Treasury spokeswoman, Jenni Engebretsen, estimated the number of loans that have been modified at ''more than 10,000 but fewer than 55,000.''
 In the first two months of the year alone, another 313,000 mortgages landed in foreclosure or became delinquent at least 90 days, according to First American CoreLogic.
 ''I don't think there's any chance of government measures making more than a small dent,'' said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.
 Last year, foreclosures expanded sharply as the economy shed an average of 256,000 jobs each month. Since then, the job market has deteriorated further, with an average of 665,000 jobs vanishing each month. 
 Each foreclosure costs lenders $50,000, according to data cited in a 2006 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, so an additional two million foreclosures could mean $100 billion in lender losses.
 The government's recent stress tests of banks concluded that the nation's 19 largest could be forced to write off as much as a fresh $600 billion by the end of 2010, bringing their total losses to $1 trillion. The Federal Reserve concluded that these banks needed to raise another $75 billion.
 Many economists pronounce that assessment reasonable, while cautioning that it could become inadequate if foreclosures continue to accelerate.
 ''The margin for error is not that big,'' said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist for HIS Global Insight. ''It's kind of like, 'Let's keep our fingers crossed that we've seen the worst.' ''
 Among prime borrowers, foreclosure rates have been growing fastest in states with particularly high unemployment. In California, for example, the unemployment rate rose to 11.2 percent from 6.4 percent for the year that ended in March, while the foreclosure rate for prime mortgages nearly tripled, reaching 1.81 percent.
 Even states seemingly removed from the real estate bubble are seeing foreclosures accelerate as the recession grinds on. 
 In Minnesota, three of every five people seeking foreclosure counseling now have a prime loan, according to the nonprofit Minnesota Home Ownership Center.
 In Woodbury, Minn., Rick and Christine Sellman are struggling to persuade their bank to reduce their $2,200 monthly mortgage on their five-bedroom home. 
 Mr. Sellman, a construction worker, found some work putting in asphalt driveways last summer, but he is now receiving unemployment. Ms. Sellman's scrapbooking businesses shut down last summer. Since then, they have slipped $19,000 behind on their mortgage.
 ''We were always up on our house payments,'' Ms. Sellman said. ''You work so hard to keep what you have, and because of circumstances beyond our control now, there's nothing we can do about it.''

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Feeling the Pain From a Crippled Advertising Market

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
The worst advertising market in decades has had a devastating, and well-documented, effect on newspapers, magazines and television networks. But now another recipient of ad dollars is being hurt by the market slump at a time it can little afford it: mass transit.
 In recent months, a company that sells many of the ads that appear on buses and trains and in stations in New York, Boston, Minneapolis and other cities has come up short in its payments to transit agencies, citing a sharp drop in ad rates and sales. 
 New York is among the hardest hit. 
 The company, Titan Worldwide, fell short a total of $7.5 million in mandatory payments to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority from February through April, citing lower than expected ad sales. That would be enough to buy 16 new buses for the authority, which recently received a state bailout in the face of multibillion-dollar budget deficits over the next few years. 
 ''This is another example of the M.T.A.'s exposure to the global economic recession,'' said Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the authority, which plans to raise fares and tolls by about 10 percent in June. 
 Titan sells ads that appear on buses and in Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road trains and stations, including Grand Central Terminal. 
 Another company, CBS Outdoor, sells ads in the subway system, and it fulfilled its contractual requirement of making a $55 million lump-sum payment to the authority in January for all of 2009.
 A CBS spokeswoman, Jodi Senese, said that subway sales in New York remained strong, in spite of the overall industry slump, partly because of new types of ads in the system, like those on the exterior of subway cars.
 Companies like Titan and CBS make money by contracting with transit agencies and agreeing to sell ads that appear in their buses, trains and stations. The ad company agrees up front to make guaranteed payments to the transit agency or pay it a percentage of the receipts, whichever is greater. The company keeps the rest for expenses and profits. 
 At the end of the year, both Titan and CBS may be required to increase their payments to the authority, if a designated percentage of total sales exceeds what has already been paid. 
 Titan still owes the authority an additional amount for last year's ad sales. The company would not say how much it owed but said it intended to make the payment this year.
 The authority is negotiating with Titan over its inability to make its required monthly payments, and neither side would give details of the talks. 
 ''We're trying to work with them to find a way to keep this contract in place,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''Our goal is to work it out and minimize the impact on the M.T.A.'s bottom line.''
 Titan's chairman, William Apfelbaum, said that ad rates and sales have plummeted with the distressed economy, pushing the company's sales revenue this year down about 25 percent. 
 ''In my 30-plus years in the business there's never been a year that was down versus the prior year,'' he said. ''This is a first.''
 Mr. Apfelbaum said that he hoped to renegotiate his agreements with transit agencies ''to keep us from suffering catastrophic losses.''
 Titan's problems are much the same nationwide. 
 In Boston, Titan fell $321,000 short in its payment for March and April to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and it has told the authority, according to a spokesman, Joe Pesatauro. 
 ''This news from Titan certainly is not helping the situation,'' said Mr. Pesatauro, explaining that the authority is grappling with a projected budget deficit of $160 million for the fiscal year that starts on July 1.
 In Minneapolis and St. Paul, Titan paid Metro Transit, which provides bus and light rail service, about $100,000 less than the required $1 million payment for the first three months of this year, according to Bruce Howard, the transit agency's director of marketing. He said that ad sales during the period were about 20 percent below what they were the previous year. 
 Transit officials in Chicago, Philadelphia and with San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit system said that they had also been approached by Titan to renegotiate contract terms.
 The slump comes at an inopportune time for transit agencies, which have been hit hard by shrinking tax revenues and, in some cases, decreasing ridership. 
 Ad revenues make up only a small portion of total revenues at the agencies, but transit officials have been seeking to maximize income from such sources to help relieve the pressure for fare increases.
 According to the Federal Transit Administration's National Transit Database, transit agencies nationwide reported $334 million in ad revenue in 2007. That was about one percent of total operating funds.
 In New York, bus ad rates vary depending on what part of the city the buses travel, with rates in Manhattan being the highest, though the rates have been lowered in response to the slumping ad market. In Manhattan, an ad that covers one side of a bus typically sells for about $1,500 a month. At this time last year, the same ad sold for about $1,800, Mr. Apfelbaum said. 
 ''Warner Brothers came to us and said, 'We want the same exact schedule as last year but we're going to pay 20 percent less or you're not going to get it,' '' Mr. Apfelbaum said, referring to the number of ads placed by the entertainment company. 
 Mr. Apfelbaum said that while there are also fewer ads being sold, his company makes sure it keeps the ad spaces on buses and trains and in stations filled, because empty space would look bad. 
 Sometimes, he said, Titan will put up more ads than a customer has paid for, to fill what would be empty space. 
 Titan was created in 2001 and it has worked aggressively to win transit contracts.
 The company received the New York bus and commuter rail contract in December 2006. It agreed to make a minimum guaranteed payment of $823 million over the course of the 10-year contract, $103 million more than the next-highest offer. The minimum payments this year come to $5.4 million a month.
 As part of the contract, the company also agreed to pay the authority 72.5 percent of sales each year, if that amount was greater than the minimum payment. Mr. Apfelbaum said that is the highest percentage in the industry.
 But Mr. Apfelbaum said he had not overbid to win the contract. 
 ''This contract, in any kind of normal time, any year in my 35 years in the business except for 2009, is a profitable contract,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Test Ban Treaty

 BODY:
Nearly 17 years ago, after more than 1,000 explosions, the United States conducted its last underground nuclear test. President George H. W. Bush, following Russia and France, announced a voluntary moratorium and the other major nuclear powers -- Britain and China -- made the same pledge with more or less enthusiasm. Since then, 180 countries have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
 That's all very good news. The bad news is that the test ban treaty, which would go beyond the voluntary moratorium and legally bind states to not test, has never come into force. 
 That is because the United States and eight other nuclear-capable states whose participation is required -- China, North Korea, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Israel and Egypt -- have not ratified it.
 A formal ban on testing would make it harder for nuclear-armed states to build new weapons, and place another hurdle in the way of any country -- Iran comes immediately to mind -- thinking of starting an arsenal. North Korea's announcement that it had tested a nuclear device on Monday is a stark reminder of the many dangers out there. 
 In September 1996, President Bill Clinton was the first leader to sign the treaty. But the drive to bring it into force hit a wall three years later when the Senate voted 51 to 48 against ratification, with most Republicans opposed. President George W. Bush buried the pact even deeper during eight destructive years in which he disparaged arms control and weakened the international rules that for decades helped curb the spread of nuclear weapons. So it is important that President Obama has vowed to ''immediately and aggressively'' pursue ratification of the test ban treaty. He has asked Vice President Joseph Biden to shepherd the treaty in the Senate. 
 The campaign got an important boost from two Republican former secretaries of state, George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, who have urged ratification. Mr. Shultz was right when he said in Rome last month that the old arguments against the treaty -- cheaters might not be detected and the safety and viability of American weapons could not be guaranteed without testing -- have been put to rest by advances in technology. 
 A task force led by former Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, and Brent Scowcroft, a Republican former national security adviser, also concluded that the treaty is in America's national security interests. 
 Still, Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden will have to invest considerable effort and political capital to win ratification. Senate sources say no more than 63 senators would now vote for the treaty, four less than the two-thirds majority needed. Two key Republican senators who need to be won over are John McCain, who said in the 2008 presidential campaign that the treaty deserved another look, and Richard Lugar, former Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who has said he would ''study it thoroughly.''
 We hope they, and any others who are skeptical or undecided, will withhold final judgment until the administration completes a review that aims to answer their doubts with updated data. Another Senate defeat would probably doom the treaty forever. 
 One can shrug and say that such treaties are leftovers from the cold war. That is wrong, especially in a world where nuclear appetites are growing. 
 A test ban will make it technologically much harder for other countries to press ahead with weapons development. And if Washington has any hope of rallying diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions for constraining Iran's nuclear ambitions or North Korea's program, it has to show that it, too, is willing to play by the international rules. For both of those reasons, the Senate needs to ratify the test ban treaty.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 St. George Pushes
 Pause on Rebirth
 In the brightest moments of the building boom, St. George was set to cast aside its reputation as a forlorn neighborhood of government buildings and shops clustered around the ferry terminal on Staten Island. 
 Government agencies spent $160 million to revive the waterfront in the past decade and completed the restoration of the ferry terminal in 2005, according to the office of Staten Island borough president James P. Molinaro. 
 Developers rushed in with plans to build nearly 1,000 new condominiums. In October, the Department of City Planning approved a rezoning plan to encourage development of more shops and condos.
 But amid the recession, the transformation has come to a standstill: condo units sit unfinished; local agencies have laid off workers. Nearby businesses are suffering.
 Karl Reina, 49, of Karl's Klipper restaurant, which opened just steps from the terminal five years ago, benefited from the first glimpses of the neighborhood's turnaround. 
 But Mr. Reina said business dropped by 15 percent over the past two years. He talked about the neighborhood's troubles in a recent interview.
 Q. What signs have you noticed that the neighborhood has suffered?
 A. Places are going out of business. There have been some layoffs. Some of my bar patrons are out of work. Three years ago, we used to do a lot more business.
 Q. Who is most careful about spending?
 A. The office workers are cost-conscious. They'll have a bowl of soup for lunch and crusty bread. They really cut back on the drinks. It's a lot of Diet Coke and water.
 Q. What have you done to draw local customers who have less to spend?
 A. I just changed my special board. I keep it cost-minded. Today I have a chicken meatloaf sandwich with macaroni and cheese for $6.50. I try to get in one special a day.
 Q. What part of your business has remained strong?
 A. I'm lucky to have tourists. Some people stay for one cup of coffee. Some people for seven, eight beers. An Australian couple came back for our baby back ribs.

HEADLINE: Testing the Resolve Of Obama on Energy

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN 

 BODY:
The pursuit of independence from imported oil has thwarted every president since Richard M. Nixon. But making that push while also seeking steep reductions in emissions of the heat-trapping gases that cause global warming significantly compounds the degree of difficulty.
 In the six months before world leaders gather in this city to seek a deal on climate change, President Obama will face a true test of presidential grit as he tries to deliver on his call for transformational policies on energy and the environment. 
 Last week, Mr. Obama toasted two victories. At the White House, he drew car companies, environmentalists and governors of both parties behind new regulations that raise vehicle efficiency standards and curb tailpipe emissions. On Capitol Hill, the House Energy and Commerce Committee approved its version of the president's ''cap and trade'' plan to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. 
 Yet the tough calls facing Mr. Obama on the issue -- of policy, politics and diplomacy -- have only begun.
 Obstacles to Action
 A comprehensive health care overhaul in the United States, which has eluded Democratic presidents since Harry S. Truman, also poses immense challenges. Yet energy presents a harder challenge for two reasons.
 First, the domestic constituency for action on energy independence and climate change remains smaller and less intense. While mounting health care costs touch everyone, interest in major change on energy and the environment fluctuates with gasoline prices and attention from the news media. 
 Second, Democratic leaders in Congress have opted not to pursue energy legislation under filibuster-proof ''reconciliation'' procedures. That means Mr. Obama must attract 60 votes in the Senate to win; health changes can pass with just 50. 
 That leads to the first challenge Mr. Obama faces: pressing for the House to hold a floor vote. Some reluctant Democrats, chiefly moderates from energy-intensive states, want to dodge the political hazard of what Republicans call ''cap and tax'' without an assurance that the Senate also intends to move. 
 Even if the Senate cannot, Mr. Obama has strong incentive to seek House passage to convince other nations that the United States intends to lead. 
 ''The ultimate objective is to get something through the House so they can show the international community progress at Copenhagen,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, policy director for the 2008 presidential campaign of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who joined Mr. Obama in backing the cap-and-trade idea.
 Some Obama allies argue that prospects for Senate action remain bright. Cap-and-trade skeptics ''will write its obituary many times before Obama signs it,'' said Dan Weiss of the Center for American Progress.
 But final passage will require a second tough call: how hard Mr. Obama plans to press liberal backers to accept concessions needed to gain 60 votes, including on contentious issues like increased domestic drilling and more nuclear power.
 A breakthrough will also require cooperation by China, which has surpassed the United States as the world's leading emitter of heat-trapping gases. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, is scheduled to travel there this week, and Mr. Obama plans to visit this fall. But given Washington's continuing dependence on Chinese loans to finance its budget deficit, pushing Beijing is not easy.
 If Congress fails, Mr. Obama can act unilaterally, using powers the Environmental Protection Agency has asserted to regulate carbon emissions as a public danger. That would pit the president, acting alone, against all the economic interests threatened by his policy. Former Senator Timothy E. Wirth of Colorado, who leads the United Nations Foundation, said the ''nexus of negative interests'' -- including the oil, coal, utility and railroad industries -- made other business lobbies ''look like kindergarten play.''
 Sending a Warning
 Mr. Obama has always drawn high marks for brains and charisma. But aides insist that the president who shoved through a historic economic stimulus plan, steered Chrysler into bankruptcy and replaced his wartime commander in Afghanistan deserves more credit for being a strong leader who does what it takes to accomplish his big goals. 
 ''People always miss that toughness, that steel in him,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff.
 Mr. Emanuel called Mr. Obama's moves to reshape the auto industry an indicator of his determination to get results and a signal of what opponents will face on energy and environmental legislation. ''It would be a warning to all those other interests not to underestimate this president,'' he said. ''That would be a mistake.''
 But achieving Mr. Obama's goals will require a fight by more than just the president, said Mr. Wirth, who was in Copenhagen over the weekend for a meeting in advance of the December event. ''Rahm has to take it on'' as well, he said, mobilizing the administration's economic, environmental and national security power centers.
 ''Will they all pull in the same direction and take on the biggest of all economic coalitions?'' Mr. Wirth said. ''The jury's out.''

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Is Still a Possibility for Opel, Official Says

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Bankruptcy for Opel, the European unit of General Motors, remains a distinct possibility despite three offers for the unit, the German economy minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, said in an interview published on Sunday. 
 Though Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is to meet on Monday to consider the bids, there is no guarantee that any will be accepted, Mr. Guttenberg was quoted as saying by Bild am Sonntag.
 ''We must first have a high degree of certainty that the significant tax money we will have to provide is not lost,'' he was quoted as saying. Mr. Guttenberg, a member of Mrs. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, said that if the bids did not improve, ''an orderly insolvency'' would be best for Opel.
 Speaking to journalists in Berlin on Sunday, Mr. Guttenberg later said that although avoiding bankruptcy was desirable, it must still be option, said a spokesman, Steffen Moritz. Mr. Guttenberg also emphasized that an ''orderly insolvency'' would be a tool for restructuring, ''not the end of the company,'' Mr. Moritz said.
 Three companies have bid for Opel: Fiat, which has also bid for Vauxhall, G.M.'s British unit; RHJ International, a buyout company listed in Brussels; and Magna International, a Canadian auto parts maker that is being backed by Sberbank Rossii, a Russian bank.
 Opel, based in Russelsheim, is part of a G.M. business that sold 300,000 cars and light commercial vehicles last year in Germany. But Opel is struggling as a result of a crisis in the global auto industry and the problems of G.M., which is expected to file for bankruptcy protection by a June 1 deadline imposed by Washington, despite $19.4 billion in United States government aid.
 G.M., which wants to retain a stake in Opel, has said that it would also need billions of euros in aid from governments, principally Germany's, for a successful restructuring of its European operations.
 Mr. Guttenberg suggested Saturday that Fiat had improved its bid after some German officials and labor leaders expressed a clear preference for Magna's offer. Gualberto Ranieri, a spokesman for Fiat, said he had no comment on that. 
 Mr. Ranieri pointed to interviews that Sergio Marchionne, Fiat's chief executive, gave to the German news media this weekend in which he played down the effect that a takeover would have on Opel's work force. Workers at Opel fear that nearly 20,000 jobs could be lost if Fiat's bid is successful.
 Mr. Marchionne was quoted on Sunday by Bild am Sonntag as saying that ''fewer than 2,000'' German jobs would be lost under Fiat's control of Opel, from a total European work force reduction of fewer than 10,000. In an interview with Der Spiegel, to be published on Monday, he reportedly said he did not see a need to close any German plants. Fiat earlier disturbed union workers and government officials with a plan to shut an engine plant in Kaiserslautern that employs nearly 3,500 people. 
 Mr. Marchionne has spoken about the need to cut production by about 20 percent. But Mr. Ranieri said such a cut would not equate to a 20 percent reduction in jobs.

HEADLINE: North Korea Says It Tested Nuclear Device

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; Mark McDonald contributed reporting from Hong Kong and Mark Landler from Washington.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
North Korea announced on Monday that it had successfully conducted its second nuclear test, defying international warnings and drastically raising the stakes in a global effort to get the recalcitrant Communist state to give up its nuclear weapons program.
 The North's official news agency, KCNA, said ''The Democratic People's Republic of Korea successfully conducted one more underground nuclear test on May 25 as part of the measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defense in every way as requested by its scientists and technicians.'' 
 The test was safely conducted ''on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control,'' the agency said. ''The results of the test helped satisfactorily settle the scientific and technological problems arising in further increasing the power of nuclear weapons and steadily developing nuclear technology.'' 
 Word of the test sent a shudder through Asian financial markets and clearly caught South Korea and the United States off guard. The news hit just as South Korea's government and people were mourning the suicide of former President Roh Moo-hyun. And hours after the test was reported, South Korean state media reported that the North had fired a short-range missile.
 The nuclear test also came against a backdrop of uncertainty about North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il, and speculation about who might succeed him. Mr. Kim suffered a stroke last August, which prompted him to step up preparations to transfer power to one of his three known sons. Analysts believe the favorite son is his youngest, Kim Jong-un, who is in his mid-20s.
 North Korea conducted its first nuclear test on Oct. 9, 2006, which was considered something of a bust by South Korean and American officials. If the North's second test was more of a success, it could mean that North Korea has bolstered its atomic weapons capabilities -- and its leverage over the United States, which has sought to denuclearize the North.
 In Washington, the Obama administration had a cautious initial reaction to the news early Monday. ''We are aware of the reports of a nuclear test by North Korea,'' said a senior State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the department was still gathering information. ''We are consulting with our allies. Once we have established the facts, we will have more to say.''
 Hints that the North had conducted a test first emerged Monday morning when South Korean authorities detected an artificially triggered earth tremor emanating from the area of Kilju, in northeast North Korea, said Lee Dong-kwan, spokesman of the office of President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea.
 The spokesman said ''intelligence officials of South Korea and the United States are analyzing the data and closely monitoring the situation.''
 Earlier Monday, North Korea announced that Kim Jong-il had sent a message expressing ''profound condolences'' to the widow of Mr. Roh, who had pursued a more conciliatory policy toward the North. It remained unclear whether Mr. Kim would send a delegation to Mr. Roh's funeral slated for Friday.
 Relations between the Koreas have plunged since Mr. Roh's successor, Mr. Lee, took office in February 2008, promising to reverse the ''sunshine policy'' of promoting political reconciliation with Pyongyang with economic aid.
 Agreements resulting from a 2007 summit meeting called for the South to spend billions of dollars to help rebuild the impoverished North's dilapidated infrastructure. Mr. Lee believed that such aid must be linked to improvements in the North's human rights record and the dismantling of its nuclear facilities.
 North Korea has viciously attacked Mr. Lee, calling him a ''national traitor,'' cutting off official dialogue and reducing traffic across the countries' heavily armed border.
 North Korea had given some advance notice before its first nuclear test, in 2006, and that initial test also was conducted in the northeast. 
 North Korea had recently threatened to conduct a second nuclear test, citing what it called Washington's ''hostilities.''
 The new test comes against a backdrop of heightened tensions between North Korea and the United States, which keeps a heavy military deployment in South Korea.
 Two American journalists are scheduled to be tried June 4 in North Korea, charged with illegal entry into the North and ''hostile acts,'' and that case in particular has aggravated tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. The relationship was already strained by the North's launching of a long-range rocket on April 5.
 After that launch, Washington pressed the United Nations Security Council to tighten sanctions on the North. In retaliation, Pyongyang expelled United Nations nuclear monitors, while threatening to restart a plant that makes weapons-grade plutonium and to conduct a nuclear test.
 This month, one day after an American diplomat offered new talks on North Korea's nuclear program, the North said it had become useless to talk further with the United States.
 ''The study of the policy pursued by the Obama administration for the past 100 days since its emergence made it clear that the U.S. hostile policy toward the D.P.R.K. remains unchanged,'' the North Korean Foreign Ministry said, using the initials for the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
 In comments carried by KCNA, the ministry said: ''There is nothing to be gained by sitting down together with a party that continues to view us with hostility.''
 The rebuff came as Stephen W. Bosworth, the American special envoy on North Korea, began a trip to Asia with a fresh offer of dialogue. The North's vow to ''bolster its nuclear deterrent'' came just hours before Mr. Bosworth was due to arrive in Seoul.
 The North's first nuclear test was widely condemned, but it created a new urgency in the six-party talks that had failed to prevent the blast. The parties to the talks are the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia.
 In February 2007, Washington agreed to ease sanctions against banks dealing with Pyongyang, and North Korea concurrently agreed to a process that would lead to the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program. North Korea would receive deliveries of fuel oil in exchange for certain verifications that it was ending its program.
 But last December the process collapsed when North Korea rejected the verification measures being sought by the Bush administration.

HEADLINE: State Of Paralysis

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
California, it has long been claimed, is where the future happens first. But is that still true? If it is, God help America.
 The recession has hit the Golden State hard. The housing bubble was bigger there than almost anywhere else, and the bust has been bigger too. California's unemployment rate, at 11 percent, is the fifth-highest in the nation. And the state's revenues have suffered accordingly.
 What's really alarming about California, however, is the political system's inability to rise to the occasion. 
 Despite the economic slump, despite irresponsible policies that have doubled the state's debt burden since Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor, California has immense human and financial resources. It should not be in fiscal crisis; it should not be on the verge of cutting essential public services and denying health coverage to almost a million children. But it is -- and you have to wonder if California's political paralysis foreshadows the future of the nation as a whole.
 The seeds of California's current crisis were planted more than 30 years ago, when voters overwhelmingly passed Proposition 13, a ballot measure that placed the state's budget in a straitjacket. Property tax rates were capped, and homeowners were shielded from increases in their tax assessments even as the value of their homes rose. 
 The result was a tax system that is both inequitable and unstable. It's inequitable because older homeowners often pay far less property tax than their younger neighbors. It's unstable because limits on property taxation have forced California to rely more heavily than other states on income taxes, which fall steeply during recessions.
 Even more important, however, Proposition 13 made it extremely hard to raise taxes, even in emergencies: no state tax rate may be increased without a two-thirds majority in both houses of the State Legislature. And this provision has interacted disastrously with state political trends. 
 For California, where the Republicans began their transformation from the party of Eisenhower to the party of Reagan, is also the place where they began their next transformation, into the party of Rush Limbaugh. As the political tide has turned against California Republicans, the party's remaining members have become ever more extreme, ever less interested in the actual business of governing.
 And while the party's growing extremism condemns it to seemingly permanent minority status -- Mr. Schwarzenegger was and is sui generis -- the Republican rump retains enough seats in the Legislature to block any responsible action in the face of the fiscal crisis. 
 Will the same thing happen to the nation as a whole?
 Last week Bill Gross of Pimco, the giant bond fund, warned that the U.S. government may lose its AAA debt rating in a few years, thanks to the trillions it's spending to rescue the economy and the banks. Is that a real possibility?
 Well, in a rational world Mr. Gross's warning would make no sense. America's projected deficits may sound large, yet it would take only a modest tax increase to cover the expected rise in interest payments -- and right now American taxes are well below those in most other wealthy countries. The fiscal consequences of the current crisis, in other words, should be manageable. 
 But that presumes that we'll be able, as a political matter, to act responsibly. The example of California shows that this is by no means guaranteed. And the political problems that have plagued California for years are now increasingly apparent at a national level. 
 To be blunt: recent events suggest that the Republican Party has been driven mad by lack of power. The few remaining moderates have been defeated, have fled, or are being driven out. What's left is a party whose national committee has just passed a resolution solemnly declaring that Democrats are ''dedicated to restructuring American society along socialist ideals,'' and released a video comparing Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to Pussy Galore. 
 And that party still has 40 senators.
 So will America follow California into ungovernability? Well, California has some special weaknesses that aren't shared by the federal government. In particular, tax increases at the federal level don't require a two-thirds majority, and can in some cases bypass the filibuster. So acting responsibly should be easier in Washington than in Sacramento. 
 But the California precedent still has me rattled. Who would have thought that America's largest state, a state whose economy is larger than that of all but a few nations, could so easily become a banana republic?
 On the other hand, the problems that plague California politics apply at the national level too.

HEADLINE: Key to Power In Court Pick

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As President Obama prepares to replace Justice David H. Souter on the Supreme Court, conventional wisdom says his nominee will have little chance to change the court because all the contenders appear to share Justice Souter's approach on social issues, like abortion rights.
 But the effect on presidential power could be pivotal. Important rulings on executive authority -- striking down military commissions and upholding habeas corpus rights for Guantanamo detainees -- have been decided by a five-vote majority, including Justice Souter, on the nine-member court.
 ''Given that the decisions have generally been 5-4 in this area, this could be terribly consequential,'' said David Golove, a New York University law professor. ''We're losing one of the court's strongest leaders on the side of limiting executive power to reasonable bounds. If the person who replaces Souter is different than him, the balance of power may shift.''
 Most of the half-dozen or so candidates Mr. Obama is weighing have little by which to gauge whether their appointment might create a majority with greater sympathy for the White House. 
 But one, Judge Diane P. Wood of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, has expressed doubts about claims of sweeping executive powers in national security matters. Another, Solicitor General Elena Kagan, has a history of advocating for presidential powers in domestic matters, along with a mixed record of statements on counterterrorism issues.
 The scope of executive power has become the subject of a profound debate since the Sept. 11 attacks. Bush administration lawyers argued that the president's war powers could override laws and treaties, a theory at the heart of policies on harsh interrogations, surveillance without warrants and the detainees at the prison at the naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
 Some of former President George W. Bush's greatest setbacks came when the Supreme Court rejected such arguments. And while Mr. Obama has not embraced the Bush administration's most expansive theories, he appears to be on his own collision course with the court.
 His administration is appealing a ruling that some detainees in Afghanistan have habeas corpus rights. And he has announced other policies, including revised military commissions and a system of prolonged preventive detention without trial, that are likely to be challenged.
 Moreover, the broad powers Mr. Obama has employed in the economic crisis, like his virtual takeover of the American auto industry, could generate a new category of cases that would turn on how much deference the court gives to the executive branch.
 ''If Obama is really serious about national security, he ought to be looking for a justice who won't try to micromanage in this area,'' said Ed Whelan, a Bush administration lawyer. ''He'll also want a strong proponent of executive power to review his aggressive domestic measures.''
 All three of Mr. Bush's Supreme Court nominees -- Samuel A. Alito Jr., Harriet E. Miers and John G. Roberts Jr. -- were current or former executive branch lawyers whose records suggested a robust view of presidential power. Ms. Miers's nomination was withdrawn.
 By contrast, one person near the top of Mr. Obama's short list -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit -- has never worked in the executive branch and sits on a court that hears few executive power cases.
 Two other potential candidates, Janet Napolitano and Jennifer M. Granholm, have been governors, and Ms. Napolitano is now the homeland security secretary. Still, neither has worked extensively on legal issues about presidential power.
 Judge Wood has served several stints in the executive branch, where her work focused on antitrust issues. But in a 2003 essay, she warned that steps proposed in the fight against terrorism, like diminishing privacy to facilitate executive surveillance, posed a threat to the rule of law. 
 ''In a democracy, those responsible for national security (principally, of course, the executive branch) must do more than say 'trust us, we know best' when they are proposing significant intrusions on liberties protected by the Constitution,'' she wrote. 
 And in a lecture about legal issues related to natural disasters, published in 2008, Judge Wood suggested that she would view trying terrorism suspects in military commissions, as Mr. Obama has proposed, with suspicion.
 ''In the related area of military justice, the principle is well established that extraordinary tribunals, such as military commissions, are not authorized to operate if the normal courts are open for business,'' she wrote.
 Ms. Kagan's history, by contrast, suggests a greater sympathy for executive interests. She worked in the White House under President Bill Clinton when he was at odds with a Republican Congress and seeking ways to achieve his agenda unilaterally. 
 As a Harvard law professor, she wrote an article defending steps Mr. Clinton had taken to centralize control over government agencies. She called it ''ironic'' that ''self-professed conservatives'' had been the loudest advocates of executive power in recent decades because a muscular presidency could change the status quo and achieve ''progressive goals.''
 She also argued that the president had more power to command agency decisions than many scholars believed. Unless Congress has explicitly banned White House interference, she said, laws granting authority to an official -- like giving the Environmental Protection Agency administrator the responsibility to set allowable pollution levels -- should be interpreted as giving the president an unwritten power to override those decisions.
 Later, in her solicitor general confirmation hearing, Ms. Kagan said the president had the authority to indefinitely detain, without a trial, someone suspected of helping to finance Al Qaeda.
 She also said that she, like any solicitor general, would not defend a statute that ''infringes directly on the powers of the president,'' because ''there are occasional times where presidential power still exists, even if Congress says otherwise.'' But, she added, that category was ''exceedingly narrow.''
 After her mid-March appointment, she joined a legal team that has battled to restrict detainee rights and has invoked the so-called state secrets privilege to block lawsuits involving surveillance and torture.
 Much of that litigation was in motion before she arrived, and it is not clear whether, if named to the bench, she would recuse herself from ruling on such cases. 
 But Ms. Kagan has also expressed skepticism about expansive presidential war powers. In 2007, she delivered a lecture at West Point praising Bush administration lawyers who threatened to resign over the program of surveillance without warrants, which they believed was illegal.
 ''The world is watching whether, under this provocation, we adhere to our self-declared principles,'' she said. ''And the world will properly condemn us to the extent we become lawless.''
 Whoever replaces Justice Souter will join a court whose members hold strong opinions on both sides of the executive power issue.
 In the decision striking down military commissions, for example, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said trials controlled by the executive alone raised constitutional concerns ''of the highest order'' because ''concentration of power puts personal liberty in peril of arbitrary action by officials.''
 In a dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas said the majority's opinion had ''dangerous implications for the executive's ability to discharge his duties as commander in chief'' and ''openly flouts our well-established duty to respect the executive's judgment in matters of military operations and foreign affairs.''

HEADLINE: Statehouse Journal: In Utah, a National Debate About the G.O.P. Plays Out on a Smaller Stage

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah, a hugely popular Republican from one of the nation's most conservative states, made waves and headlines in recent months by suggesting that his party would need to move toward the center to start winning national elections again.
 With his support for President Obama's economic stimulus plan, his successful effort to ease the state's method of regulating liquor sales and his advocacy of civil unions to protect same-sex couples, Mr. Huntsman ignited a debate over what the Republican Party here should be. 
 Now he has been chosen by the president to be the next ambassador to China. But in exiting stage left, assuming Mr. Huntsman is confirmed by the Senate, he leaves the debate he began unfinished. 
 Conservative Republicans say the state party will stay right of center; Democrats agree and say they think voters will respond by looking for moderate alternatives in the mold of Mr. Huntsman -- perhaps Republican, perhaps even Democratic. 
 Scholars say that Utah's demographic portrait is changing, especially with the fast growth of the Hispanic population, but that only time will tell where those changes go and how prescient Mr. Huntsman proved to be.
 His would-be successor, Lt. Gov. Gary R. Herbert, is regarded as a staunch conservative and is already distancing himself from some of Mr. Huntsman's positions, including support for same-sex civil unions. Supporters say Mr. Herbert, who has said he will run in a special election next year to fill out the rest of Mr. Huntsman's second term, through 2012, will lead the party back to conservative orthodoxy. Other conservatives have said they may challenge him for the nomination if he does not.
 ''Conservatives are shouting from the rooftops,'' said Adam Brown, an instructor in political science at Brigham Young University in Provo.
 But Democrats, in expressing their own hopes, are suggesting that Mr. Huntsman was right in his take on the demographic trends that are driving the electorate. They point to the drift away from the Republican brand in last fall's election by younger and first-time voters in Utah, and to the growing numbers of Hispanic voters, who tend to support Democrats. Mr. Herbert, they say -- in tipping their hand about the likely tone of the next campaign season -- is too conservative for the evolving, diverse, urbanized state that Utah is becoming.
 The added wild card, both sides say, is Mr. Obama. Although he lost in Utah last fall, he won in Salt Lake County, the biggest county by population, although his victory was by a slim 296-vote margin over Senator John McCain out of about 370,000 votes cast. 
 By selecting Mr. Huntsman, who is lionized in much of the state and won re-election in November with 78 percent of the vote, Mr. Obama has linked his name to Mr. Huntsman's golden glow, further spicing a stew that might blur party lines and loyalties in the special election for governor.
 ''Obama will be an important figure for Western Democrats,'' said State Senator Patricia W. Jones, a Democrat and the minority leader. ''The fact that he picked our Republican governor -- not only was it the perfect choice, it says a lot about the president.''
 Mr. Herbert said in an interview at the Capitol that he mostly intended to stay the course Mr. Huntsman set, especially on fiscal and economic affairs. But where they differ on social and environmental issues -- Mr. Huntsman, for example, supported initiatives to fight climate change, while Mr. Herbert said he thought the science was still out on how much global warming is caused by human activity -- Mr. Herbert said he will speak to and for Utahans in a way that Mr. Huntsman, whose presidential ambitions are well known, did not.
 ''Governor Huntsman has been talking to a national stage,'' said Mr. Herbert, a 62-year-old real estate developer. ''I'm talking to a State of Utah stage, and that's a different audience.''
 Mr. Huntsman declined an interview request because of the pending Senate confirmation hearings.
 Geography may also partly dictate whether Utah swerves right or follows Mr. Huntsman's playbook toward the center. Salt Lake County has elected increasing numbers of Democrats to local and state legislative offices. And it went for Mr. Obama in November. But that was more than countered by Utah County, the second-biggest county by population, where Mr. McCain got more than 75 percent of the vote. Utah County, with Provo as its largest city, is Mr. Herbert's home base, and he served on the county commission for 14 years.
 Utahans have elected Democratic governors in the past, most recently Scott M. Matheson, who served from 1977 to 1985. And the Matheson name is another potential wrinkle standing in the way of what Republicans hope will be a restoration of traditional party spirit after Mr. Huntsman.
 Representative Jim Matheson, a Democrat, is the son of the former governor and a possible challenger to Mr. Herbert. He is popular among Republicans in much the same way Mr. Huntsman was among Democrats in his first election as governor in 2004 and again last fall. 
 Mr. Matheson represents Utah's Second Congressional District, which comprises the eastern half of Salt Lake County, the northern tip of Utah County and 14 eastern and southern Utah counties. In each of his last four elections, he got more Republican votes each time -- peaking last fall at 30 percent among people who described themselves as ''strong Republicans'' and at about 65 percent among ''weak Republicans,'' according to a study at the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young. (Mr. McCain got 62 percent of the vote in Utah.)
 ''It's not the doom of the Republican Party in Utah, but it does suggest some warning signs,'' said Quin Monson, an assistant professor of political science at Brigham Young, who conducted the study.

HEADLINE: Boy Band Is Starting To Feel The Heat

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The Jonas Brothers sat backstage recently at the El Rey Theater here, politely answering questions from a small cluster of reporters about their new CD. Publicists conducted SWAT-team surveillance.
 In the end nobody had the temerity -- or the opportunity, since the interview session was cut short -- to ask the tough question: Are the Jonas Brothers fizzling as a full-blown Walt Disney Company franchise?
 It's a notion that Disney, the world's largest media company, thinks is ludicrous. ''Hot as a pistol'' is how Abbey Konowitch, general manager of Hollywood Records, the Disney-owned label, describes them.
 Mr. Konowitch noted that the pop band's summer tour, a three-continent extravaganza built around the brothers' fourth studio album, ''Lines, Vines and Trying Times,'' sold over 800,000 tickets in its first weekend, no small feat in a dismal economy. The new CD, inspired in part by the music of Neil Diamond, arrives in stores on June 16 amid a flood of publicity, including a Rolling Stone cover and a free concert in Central Park. 
 The Jonas Brothers are trying to expand beyond the Disney footprint and shouldn't be evaluated as a company franchise, said Johnny Wright, the group's co-manager. ''We consult with Disney, but Disney doesn't tell us what to do,'' he said. The band's outside efforts include a line of branded energy drinks and starring roles in ''Walter the Farting Dog,'' a movie for 20th Century Fox based on the best-selling children's book. (The trio had cameo roles of a sort in ''Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,'' which was the No. 1 movie at the box office over the weekend.)
 ''People are wrong when they say the bubble has burst,'' Mr. Wright continued. ''It's just changing. We are focused on longevity and transitioning to a slightly older audience. When you do that, you risk losing some of your core fan base.''
 Still, Disney is counting on the cherubic musicians -- Kevin, 21, Joe, 19, and Nick, 16 -- to be more than just pop stars. The company's profit engines are creative franchises like ''Hannah Montana'' that spawn merchandising, movie and theme park spin-offs, and Disney has been putting considerable muscle into broadening the Jonases' beyond music.
 So far results have been mixed.
 Their debut film, ''The Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience,'' was a dud, selling just $19.2 million in tickets at North American theaters in February. Disney had hoped that the movie would generate sales of about $40 million, according to a senior studio executive.
 Mr. Konowitch said expectations for ''The 3D Concert Experience'' were unfairly high, noting that the band had just come off a lengthy tour that enabled most fans to see the trio in person. Mr. Wright said, ''It irks me when people say the movie was a flop. If $19 million is a flop, I'll take it.''
 Mr. Konowitch also doused some cold water on Miley Cyrus's drawing power, saying that her concert movie, ''Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds,'' became a phenomenon that sold $65.3 million in 2008 partly because the Jonas Brothers appeared in it as well. Ms. Cyrus did not appear in the Jonas movie.
 Television is also proving a bit bumpy for them. ''Jonas,'' a new Disney Channel comedy that stars the brothers, had its debut on May 2 to an audience of 2.4 million kids ages 6 to 14, the target demographic, according to Nielsen Media Research.
 That was enough to put the show at No. 1 -- beating tough counterprogramming on Nickelodeon -- but it was also Disney Channel's second-lowest live-action premiere in nearly four years. The target audience sunk sharply in its second week, but the show rebounded. The ratings performance is surprising given that ''Camp Rock,'' the Disney Channel musical starring the brothers, was the No. 1 cable telecast for 2008.
 Does the band feel pressure to have a big summer?
 ''We're all about taking those gradual steps,'' Nick Jonas said. His brother Kevin said, ''We definitely have no expectations.''
 Lucy Schiller, 8, has been a follower of the Jonas Brothers since she first heard their hit ''Year 3000'' two years ago. She was one of 600 invited fans at the El Rey Theater, where the band was filming a six-song concert video that will appear exclusively on Walmart.com starting June 9.
 ''I'm downloading the new songs off iTunes the second they come out,'' she said. But this third grader never made it to the band's movie and still hasn't seen the Disney Channel series. ''My friends aren't really talking about the show,'' she said. ''I like them as singers.''
 A sold-out tour and strong response to the new album will almost certainly bolster interest in the sitcom. And perhaps the show's slow start is just a case of growing pains. ''I think it takes time for music stars to be looked at as television stars,'' Mr. Konowitch said. 
 Mr. Wright, whose experience with boy bands includes managing 'N Sync, said that the Jonas Brothers may no longer be the best fit with Disney Channel's young audience. ''They agreed to do the show two years ago, but it was delayed for various reasons,'' he said. ''They're in a different place now.''
 In a statement Disney Channel said it was ''pleased with the early ratings'' for the show, noting that it has reached nearly 10 million total viewers over its first six telecasts. Jonas Brothers fans, the company added, have given DisneyChannel.com its best results for 2009.
 ''The show is a great learning process,'' Joe Jonas said. ''Acting is something I want to get into a lot more.''
 Disney Channel has said it hoped the show would open a beachhead on Saturday nights, long dominated by Nickelodeon. If ''Jonas'' can dent ratings for ''iCarly,'' the Nickelodeon show opposite it that is rapidly becoming a phenomenon among kids, the brothers' sitcom will be considered a big success internally.
 Even so, if the Jonas Brothers are truly going to cross over, they need to do it with a punishing speed. Children 6 to 14 -- the so-called tween market -- have always been fickle, and allegiances come and go faster than ever. In industry parlance the band needs to strike before its core fans -- young girls -- ''age out'' of the experience.
 The band's last album, ''Little Bit Longer,'' was released in August and has sold 1.52 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Sales of their 2007 album, ''Jonas Brothers,'' have reached 1.82 million. Worldwide, Jonas Brothers albums have sold 8.1 million CDs, according to Disney. 
 ''This album is a big step for us as artists, musicians and songwriters,'' Nick Jonas said. ''We're pouring it out of our hearts.''

HEADLINE: Trade and Hard Times

 BODY:
Foreign trade has been a potent force for good over more than half a century. It propelled Japan's emergence from the ashes of World War II and helped it become an industrial powerhouse. It is the cornerstone of development strategies from China to Brazil. It is what links countries all over the world in a network of production that underpins global prosperity.
 Today, trade is collapsing, one more casualty of the global financial crisis. That is especially bad news for countries that are dependent on trade for economic growth, including many developing nations that had nothing to do with the financial mess. 
Exports from the United States declined 30 percent and imports 34 percent in the first quarter of the year from the previous three months. Imports into countries that use the euro from outside the area were down 21 percent compared with the first quarter of last year. At this rate, the World Trade Organization's dire projection in March that global trade would decline 9 percent this year will soon start to look outright boastful.
 The drop in trade is spreading economic weakness across the world, as one country's drop in imports translates into a fall in exports, and production, in another. 
 Japan, whose economy depends heavily on sales to the United States, saw exports plunge 45.5 percent in March compared with March of 2008. In the first quarter, its economy contracted 15.2 percent at an annual rate, the worst performance since 1955. Exports from China and Brazil both fell 20 percent in the first quarter, compared with the year before. Mexico -- linked tightly to the United States market through Nafta -- saw exports collapse almost 29 percent while the Mexican economy contracted 21.5 percent at an annual rate, more than three times the rate of decline in the United States. 
 The main forces clobbering trade seem to be the fall in demand and investment that started in the United States and Europe, and the seizing up of trade finance, which funds up to 90 percent of the world's merchandise trade, worth some $16 trillion. 
 The impact has been magnified by the far-flung nature of multinational companies' production networks -- where a factory in one country makes parts that are used by a plant in another country. As demand for their products has declined, the pain has moved across countries up the chain of production. The thawing of credit markets has helped resuscitate trade finance some. Governments of the 20 biggest economies agreed to nudge it along, ensuring $250 billion of trade finance would be available over the next two years. They should keep those pledges, and they may have to do more. 
 Protectionism also remains a serious danger. With voters insisting that politicians protect their own, many countries have already imposed new restrictions on imports. So far they have been relatively modest. But as unemployment continues to rise, the temptation -- and the pressure -- will grow. Earlier this year, the Global Monitoring Report by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund noted that ''a pattern is beginning to emerge of increases in import licensing, import tariffs and surcharges, and trade remedies to support industries facing difficulties early on in the crisis.''
 Of particular concern are attempts by governments -- including in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Switzerland -- to ensure that banks bailed out by taxpayers favor domestic borrowers. While the Obama administration has not imposed similar requirements, there is pressure from Congress and the public to make American banks that receive TARP money lend primarily, if not exclusively, to American borrowers. That would be a mistake. One of the sure ways to prolong the global recession is to create even more barriers to global trade.

HEADLINE: Governments Urge Security Council Action

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Across the globe from Washington to Moscow to Beijing, North Korea's underground nuclear test drew condemnation and criticism on Monday and some governments threatened to press for tighter sanctions at the United Nations Security Council.
 But given the patchy record of sanctions on North Korea, it remained unclear what effect such threats might yield.
 Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan said his government would seek a new United Nations resolution to condemn the test. He said an urgent meeting of the Security Council was expected to be held on Monday in New York at Japan's request. 
 China, whose response was closely watched around the world, said it was ''resolutely opposed'' to the test, according to a Foreign Ministry statement carried by the official Xinhua news agency. China is by far North Korea's largest trading partner and wields critical diplomatic influence.
 Russia said the test breached a United Nations Security Council resolution and would ''endanger security and stability in the region,'' according to the Russian Foreign Ministry in a statement. 
 President Obama was among the first to register protest, saying in a statement that ''North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community.'' 
 The statement continued: ''Such provocations will only serve to deepen North Korea's isolation. It will not find international acceptance unless it abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.''
 Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he believed the latest series of tests ''just speak to the growing belligerence on the part of North Korea,'' The Associated Press reported.
 Appearing on NBC's ''Today'' show on Monday, Admiral Mullen said described North Korea as a country that ''continues to destabilize that region and in the long term should they continue to develop a nuclear weapons program, poses a grave threat to the United States.''
 European governments joined the call for Security Council action and said North Korea would not gain international acceptance as long as it followed policies that Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain described as ''erroneous, misguided and a danger to the world.''
 The French Foreign Ministry said in a statement: ''France will consult in the coming hours with its partners on the Security Council and in the region on the consequences to draw from this serious act by North Korea, and in particular on strengthening sanctions.'' Germany also condemned the test.
 Several European foreign ministers were heading for a meeting in Hanoi with their Asian counterparts when news of the test broke. Carl Bildt, Sweden's minister of foreign affairs, called the development ''alarming.'' Javier Solana, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, said in Brussels that the ''irresponsible acts by North Korea warrant a firm response.''
 After the North's first nuclear test in October 2006, a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by the United States, banned trade with North Korea in materials linked with unconventional weapons, and authorized countries to inspect cargo going into and out of the North. 
 It also sought to outlaw international travel and freeze the overseas assets of people associated with the North's weapons programs. But doubts about the sanctions arose when South Korea and China indicated that business and economic relations would be largely unaffected.
 In April 2009, North Korea defied the United States, China and a series of United Nations resolutions by launching a rocket that the country said was designed to propel a satellite into space. Much of the world viewed the test as an effort to prove it is edging toward the capability to shoot a nuclear warhead on a longer-range missile. 
 Following the launch, the Security Council decided unanimously last month to tighten sanctions against North Korea. The White House asked the United Nations sanctions committee to develop a list of North Korean companies to be singled out, focusing on companies involved in missile and nuclear technology. 
 But some analysts said they doubted that these measures would prove effective. They noted that China opposed a stronger United Nations response to the April missile launching. 
 On the Korean peninsula on Monday , news of the test caused an initial drop on South Korean markets, where the benchmark Kospi index plummeted by up to 6.3 per cent before recovering almost all of its losses. The won fell against the dollar but also recovered.
 The government in Seoul called the North Korean underground test a ''direct threat against the peace and stability in the region as well as to the world.''
 Australia offered ''absolute condemnation'' and New Zealand expressed worries about the test, as did India.
 ''India is against nuclear proliferation,'' India's Defense Minister A.K. Antony said in New Delhi, The A.P. reported. ''It's a matter of very serious concern not only to India, but to the world.''

HEADLINE: Our Crumbling Foundation

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
I'm not sure that the catastrophic job losses of this recession, the worst since the Great Depression, have really sunk into the public's consciousness. And that would mean that the ground has not been prepared for the kind of high-powered remedies needed to get the economy back into some kind of reasonable shape.
 The Times ran a front-page story on Monday that said job losses are forcing ever larger numbers of homeowners who once had solid credit to fall seriously behind on their mortgages, thus amplifying the foreclosure crisis. 
 And now the Center for Labor Market Studies has compiled data showing that the recession's effects have been ''disastrous beyond belief'' for some groups, including young men, men without college degrees and black men. These job losses among young workers have ominous long-term implications for American families and the economy as a whole.
 At the same time, there was a development in Congress last week that should have been seen as significant but could not elbow its way into the media precincts obsessed with Rush Limbaugh, Dick Cheney and swine flu.
 Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, introduced a bill to establish a national infrastructure development bank that would use public and private capital to fund projects of regional and national significance. These are projects that are badly needed and would be a boon to employment.
 America has become self-destructively shortsighted in recent decades. That has kept us from acknowledging the awful long-term consequences of the tidal wave of joblessness that has swept over the nation since the start of the recession in December 2007. And it is keeping us from understanding how important the maintenance and development of the infrastructure is to the nation's long-term social and economic prospects.
 It's not just about roads and bridges, although they are important. It's also about schools, and the electrical grid, and environmental and technological innovation. It's about establishing a world-class industrial and economic platform for a nation that is speeding toward second-class status on a range of important fronts.
 It's about whether we're serious about remaining a great nation. We don't act like it. Here's a staggering statistic: According to the Education Trust, the U.S. is the only industrialized country in which young people are less likely than their parents to graduate from high school.
 We can't put our people to work. We can't educate the young. We can't keep the infrastructure in good repair. It's hard to believe that this nation could be so dysfunctional at the end of the first decade of the 21st century. It's tragic.
 Ms. DeLauro's bill has an unusual range of support, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the Service Employees International Union. One of her co- sponsors is Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who noted that his hometown, Minneapolis, is where the I-35W bridge collapsed in 2007, hurling cars, trucks and vans into the Mississippi River and killing 13 people. 
 The infrastructure bank would be authorized to issue bonds, provide loans and offer loan guarantees to finance large-scale projects. The idea would be to leverage substantial amounts of private capital in support of such projects, and to make more prudent decisions about which projects move ahead.
 For those who are concerned about whether the government can afford these major projects, I would note that one of the biggest supporters of the creation of an infrastructure bank is Felix Rohatyn, the financier who guided New York City through the harrowing fiscal crisis of the 1970s. He is hardly a radical when it comes to government finances.
 The link between the need to rebuild the nation's crumbing infrastructure and the crucial need to find rich new sources of employment in this economic downturn should be obvious, a no-brainer. The Center for Labor Market Studies is at Northeastern University in Boston. A memo that I received a few days ago from the center's director, Andrew Sum, notes that ''no immediate recovery of jobs'' is anticipated, even if the recession officially ends, as some have projected, by next fall.
 The memo said: ''Since unemployment cannot begin to fall until payroll growth hits about one percent -- and payroll growth will not hit one percent until [gross domestic product] growth hits at least 2.5 percent to 3 percent -- we may not see any substantive payroll growth until late 2010 or 2011, and unemployment could rise until that time.''
 We've already lost nearly 5.7 million jobs in this recession. Those losses, the center says, ''have been overwhelmingly concentrated among male workers, especially among men under 35.''
 If the U.S. is to have any hope of getting its economic act together over the next few years, there will have to be a much greater focus on putting people back to work. Rebuilding the infrastructure is the place to start.

HEADLINE: Lose the Traffic. Keep That Times Square Grit.

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
When New York City announced a plan to shut down parts of Times Square to traffic, New Yorkers' reactions ranged from bemusement to mild hysteria.Despite reassurances from the Transportation Department that the changes would create a greener, more pedestrian-friendly city, some critics of the plan worried that it would sap the square of its chaotic energy. Others, apparently nostalgic for the seediness of the 1970s version of the square, denounced it as another step in New York's transformation from the world's greatest metropolis to a generic tourist trap.
 Well, I'm happy to report that, a day after the stretch of Broadway between 42nd and 47th Streets was closed to cars, the soul of Times Square remains intact. The neon still sparkles. Tourists still wander around bewildered. The whiff of last night's junk food still hangs in the air. 
 Nor is the new pedestrian mall a cataclysmic shift in New York's identity. Cities as diverse as London, Copenhagen and Melbourne have managed to reduce the number of cars in the city center without losing their urban character. And part of Times Square's value, from the days of its notoriety as a porn haven to the Walt Disney Company's takeover of 42nd Street, has been as a kind of instant snapshot of how the city sees itself. Its next incarnation will have as much to do with broad economic and social changes that New York is undergoing as with a few planters and chairs.
 But I worry about the character of the mall, with its string of disconnected plazas. While Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said the plazas are a work in progress -- he will decide in December whether to transform them into something more permanent -- they feel like odd leftover spaces. Until the city commissions a plan for a more detailed design, we won't know what they will become.
 The new five-block-long mall is the largest of a series of such spaces that now stretch from the Theater District down to Herald Square and Madison Square Park. Conceived by the city's transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, the plan is partly inspired by the redevelopment of downtown Copenhagen, many of whose medieval streets and plazas have been closed off to cars in the past decade.
 Since becoming commissioner two years ago Ms. Sadik-Khan has also created some 200 miles of new bike paths throughout the city. A year ago she closed down traffic lanes between 42nd Street and Herald Square to create a series of public esplanades. This weekend she also closed off parts of Herald Square between 33rd and 35th streets to cars.
 So far the pedestrian mall in Times Square is marked by little more than a few wobbly tables and metal chairs. A row of orange barriers frames the mall's northern edge, where a half-dozen police officers patiently redirect traffic heading down Broadway. Workers have scattered a few potted plants across the street's asphalt surface. (Seventh Avenue, which intersects Broadway at 45th Street, remains open to traffic.) 
 A large part of the design's success stems from the altered relationship between the pedestrian and the structures that frame the square. Walking down the cramped, narrow sidewalks, a visitor could never get a feel for the vastness of the place. Now, standing in the middle of Broadway, you have the sense of being in a big public room, the towering billboards and digital screens pressing in on all sides.
 This adds to the intimacy of the plaza itself, which, however undefined, can now function as a genuine social space: people can mill around, ogle one another and gaze up at the city around them without the fear of being caught under the wheels of a cab. 
 (As someone who has worked on and off near Times Square for decades, elbowing my way through the lunch hour crowds, I also appreciate the extra breathing room.) 
 Still, this is not the Piazza San Marco in Venice or even Trafalgar Square in London. A number of streets still cut across the square, carving it up into odd parcels of uneven sizes. The one between 45th and 47th Streets forms a generously scaled triangle at the northern end of the site. But as you travel farther south, the spaces become more awkwardly defined. A rectangular block between 42nd and 43rd Streets feels detached from the larger open areas to the north. The narrow esplanades below 42nd Street, which were created last year, are more or less lifeless.
 Then there is the quality of the spaces themselves. The tables and chairs may work as temporary placeholders, but they are weirdly out of scale with their surroundings. They would make more sense in the Tuileries Gardens in Paris than in a busy intersection in the heart of a modern metropolis.
 If the city decides to keep the plazas, it will have to design the spaces in a way that genuinely reflects the urban toughness of the city that feeds into them. It can't simply recreate an image of a medieval European park. Or a mall in Southern California.
 Will it work? The transformation of Copenhagen took decades, not years. And it involved constant tinkering. Some streets were closed to cars, then partially reopened years later. Parking in the city center was reduced slowly, over many years, so the changes were barely noticed.
 As Jan Gehl, who worked on the Copenhagen plan and advised Ms. Sadik-Khan in New York, explained, the strategy allowed for a period of psychological adjustment.
 Ms. Sadik-Khan seems to be working at a much faster pace. At times the process here seems clumsier.
 She's also working in a more impatient, less forgiving environment. What's most encouraging about her vision is that it reasserts the positive role government can play in shaping the public realm after decades of sitting by and watching private interests take over. Now she has to prove that she can be as nimble in her design choices as she is at imposing her ideas on a skeptical city.

HEADLINE: Learning to Accept the Unknowable

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''What You Don't Know Makes You Nervous,'' by Daniel Gilbert (Op-Ed, May 21):
 Professor Gilbert is surely right in arguing that uncertainty plays an important role in human unhappiness. But cognitive psychologists, like the late Albert Ellis, would argue that the way we think about uncertainty is also critical. If we catastrophize about the inherent uncertainty in life -- ''I can't stand not knowing what the market will do! This is horrible!'' -- then we will drive our mood much deeper into the ground.
 On the other hand, if we keep in mind the great teaching of the Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, we will be less distressed: ''Nothing will happen to me which is not conformable to the nature of the universe.'' 
 In short, we need to learn that uncertainty is certainly an unavoidable part of life.
 Ronald Pies Lexington, Mass., May 21, 2009
 The writer is a psychiatrist and the author of a book on the teachings of the Stoics.
 To the Editor:
 As Daniel Gilbert reminds us, uncertainty is unnerving. Unfortunately, however, uncertainty is a persistent reality of this world. How then are we ever to relax and enjoy life? 
 Happily, some ancients answered that question. Establish ourselves, they say, in what does not change, what is always certain. Be centered on one's essential, unchanging nature. In different words, live in the world, without being of the world. 
 And how can we ever learn do that? Engage in proper meditation, say the ancients. And as a longtime meditation teacher, I have lots of evidence they were right. 
 In short, it would be silly to try to eliminate uncertainty, either from economics or any other aspect of this world. That's not in the cards. Our aim rather should be to find a healthy way to live with it. That we can do. 
 Merrill Harmin White Plains, May 21, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Daniel Gilbert's illuminating analysis of our current unhappiness doesn't mention an important factor. In all of the examples he cites, people had no control over the dreadful outcome, even if its status was uncertain.
 Two decades of research on anxiety and depression have shown that they are related to beliefs about control. While we are more likely to be unhappy when the status of a dreaded outcome is uncertain, we are much more likely to suffer when we also believe that we have no control over the circumstances. 
 The Wall Street investment banker who is out of a job and doesn't believe there is much he can do to find one elsewhere is much more likely to be anxious and depressed than a computer programmer working for the same firm who believes he has options. 
 Paul Siegel New York, May 21, 2009
 The writer is assistant professor of psychology at SUNY/Westchester and Purchase College, and conducts research on fear.
 To the Editor:
 Prof. Daniel Gilbert's essay about the relationship of certainty to happiness is a powerful counterargument to one of the Republicans' most cherished dogmas: People are better off keeping their money and deciding how to spend it, rather than having the government tax it away to spend on federal programs.
 When buying a house, a refrigerator or a new car, people want choices. But when it comes to critical issues like health care, unemployment benefits or retirement income, choosing among multiple insurance and investment programs, all competing in the ''market,'' presents tremendous uncertainty. Most people would rest easier in the knowledge that these vital basic needs were met universally through competently run, well-regulated government agencies, solidly backed by taxes. 
 Mr. Gilbert's observations help explain why, in studies of happiness and life satisfaction, the countries of northern Europe repeatedly top the list, well ahead of the United States. These countries thrive on capitalism underpinned by a safety net of socialist institutions that relieve their people of many of the uncertainties and anxieties that plague us here.
 Raymond B. Clayton Stanford, Calif., May 21, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''What You Don't Know Makes You Nervous,'' by Daniel Gilbert:
 But we do now know with certainty that we have to live with less, and if it turns out later that we don't, well, everyone enjoys a turn for the better.

HEADLINE: Auto Troubles Touch Many Corners: Bankruptcy For G.M. Would Tax The Experts

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED; Micheline Maynard reported from Detroit, and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The decline of General Motors may be putting thousands of auto workers and managers out of work, but it will be putting a lot of lawyers to work.
 How many lawyers will end up working on G.M.'s expected bankruptcy case still is not clear, but in legal circles, the joke is that there may not be enough experienced bankruptcy lawyers available to handle the filing. 
 In part, that is because so many top lawyers are already running up lots of billable hours working on the Chrysler bankruptcy case, while others have been hired by the government, which is financing the way through bankruptcy for Chrysler and, presumably, G.M.
 It is not just lawyers who will be busy handling a G.M. bankruptcy filing, which would be perhaps the biggest and most-watched in legal history. Because of its size and scope, the bankruptcy would be the most complicated that any American company has gone through -- more complex than those of Chrysler and Lehman Brothers, two other notable bankruptcy cases now making their way through the system. 
 The G.M. filing, which is expected to occur by June 1 as part of a restructuring orchestrated by the federal government, will generate so much economic activity -- like hotel bookings, restaurant dining and expanded office rentals -- that Detroit is hoping that the case will be filed in the local bankruptcy court. 
 That is unlikely, however, as bankruptcy cases are typically handled in New York or Delaware, where many business are incorporated and the bankruptcy courts have more experience handling complex filings.
 For law firms, big bankruptcies can be very lucrative. Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the New York firm handling the Lehman case, recently sought approval for billings for $55 million for just three months' work from the bankruptcy court in that case. Weil Gotshal is one of the firms that will represent G.M., almost certainly ensuring tens of millions more in fees to represent the automaker.
 But it is not the only firm that will be working on the case. Already, hundreds of lawyers from almost every major firm that handles restructuring work have spent months preparing the reams of documents that would be required for a bankruptcy filing by G.M., which had nearly $150 billion in global revenue last year, making its case bigger than Enron.
 G.M., the Treasury Department, the United Automobile Workers, suppliers, dealers and other vendors all will have legal representatives on hand, meaning a full house in the New York bankruptcy court where the case is likely to be heard. Although no judge will be assigned until the case is filed, court officials are creating plans for a separate computer server devoted to G.M.'s filing, which will be an even bigger megacase than Chrysler, which received that designation in April.
 G.M. will require $40 billion to $70 billion in debtor-in-possession financing to create a new version of G.M. and dispose of its assets, according to people familiar with the case.
 The near inevitability of the G.M. case is a sharp contrast to the resistance put up by company executives, including Rick Wagoner, the former chief. His steadfast refusal to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while the company reorganized was a factor in his ouster in March at the behest of the Obama administration, which has been keeping G.M. alive with billions of dollars in loans.
 Many people thought a G.M. bankruptcy restructuring was simply too complicated to do. ''The case would last my lifetime, my son's lifetime, my grandson's lifetime and maybe my great-grandson's lifetime,'' Stephen P. Yokich, the late president of the U.A.W., said in a 1995 interview.
 But G.M. did consider the idea seriously at least twice in the last two decades: once in 1992, when the company was close to insolvency, and again in late 2005, when rumors of a Chapter 11 filing swirled in Detroit.
 Both times, G.M. officials rejected a bankruptcy filing, citing the disruption it would have meant to G.M.'s suppliers, workers and the communities where the company did business. Another reason was the expense: ''It would make 10 million lawyers $10 million apiece,'' Mr. Yokich said in 1995.
 That is an overstatement, of course. But while there might not be that many lawyers involved, legal fees totaling hundreds of millions of dollars are likely during the course of the case given the high-powered and high-fee lawyers involved.
 A reason that so many lawyers are needed is that the reorganization, as envisioned by the automaker with support from the federal government, is complex. 
 The plan is to split G.M.'s good assets from the bad assets, with the idea that the part owning the good assets would be a viable company because it would not be burdened with the other businesses. G.M. would sell desirable brands like Chevrolet and Cadillac to a new company, which would emerge from bankruptcy protection in a few months' time. Less-attractive assets and liabilities would remain with the old G.M., and eventually be liquidated.
 For the last several months, G.M. had retained the services of two of the biggest bankruptcy players to help guide it into Chapter 11: Harvey R. Miller of Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Martin Bienenstock of Dewey & LeBoeuf.
 Mr. Miller and his team are the company's principal legal counsel for its bankruptcy filing; but it will not represent the new version of G.M. once that is created, as there is a potential conflict between parties with an interest in the existing company and those with interests in the new company. Mr. Bienenstock, a former partner of Mr. Miller's at Weil, was brought in last fall to help create the company's restructuring plan. He may end up representing the new G.M., although the decision has not been made. 
 The law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, meanwhile, is representing G.M.'s board.
 The restructuring also will provide work for many professional groups other than lawyers. G.M., for example, has retained the services of Jay Alix, the co-founder of AlixPartners, the consulting firm. Mr. Alix, who came out of retirement to help G.M., worked with Mr. Bienenstock on the plan for a new G.M., according to people briefed on the matter.
 For financial and restructuring advice, the carmaker has turned to investment bankers at Evercore Partners, led by a cofounder, Roger Altman, and the restructuring co-head, William Repko, and to Morgan Stanley.
 The government's auto task force has its own advisers, led by the former investment bankers Steven Rattner and Ron Bloom. The team also has brought in several restructuring veterans, notably Matthew Feldman, formerly a partner at the law firm Willkie, Farr & Gallagher, and Harry Wilson, formerly an executive at the distressed-debt-focused hedge fund Silver Point Capital.
 In addition, the auto task force has retained the services of the investment bank Rothschild, led by Todd Snyder, and the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, led by John J. Rapisardi, and the Boston Consulting Group, to provide forecasts for auto sales.
 The U.A.W., meanwhile, is receiving counsel from longtime advisers at Lazard, the investment bank, and the law firm Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton.
 As the lawyers prepare to take their seats, many other steps have already been taken to ease the company into court. 
 Last week, the U.A.W. reached a deal with G.M. that includes concessions by workers and modifications to a health care fund that will assume responsibility for retirees' benefits.
 G.M. workers will be briefed on the contract changes in meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, and are expected to vote on them this week.
 Communities where G.M. does business are eligible to share in $50 million in federal assistance, announced by the administration last week. 
 Suppliers also have been offered assistance, and the Treasury is infusing more money into GMAC, the company's lending arm that also will provide loans for Chrysler.
 Consumers who buy G.M. cars while the company is under bankruptcy protection will have their warranties backed by the federal government, as it is doing for Chrysler buyers. 
 ''I've never seen a bankruptcy that has such a happy face on it as this one,'' Gary N. Chaison, professor of industrial affairs at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., said of the work that has been done in advance.
 As a result, the tone has completely changed since the dire warnings late last year that a Chapter 11 case would spell the end to the country's biggest carmaker. Now, Professor Chaison said, the government's attitude was, ''You're going to the hospital and that's really good because you'll be out soon and you'll be much better.''

HEADLINE: Luxe Hotels In a Battle For Control

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
It is not often that luxury hotel owners find themselves locked out of their own properties, but that is what the lawyers for owners say has happened at the Four Seasons Resort Aviara, north of San Diego.
 This month, Four Seasons added security, including personnel at checkpoints, to head off owners and their representatives. The owners have accused Four Seasons of mismanagement, tried to fire the company and named a replacement operator -- who so far has not set foot on the property.
 The two sides seem to agree on only one thing -- that, as Elizabeth Pizzinato, vice president for brand communications at Four Seasons, put it, ''this has really been unprecedented.'' 
 But there are almost certainly going to be more such hotel wars. Owners and operators are fighting more often and more intensely as the economic downturn reduces the number of guests and forces down rates while owners struggle to cope with debt payments on their multimillion-dollar properties, say industry analysts. 
 The disputes have usually not become public because contracts between hotel operators and owners require arbitration, but some have grown so contentious that, like the one involving the Aviara resort, they have ended up in open court. 
 ''There are things that brand managers do that really annoy owners,'' said Bjorn Hanson, associate professor of hospitality and tourism management at Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University.
 For example, luxury hotel operators typically do not want to reduce their rates because doing so may hurt the brand's image, Mr. Hanson said. Nor do they want to reduce costs by cutting back on amenities -- even though keeping multiple restaurants open 24 hours a day, for example, may be very expensive -- because such services justify the brand's premium.
 The economic downturn has affected high-end resorts far more than less costly hotels. In the first three months of the year, occupancy at luxury hotels was down 16.3 percent from a year ago, compared with a 10.9 percent decline for the industry as a whole, according to Smith Travel Research, a private research firm that tracks the lodging industry.
 Those declines have put pressure on owners of luxury hotels, usually investment groups, wealthy individuals or companies specializing in lodging. Many owners took out loans to buy, finance or remodel their properties when occupancy rates were higher and credit was easy, but now loan payments can be crushing and borrowing difficult. 
 To add insult to injury, in the current climate no business traveler wants to put the name of a high-end resort on an expense report.
 The economic problems for luxury hotels are compounded by the competing interests of property owners and operators, who are tied together by contracts that can span decades and that may give the operators little incentive to cut costs. 
 The contracts are supposed to give owners the benefits of a hotel operator's reputation and its marketing and management prowess. But provisions in those operating agreements also usually require owners to cover the costs of operating the hotels, in addition to paying the hotel manager a fee, often a percentage of gross revenue.
 ''It gives the operators all the benefits of ownership with none of the burdens,'' said James R. Butler Jr., a lawyer at Jeffer Mangels Butler & Marmaro in Los Angeles. ''It pushes to the owner all of the costs -- the capital costs of buying, maintaining and operating the property -- and lets the managing companies take most of their money off the top.''
 Such an arrangement may give the hotel management company little reason to worry about keeping costs down, Mr. Butler said, or about how much is left in profit to owners. But without that profit, owners who borrowed to pay for their properties may have a hard time repaying loans.
 Owners have been emboldened to sue management companies by judges' favorable decisions in owner-operator disputes in the last decade, said Hushmand Sohaili, a lawyer in the Los Angeles office of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. 
 ''The balance of power in the relationship has shifted to owners and lenders and away from management companies,'' he said. 
 The owners of the Turnberry Isle Resort and Club in Aventura, Fla., filed a lawsuit in April against their operator over nearly $1.3 million in what they called ''unsubstantiated'' fees. 
 Stuart Z. Grossman, a lawyer for the owners, said that instead of providing information to back up the fees, the operator, Fairmont, started an arbitration proceeding. Now the operator and the owners are engaged in a battle over who will preside over that proceeding; the next hearing is scheduled for June 4 in federal court in Miami, where a judge will interview prospective arbitrators.
 ''We don't feel that they are marketing, managing, doing the things that it takes to make the hotel successful,'' Mr. Grossman said. 
 The owners invested $133 million in upgrading the resort, which they bought in December 2005, but the hotel still lost about $13 million in 2007, according to the owners' complaint, and the hotel ''materially underperformed its competition.''
 A spokesman for Fairmont declined to comment, citing company policy.
 But the dispute between Turnberry's owners and managers has not escalated to the point of the battle over the Aviara. The owners of the Aviara resort started an arbitration proceeding against Four Seasons in March, according to court documents, and then tried to terminate Four Seasons as hotel manager. (The hotel also has time-share properties separate from the resort, but those are not part of the dispute, according to owners' representatives.)
 The owners accused Four Seasons of ''failing, among other things, to operate the hotel in a financially efficient and cost-effective manner.'' They also claim that Four Seasons blocked access to the hotel's books and financial records.
 ''Four Seasons sent guards to literally blockade the doors to the offices where the books and records are maintained,'' said William A. Brewer III, a lawyer at Bickel & Brewer, representing the hotel's owners. ''I've never seen anything like it.''
 According to Four Seasons, the real issue in this case is that the owners took on too much debt. Ms. Pizzinato said that the company has been properly managing the Aviara resort. 
 ''The brand stands for a certain level of quality and service, and we don't compromise on that,'' Ms. Pizzinato said. ''But we also believe we're very prudent financial managers because we are managing on behalf of somebody else.''
 A hearing on the dispute is scheduled for Wednesday.

HEADLINE: In Hot Pursuit of Fusion (or Folly)

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

DATELINE: LIVERMORE, Calif. 

 BODY:
Here in a dry California valley, outside a small town, a cathedral of light is to be dedicated on Friday. Like the cathedrals of antiquity, it is built on an unrivaled scale with unmatched technology, and it embodies a scientific doctrine that, if confirmed, might lift civilization to new heights.
 ''Bringing Star Power to Earth'' reads a giant banner that was recently unfurled across a building the size of a football stadium.
 The $3.5 billion site is known as the National Ignition Facility, or NIF. For more than half a century, physicists have dreamed of creating tiny stars that would inaugurate an era of bold science and cheap energy, and NIF is meant to kindle that blaze. 
 In theory, the facility's 192 lasers -- made of nearly 60 miles of mirrors and fiber optics, crystals and light amplifiers -- will fire as one to pulverize a fleck of hydrogen fuel smaller than a match head. Compressed and heated to temperatures hotter than those of the core of a star, the hydrogen atoms will fuse into helium, releasing bursts of thermonuclear energy.
 The project's director, Ed Moses, said that getting to the cusp of ignition (defined as the successful achievement of fusion) had taken some 7,000 workers and 3,000 contractors a dozen years, their labors creating a precision colossus of millions of parts and 60,000 points of control, 30 times as many as on the space shuttle.
 ''It's the cathedral story,'' Dr. Moses said during a tour. ''We put together the best physicists, the best engineers, the best of industry and academia. It's not often you get that opportunity and pull it off.''
 In February, NIF fired its 192 beams into its target chamber for the first time, and it now has the world's most powerful laser, as well as the largest optical instrument ever built. But raising its energies still further to the point of ignition could take a year or more of experimentation and might, officials concede, prove daunting and perhaps impossible.
 For that reason, skeptics dismiss NIF as a colossal delusion that is squandering precious resources at a time of economic hardship. Just operating it, officials grant, will cost $140 million a year. Some doubters ridicule it as the National Almost Ignition Facility, or NAIF.
 Even friends of the effort are cautious. ''They've made progress,'' said Roy Schwitters, a University of Texas physicist who leads a federal panel that recently assessed NIF's prospects. ''Ignition may eventually be possible. But there's still much to learn.''
 Dr. Moses, while offering no guarantees, argued that any great endeavor involved risks and that the gamble was worth it because of the potential rewards.
 He said that NIF, if successful, would help keep the nation's nuclear arms reliable without underground testing, would reveal the hidden life of stars and would prepare the way for radically new kinds of power plants.
 ''If fusion energy works,'' he said, ''you'll have, for all intents and purposes, a limitless supply of carbon-free energy that's not geopolitically sensitive. What more would you want? It's a game changer.''
 NIF is to fire its lasers for 30 years.
 Like the dedication of a cathedral, the event here on Friday at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is to be a celebration of hope. Officials say some 3,500 people will attend. The big names include Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Energy Secretary Steven Chu (whose agency finances NIF) and Charles Townes, a Nobel Laureate and laser pioneer.
 In preparation, workmen here last Thursday washed windows and planted flowers on the lush campus, the day auspiciously sunny.
 Dr. Moses, who runs science programs for high school students in his spare time, broke from his own preparations to show a visitor the NIF complex.
 In its lobby, he held up a device smaller than a postage stamp. This is where it all starts, he said. From this kind of tiny laser, beams emerge that grow large and bright during their long journey through NIF's maze of mirrors, lenses and amplifiers.
 The word laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. And each particle of light, or photon, is amplified, Dr. Moses said, to ''around 10 to the 25th'' photons. Or, ''10 million, million, million, million.''
 A nearby stand held a thick slab of pink glass about the size of a traffic sign -- an example of an amplifier. NIF has 3,200 in all. Dr. Moses said the big step occurred when giant flash tubes -- like ones in cameras but six feet long and 7,680 in number -- flashed in unison to excite the pink glass. Laser photons then zip through, stimulating cascades of offspring, making the beam much stronger, such amplification happening over and over.
 Photons moving in step with one another is what makes laser light so bright and concentrated and, in some instances, so potent.
 Dr. Moses picked up a mock capsule of hydrogen fuel. It was all of two millimeters wide, or less than a tenth of an inch.
 ''It heats up,'' he said. ''It blows in at a million miles an hour, moving that way for about five-billionths of a second. It gets to about the diameter of your hair. When it gets that small, that fast, you hit temperatures where it can start fusing -- around 100 million degrees centigrade, or 180 million degrees Fahrenheit.'' 
 Hair nets, hard hats and safety goggles were donned before entering NIF proper. Repeated steps on sticky pads pulled dirt from shoes. Dust is NIF's bane, Dr. Moses said. It can ruin optics and experiments. He said the 33-foot-wide target chamber was evacuated to a near-vacuum, much the same as outer space -- a void where light can zip along with almost no impediments.
 Dr. Moses said the team fired the laser only at night and did maintenance and equipment upgrades during the day. ''This is a 24/7 facility,'' he said. 
 The previous night, he said, the laser had been fired in an effort to improve coordination and timing. The 192 rays have to strike the target as close to simultaneously as possible. 
 The individual beams, he said, have to hit ''within a few trillionths of a second'' of one another if the fuel is to burn, and be pointed at the target with a precision ''within half the diameter of your hair.''
 The control room, modeled on NASA's mission control in Houston, was buzzing with activity, even though some consoles sat empty. Phones rang. Walkie-talkies crackled. The countdown to firing the lasers, Dr. Moses said, took three and half hours, with the process ''pretty much in the hands of computers.'' 
 The operations plan for NIF, he added, is to conduct 700 to 1,000 laser firings per year, with about 200 of the experiments focused on ignition. There is no danger of a runaway blast, he said. Fusion works by heat and pressure, not chain reactions. Moreover, the fuel is minuscule and the laser flash extraordinarily short. During a year of operations, Dr. Moses said, ''the facility is on for only three-thousandths of a second,'' yet will generate a growing cascade of data and insights.
 Next on the tour, after more sticky pads, was the holy of holies, the room surrounding the target chamber. It looked like an engine room out of a science-fiction starship. The beam lines -- now welters of silvery metal filled with giant crystals that shifted the concentrated light to higher frequencies -- converged on the chamber's blue wall. Its surface was dotted with silvery portholes where complex sensors could be placed to evaluate the tiny blasts.
 ''When it's running,'' Dr. Moses said, ''there's a lot of stuff at the chamber's center.''
 Despite the giant banner outside and its confident prediction, it is an open question whether NIF's sensors will ever detect the rays of a tiny star, independent scientists say.
 ''I personally think it's going to be a close call,'' said William Happer, a physicist at Princeton University who directed federal energy research for the first President George Bush. ''It's a very complicated system, and you're dependent on many things working right.''
 Dr. Happer said a big issue for NIF was achieving needed symmetries at minute scales. ''There's plenty of room,'' he added, ''for nasty surprises.''
 Doubters say past troubles may be a prologue. When proposed in 1994, the giant machine was to cost $1.2 billion and be finished by 2002. But costs rose and the completion date kept getting pushed back, so much so that Congress threatened to pull the plug. Today, critics see the delays and the $3.5 billion price tag as signs of overreaching.
 Dr. Moses, who was put in charge of NIF a decade ago in an effort to right the struggling project, said that a decade from now, as NIF opened new frontiers, no one would remember the missteps. He compared the project to feats like going to the Moon, building the atom bomb and inventing the airplane.
 ''Stumbles are not unusual when you take on big-risk projects,'' he said.
 Dr. Moses added that the stumble rule applied to cathedrals as well.
 Having grown up in Eastchester, close to New York City, he noted that the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, was still under construction after more than a century. Is it worthwhile, despite the delays? 
 ''Of course it is,'' he said. Taking on big projects that challenge the imagination ''is who we are as a species.''

HEADLINE: Great Debate Of '58: Lincoln Vs. Douglas

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
The elections last year might have seemed unusually rife with issues and substance, what with the economy, the war and the general historic significance of several candidacies. But to feel truly on the brink of something momentous, try a trip back to 1858, when Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln debated both the survival of the nation and the very nature of humankind as they battled for a United States Senate seat. 
 ''The Rivalry,'' a play by Norman Corwin, uses excerpts from those debates and the barest minimum of side plot to turn history into compelling theater. The play was seen on Broadway in 1959, when the words of Lincoln and Douglas had all sorts of relevance to the emerging civil rights movement. Now, of course, they have whole new layers of resonance, and the staging of the play by the Vincent Dowling Theater Company and the Irish Repertory Theater lets you savor them through a pair of fine performances.
 The play, directed by Mr. Dowling, focuses on Douglas more than on Lincoln, and Peter Cormican is just what you want in that role: evenhanded, letting Douglas's sometimes jarring words speak for themselves. (The rants about racial purity are especially unsettling today.) 
 But Christian Kauffmann's Lincoln is ultimately what makes the play work. Mr. Kauffmann's characterization grows on you, much as Lincoln must have grown on the public as a leader: he lost that 1858 election, but two years later he was chosen for what was certainly at the time the most difficult job in the world.
 ''The Rivalry'' continues through July 5 at the Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org.

HEADLINE: Leading Economies Report a Period of Record Decline

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
The economies of the developed world have had their worst quarterly showing in decades, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Monday, even as more signs emerged that the pace of the decline was easing. 
 The combined gross domestic products of the 30 countries in the organization fell 2.1 percent in the first quarter when compared with the previous quarter. If that preliminary estimate holds, it would be the largest drop since 1960, when the organization began collecting such data. The G.D.P. of member countries fell 2 percent in the final quarter of 2008.
 ''The figures confirmed the impression that we already had from the individual countries' reports,'' said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ''It shows the world economy was in free fall in the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.''
 Despite the dismal data, Mr. Kramer said that ''the economy is now in its landing approach.'' He predicted that the world economy would begin to expand modestly in the fourth quarter of this year, followed by ''subpar growth'' in 2010.
 In Japan, the government on Monday raised its assessment of the economy, saying that while corporate profits and business investment continue to decline, the tempo of worsening in the economy was ''moderating'' as exports and industrial production neared what appeared to be a bottom.
 Mr. Kramer said recent purchasing managers' data from China and the Institute for Supply Management's index of nonmanufacturing businesses in the United States also supported the conclusion that ''the recession could be over by autumn.''
 ''I'm quite cautious,'' he said, ''but this is what the facts say.''
 Among the seven largest O.E.C.D. economies, only in France -- where the economy shrank 1.2 percent -- did the rate of contraction ease in the first quarter, the organization said. The organization estimated Canadian first-quarter growth because official data was not yet available.
 The O.E.C.D. economies accounted for 71 percent of world G.D.P. in 2007, according to the World Bank. Those economies shrank 4.2 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. The United States contributed 0.9 percentage point of that decline, while Japan contributed 1 percentage point, the 13 largest euro-zone countries 1.3 points, and the remaining member countries 1 point.
 China, which is not a member of the organization, reported that its economy continued to grow in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: For Wealthy British Husbands, 'Mr. Tooth Calling' Brings a Chill

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
A Mr. Tooth on the phone for you, sir.
 For years, just the word that London's premier divorce lawyer, Raymond Tooth, was calling was enough to spread fear and loathing among a certain class of wealthy British men. It meant that no fortune, no matter how large and protected, was likely to remain intact.
 And now, under the pressure of the financial crisis, more divorcing wives than ever are turning to Mr. Tooth to make sure they get as much money as they can, even as the fortress of their husbands' riches crumbles.
 ''I have never been so busy,'' Mr. Tooth said this month, as he sat behind a boat-size desk that could barely hold the bulging files of his clients. 
 Mr. Tooth, who just turned 69, is a small, soft-spoken lawyer with a gentlemanly mien -- who is known to clients and adversaries alike as Jaws.
 When it comes to defending the core principle of his mostly female clientele -- that each spouse has an equal right to either's wealth -- he never lets go.
 ''It is quite clear that a partnership between a husband and wife is a partnership of equals,'' he said.
 Clear enough for Mr. Tooth and the spouses he champions, perhaps, but not always for their former partners. 
 Mr. Tooth works in a world where men, extremely wealthy financiers or world-famous celebrities, often earn the fortunes. 
 The most recent prominent man to suffer his bite was Brian Myerson, a South African financier who once enjoyed a generally favorable reputation in London's financial center as an activist investor.
 Now he has a different reputation to live down.
 When Ingrid Myerson, his wife of 26 years, filed for divorce last year, Mr. Myerson's estate was valued at $:25.8 million or about $44.2 million. Ms. Myerson, with Mr. Tooth representing her, elected to receive $:11 million ($17.1 million) in cash and some properties, while Mr. Myerson laid claim to $:14 million ($21.7 million) in shares of the publicly traded investment fund he runs, Principle Capital Investment Trust.
 Initially, Mr. Myerson was pleased with his deal. But when Principle Capital shares plunged 90 percent last fall, Mr. Myerson shocked legal circles here by petitioning an appeals court not only to absolve him of his remaining financial obligations, but also to compel his ex-wife to return the $:11 million she had already been paid.
 To no one's surprise, his petition was rejected.
 Mr. Tooth chuckles at Mr. Myerson's audacity. It is one thing to ask the court for relief from future payments because of the financial downturn, but it is something else, he suggests with an arched eyebrow, to demand abrogation of the overall agreement, just because you called the market wrong.
 In the United States, the lawyer Steven Simkin fell victim to a similar downturn after his divorce, only his was caused by Bernard L. Madoff. In 2006, Mr. Simkin and his estranged wife, Laura Blank, agreed to split evenly the $5.4 million in an account they had with Madoff Securities, according to a suit that Mr. Simkin filed in February in New York. Mr. Simkin gave Ms. Blank $2.7 million in cash, according to the suit, and held onto the account.
 When Mr. Madoff's Ponzi scheme was uncovered, the account was worthless and Mr. Simkin petitioned the court to get back the cash he had paid his ex-wife for her share. 
 If the Myerson case is any indication, Mr. Simkin should not hold his breath. British divorce lawyers say the Myerson decision struck an important legal precedent and prevented what would have been an avalanche of similar claims had the appeal succeeded.
 ''He got greedy; he wanted to have the whole enchilada,'' Mr. Tooth said. ''And now he has had his fingers burnt.''
 To the delight, it would seem, of Britain's tabloid press.
 Mr. Myerson's blunt chauvinistic manners and his sudden fall from grace have made him a popular target for a public fed up with the fancy habits of high-living bankers.
 In a recent interview in The Evening Standard of London, Mr. Myerson lamented the lack of sympathy from his wife for his current financial condition.
 He told the newspaper that he ''afforded her a wonderful life,'' including a large house in the exclusive London neighborhood of Hampstead, a country estate in Hampshire, and a beach house and polo estate in South Africa. Nannies, private schools and vacations in Greece and Zermatt were also part of the package.
 The lines of responsibility were quite clear, he said. He made his millions as a London financier while she took care of the home front.
 ''The biggest stress of the day for my wife was deciding what to tell the cook to make for dinner,'' Mr. Myerson said. ''There is a certain class of wealthy women today who contribute nothing to the family wealth and then expect 50 percent on divorce. The court says she is entitled to continue the lifestyle you have provided. It's lunacy, absolute lunacy.''
 Mr. Tooth said that Ms. Myerson, a 48-year-old South African sculptor, would not break her longstanding policy of not speaking to the press. ''She is a nice dignified lady,'' he said, approvingly. Through a spokesman, Mr. Myerson also declined to comment for this article.
 Mr. Myerson still owes his wife $:2.5 million and a South African beach house. Is Ms. Myerson inclined to shed a tear over her husband's financial plight and relax her demands?
 Mr. Tooth was unequivocal. ''There is no sympathy,'' he said.
 The British public has been no more sympathetic, particularly since Mr. Myerson, in his interview with The Evening Standard, revealed that for the last several years of his marriage he supported a mistress and another child -- keeping them in style in a house right next to his home with Ms. Myerson and their three children.
 The arrangement was kept secret from his wife until 2004. That is when she first called Mr. Tooth, who does not come cheap at $:500 an hour, or $775.
 Mr. Tooth, who has been practicing since the 1960s, once said that ''no sane, wealthy man should get married at all.'' It is a bit of advice he, as a two-time divorce, has had trouble following himself.
 But it is that experience, mixed with the soothing manner of a psychiatrist, that locks him in with his clients. They have ranged from the wives of Jude Law and Eric Clapton to, it is speculated, the wife of the billionaire Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.
 And whether they are uncertain and in tears, or furious and unquestioning, Mr. Tooth starts with one simple piece of advice: Don't be rash. ''This is the most important financial decision a wife will make,'' he said, referring to a majority of his clientele. ''Remember, the wife's financial position is static, while the husband's is dynamic.'' 
 Mr. Tooth swats aside any talk of retiring. Life is good: he has a stable of 50 racehorses, a country estate in Warwickshire and a house in Antigua.
 ''People don't stick together in bad times,'' he said with a smile. ''It's human nature.''

HEADLINE: Examined Lives: So Many Camera Crews, So Little Time

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
If you tend to avoid women's television and the front tables at Barnes & Noble, you may not be aware that Tori Spelling has emerged as a powerful symbol of the struggle for work-family balance. On her highly rated Oxygen reality series, ''Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood'' and in her books, ''sTORI Telling'' and ''Mommywood'' -- currently No. 21 on the New York Times best-seller list -- she presents herself as an American everywoman trying to juggle it all: motherhood, a line of jewelry for the Home Shopping Network, designing baby clothes and posing for shoots in People magazine while also complaining about the intrusions of Los Angeles paparazzi. Ms. Spelling works her Ugg boots off, and she is not self-effacing about it, cultivating privacy the way that Donald Trump seeks an image of humility. 
 ''Tori & Dean'' (which begins anew on Tuesday) is itself an exercise in controversion, as Ms. Spelling's attempts to avoid photographers with long lenses are in turn filmed by the camera crew she has invited to follow her around while she navigates life with her husband, Dean McDermott, and their children Liam and Stella Doreen. An added strangeness lies in the couple's incessant conversation about spreading themselves too thin, when they could add so many more happy hours to their week simply by refusing to appear in a reality show about their inclination to overextend themselves.
 Mr. McDermott tries to match his wife's version of ambition but at the same time complacently embraces his inability to serve as the family's financial bedrock. He refers to himself as an actor, undermining the artistic self-perception of every student currently enrolled in the drama program at Juilliard. Eight years ago he appeared in ''Hysteria: The Def Leppard Story'' and has since graduated to material like ''Santa Baby 2'' with Jenny McCarthy. He sees himself as a man defined by his passions. Scuba diving consumed him in previous seasons, but now it is motorcycling, which scares his wife but also ticks her off because she is too busy working to pursue fleeting interests.
 Like so many women who out-earn their husbands, Ms. Spelling harbors barely sublimated resentments. As she explains on her blog on Oxygen.com, she doesn't have time for hobbies. ''My family comes first no matter what,'' she says. ''They are my priority! But, one day I'd love to take up scrapbooking.''
 This, of course, serves only as a quarter truth. Sometimes Ms. Spelling wants to be a stay-at-home mother; sometimes she wants to run an empire. Peering over her laptop at her son, she wrestles with her decision to reprise her role as Donna Martin in the CW remake of ''Beverly Hills 90210'': ''If I was filming '90210' today, I would have missed him eating his first pastry,'' she tells her husband.
 What Ms. Spelling does not seem to miss is her relationship with her estranged mother, Candy Spelling, whose maternal transgressions are a recurring theme on the show as well as in her books. In ''Mommywood'' Ms. Spelling laments her mother's insistence that she wear Halloween costumes made for her by Nolan Miller, creator of the ''Dynasty'' wardrobe. All she ever wanted growing up, she writes, was ''store-bought simplicity.'' 
 Ms. Spelling, who reportedly received little of the fortune of her father, Aaron Spelling, when he died, seems to provide her children with measured privilege. She lives modestly enough that you might think she worked as the help for one of the Real Housewives of New Jersey. Yes, ''Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood'' is potential recession programming.
 TORI & DEAN
 Home Sweet Hollywood
 Oxygen, Tuesday nights at 10, Eastern and Pacific times; 9, Central time.
 Fenton Bailey, Randy Barbato, Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott, executive producers; Richard Courtney and Robert Sizemore, co-executive producers; Alastair Surprise, supervising story producer; Heidi Larson and Natalia Munoz, story producers; John Vidas, senior field producer; Donovan Lovell, field producer; James McGowan, production designer; Marios Panagiotopoulos, director of photography. Produced by World of Wonder and Life in a Bowl.
 The Little Couple
 The cosmic coincidence of scheduling compels me to mention the arrival of another reality series about a young married couple embarking on life in a fish bowl. ''The Little Couple'' (beginning on Tuesday on TLC) revolves around Bill Klein, a businessman, and Jen Arnold, a neonatalogist, who share a compatibility of mind and, more pointedly for the purposes of reality television, a likeness of physical stature: they are both under four feet tall. They face a big move (as do Ms. Spelling and Mr. McDermott) and the challenge of eking out more time for each other.
 Beautiful People
 ''The Little Couple'' is to be missed; ''Beautiful People,'' a British comedy beginning on Tuesday on Logo, is not. Based on the book of the same title, a memoir by the fashion wit and creative director of Barneys New York Simon Doonan, ''Beautiful People'' takes funny, poignant measure of the hunger for fabulosity in the midst of the drearily mundane. 
 Luke Ward-Wilkinson plays the young Simon, a 13-year-old with theatrical aspirations who maintains a loving, affectionate horror of his parents' blowzy aversion to urbanity, and Olivia Colman excels as his smeared-lipstick barmaid mother, a working-class matron in southeast England who would send a thug through a blender to protect a son she can't quite fathom.

HEADLINE: Epidemics, Fearsome and Fascinating

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.

 BODY:
You have probably had your fill by now of swine flu, bird flu, flu of all descriptions; you have turned off your television, tossed the front section of this newspaper into the trash, and called for not one more word about the flu or any of the other dire infections breaking news around the globe.
 Sad news: you are out of luck. There will unquestionably be more words -- many more -- and you will probably wind up reading them. An insatiable fascination with contagious illness is hard-wired into all of us, as two new books make clear. 
 From Philip Alcabes, an epidemiologist and a professor at Hunter College in New York, comes ''Dread,'' a sober analysis of why exactly this should be so. What is it that distinguishes epidemic infection from all other diseases, the ones that fail to generate breathless headlines and have failed to inspire the gigantic body of literature and commentary that trail behind history's epidemics? 
 The answer is logical enough: epidemics hit us right at the nexus of self-interest and altruism, that exquisitely uncomfortable spot where our brother's misfortune nudges us just enough that we need to examine it and distance ourselves from it (and, in more highly evolved civilizations, take care of it before it takes care of us). 
 The history of epidemic infection is actually somewhat less about disease and treatment than the various ways humans have found to create a nice thick wall between the ill and the well, the ''us'' and the ''them.'' Only quite recently has the radical notion of reaching through the wall and protecting the well by treating the ill gained much support.
 Dr. Alcabes takes a methodical tour of the terrain, from the leprosy of biblical times through the bubonic plague outbreaks of medieval and Renaissance Europe, cholera and tuberculosis in the 19th century, AIDS in the 20th. Politics, religion and economic concerns shaped the public response to each, with feeble medical intervention generally trailing far behind. 
 The language itself, Dr. Alcabes argues, can sometimes transform the facts: once you call a disease an ''epidemic,'' for instance, you immediately imply that it has a story line, with a beginning and an end, a certain moral tenor and a narrative flow that regular old illness lacks.
 And so, he asks provocatively, is obesity is really the newest modern epidemic? Or is the word being used cannily by public health officials, with the intent of inspiring a specific public reaction -- creating an ''us'' and a ''them'' (''they'' have bad habits and have made poor choices) and implying that someday it will be ''over''?
 This is fascinating stuff, or at least it should be. Unfortunately, Dr. Alcabes writes with the trademark mumble of the social scientist, and he has successfully gutted most of the human interest from his story. The facts are there, but the color has bled far away.
 For living color, turn to ''The Lassa Ward,'' which effortlessly transmits both the facts and the fascination of a bad infectious outbreak. Dr. Ross Donaldson spent two months in Sierra Leone as a medical student in 2003. Malaria, tuberculosis, yellow fever and AIDS were rampant, but Dr. Donaldson, for reasons clear perhaps only to the invulnerable post-adolescent he was at the time, decided to spend his time with Lassa fever patients.
 This rat-borne illness is one of Africa's dire viral hemorrhagic fevers; like Ebola, it can reduce a human body to a bruised, bloated corpse in days. It is terrifying -- the secretions of infected patients easily spread the disease -- but it is also treatable, and in the best cases patients get well and go home.
 Dr. Donaldson had trailed the elderly Lassa specialist Dr. Conteh for only a few weeks when, to his horror, he was left alone in charge of the Lassa isolation ward. ''No matter how low a cotton tree falls, it is still taller than grass,'' the old doctor said as he left to teach in another town. In other words, the inexperienced Dr. Donaldson, with three years of medical school, had more formal education than anyone else around.
 With patients who were sicker than sick, and little in the way of tests or treatments, Dr. Donaldson clung to the usual life preservers: the advice of a couple of experienced nurses and his own common sense. At the end of two weeks, he writes, ''I hardly recognized the person I had become.'' He was a Lassa expert, veteran of the old education-by-immersion process that terrifies medical students no matter where they are. 
 His take on epidemic infection is dead-on, down to the bizarre stubbornness that often permeates stricken communities and prevents the very changes that might save lives. (For Lassa, a key preventive measure was to stop eating rats, but rat meat tasted far too good for that advice to be taken seriously.)
 Dr. Donaldson shows how life can be strangely orderly at the deep center of an epidemic: meals are eaten, drugs are dispensed, patients die but others recover, and a little girl lying bloated and moribund in the hospital makes it home to play in a rat-infested yard. She may be immune to Lassa now, but her playmates are not. This is the portrait of contagion at the highest possible magnification, and all the abstruse details of policy, prevention and financing are right there, if you look hard enough.

A MILESTONE,
 And a Look Back
 ''No. 1, meet No. 10,000. No. 10,000, meet No. 1.''
 The introduction before the commencement of the Graduate Center of the City University of New York on Thursday may not go like that, but it could. No. 1 -- the first person to receive a doctorate from the Graduate Center -- will meet the person who will receive the 10,000th doctorate. 
 No. 1 is Daniel Robinson, 72, now a professor of philosophy at Oxford University and a distinguished professor emeritus at Georgetown University. 
 Of the 300 graduate students scheduled to receive doctorates on Thursday, the university has designated Kristen Case, a published poet who has already received the Graduate Center's Millennium Dissertation Award, as No. 10,000. 
 Dr. Robinson will place the hood on Ms. Case during the ceremony at Lincoln Center, signifying that she has become Dr. Case. 
 His own commencement 44 years ago was much smaller: Only two doctorates were awarded, to Dr. Robinson and to Barbara Stern, who was pregnant -- the Graduate Center says the ceremony was held earlier than planned so she would have her degree before her baby arrived. And because there were only two of them, Dr. Robinson said, there was time for their principal academic advisers to deliver 10-minute speeches about them and their work. ''As things go, that was the most memorable part of it,'' he said.
 He said there was an element of uncertainty: ''There wasn't a rehearsal on this. We were told to show up at the appointed hour and be sure we had our cap and gown -- the City University would take care of our doctoral hood.''
 Who received the Ph.D. first? ''I think I got it nominally because my last name begins with R and hers with S,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''I edged her out by one letter.''
 Of course, Dr. Stern could have deposited her dissertation first, but a university spokesman said that degrees are not officially awarded until the faculty votes the acceptance of the candidates at commencement. So, officially, it was a tie.
 Dr. Robinson, whose doctorate was in psychology, went on to teach at Amherst, Princeton and Columbia as well as Oxford and Georgetown. Dr. Stern, whose degree was in English, was a professor of marketing at Rutgers. She died on Jan. 15.
 The daughter Dr. Stern was carrying on graduation day in 1965 will be at the ceremony on Thursday, said Dr. Robinson, who will also receive the Graduate Center's Presidential Distinguished Alumni Award. 
 ''If I get a chance, I will say this is the second time she has seen me be awarded something.'' JAMES BARRON NEW YORK

HEADLINE: Q & A with Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
Q: (Reader)
 There's a new Macy's commercial for its everyday value merchandise that includes a boy saying something like, ''My mom says it's smart to be thrifty.'' I remember the slogan ''It's smart to be thrifty'' as part of ad campaigns for Macy's a long time ago. Can you tell me anything more about this?
 A: (Stuart Elliott) 
 The phrase is indeed featured in ''in our new everyday value spot,'' Holly Thomas, a spokeswoman in New York for the Macy's division of Macy's Inc., writes in an e-mail message.
 She says the goal is ''revitalizing a famous and timeless Macy's slogan'' that is believed to date to the 1920s and, as best as Macy's can determine, was used in some fashion through the early 1950s.
 ''After the strong consumer response to our 'Anthem' spot,'' Ms. Thomas says, referring to the recent commercial celebrating Macy's 150th birthday, ''we know that our customers relate and respond to Macy's long and colorful heritage, and that those who remembered this particular slogan connected it to our history of trust and value.''
 The commercial was created internally at Macy's.
 ''It's smart to be thrifty'' is from the days when Macy's battled the late, lamented Gimbels chain of department stores for the patronage of middle-class consumers like the shopper played by Thelma Ritter in the classic holiday film ''Miracle on 34th Street.'' (There was a scene from the film in the ''Anthem'' commercial, which was chockablock with references to Macy's in the popular culture.) 
 Nowadays, Macy's is much more glamorous in how it markets itself and presents its merchandise than it was in the heyday of ''It's smart to be thrifty.'' But perhaps the current economic climate, which seems to have renewed the public's interest in thrift, may lead to a sustained comeback for the vintage slogan.
 The slogan was the brainchild of Bernice Fitz-Gibbon, a legend of retail advertising who at another point in her career wrote a popular ad slogan for Gimbels, ''Nobody but nobody undersells Gimbels.'' Writing famous lines for dueling department stores -- now that's an achievement any mad man, or woman, could aspire to.
 I seem to recall a radio commercial for Macy's that included a jingle with a chorus singing ''It's smart to be thrifty'' and spelling out, one by one, the letters in Macy's. It was a real-life echo of the make-believe commercials in movies about advertising like ''The Hucksters'' and ''It's Always Fair Weather,'' which include spots for imaginary products like Beautee soap (''B-e-a-u-t-double-e'') and Klenzrite washing powder (''K-l-e, n-z-r, i-t-e'').
 Q: (Reader)
 What's the name of that song from the current AT&T commercial, which starts, ''I think possibly, maybe, I'm falling for you''?
 A: (Stuart Elliott)
 The commercial for AT&T, titled ''Backpackers,'' is part of the ''More bars in more places'' campaign for its wireless operations. The spot was created by BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group.
 Roy Elvove, a spokesman for the agency, identifies the song as ''Falling in Love at a Coffee Shop'' by Landon Pigg.

HEADLINE: Auto Troubles Touch Many Corners: Europe Feels the Strain of Protecting Workers and Plants

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: RUSSELSHEIM, Germany 

 BODY:
For Klaus Franz, the top union official at General Motors' Opel unit here, the difference between how the United States and Europe confront the auto industry's global overcapacity problem is simple.
 ''In the U.S., you get money to close down factories,'' said Mr. Franz, referring to the tens of thousands of Chrysler and G.M. workers who will lose their jobs as part of the White House's plan to restructure the American auto industry. ''In Europe, you get money to keep them open and safeguard jobs.'' 
 It is an appealing sound bite worthy of one of the Continent's most powerful and articulate labor leaders -- but the reality may be more complicated. 
 For even as Europe refuses to emulate the United States and reduce the ranks of its auto workers, its carmakers risk falling behind in the current wave of global consolidation that is transforming the industry. Eventually Europe may be forced to grapple with the fact that it does not need all the auto plants it has to meet demand. 
 In the last five years, the number of auto workers in Europe has held steady at roughly 2.3 million, even as the American automotive work force dipped from 1.1 million in 2003 to 781,000 by the end of 2008.
 Sales have dropped sharply in both markets, however, and experts say Europe has at least 25 percent too much production capacity. In recent years, car production at new plants in central and Eastern Europe has surged, but few of the older, more expensive factories in France, Belgium or Germany have closed. 
 ''If they don't take the pain now the way the U.S. is accepting it, you're just storing up a crisis in 10 years time,'' Stuart Pearson, an analyst with Credit Suisse in London, said.
 For now, however, European workers and politicians prefer to put off any hard decisions. As G.M. lurches toward a likely bankruptcy filing by June 1 and several bidders race to make a deal for Opel and the rest of G.M. Europe, the goal of preserving jobs, not profits, could determine the winner. 
 Along with G.M.'s endorsement, financial aid from the German government will be needed by any of the potential acquirers, which include the Italian automaker Fiat as well as Magna International, a Canadian auto parts maker with major operations in Europe, and RHJ International, a Brussels-based private equity firm. 
 ''Too many players and too much capacity is a recipe for value destruction,'' Mr. Pearson said. The stakes are especially high for Fiat, whose chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, has embraced the American approach and called for consolidation with a few global players dominating the industry. 
 Last month, Mr. Marchionne successfully persuaded Washington to give Fiat a 20 percent stake in Chrysler when it emerges from bankruptcy this summer, as well as billions in financing for Chrysler in exchange for new technology from Fiat that he claims will make Chrysler more efficient and broaden its product line.
 But a similar strategy to acquire Opel and vault Fiat into the top tier of global car companies is faltering because Berlin fears Mr. Marchionne will use as much as 7 billion euros in government aid for Opel to shut factories and lay off German workers. Mr. Marchionne is set to meet Tuesday in Berlin with Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, in a last-ditch attempt to win her support, with the German government expected to announce a decision later this week.
 German officials prefer a rival bid by Magna because they believe it will preserve more jobs. 
 Few observers dispute that Europe has the capacity to produce too many cars for too few consumers. The 27-member European Union makes 30 percent of the world's automobiles even though it is home to less than 10 percent of its population, and exports only a small, luxury slice of that output.
 ''It will have to be solved but it's unlikely to be fixed in the short-term,'' said Ivan Hodac, secretary-general of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. 
 Because of generous severance requirements under European law, he said his members ''can't close factories in a time of crisis, you don't have the money for it.''
 ''In times of economic growth, it's also difficult,'' he added. ''The trade unions will say why?''
 A decision on the fate of G.M. in Europe could come within days, but Mr. Franz does not betray much anxiety at a time when American union bosses are tallying their losses. Noting that Mrs. Merkel faces a re-election campaign in September, he said, ''Do you think the German government will give once cent to close down factories in an election year?''
 In a bid to reassure political and labor leaders, Fiat on Friday took the unusual step of publicly disputing German media reports that a Fiat acquisition of Opel would claim 18,000 jobs, insisting instead that total job losses throughout Europe would amount to less than 10,000 and that only a small portion of those would be in Germany. G.M. employs roughly 50,000 workers across Europe, about half of whom are in Germany. 
 In contrast, G.M. plans to shut 13 plants North American plants and lay off 21,000 workers as part of its turnaround plan. By 2014, G.M.'s goal is to cut its hourly work force to 38,000, compared with 61,000 in the first quarter of 2009.
 If Magna were to win control of G.M. Europe, according to a top official familiar with the negotiations, G.M. would retain a 35 percent stake in the new company, with Russia's Sberbank getting 35 percent, Magna taking 20 percent, and Opel's employees owning 10 percent. 
 Fiat, on the other hand, would have a clear majority stake in a new Fiat-led auto group, with G.M. getting a smaller fraction of the new company. RHJ International's bid foresees it taking a 51 percent interest, while G.M. would retain 49 percent.
 If it is successful, the Russian support for the Magna bid might help Opel gain market share in Russia, and Mrs. Merkel discussed the offer with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin over the weekend. 
 Regardless of who acquires Opel, experts say Europe needs to come to grips with the overcapacity problem if it is going to be able to compete with Japanese automakers now, as well as potentially more efficient American car companies when the economy recovers.
 ''Europe does have to make a choice,'' said Garel Rhys, head of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales. ''In North America, the unions have realized there will be no jobs left if the capacity issue isn't dealt with. If Europe doesn't do the same, the industry won't be able to make the profits they need to invest for the future.''
 Eventually, he warns, taxpayers will tire of making up the difference. ''Patience is wearing pretty thin,'' he said.
 Despite European Union rules aimed at guaranteeing a single market without state intervention, Mr. Rhys said the concern over the job cuts in Germany, as well as the need for the loans from Berlin, makes it likely that workers in Britain and Belgium will shoulder a disproportionate share of any American-style plant closures.
 If that were to happen, Rudi Kennes, the union head at the G.M. plant in Antwerp, warned, ''They'd have a big problem and everybody knows it.''
 The Antwerp plant is running significantly below its production capacity of 125,000 cars annually; while its work force has declined, G.M. has wanted to close it for years. But Mr. Kennes said he believed the 500 million euros in financial support recently offered by the local Flemish government would prevent that, much as the German government aid would protect jobs there. 
 Fiat and Magna have both identified Antwerp for potential cuts, but like Mr. Franz, Mr. Kennes does not seem especially worried. ''We're immune to these kinds of messages,'' he said during an interview at the eerily quiet factory. ''I hope to write a book, 'The Plant They Couldn't Close.' ''

Well
 From Tara Parker-Pope's blog, nytimes.com/well.
 Instead of just telling their children not to consume alcohol at parties, parents should use science to reinforce the message, says a new report from the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
 The group says parents should assume children will be tempted to drink on prom night and other end-of-school celebrations. Surveys suggest that about 75 percent of students have tried alcohol at least once, 1 in 3 have been a passenger in a car driven by someone who was drinking, and about 10 percent have recently driven a car after drinking.
 The association suggests teaching children the chemistry, biology and neuroscience of alcohol consumption. For example, the hippocampus, the part of the brain that stores memory, is still developing in teenagers, so alcohol can erase their best memories of prom night. And adolescents are especially vulnerable to alcohol's effects because their prefontal cortex, which controls decision-making, isn't mature until the late 20s.

 The rich and fast-growing countries that dominate the global economy -- and the human influence on the global atmosphere -- are convening again, this time in Paris, as part of an Obama administration initiative to create partnerships and programs on climate and energy. A previous effort by the Bush administration was widely criticized, particularly in Europe, as an end run around United Nations talks on a new climate treaty. Can the Obama administration's version of the process work? 
 In an interview, Todd D. Stern, President Obama's special envoy on climate change, said a goal was to foster cooperative action and investment on ''transformational technologies'' like energy storage, photovoltaics and nuclear power -- which many experts say will be needed no matter what gains are made in efficiency and improvements in known technologies. 
 One glaring need is research on translating the near-boundless energy of the sun into a cheap source of electricity.
 TierneyLab
 From John Tierney's blog, nytimes.com/tierneylab.
 As promised, we have more answers from Robert Desimone, director of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at M.I.T., to your questions on the science of paying attention. We'll start with a question from Scott Goodwin about information overload:
 Q.We have created a technology-rich environment that is designed to distract, and we've become addicted to it. ... It's too easy to leave the new mail indicator running, to have your BlackBerry notify you of every incoming message as it arrives.
 A. Many readers made similar points about information overload in a hyperconnected world. But it's not obvious that the attention load is higher than it was in the past. Our ancestors had to attend to a lot of things that most of us can safely ignore -- how to avoid starving to death or being mauled by wild animals, etc. My guess is that New Yorkers today learn to tune out stimuli that would have seemed inconceivably distracting to our ancestors.

HEADLINE: Localities Want U.S. To Support Muni Bonds

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
State and local governments are asking Washington to give them something that banks are trying to get rid of: federal bailout money. 
 California is asking that money from the Treasury's TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, be used to help back more than $13 billion in short-term borrowings. Members of Congress and several municipalities want bailout money to be used to cover more than $1 billion in losses from investments by municipalities in debt issued by Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that went bust. 
 And Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is drafting legislation that would have the Federal Reserve, and potentially the Treasury's bailout money as well, stand behind floating-rate municipal bonds -- a $400 billion market that provides short-term financing to municipalities, but which has been largely frozen in the current credit crisis. 
 Another measure drafted by Mr. Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, would create a public finance office within the Treasury Department to reinsure $50 billion in municipal bonds. This proposal comes as downgrades of municipal bond insurance companies have made it more difficult and costly for state and local governments to issue bonds. 
 All of the proposals are meant to help struggling state and local governments that are facing a cash-flow squeeze. The economic downturn has eaten into their tax bases as local businesses shut, houses are lost to foreclosure and there is a resistance to raising taxes. The risk to the federal government is that it could lose money if things get worse for municipalities and states. Although backing debt with a guarantee does not require an immediate outlay of funds, the federal government could have to cover losses if there are defaults -- which could be substantial if the economy weakens or states and municipalities cannot bring their budget deficits under control. Nonetheless, these overtures by state and local officials reflect a sense -- perhaps just a hope -- that municipalities suffering from a downturn in revenues and creditworthiness may find some relief in Washington beyond the stimulus money the federal government already is spending. 
 When the relief program was first conceived of last year, pleas by municipalities for a slice of the money went unheeded by Treasury officials who had earmarked the funds solely for troubled banks and financial institutions. But, in recent days, new conversations have taken place involving Federal Reserve and Treasury officials and state and local representatives that have given rise to cautious optimism. 
 ''The municipal sector has been asking for federal assistance since TARP was just a glimmer in Hank Paulson's eye,'' said Matt Fabian, managing director at Municipal Market Advisors, an independent research firm. ''But no one was pursuing it for months. Now, there has been a re-engagement in Washington about using the TARP money.'' 
 Andrew Williams, a Treasury spokesman said, ''We've had conversations with people from California and with people from around the country about the challenges facing the municipal market. And we continue to study the issue closely.'' 
 In a speech last week at the National Press Club, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said that the Treasury is ''looking at ways to make sure these markets are working so that states and munis can meet their needs.'' 
 But, according to a Bloomberg News account of the speech, Mr. Geithner cautioned: ''I wouldn't use the word bailout.'' 
 With bailout fatigue setting in, it is unclear how successful the municipalities will be. At a Congressional hearing last Thursday called by Mr. Frank, federal officials remained cool to the idea of tapping into the relief fund, while still expressing concern over a credit squeeze facing many municipal borrowers. 
 David W. Wilcox, a deputy director at the Federal Reserve, said at the hearing that the Fed is ''quite concerned'' over any proposal that would extend federal guarantees to municipal debt. But, he allowed that if Congress does take that course, it should ''tailor any government intervention in the municipal bond market relatively narrowly'' and provide for a quick government exit when market conditions improve. 
 On the same day, Mr. Geithner told a House Appropriations subcommittee that the relief money cannot be used to resolve local government budget crises, since that money has been reserved for financial companies.
 He said, however, that the Treasury would work with Congress to help states like California, which have been struggling to arrange backing for municipal bonds and short-term debt. Mr. Geithner did not provide any specifics. 
 Clearly, market conditions are not favorable in several corners of the municipal bond market, which consists of more than 50,000 public entities that have issued about $2.7 trillion in debt. 
 In April, Moody's Investors Service issued its first-ever blanket report on municipalities and assigned a negative outlook on the creditworthiness of all local governments in the United States. This suggests that Moody's may downgrade the ratings of many municipal issuers, which would increase their borrowing costs. 
 The biggest squeeze right now is on variable-rate demand notes, a common form of floating-rate borrowing that is backed by the promise of having sufficient future municipal revenues to repay investors -- an increasingly uncertain proposition. The relief money would be used to guarantee these notes. 
 California, which has been crying the loudest for relief money, is in worse shape than most municipal borrowers. In a May 13 letter to Mr. Geithner, California's treasurer, Bill Lockyer, said that the state ''will be almost out of cash in July.'' 
 Mr. Lockyer added that it is ''highly unlikely that the state can access the short-term market ... based on its own credit.'' 
 ''We believe that California is not the only state to confront the same short-term cash-flow borrowing needs,'' said Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for the California treasurer's office. ''But no one has as great a need as we do in terms of dollars.'' 
 Michael Decker, a co-chief executive for the Regional Bond Dealers Association, concurred. 
 ''All kinds of municipal borrowers are facing revenue shortfalls,'' said Mr. Decker. ''California is the largest example. Some states are better off than others. But all outstanding debt is backed by tax revenues. And municipalities are facing a greater or lesser level of distress.'' 
 Also clamoring for help is a group of municipalities that purchased Lehman debt, which is now nearly worthless. Legislation authorizing the use of relief money to make these purchases was introduced by two California Democratic representatives, Jackie Speier and Anna Eshoo. If approved, this would be more like a bailout than a guarantee, because the federal government would be paying face value for debt that otherwise has little value.
 The price tag on that proposal is around $1.6 billion. The argument promoted by the two congresswomen is that the Treasury and Fed allowed Lehman to fail, causing governmental bodies to lose money. 
 Though this effort has hit stiff opposition, Ms. Eshoo has not given up. 
 ''It's been said that some banks are too big to fail,'' Ms. Eshoo said in testimony at a May 5 hearing held by Mr. Frank on the issue. ''It can also be that counties, school districts and cities are too small to be noticed.''

HEADLINE: A Time To Remember, And Cash In

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Not all remembrances on Memorial Day were about the brave ones who went to war and didn't come home. Memories were stirring as well among those who, typically without the benefit of ever having been in uniform themselves, sent the brave ones off to war.
 We are in a season rich with recollections being offered by key figures in the George W. Bush presidency. They have been busy writing their memoirs, or at least shopping them around -- people like Dick Cheney, Donald H. Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, Karl Rove and, lest we forget, Mr. Bush himself. 
 This is to be expected. Once they have let slip the reins of power, senior people in every administration race to their desktops to pound out their side of the story and (no small consideration) to cash in on it. Big time, as Mr. Cheney might say. Former President Bill Clinton remains the gold standard, having received a $15 million advance for a thick memoir judged by some reviewers as notable less for its literary elegance than for its utility as a doorstop.
 These books are very important to New York. This city doesn't have many industries left. The few that survive, like Wall Street and the news media, are hobbling. But we are still the country's publishing capital. That means we are the capital of self-serving reminiscences. They may or may not be what is known in court as the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but the city's economy benefits when they are cranked out at a steady pace.
 New York also tends to be the first stop when it comes time to huckster these works of self-promotion because we also have Matt and Meredith and Diane and Barbara and Scott and Katie, whose on-air interviews are needed to oxygenate even the most celebrated memoirists. Hey, it's a living.
 All of us have seen the routine scores of times.
 As good an example as any is George J. Tenet, a son of Queens who became the director of central intelligence. On his watch in the crow's nest we had the Sept. 11 attacks and the launching of an unpopular war in Iraq, rooted partly in Mr. Tenet's assurance -- a ''slam dunk,'' he called it -- that Saddam Hussein had an arsenal of illicit weapons. Mr. Tenet parlayed that dazzling record into a fat book contract with HarperCollins.
 Last year, it was the turn of Scott McClellan, a former Bush press secretary. Ten months before he left the White House in 2006, he had become ''increasingly disillusioned by things,'' Mr. McClellan said. Yet he kept his thoughts from the American public -- until PublicAffairs paid him for them. Funny how a book deal can loosen the tongue faster than a bottle of 16-year-old Lagavulin.
 Among the latest to join the memoir parade is Mimi Beardsley Alford, a New York woman who had an 18-month-long affair with President John F. Kennedy when she was a young intern in his White House. Ms. Alford acknowledged the liaison soon after it was exposed in 2003. She said then in a statement, ''I will have no further comment on this subject, period.''
 If only.
 Over the Memorial Day weekend, word came that Ms. Alford got a rich advance, said to approach seven figures, to tell her story for Random House. Her agent said it would not be a tell-all memoir. Of course not. Why would anyone care about her romps with the president? We'd all no doubt be eager for Ms. Alford's musings on life had she fooled around back then with, say, a deputy secretary of the interior.
 CERTAINLY, memoirs can be instructive, even inspiring. But there is increasingly no reason to assume they bear even a faint resemblance to the truth.
 In the last few years, we have been subject to a fake ''true story'' about the Holocaust by Herman Rosenblat, a phony tale by Margaret Seltzer about her gang life in Los Angeles and a salacious look at professional baseball players by Matt McCarthy, whose fealty to facts has been strongly challenged. Who doesn't remember James Frey's account of drug addiction that proved to be bogus, shattered into a million little pieces?
 Given some of their past statements, the Bush administration officials now birthing memoirs are bound to contradict one another as well as the likes of Mr. Tenet and Mr. McClellan. Good luck trying to figure out where reality lies.
 War, it seems on this Memorial Day, isn't the only human endeavor whose first casualty is the truth.

HEADLINE: Principals Younger and Freer, But Raise Doubts in the Schools

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN and ROBERT GEBELOFF

 BODY:
They are younger than their predecessors, have less experience in the classroom and are, most often, responsible for far fewer students. But their salaries are higher and they have greater freedom over hiring and budgets, handling a host of responsibilities formerly shouldered by their supervisors.
 Among the most striking transformations of New York's public school system since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took charge in 2002 is that of the role of principal, once the province of middle-aged teachers promoted through the ranks, now often filled by young graduates of top colleges. 
 ''I wanted to change the old system,'' Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said in an interview. ''New leadership is a powerful way to do that.'' 
 One of Mr. Klein's proudest achievements is luring promising candidates to the toughest schools by providing more autonomy in exchange for accountability through test scores and other data. 
 But an analysis by The New York Times of the city's signature report-card system shows that schools run by graduates of the celebrated New York City Leadership Academy -- which the mayor created and helped raise more than $80 million for -- have not done as well as those led by experienced principals or new principals who came through traditional routes.
 A separate Times analysis shows that since 2002, opening hundreds of new schools and raising salaries have swelled the principals' payroll 43 percent after adjusting for inflation. The average salary among the current 1,500 school leaders tops $133,000, 10 percent higher than their 1,200 counterparts in 2002 in inflation-adjusted dollars, even as the median household income nationally has risen only marginally.
 An average of 649 students are under each principal's purview, compared with 879 six years ago; pay per pupil, then, has jumped to $205 from $138 in 2008 dollars.
 Nearly 80 percent of the city's principals were not on the job in 2001; Chad A. Altman, the 28-year-old head of a Bronx elementary school, was still studying public policy at Carnegie Mellon University when the mayor was petitioning Albany for school control. Indeed, 22 percent of today's principals are under 40, compared with 6 percent in 2002; about 20 percent of them have less than five years of teaching experience, double the percentage in 2002.
 Mr. Klein's cultivation of a new breed of school leadership is being watched around the country, where many cities are grappling with waves of principal retirements even as more is being asked of public schools. 
 As New York State lawmakers consider whether to renew the 2002 mayoral control law, which expires June 30, one proposal on the table would revive the district superintendents, now largely powerless, to more closely supervise and support principals.
 For all of New York's recent focus and investment in school leadership, more than a quarter of teachers said in city surveys last spring that they did not trust their principals or consider them effective managers, and more than a third of those leaving the system cited the quality of school leadership as among the main reasons. ''Perceptions of principal leadership skills are drivers of attrition,'' an internal report concluded. 
 Teacher turnover has been higher at schools run by Leadership Academy principals -- over the summer of 2007, nearly a quarter of these principals lost at least a third of their teachers, compared with 9 percent of other principals -- though some see that as evidence the new leaders are shaking things up. Iris Blige, a graduate of the first class of the Leadership Academy, has seen at least eight assistant principals and dozens of teachers leave the Fordham High School of the Arts since she took over in 2004; she was the subject of an angry protest in March.
 In interviews with three dozen principals, former principals and education experts, many said the newfound ability to select faculty was invaluable, but painted a portrait of a job that has grown complex and unwieldy. 
 ''You're a teacher, you're Judge Judy, you're a mother, you're a father, you're a pastor, you're a therapist, you're a nurse, you're a social worker,'' said Maxine Nodel, principal since 2003 of the 481-student Millennium Art Academy in the Bronx. ''You're a curriculum planner, you're a data gatherer, you're a budget scheduler, you're a vision spreader.''
 Ms. Nodel, who has taught math, English, science, art and chess over 18 years, earned two A's in a row under the city's new school report card system. But, she said, ''This is the most exhausted I've ever been.''
 Brilliance and Mediocrity
 Allison Gaines Pell could be the personification of the new principalship. A graduate of Brown University with a master's degree in education from Harvard, she taught for three years at St. Ann's, a Brooklyn private school, and two in Syracuse, and worked for educational nonprofit agencies before being fast-tracked to the principal's office through the Leadership Academy in 2005. 
 At 34, she is one of 132 current school leaders under age 35, up from 26 in 2002, and one of 237 who have worked in the district less than a decade, up from 54 in 2002. She earns $127,000 a year running a middle school of 278.
 Over a few days at her Urban Assembly Academy of Arts and Letters in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, this spring, Ms. Gaines Pell gave out high school acceptance letters, videotaped two lessons, revised the laptop security policy, joined a meeting between the school nurse and a student with a hurt hip, and experienced the joys and headaches of being in charge of her own budget. 
 Headache: a rumor that when students did not pay for lunch, she would have to make up the shortfall (she has yet to determine whether this is true). Joy: a new computer program -- which she could buy without approval from on high -- designed to help teachers collaborate online.
 ''That's hot!'' Ms. Gaines Pell exclaimed to her assistant principal, John O'Reilly. ''That's really hot,'' he seconded.
 But while Ms. Gaines Pell's school earned an A from the city this fall, The Times's analysis shows that Leadership Academy graduates were less than half as likely to get A's as other principals, and almost twice as likely to earn C's or worse. Among elementary and middle-school principals on the job less than three years, Academy graduates were about a third as likely to get A's as those who did not attend the program.
 While Academy graduates do tend to be placed in some of the city's lowest-achieving schools, the report-card system has built-in controls to account for that, emphasizing progress over performance and comparing schools with similar demographics. Still, Sandra J. Stein, chief executive of the Leadership Academy, said the cards -- the city's primary accountability measure -- are not a fair gauge of her graduates because, as she put it, ''it takes time to reverse a downward trend.''
 After five years running primarily on private donations, the Leadership Academy won a city contract last June for up to $10 million a year. Its centerpiece is the Aspiring Principals Program, a 14-month paid boot camp that has graduated 336 people since 2003, 227 of whom are now principals -- 15 percent of the total. 
 One Leadership Academy alumnus was removed from his post this month, pending Education Department investigations, after a public screaming match with the school's parent coordinator; more than 250 parents had signed a letter citing a ''litany of problems'' including ''increased staff turnover, parent dissatisfaction and general turmoil.'' Another was removed upon his arrest in February for driving while intoxicated and fleeing the scene of an accident. 
 The first independent analysis of the academy's effectiveness, done at New York University, is due in June. ''I think our batting average is quite good,'' Mr. Klein said. ''Could it improve? I'm sure it could improve.''
 Pulling Their Own Strings
 Andrew M. L. Turay vividly remembers, back when he was principal of the Bronx's mammoth Evander Childs High School in 2001, the day an assistant principal who had struggled at another school walked into his office and announced she would now be working with him: superintendent's orders. ''You were the figurehead as a principal, but the actual power was in the superintendent's office,'' he said. ''They were pulling the strings.'' 
 Now, as principal of Peace and Diversity Academy, a small high school in the Bronx that he founded in 2004, Mr. Turay not only picks his own staff but decides how to train them. Still cringing over the time he returned to Evander from a required daylong monthly session to find that a student had assaulted a staff member in the cafeteria, Mr. Turay can -- and does -- choose to skip virtually all meetings outside the office. 
 Where he oversaw more than 3,000 students at Evander, Mr. Turay now has 315, and makes it his business to know who was just absent for five days (the girl with multiple face piercings), and who is struggling with sexual identity (18 students are openly gay). There is no superintendent regularly visiting; it is up to Mr. Turay to call his network leader -- his primary support person -- on her cellphone when he needs help. Someone sent by the Education Department descends on the school for a few days at least once every three years and then submits a ''quality review'' on its shortcomings and successes, but Mr. Turay is judged, in large part, by a thick stack of documents.
 Compliance checklists, on items including vision-testing and fire drills. School report cards (he got a B). Parent and teacher surveys. A review of how well he has met his own goals.
 Mr. Turay, who is 57 and has worked in city schools for 24 years, prefers the new system, or at least the small-school environment. ''I didn't know kids, I didn't know parents,'' he said of his days at Evander Childs. ''I couldn't tell if I helped anyone, really.''
 But the independence that has helped Mr. Turay flourish has tripped up others.
 Maria Penaherrera -- who started as a substitute teacher 20 years ago and worked her way up to the principal's office -- used her financial freedom to hire four assistant principals at the 900-student Public School 114 in Canarsie, and ran up $150,000 in debt. Then she eliminated three of the positions only to have the fourth assistant principal quit. That left a custodian to take charge in February when a carbon monoxide alarm went off while Ms. Penaherrera was out. She has since been reassigned to a central office post while the Education Department investigates, and did not respond to requests for comment. 
 Peter McNally, executive vice president of the principals' union -- which has generally supported the mayor's reforms -- said the biggest complaint from members was ''that they spend more time looking at the data than in classrooms observing and supporting instruction.'' Indeed, many had deep reservations about a system in which, as one principal put it, ''my report card is my boss.'' 
 ''If teaching and learning become about credits and grades, it's not about learning,'' said Jill Herman, who retired last year after three decades as a teacher, principal and network leader. 
 Rookies Do Worse
 Philip Weinberg walks the halls of Brooklyn's 1,250-student High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology like the beloved mayor of a close-knit town, popping into a young math teacher's classroom, ushering teenagers off the sidewalk after dismissal in a manner both firm and warm. ''He's cool with all the students,'' said Anthony Mesa, a senior who took the liberty of adjusting Mr. Weinberg's scarf. 
 Mr. Weinberg, 49, started teaching English at the school, in Bay Ridge, in 1986 and became its principal in 2001; several of his staff members are former students. He is one of 255 principals -- 17 percent of the total -- in the same post as before mayoral control. (The number of rookie principals soared to 20 percent in 2003 and 25 percent in 2004, but has settled down to 12 percent over the past two years.)
 The Times's analysis shows that experience counts -- at least on school report cards. Forty-three percent of principals with at least a decade at their schools received A's last fall (including Mr. Weinberg), compared with 30 percent of those who had been at their schools up to two years.
 ''The longer you know a story, the better you know the story,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''I would hate to have been judged on my first three years as principal.''
 In an interview, Mr. Klein said he would like to see good principals stay 8 to 10 years; 5 out of 6, though, have not been around that long. And the first two principals the chancellor cited as models were Shimon Waronker, 40, a Leadership Academy graduate who is on leave from the school system to attend a graduate program at Harvard, and Marc S. Sternberg, 36, a Princeton and Harvard Business School graduate who plans to leave the high school he founded in 2004, Bronx Lab, this summer.
 Elana Karopkin left Brooklyn's Urban Assembly School for Law and Justice last summer, at 32, for a charter school group, saying she was physically and emotionally ''exhausted'' from what she described as a ''Herculean task.''
 And Michelle Harring, 62, retired last year after nearly a decade as principal of the Earth School on the Lower East Side, complaining of too much time spent ''belaboring the testing statistics'' or on the computer as well as bureaucratic reshufflings that left her scrambling to figure out whom to call for what.
 ''The job had many more pressures coming from lots of different directions, that I often felt took away from my time as a person who supported both teachers and the children in the classroom,'' she explained. ''I think of C.E.O.'s as people for whom the bottom lines are numbers and profit lines. I don't think principals should be C.E.O.'s.'' 
 Amy Ellen Schwartz, director of the Institute for Education and Social Policy at New York University, who is heading the Leadership Academy study, wonders whether the school system has constructed ''a job description for which there are very few really good candidates.''
 ''It may be that it's an impossible job,'' she said. ''You're asking for things that don't often come in the same person.''

HEADLINE: Selling Stake, Cavaliers Add a Major Player

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
The deal that may give a group of Chinese investors a minority stake in the Cleveland Cavaliers and its arena signals the first significant investment in a major American sports franchise by investors from China.
 The Cavaliers, who are led by LeBron James, the N.B.A.'s most valuable player this season and perhaps its biggest star, said they agreed over the weekend to sell a 15 percent stake in the franchise and its Quicken Loans Arena to the group, which is led by Kenny Huang, a Chinese-born investor who has also brokered marketing deals with the Yankees and the Houston Rockets, and a Hong Kong conglomerate.
 The deal must be approved by the league's board of governors. 
 If the sale is approved, it may be the most ambitious move yet in an American sports landscape full of leagues, teams and players striving for a foothold in the expansive and largely untapped Chinese marketplace. The N.B.A. has been aggressively expanding its presence in China with exhibition games and a joint venture that aims to develop a Chinese basketball league and professional arenas.
 Major League Baseball and the National Football League have also been seeking talent and business prospects in China. Nike and Adidas are doing the same. Prominent athletes like Kobe Bryant and Serena Williams have tried to capture part of the Chinese audience with endorsement deals.
 The N.B.A. is already enormously popular in China. N.B.A. games are telecast here and there are at least a half-dozen magazines devoted to the N.B.A. and its stars. Part of the popularity is attributed to the Rockets' Yao Ming. Last summer, James and Yao appeared in an advertisement for Coke that ran on Chinese television during the Olympics. But other players, like the Los Angeles Lakers' Bryant, are just as popular among Chinese youngsters.
 China also has two fast-growing athletic gear companies, Li Ning and Anta, both of which have signed deals with N.B.A. players or teams. The All-Star center Shaquille O'Neal, who plays for the Phoenix Suns, has a shoe contract with Li Ning.
 N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern said in a telephone interview that the deal between Huang and the Cavaliers would be ''the natural next step in our relationship with China'' and ''very much a validation of our business expansion there.''
 Marc Ganis, a Chicago-based sports consultant, and Huang founded Sportscorp China, a company that helps bridge sports and sponsorship deals between the United States and China, seven years ago. Huang is also a partner at Aspen Infrastructure Investment Corporation, a New York-based company that invests in Chinese infrastructure projects and says it has close ties to some of China's state-owned companies. Adrian Cheng, Huang's chief partner in the Cavaliers investment, is from the family that controls the Hong Kong conglomerate New World Development, which invests in hotels, infrastructure and telecommunications in China.
 Huang was in China on Monday and could not be reached for comment.
 In a telephone interview, Ganis said that Huang's attempt to buy the Cavaliers was part of ''creating a platform in sports and entertainment that will include investments in the United States and business activities in China.''
 Ganis added, ''If this deal is approved, there will be much more attention paid to the Cavaliers in China, like there is for Houston, and that will help the team and LeBron's own individual marketing.''
 The move will be interpreted as an effort by the Cavaliers to entice James, who will become a free agent after next season, to stay in Cleveland and capitalize on the franchise's connections in China. James has said that he wants to become the first athlete worth a billion dollars.
 ''This is just another example of Dan Gilbert trying to appeal to LeBron and building the case for why he should re-sign,'' said Mark S. Rosentraub, a sports business analyst and a professor at Cleveland State University, referring to the Cavaliers' majority owner. 
 ''And as the Cleveland economy suffers, like many other cities are right now, the Chinese investors give the team a hedge because they have deep pockets to take losses. If you are selling fewer luxury suites, the investors can help take the blow.''
 The financial success of the deal for Huang hinges, in part, on the Cavaliers' ability to re-sign James, Rosentraub said. ''If LeBron re-signs, the Chinese investors will be assured of at least six to seven years of a successful team and that will significantly enhance the deal,'' he said.
 Huang was born into a successful family with strong business and government ties in Guangzhou. By the time he arrived in New York to attend college, he spoke several languages fluently. He studied at Columbia University and New York University before starting Sportscorp China.
 In an interview last month with a sports publication called Titan Weekly, he said he and a group of investors were seeking to acquire a 15 percent stake in the Cavaliers.
 Four years ago, Huang and Ganis brokered one of the first significant sponsorship deals between a North American sports franchise and Chinese companies when the Rockets agreed to put advertisements in Mandarin in their arena.
 The following year, a group of investors led by Huang attempted to buy a minority share in the Rockets from their owner, Leslie Alexander.
 Two years ago, Huang and Ganis advised Yankees officials on ways to expand their marketing in China and helped them form a cooperation agreement with the Chinese Baseball Association. 
 ''Kenny has been a trusted adviser to the Yankees and helped us establish our operations in China and in other parts of Asia,'' Randy Levine, the team's president, said.
 Sportscorp China also arranged for Chinese companies to sponsor basketball games played by the United States national team in Guangzhou in 2007.
 Typically, only Chinese entrepreneurs with strong ties to the Chinese government can invest directly in infrastructure projects and state-owned companies.
 Ganis said that he had witnessed Huang's relationships with business and government officials in China, but declined to specify with whom he deals and how deep his relationships run with the government.

HEADLINE: Building It Big in Las Vegas

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
The ravages of the recession are visible in this gambling city, but one of the largest privately financed developments in the United States -- an $8.5 billion city within a city called CityCenter -- claims to be on schedule to open this year.
 The 67-acre development on the Strip consists of six towers with 2,392 apartments, as many as 5,900 hotel rooms, a casino, and a shopping center and entertainment complex. Some of the world's renowned architects have designed buildings for the project. Envisioned as a self-contained community, it will have its own fire department and power plant.
 CityCenter is seen as highly significant to Las Vegas's image as an entertainment mecca. But the city's swagger was shaken this year when the project's owners -- MGM Mirage, the publicly held casino operator, and Dubai World, an investment arm of the Dubai government -- ran into a legion of problems. As of this month, however, they said that those wrinkles have been ironed out. 
 Because of the credit crisis, CityCenter's owners found themselves in September 2008 unable to obtain several billion dollars that they had anticipated in loans from a consortium led by Bank of America. Though a $1.8 billion loan was eventually offered, the owners had to finance much of the project with their own cash. They had almost finished five towers when new problems erupted in February.
 Building inspectors discovered technical problems in the half-built sixth tower -- the Harmon Hotel, Spa and Residences -- and the developers decided to cut off construction at 25 floors, instead of the planned 47 stories, almost halving the tower and killing plans for 200 condominiums. The Harmon, designed by the prominent architect Norman Foster, will now be only a hotel with 400 rooms. 
 Although seen as a major embarrassment, the decision may have been a blessing in disguise, since condo prices are in a free fall in Las Vegas. (They are currently down about 30 percent from their peak.)
 Then MGM Mirage, with some $14 billion in debt, said in March that it was contemplating bankruptcy. Dubai World, which had put $4.3 billion into the project since forming the partnership in August 2007, filed a lawsuit against MGM Mirage seeking relief from its obligations.
 ''Dubai World is a sophisticated investor, and as such we actively monitor and seek to enhance and protect our investments wherever they are,'' said William Grounds, president of the Infinity World Development Corporation, the Dubai World subsidiary that is investing in CityCenter. 
 But the two partners worked out an agreement on April 29 that is intended to allow the project to continue whether or not MGM Mirage files for bankruptcy protection, those involved in negotiations said.
 The agreement ensured that $1.8 billion in loans from lenders will flow -- though at an interest rate that is 2 percent higher than originally negotiated. Also, if project costs exceed $8.5 billion, MGM Mirage will be responsible for the excess. Its CircusCircus casino and adjacent land are being used as collateral.
 The $8.5 billion does not include money to complete the Harmon, estimated to be a $200 million, to be paid by both partners under a separate agreement, said Alan Feldman, a spokesman for MGM Mirage.
 Mr. Feldman said the company did not expect cost overruns on CityCenter. ''We're very confident in the budget at $8.5 billion,'' he said. ''Generally speaking, the big-ticket parts of this project's budget have been coming down in price over these last few months,'' like labor and some material costs.
 The other moving piece in the agreement is condominium sales. If condo revenue is less than $243 million, then MGM Mirage has to put the amount of the shortfall into construction financing though Mr. Feldman said he doubted that would happen.
 ''We have $1.5 billion in condominiums under contract,'' he said. Although some prospective buyers may eventually back out, Mr. Feldman said reaching $243 million in sales is ''a fairly modest bar to have to get beyond.'' Closings will most likely begin as early as October. 
 In mid-May, 432 of the 670 residences at Veer Towers, two slanted 37-story residential high-rises designed by Helmut Jahn, were under contract, while 206 of 227 condos were under contract at the Residences at Mandarin Oriental, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox. (The Mandarin, which scheduled to open on Dec. 3, will also have 400 hotel rooms.)
 A 57-story semicircular tower called Vdara, designed by RV Architecture, led by Rafael Vinoly, has 1,495 residences, of which 698 had been sold as of mid-May. At the same time, Vdara, a condo-hotel, has booked 54,000 nights at rates of $159 to $2,000 a night.
 Mr. Feldman said that once owners close on their Vdara residences, they will be able to participate in a rental program that, beginning Oct. 1, leases their condos as hotel rooms when they are not residing there. For the hotel nights already booked, travelers will be put up in unsold condominiums.
 Aria, CityCenter's 61-story 4,004-room hotel-casino, designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects as several multilevel interlocking slices, is to open on Dec. 16. As of mid-May, Aria had booked 105,000 nights at room rates ranging from $179 to $799, and suites ranging from $500 to $7,500 a night. Aria will feature restaurants with award-winning chefs, and a theater for Cirque du Soleil's new Elvis-themed show.
 The oval-shaped Harmon hotel is not expected to open until late 2010.
 A 500,000-square-foot shopping, restaurant and entertainment complex with quartzlike jagged edges called the Crystals will open on Dec. 3. Designed by Studio Daniel Libeskind with interiors by David Rockwell, the Crystals fronts the Strip. Retailers that have leased space include Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Company, Tourbillon and Ermenegildo Zegna; Wolfgang Puck will open two restaurants there.
 Faith Hope Consolo, a New York-based retail broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate, was in Las Vegas in mid-May for a conference and toured the Crystals. She said she is encouraging her retail clients to consider the shopping center.
 The overall retail situation in Las Vegas has been rather bleak, with some properties struggling. General Growth Properties, which has about 200 malls nationwide, is restructuring its debt and had sought at one time to sell three properties in the city: Fashion Show, Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian and the Shoppes at the Palazzo. 
 High-end retailing is not the only area in which CityCenter is significantly increasing the city's supply. When the development is fully open, the number of upscale hotel rooms in Las Vegas will increase by about 15 percent, said Michael Mixer, a senior vice president with Colliers International Las Vegas who sells land for hotel-casinos and has assisted with evaluation of CityCenter's holdings. Between the jump in supply and the recession, MGM Mirage will have to worry about cannibalizing its own casinos and hotels, he said.
 ''But that will be a blip -- a short-term issue,'' Mr. Mixer said. ''About 85 percent of Americans have yet to come to Las Vegas, and as the economy comes back, the CityCenter project will in fact expand the market.''
 Mr. Mixer said Las Vegas residents breathed a collective sigh of relief when the partners in CityCenter worked out their disputes. The project will create 12,000 permanent jobs.
 ''At this stage, it would be such a shame to see a project of that magnitude falter, almost at the two-yard line,'' he said. ''This project is the shining star of Las Vegas.''

HEADLINE: Regulating Insurers: Two Perspectives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The concern voiced in ''Regulator Shopping'' (editorial, May 21) is unwarranted. 
 Life insurers are asking Congress to enact legislation to create an optional federal charter in which consumer protections meet the highest state standards and are uniform across the country. In the wake of the financial crisis, Congress is in no mood to do less. 
 The federal standards would serve as a model for states that lag behind. Indeed, the current state-by-state system leaves some consumers vulnerable. 
 In an April report, the Government Accountability Office said of the current system, ''Lack of uniformity and reciprocity may lead to inefficiencies, higher insurance costs and uneven consumer protection across states.'' 
 One further point: The economic crisis was not triggered by regulatory shopping but by regulatory gaps. Congress is working on a legislative package to enhance oversight of the financial sector. These initiatives include improving coordination among regulators and eliminating gaps that could result in similar problems occurring in the future. 
 Ignoring a $5 trillion life insurance industry that is systemically significant both domestically and globally is not in the best interests of our financial markets or consumers.
 Frank Keating President American Council of Life Insurers Washington, May 21, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 Your May 21 editorial makes a compelling case against allowing insurance companies, currently regulated by the states, to opt for federal regulation. There is another reason to be cautious about weakening the states' role in insurance regulation: it could undermine the state-based insurance guaranty fund system, which provides a well-financed and effective safety net for policyholders whose companies face insolvency. 
 The state guaranty funds protect policyholders from insurer default. Although coverage limits vary by state and type of insurance, these funds pay claims and provide continuing coverage to policyholders in the wake of an insurer's bankruptcy. The money to maintain the funds at adequate levels comes from assessments on insurance companies required under their state charters. 
 This national network of guaranty funds represents an essential ''insurance on insurance'' that affords an extra layer of security for consumers. Although greater federal regulation of insurance may make sense in certain areas (for large financial companies whose failure would pose a systemic risk), in ''fixing'' the current regulatory system, Congress should ''first do no harm.''

HEADLINE: Recession Imperils Loan Forgiveness Programs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
When a Kentucky agency cut back its program to forgive student loans for schoolteachers, Travis B. Gay knew he and his wife, Stephanie -- both special-education teachers -- were in trouble.
 ''We'd gotten married in June and bought a house, pretty much planned our whole life,'' said Mr. Gay, 26. Together, they had about $100,000 in student loans that they expected the program to help them repay over five years.
 Then, he said, ''we get a letter in the mail saying that our forgiveness this year was next to nothing.'' 
 Now they are weighing whether to sell their three-bedroom house in Lawrenceburg, Ky., some 20 miles west of Lexington. Otherwise, Mr. Gay said, ''it's going to be very difficult for us to do our student loan payments, house payments and just eat.''
 From Kentucky to Iowa to California, loan forgiveness programs are on the chopping block. Typically founded by their states to help students pay for college, the state agencies and nonprofit organizations that make student loans and sponsor these programs are getting less money from the federal government and are having difficulty raising money elsewhere as a result of the financial crisis. 
 The organizations say the repayment programs have been hurt by a broader effort by Congress to tackle the high cost of the federal student loan program by reducing subsidies to lenders. 
 Curbing the programs will make it harder to lure college graduates into high-value but often low-paying fields like teaching and nursing. 
 While few schools may be hiring now in this economic climate, there may be shortages later, educators say. 
 ''You're going to diminish the quality of the candidates who are thinking, 'Do I take my skills in math and science into industry or do I take them into the classroom?' '' said Tracey L. Bailey, who had loans forgiven in Florida and now is director of education policy for the Association of American Educators.
 The Kentucky Higher Education Student Loan Corporation is at the extreme in cutting payments to people in midstream who have already finished their educations and are repaying loans, but organizations in many other states have curtailed their new offers to prospective teachers, nurses and others. 
 The New Hampshire Higher Education Loan Corporation has suspended its program for teachers, and the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Authority has done so for nurses and people called to active duty in the military.
 Iowa Student Loan has reduced the maximum amounts offered to people in two of its three program categories, one for teachers and one for certain types of nurses, in an effort to ensure the programs will last. ALL Student Loan, which is based in Los Angeles, ended a program for nurses last year.
 The changes leave students without a critical escape hatch from their federal college and graduate school loans, and they throw up a roadblock for those who dream of teaching but fear an oppressive combination of low wages and high debt.
 ''I remember sitting in the financial aid office and them saying, 'Pay for every penny of it, pay for your books through loans, because they're going to be forgiven,' '' Mr. Gay said. And he dutifully did, using federal loans to cover some of the costs of his undergraduate degree in communications and all the costs of his master's program in special education, which he finished in 2006.
 If he had known the forgiveness program was vulnerable, Mr. Gay said, he would have chosen a different career, perhaps public relations. ''Which I am actually contemplating doing right now,'' he added.
 Teachers in Kentucky are hoping to get financing restored for the program. But it is not clear where the money could come from.
 ''We'd obviously love to see something like that happen,'' said Ted Franzeim, vice president for customer relations of the organization. He added that the group had never told participants that financing for forgiveness was guaranteed -- a point that schoolteachers dispute.
 About 7,500 teachers, nurses and public interest lawyers have benefited from the state's loan forgiveness program since 2003, at a cost of $77 million, Mr. Franzeim said.
 The federal government and some states continue to support their programs to lure promising young graduates to less lucrative jobs. The federal Education Department still offers up to $17,500 in loan forgiveness to math, science or education teachers who have worked for at least five years at an elementary or secondary school in a low-income area.
 New Mexico, New Jersey and New York pay for their programs directly instead of relying on nonprofit organizations, and they have not been cut by lawmakers. In Oregon the Legislature is debating whether to suspend funding of a program for nurses. 
 Another problem for some of the nonprofit groups that rely on selling their loans in a secondary market is that financing has dried up. 
 The Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, for example, has stopped offering to reduce interest rates for borrowers working in public service fields like teaching and firefighting, said Will Shaffner, director of business development and governmental relations. The only investor willing to buy its loans now is the federal Education Department, which purchases loans with standard terms only. 
 There is no clear accounting of how many people were swayed by loan forgiveness to pursue teaching, or how many might be deterred by the absence of such programs. But the anecdotal evidence suggests the programs matter.
 Mark Henderson said he weighed a job as an auditor at Humana, where he worked as temporary help in 2005, against the chance to teach math, a subject he loved. Kentucky's loan forgiveness program persuaded him to try teaching. 
 ''I thought, at least if I have somebody repay it, I can last five years and get rid of this debt,'' said Mr. Henderson, 26, a math teacher in Louisville. He enrolled at Spalding University and graduated in 2006 with a master's in teaching; he is not yet in repayment on his loans because he is taking classes to improve his earning potential. 
 He has ended up teaching at the very high school he attended, Mr. Henderson said, and teaches geometry in the same classroom where he learned it. 
 ''As it turned out, I really liked it,'' he said, ''and I'll stick around for a long time.''

HEADLINE: Levi's Adopts a Tie-In With a Gay Marriage Symbol

BYLINE: By ARI KARPEL

 BODY:
LEVI'S is getting in the spirit of the season by dressing its storefront mannequins in white. In Levi's-owned stores in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, that means more than just marking the passing of Memorial Day, the traditional date to begin wearing white: in 20 stores, the mannequins' white Levi's jeans and shirts are adorned with White Knots, a symbol of solidarity with the same-sex marriage movement. 
 The symbol was made more timely by the California Supreme Court's decision on Tuesday to uphold Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage in the state. Developed by Frank Voci, a digital media consultant, as a response to Proposition 8's passage last November, the White Knot for Equality is a white ribbon tied in a knot. 
 It has been worn by the actress Anne Hathaway at President Obama's Inauguration; Dustin Lance Black, the screenwriter of ''Milk,'' at the Oscars; and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, at a May 17 Manhattan rally supporting gay marriage. At the GLAAD Media Awards in Los Angeles in April, the comedian Kathy Griffin wore a bikini with a strategically placed White Knot. 
 With that kind of visibility and the online support among gays, lesbians and straight allies, the merchandising team at Levi's was prompted to ask Mr. Voci if the company could use White Knots in its stores. 
 ''Our design team was seeking something that would resonate beyond just fashion but also fit with our white product theme,'' said Rene Holguin, senior vice president for global creative services for the Levi's brand.
 Levi Strauss & Company has a tradition of supporting equal rights for gays. Last fall, the San Francisco-based company filed an amicus brief with the California Supreme Court outlining the economic advantages of allowing same-sex couples to wed. The company has also signed on to sponsor a programming block on Logo, the gay cable channel owned by MTV Networks, and developed a marketing partnership with ''Milk,'' the Focus Features movie about Harvey Milk, the gay civil rights leader. 
 ''We always try to connect to the energy and events of our time,'' said Erica Archambault, Levi's director of brand marketing and public relations. ''What's the pioneering spirit of today? A lot of people are rallying around marriage equality and fighting for that and so many individuals within our company feel so strongly about it.''
 The Levi's stores have no signs or conspicuous messages about the White Knot for Equality organization. Instead, the intent is to encourage customers to talk with employees, who have been briefed on the campaign. ''We have weekly calls with our store managers and we sent out detailed information about the White Knot organization and also ways in which we're supporting marriage equality over all as a company,'' Ms. Archambault said.
 The point, she said, is for sales staff ''to be educated and able to have an informed conversation that's more interactive than reading off a card or something.''
 Mr. Voci said that he decided to create a symbol after seeing a number of rallies opposing the passage of Proposition 8. Inspired by the red ribbon for H.I.V./AIDS and the pink ribbon for breast cancer, he headed to a fabric store and began playing with white ribbon. ''I was trying to figure out something different to do with it,'' he recalled. ''I tied it in a knot and thought, 'Oh, tie the knot, like getting married.' ''
 ''Everyone should have the right to tie the knot,'' he said.
 His eureka moment also led to the creation of a Web site, WhiteKnot.org. The owner of Voci Media Works, Mr. Voci advises companies like Living Proof, which makes hair- and skin-care products, on Internet strategies. He said he applied his knowledge to develop the WhiteKnot.org site. Volunteers have made thousands of White Knots, and the site features stories about their efforts.
 Mr. Voci said he was not interested in turning the White Knot campaign into a major fund-raising operation. Instead, he said, he plans to support the efforts of established organizations like the Human Rights Campaign and Freedom to Marry.
 Mr. Voci said he hoped that the White Knot could represent other initiatives promoting gay civil rights. ''There's a larger push for overall equal rights, the repeal of DOMA'' -- the Defense of Marriage Act -- ''the repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell,' the passage of a hate crimes bill and the end of workplace discrimination,'' he said. ''Marriage equality seems to be the headliner right now, but what we really want is comprehensive civil rights.'' 
 Ricki Lake, the actress, has worn the White Knot to events. ''It's so simple and it says a lot,'' she said. ''It's the same thing as the Lance Armstrong LiveStrong bracelet -- that simple gesture that gets the word out.''

HEADLINE: High Quality Sublets, Lots of Them

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
Few office towers have been left untouched by the flood of sublet space that has recently inundated the New York office market. In Midtown Manhattan -- where many of the world's largest financial companies are headquartered -- three out of every four office towers now have sublet space available.
 Brokers say that many sublandlords will probably need to bend over backward to sublease their space, given the sharp rise in vacancies. 
 In Midtown Manhattan, for example, 13 percent of prime, modern, well-located offices -- which brokers often refer to as Class A space -- was available in April, up from 6.5 percent a year earlier, according to Colliers ABR, a commercial real estate services company. And sublets now account for some 40 percent of the space available in Midtown, compared with 30 percent of the much smaller total that was available a year ago, the company said.
 In some cases, the ink was barely dry on the original lease before the space went back on the market for sublet.
 For example, Dechert, a global corporate law firm, has completed one year of a 15-year lease for the 25th through 31st floors at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, a 41-story office tower between 41st and 42nd Street, overlooking Bryant Park. 
 When the firm moved in last year, it intentionally took an extra floor, which it planned to use for future expansion, and from the start it has had a subtenant on the whole 31st floor. But that sublease expires in July, and the subtenant does not plan to renew. Since last year, the law firm has also had several rounds of layoffs, and it needs less space.
 Judith B. Tellefsen, the director of real estate and purchasing for Dechert, said the firm would like to sublet two floors, preferably lower floors, which are each 37,000 square feet. ''We are only partially occupying the 25th and 26th floors, and we could easily consolidate those lawyers on other floors,'' she said. Ms. Tellefsen said that the firm would be flexible, though, if a subtenant wanted the 31st floor instead.
 For companies whose space is not as new as Dechert's, there might also be a need to invest in improvements in order to make the space more marketable -- or else give subtenants a generous work allowance to redo the space themselves.
 ''Sublandlords should be trying to make it as easy as possible for the tenant to move in,'' said Mitchell Konsker, a vice chairman at Cushman & Wakefield. He said that space improvements could be as simple as reconfiguring the furniture or painting the walls. In other cases, Mr. Konsker said, sublandlords might need to split up a large block of space into several smaller blocks. ''Smaller blocks are moving more quickly now,'' he said.
 Peter Turchin, an executive vice president at CB Richard Ellis, said that sublandlords should put their best space on the market -- even if that meant moving their own employees into less desirable space.
 In some cases, Mr. Turchin said, a sublandlord might even need to hire an architect to show tenants how an office could be reconfigured, especially if the space does not have a reception area or a conference room.
 Mitchell S. Steir, the chairman and chief executive of Studley, a New York brokerage firm that specializes in representing office tenants, said some sublandlords were offering more generous work allowances than many building landlords were giving to new tenants.
 Mr. Steir said owners were offering work allowances of around $65 a square foot, up from $35 to $40 a square foot a year or so ago. But he said some sublandlords were willing to go as high as $160 a square foot.
 ''Obviously, the sublandlords are not in the leasing business, so they're not looking at a return on investment,'' he said. ''They are only looking at how quickly they can get the space off their books.''
 But real estate experts say the main way sublandlords are competing with office space that is available directly from building owners -- often within the same building -- is by slashing rents.
 Robert Sammons, the managing director in charge of research at Colliers ABR, said that sublet space in trophy office towers along Madison Avenue and Park Avenue has been leasing for as little as one-third of what that space might have commanded in early 2008, at the height of the roaring market.
 ''A year and a half ago, this space might have leased for $150 per square foot,'' Mr. Sammons said, while he has heard of recent sublets in high-end buildings in this office corridor with annual rents of as little as $40 to $50 a r square foot. ''This is the most remarkable turnaround in pricing that I've ever seen in such a short period of time.''
 He pointed to several large blocks of sublet space that recently came onto the market along the stretch of Park Avenue north of Grand Central Terminal, where many large financial companies have their headquarters and many hedge funds and private equity funds have also set up shop.
 In April, two financial companies began offering sublet space at 399 Park Avenue, between 53rd and 54th Streets: Citigroup listed the building's entire third floor, and Legg Mason listed the entire fourth floor. Each floor covers more than 97,000 square feet.
 This month, JPMorgan Chase listed a large sublet at 277 Park Avenue, between 47th and 48th Streets. It amounts to more than 400,000 square feet, covering the 13th to the 17th floors, and the 19th to the 25th floors of this 51-story office tower. This is the largest block of space currently being offered for sublet in Midtown Manhattan. 
 ''A number of these blocks of sublease space are quite large, so it's much more difficult to lease them,'' Mr. Sammons said. ''And a number of them have relatively short terms remaining.
 ''A lot of this space might end up going back to the landlord,'' he said, ''if the economy doesn't turn around soon.''

HEADLINE: For Some Airlines, Recession Doubts Are Taking a Back Seat

BYLINE: By CAROLINE BROTHERS

 BODY:
PARIS -- Demand for so-called premium air travel has fallen sharply along with the economy, leading to recent announcements from airlines like Qantas and British Airways about plans to reduce first-class seating. 
 Yet those who find it hard to fly without Beluga caviar and designer pajamas can take heart. Even as the top class of seats disappears, some airlines are actually expanding their first-class services for long-haul flights -- and offering selective upgrades -- as a way to retain their most valuable customers until recovery comes. 
 Airlines like Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, and Air France-KLM, the biggest airline in Europe, are opening new airport lounges exclusively devoted to first-class passengers in Europe and the United States. They also are planning to use imminent deliveries of the new A380 superjumbo jet to further expand first-class pampering. 
 While part of the investment is designed to position the airlines for when business picks up, even cash-strapped carriers like American Airlines say that the first-class cabin is an important instrument for keeping its highest-spending customers loyal. 
 ''We use our premium cabin as an incentive for frequent fliers and corporate accounts,'' said Richard Hedges, a spokesman in London for American Airlines. While confirming that the airline was still extending free upgrades to the first-class cabin, where fine wines can be savored with a companion on cushy sofas, he declined to say whether the pace had changed amid the crisis. 
 Monthly figures from the 230-member International Air Transport Association do not distinguish between business-class and first-class travel, but show that all ''premium'' traffic plummeted 21 percent in February and 19 percent in March from levels a year earlier. The loss is critical because airlines make most of their profit from their first- and business-class seats.
 Doubts about the future of elite travel were raised by British Airways and Qantas during the past week, with the B.A. chief executive, Willie Walsh, announcing that four new long-haul Boeing 777s would join his fleet this year without a first-class cabin, and that the airline would review the configuration of all its new planes. 
 Qantas, which offers its first-class passengers sheepskin mattresses, cordon bleu cooking, hand-made chocolate truffles and designer sleep wear, said Monday that it was scrapping first class altogether on a temporary basis on three of its long-distance routes.
 But at Lufthansa Technik, a subsidiary of the German airline and the world's biggest one-stop shop for aircraft maintenance and cabin refurbishment, contracts to rip out first-class accoutrements are not pouring in. 
 In fact, Bernhard Schoning, manager for cabin modification for commercial airlines, says that the trend is moving in the opposite direction. 
 ''We are now modifying back from two to three classes again,'' he said.
 For airlines, at a time of immense financial pressure, the prospect of using bonus points to upgrade to first class may make the difference between a passenger taking your flight, or that of a competitor, he noted.
 ''It's a reason to keep first class,'' Mr. Schoning said. ''Bonus programs, and upgrades into first, play a big part.''
 It also makes sense for an airline to bump a high fare-paying passenger into first if it opens up a space to meet extra demand in coach, said Nick Cunningham, an aviation analyst at Evolution Securities in London.
 ''It's a marketing tool in a recession, and in the best of times it's a genuine yield tool,'' said Mr. Cunningham.
 Although some corporations are restricting executive travel to business class, Lufthansa said that some travellers were still managing to get seats in first. 
 ''They are upgrading themselves on miles collected personally,'' said Amelie Schwierholz, a spokeswoman for the German flag carrier.
 British Airways, the world's first airline to introduce fully flat beds in its premium cabins in 1996, insisted that it was not rowing back on luxury travel, despite Walsh's comments published in the Guardian newspaper during the weekend.
 Anthony Cane, a B.A. spokesman, said the new 777s being delivered this year were ordered in a two-class configuration long before the financial crisis struck. 
 Furthermore, the airline -- which offers lobster Thermidor, aromatherapy ''Sleep Enhancer'' spray on pillows of Egyptian cotton, and ''infinity bathrooms'' to its best passengers in its lounges at Heathrow airport -- will be investing this year in the long-awaited revamp of its first-class cabins. 
 ''We stand by our premium product,'' Mr. Cane said. 
 Like Qantas, Lufthansa and Emirates, which offers Beluga caviar and showers to first-class passengers on its A380 superjumbos, B.A. does not give away seats in its first-class cabin for free, according to Mr. Cane. 
 But first-class still remains a powerful marketing instrument. 
 Travelers can gain access to the first-class cabin by converting their frequent flier miles into top-class seats, by taking advantage of B.A.'s special promotions on first-class travel, or purchasing fares that offer one leg of a journey in first.
 But as some airlines remove first-class cabins on routes with slack demand, others are increasing investment with a view to future recovery.
 Air France has just opened a first-class lounge at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. Lufthansa, which has an entire terminal at Frankfurt accessible only to the first-class traveler, is in the second year of a five-year, 150 million, or $210 million, investment in its premium lounges, having already opened three which are dedicated exclusively to first-class passengers. 
 Another opened at Kennedy International Airport in New York in January.
 The German airline, furthermore, expects to take delivery of its first A380 superjumbo early next year and will use the opportunity to promote a revitalized first-class offering for the entire airline, according to a spokesman, Jan Barwalde. 
 Many U.S. airlines, in contrast, have largely done away with first-class travel, with intercontinental routes between major city pairs among the few that still offer three-class cabins, according to Peter Walsh, managing partner for the aviation consultants Oliver Wyman in Dallas.
 ''There is significant pressure on first-class cabins originating in the U.S. right now,'' he said, adding that paid-for first class passengers typically filled less than 20 percent of the first class cabin. 
 Upgrades -- usually ''paid'' for with frequent-flyer program miles -- were more common. 
 Investment, he added, was limited, with carriers saving cash rather than modifying their jets to add or take away first class seats.
 Still, Emirates, which has 8 first-class suites on its 777 jets and 14 on the A380, says that suppressing the first-class cabin is unthinkable, even with the crisis in demand for premium seats.
 ''It's something that's expected by the first-class traveler,'' said a spokesman based in Paris for the Dubai-based carrier who requested anonymity according to company policy. ''If we started changing the configuration of the airplane, its possible that the passenger would go elsewhere.''

HEADLINE: Degrees of Disappointment

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Jason Martin entered the University of South Carolina's sport and entertainment management program hoping to become the next Jerry Maguire, the mythical superagent. Instead, like most people trying to break into the sports industry, he is looking at years of low-paying, unglamorous jobs like selling ads, tickets and hot dogs.
 That, of course, assumes he can find a job. In January, he started a four-month unpaid internship at the Family Circle Cup, a women's tennis tournament, helping sponsors place their ads. He hoped his internship would lead to a salaried job.
 Not this year. Because of the recession, Martin, who graduated this month with thousands of other sports management majors across the country, is continuing his job search at home in Virginia. If no full-time work turns up by September, he will enroll in a master's degree program. 
 ''Graduate school is definitely Plan B,'' said Martin, 21, who is working this summer as a swimming coach. ''My original intention was to get a job, but with the economy, there's so many people who just graduated who can't even get a cup of coffee with a prospective employer.''
 For decades, the sports industry has been largely impervious to the economic cycle. Through booms and busts, leagues and tournaments expanded, stadiums were built and attendance and television viewership set records. Revenue from suite sales, naming rights and television contracts boomed.
 But Martin and other graduates are finding that the industry's growth is slowing, if not reversing. Students are receiving fewer job offers this spring or are accepting internships instead of salaried positions. Many of those internships are unpaid. The worry, their professors say, is that austerity may become the norm, forcing students to scale down or abandon their ESPN-fueled dreams.
 ''I used to teach that sport was recession-proof, but this recession proved me wrong,'' said Gary Sailes, who runs the undergraduate program in sports marketing and management at Indiana. ''I tell students that this is a good time to stay in school.''
 The number of jobs related to spectator sports has risen steadily during the last few decades. According to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 138,700 people work in the spectator sports industry, 9.8 percent more than in 2002.
 There is no accurate tally of how many jobs have been lost in the last year or so, but the anecdotal evidence is grim. The N.F.L. has cut nearly 200 jobs. The N.B.A. has eliminated 10 percent of its staff, and the United States Olympic Committee laid off more than 50 workers.
 The L.P.G.A. dropped several tournaments, and Honda ended its Formula One sponsorship. The Jets will furlough some employees for two weeks, and the Cleveland Browns, the Denver Broncos and the Washington Redskins have cut jobs.
 Many other teams and tournaments, stung by declines in attendance and sponsorship dollars, have stopped hiring. ESPN will not fill 200 vacant jobs. The Arena Football League canceled its season.
 This is bad news for the 300 or so universities that offer sport management degrees. Every year, they churn out thousands of graduates who, even in good times, are willing to work for low pay in return for the chance to work around athletes and arenas. The teams, leagues and others in the sports industry have taken advantage of their willingness to make financial sacrifices, and may continue to do so. 
 ''Sport management is one of the sexy industries, and it's very hard to discourage students from joining the industry,'' said Mark McDonald, the director of internships at the University of Massachusetts's sport management program. ''I feel for the students who haven't done the preparation.''
 Going to college to prepare for a job in sports is relatively new. Years ago, many jobs were filled through word of mouth or serendipitously. Marty Appel, the Yankees' assistant public-relations director in the early 1970s, wrote to the team in 1967 asking for a summer job. He was lucky; someone was needed to answer Mickey Mantle's mail.
 ''It was very much like a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants operation,'' said Appel, who estimated there were only 40 people working in the team's front office then.
 By the late 1970s, Appel interviewed graduates of some of the first sport management programs who, he said, were better prepared to handle the growing list of demands on ball clubs.
 Walter O'Malley, who owned the Dodgers in Brooklyn and Los Angeles and who foresaw the need for better-trained employees, helped persuade Ohio University to start the first degree-granting sport management program in 1966.
 The number of programs jumped fourfold in the 1980s as the industry grew along with ESPN and Title IX, according to Jacquelyn Cuneen, who teaches sport management at Bowling Green. Dozens of universities, looking to increase enrollment, rebranded their physical education departments.
 Sport management programs have also been broadened to teach fitness, tourism, recreation and hospitality, prompting critics to claim that many programs do not provide students with the skills to succeed at anything other than the lowest-level jobs.
 More worrisome is the realization that even at rigorous programs, students are getting about half as many job offers this year compared with other years, according to Dallas Branch, who teaches sport management at West Virginia. Yeoman's work is demanded of graduates even from the most prestigious universities like Columbia, which started a master's level program for midcareer students in 2006.
 While attending classes there, Sean Mysel is working this summer as a stadium manager for the Sussex Skyhawks, a minor league baseball team in New Jersey. But he has spent about $25,000 on tuition and $75,000 on living expenses to attend Columbia, which he hopes will help him reach his goal of running a major league ballpark.
 ''I know the job market is difficult for a while, but I don't feel I have to hit the panic button,'' said Mysel, 31. ''At a minimum, it will take 10 or 15 years.'' 
 Graduate students, though, are in a better position than undergraduates because they often have several years of work experience. Kati Karottki, who graduated last weekend from Massachusetts with a bachelor's degree in sport management, did well in college and worked as a research analyst at a company that measures sponsorships.
 But as her senior year began, she planned to single out several companies as potential employers. Then Lehman Brothers collapsed in September.
 ''I really had to redo everything,'' she said.
 She reached out to alumni and had half a dozen interviews. But over and over, she heard the same thing: there are other candidates with master's degrees with more experience who are willing to work for little. This week, she is traveling to Bristol, Conn., to interview at ESPN for an analyst's job focused on audience research. She is not getting ahead of herself.
 ''They have so many applicants and people to choose from, just getting to an in-person interview, that's a big achievement,'' she said. ''My classmates have resigned themselves to doing another internship or taking time off to travel.''

HEADLINE: Why I'm Not Running for Mayor

BYLINE: By ANTHONY WEINER. 
Anthony Weiner is a member of the House of Representatives from Queens and Brooklyn.

 BODY:
I WAS the kind of New York kid who played stickball in the street, made pocket change working at the local bagel store and handed out leaflets on Election Day. I loved New York. I couldn't imagine why people would live anywhere else.
 Other dreams came and went, but as I became more drawn to politics, my love for the city grew. And the idea that I might be one of the people who could help it maintain its diverse yet proudly local, strong-willed but fiercely tolerant personality seemed like a gift. 
 It's for this reason that I've spent a lot of time this year thinking about whether I should run for mayor. While that's been the question on my mind, a lot of people I have talked to have asked a different question: ''How can you win?'' 
 It's easy to understand where they are coming from. All you need to do is see the avalanche of television ads for Mayor Mike Bloomberg, whose huge war chest and incumbency can be daunting. It's also easy to understand the desire to focus on the horse race aspect of a campaign.
 But for me, these have been side issues. What has animated me most during these past months is how much Washington has changed, and the potential for greater movement still. With a progressive sweep in all branches of the federal government, major economic reform, a new energy bill and an overhaul of health care ahead, this is a moment when ideas matter. I've had to evaluate what I could accomplish in Washington if I was in a heated campaign in New York City at the same time. 
 And the work in Washington isn't easy right now. Although President Obama ran on a platform of reaching out to all sides, most Republicans haven't reached back -- not a single Republican representative, for example, voted for the economic stimulus package. It will take a lot of fighting to pass legislation that can help middle- and working-class people. 
 The discussion of how to have a new kind of politics has taken on a special significance for me as I've contemplated running for mayor of New York City. About two months ago I announced that I would postpone deciding whether to run. I believed the issues we were confronting in Congress were important and decisions about campaigns could wait.
 But it's also true that there is no escaping the reality that political campaigns have become longer and more negative, and often seem focused on style and non-issues instead of substance. The mayor is expected to spend $80 million of his own money in the race, more than 10 times what candidates who have not opted out of the city's public campaign finance program, as Mr. Bloomberg has, can spend in a primary. 
 With spending like that, regular debates about real issues will probably take a back seat to advertising. As a native of Brooklyn, I'd be lying if I said I didn't savor a good scrap. But I'm disappointed because I'm increasingly convinced a substantive debate simply isn't likely right now.
 The sad truth for a political candidate without deep pockets is that while money isn't the only thing, it does matter. Campaign finance laws are vital, not just to keep special interests from dominating campaigns, but also because in this case they could help prevent vast disparities in spending. 
 The other truth is that the Supreme Court decision in 1976 in Buckley v. Valeo, which allows candidates to spend however much they want on their own races, makes it possible for billionaires to swamp middle-class candidates. In this case, a sports analogy is apt: If one football team has 110 players on the field, the team with 11 has a hard time getting through the blocking and tackling on the crowded turf.
 The personal choice for me is whether to run for mayor this year. I've taken stock of my life, my work in Washington and decided that now is not the right time to run. I believe I have a contribution to make in Congress fighting for New Yorkers. (I'd also like to build a family.)
 I have respect for the leading Democratic candidate in the mayor's race, City Comptroller Bill Thompson, a respect that only reinforces my conclusion that running in the primary against him in September would only drain the ability of the winner to compete in the general election. 
 I want the city to be a success. I don't agree with Mayor Bloomberg on everything -- for example, I disagree strongly with his effort to overturn the term limits law without a vote by New Yorkers. But I think the mayor has tried to be innovative in some areas, and he has avoided the divisive racial politics that can cripple our city. So I will continue to work with Mayor Bloomberg whenever I can, and disagree forcefully when I believe his policies leave the middle class and working class behind. 
 For my supporters -- and for most New Yorkers -- politics isn't about tactics, it's about making their lives better. I'm convinced this is an important time for our city and our country, with millions of people in economic peril but with real opportunities for progress in Congress. I plan to be part of that discussion.

HEADLINE: Shinnecock Indians Contemplate a Casino as They Close In on Federal Recognition

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
The Shinnecock Indian Nation cleared a major hurdle toward its goal of federal recognition on Tuesday when it entered into a settlement with the Interior Department that requires a preliminary ruling on its tribal status by the end of the year.
 Shinnecock leaders would like to run the first casino in downstate New York, and wrote to Gov. David A. Paterson on Tuesday, citing the settlement as an impetus to begin talks with the state on a range of issues. 
 After a court fight of more than 30 years, the Shinnecocks believe that federal recognition is in their grasp; they have long been recognized by the state, and a federal judge described them as a sovereign tribe in a 2005 ruling. The settlement gives the federal government until Dec. 15 to make a preliminary ruling on the Shinnecocks' status. 
 The implications for New York could be considerable. 
 The Shinnecocks are based in Southampton, N.Y. Once federally recognized, they would immediately have the right to build a ''Class II'' casino on their 800-acre reservation, a designation that would mean they could have thousands of video slot machines, but no table games. Like other tribes, the Shinnecocks see a casino as a way to lift their members out of poverty, a condition highlighted by the tribe's proximity to the extravagance of the Hamptons. 
 ''We're surrounded by the wealthiest communities in the country, yet the state of affairs on the reservation is one of offhanded neglect,'' said Frederick C. Bess, one of the Shinnecock Nation's three trustees. 
 But the prospect of a large gambling center in the Hamptons has not been palatable to Long Island leaders, and the tribe, which has about 1,000 members, would prefer to build a full-blown casino somewhere else. One potential location is the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens, the site of interminable state negotiations over a gambling complex. 
 Casino gambling is not the only issue likely to be encompassed in negotiations. The tribe is also hoping to resolve more than $1 billion worth of land claims in the Hamptons. The state, for its part, will seek revenue-sharing as part of any casino deal and may also try to resolve a long-running dispute over sales of untaxed cigarettes on the reservation. The threat of a Hamptons-based gambling center could force the state to the table. 
 ''The hope is we can negotiate and sit down with the governor, and if gaming is on the table, to develop appropriate areas where we can do that,'' said Randy King, chairman of the Shinnecock Nation and a tribal trustee.
 The settlement was filed Tuesday in United States District Court in Central Islip, N.Y. The tribe filed a petition for federal recognition in 1978. When it still did not have an answer by 2006, it sued the Interior Department, saying that the agency had failed to process its request in a reasonable amount of time.
 As part of the settlement, reached after months of negotiations, the Interior Department will hold a public meeting on June 3, during which the Shinnecocks will present and discuss their petition with officials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
 ''It's a good deal for all sides,'' said Nedra Darling, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a branch of the Interior Department. ''We've all agreed to these time frames. On our side, we want to get the decision done. Agreeing to the time frame will move towards that.''
 Mr. Paterson's office said the governor and his staff were reviewing the matter. 
 John A. Strong, a retired Long Island University professor who has written three books about the Indians of Long Island, said he would be surprised if the Shinnecock petition was rejected. 
 ''They have one of the best-documented petitions for federal recognition that I'm aware of,'' he said. 
 One of the requirements for federal recognition is evidence of continuous government. In 1792, Mr. Strong said, the town of Southampton essentially forced the Shinnecocks to elect three governing trustees who could resolve land disputes between the town and the tribe. 
 The elections were recorded by the town clerk, and the tribe is still governed by three trustees. 
 ''I don't know of any other tribe that has that kind of paper trail,'' Mr. Strong said.
 In 2003, the Shinnecocks angered their neighbors when they broke ground for a casino, a move that led to a legal battle of its own. More recently, Suffolk County lawmakers formed a task force with tribal representatives to try to come to an accommodation on a casino. 
 ''We're prepared, so that if this approval comes down the pike, we have a say in where it's located and it's someplace that may make sense for the general public,'' said Wayne R. Horsley, a Democratic legislator in Suffolk County who leads a committee on economic development. 
 Mr. Horsley said putting a casino in the Hamptons would make traffic even worse, but he would also like to keep the casino and its revenue in Suffolk County. The tribe, for its part, would prefer the greater revenue potential of a casino with table games in exchange for sharing the proceeds. 
 ''It would benefit the people of the state of New York and it would benefit the tribe much more than Class II gaming would,'' Mr. King said. 
 For now, the Shinnecocks are focused on the final stage of a long legal struggle. 
 ''In our mind,'' said Gordell Wright, one of the tribe's trustees, ''there is no doubt that we will be placed on the list of federally recognized tribes.''

HEADLINE: Home Prices Declined Again in March as Banks Sold More Foreclosed Properties

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Home sales may be up in many parts of the country but prices continue to scrape along the floor, raising fresh doubts about the recovery of a critical sector.
 Prices in 20 major metropolitan areas dropped by 18.7 percent in March when compared with the same month a year ago, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-ShillerHome Price Index that was released Tuesday. That was about the same as February and just shy of January's record plunge of 19 percent.
 ''Foreclosures have picked up, and that seems to be pushing prices down,'' said David M. Blitzer, chairman of S.& P.'s index committee. ''The recession is really biting.'' 
 Seventeen of the cities tracked by the index declined from February. That was an improvement over the previous month, when prices in all 20 areas fell. Denver and Charlotte, N.C., managed tiny gains, while Dallas was flat.
 In many urban areas, including those tracked by Case-Shiller, the residential real estate market is essentially cleaved in two. The top half of the market is largely stagnant, with owners unwilling to sell and buyers unable to buy. ''Move-up'' families seeking another bedroom or a better kitchen are an endangered species.
 The low end, however, is sizzling, as investors armed with cash and first-time buyers equipped with tax breaks compete for foreclosed properties.
 As a result, some argue, the Case-Shiller numbers make the market appear worse than it is. Minneapolis is a case in point. Prices there plunged 6.1 percent from February to March -- the largest single-month drop for a city in the history of the index.
 The area was not prone to the bubble excesses of California or Florida, but it has its share of foreclosures. Until recently, banks tried to hold on to these houses to get the best price, said Steve Havig, president of the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors. 
 Overwhelmed, the banks are now taking a different approach: dumping the properties to clear their books, making them ''extremely motivated sellers,'' as Mr. Havig calls them.
 These bargain homes make up nearly half the sales in Minneapolis, and are a big reason the agents' own numbers show a one-year median price decline of 22.9 percent. That closely matches the corresponding Case-Shiller drop of 23.3 percent. But when foreclosures and short sales are stripped out, the decline for so-called traditional homes is much smaller: 2.3 percent.
 ''Clearly, there are two different markets operating here,'' Mr. Havig said. That can lead to frustration among buyers of traditional houses, who expect better deals.
 Another national flood of foreclosures, which many are predicting for this summer, would continue to push down the indexes. But even if that does not happen, many analysts predict more pain for homeowners who want to sell or refinance. Buyers who do not get a foreclosure, meanwhile, might feel they can afford to wait.
 ''It is highly unlikely that the overall price adjustment seen to date is sufficient to balance supply (which is enormous) with demand,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, wrote Tuesday in a note to clients. He estimated the index was only two-thirds of the way to its ultimate bottom.
 Some experts had predicted slightly better March numbers, by which they meant that the relentless rate of decline would noticeably slow. They were disappointed. 
 ''Were this pace to continue, the loss of housing wealth this year would be roughly equal to the entire G.D.P. of China,'' Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics wrote in a research note. With household wealth evaporating, he added, ''consumption will be very weak for the foreseeable future.''
 New York and Detroit, which both showed large monthly declines in March, show the different legacies of the boom. Prices in New York are still up 73.4 percent from January 2000, while those in Detroit are 29 percent lower. A Detroit house costs about the same today as it did 14 years ago.
 Las Vegas joined Phoenix in showing a decline from the area's peak of more than 50 percent. Dallas, which never had much of a housing boom, is the best-performing city in the index, down 11.1 percent from its peak.
 The national Case-Shiller index for the first quarter, also released Tuesday, showed a 19.1 percent decline compared with the first quarter of 2008, the biggest drop in the index's 21-year history.

HEADLINE: Stocks of Retailers Surge On Consumer Optimism

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Consumers in the United States are feeling more optimistic, and on Tuesday, so were investors.
 After several days of declines on concerns about the government's borrowing needs and the soundness of the dollar, stock markets rebounded Tuesday on a surprising bounce in consumer confidence. The private Conference Board reported that consumer sentiment rose again in May, hitting its highest levels in eight months.
 As traders returned to Wall Street after the holiday weekend, the glints of good news in those numbers were enough to outweigh other figures showing that housing prices continued to tumble as fast as ever. Every sector of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was higher, led by financial stocks and consumer-geared companies like McDonald's, the Home Depot and Lowe's home improvement chains, and the Walt Disney Company. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 196.17 points, or 2.37 percent, to 8,473.49, while the S.& P. 500 was 2.6 percent, or 23.33 points, higher at 910.33. 
 The technology-focused Nasdaq outpaced other indexes, rising 3.5 percent, or 58.42 points, to 1,750.43, on gains among computer makers, search engines and Internet firms as analysts upgraded Apple. Apple, the maker of iPhones and iPods, rose 6.8 percent to $130.78 a share.
 Big banks like Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase closed higher, bolstered by optimism that improving consumer sentiment could translate into stability for the financial system. Investors also edged back toward the dollar, a week after they pushed it to its lowest point in five months on concerns about inflation, the expanding supplies of new currency and big federal deficits. The dollar index, which measures the dollar's performance against six major currencies, was up 0.1 percent.
 As the dollar gained ground, gold prices fell moderately. 
 The jump in consumer confidence also helped the oil markets, where prices settled 78 cents higher, to $62.45 a barrel.
 To some economists, the new figures on consumer sentiment were another signal that the force of the recession was beginning to abate.
 Consumers, whose spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, have been shedding their pessimism like heavy winter coats in the last few months as stocks have bounded higher and credit markets have stabilized. Consumer spending rose unexpectedly in the first quarter, at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, and some retailers have said their sales were no longer falling as sharply.
 The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence rose to 54.9 in May from 40.8 last month. Consumers said their current situation was just slightly better than a month ago, but their expectations shot up, to 72.3 from 51 in April. 
 Although consumers are still downbeat by historical standards, they are feeling better about the future than just a few months ago when the stock market was sliding toward 12-year lows and the banking system was teetering. Consumers now expect the job market, business conditions and their incomes will improve in the months ahead.
 The more buoyant mood among consumers echoed recent surveys of home builders, manufacturers and service-sector businesses, which have reflected a retreat from historic levels of pessimism. 
 ''Anything that measures sentiment has improved,'' an economist at Deutsche Bank, Joseph LaVorgna, said. ''We're not seeing it in the hard data, but seeing it in the sentiment. But you can't spend confidence.''
 And with unemployment projected to rise from 8.9 percent to as high as 10 percent over the next year, economists warn that consumers may lose that newfound optimism in the months ahead.
 ''There are still an extremely troubling amount of people out of work, and there's nothing that matters more, economically, than employment,'' said Richard Yamarone, director of economic research at Argus Research. ''You may see numbers jump again, but its not going to translate into greater economic activity until you see the job situation improve.''
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 25/32, to 96 15/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.55 percent, from 3.45 percent late Friday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and two-year notes:

HEADLINE: A Puff of Pride, and Some Concerns, Among Hispanics

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Randal C. Archibold contributed reporting from Los Angeles; Fernanda Santos from New York; and Yolanne Almanzar from Miami.

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
The lunch crowd at El Palacio de Los Jugos on Tuesday could not agree on the appropriate level of excitement. Cubans, Colombians, Dominicans -- they all said they were pleased to hear Judge Sonia Sotomayor accept her selection for the United States Supreme Court with a speech that included the rolling ''r's'' of her Puerto Rican roots. 
 But do not assume that Judge Sotomayor's identity will define her, said Luis Home, 35, a Colombian-American technology recruiter. ''It's like saying if you're Hispanic, you're going to be a superhero for Hispanics. That's not true.'' 
 Mr. Home's friend, Amaury Lendeborg, 30, disagreed, somewhat. ''A cultural connection will always win,'' said Mr. Lendeborg, a Dominican-American. 
 And so the debate begins. 
 In restaurants, homes and offices across the country, Hispanics responded to Judge Sotomayor's selection with a puff of pride, some gratitude and considerable discussion. In interviews in Miami, Los Angeles and New York, many said this kind of recognition from Washington -- Democratic or Republican -- was long overdue given the growing size of the Hispanic voting bloc.
 The hope, they said, is that her hardscrabble life and accomplishments will add prestige to the public image and self-image of Hispanics.
 ''This is a Jackie Robinson moment,'' said Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat, the first Dominican elected to the New York Legislature. ''Puerto Ricans, who have been Hispanic pioneers in so many fields in this country, have broken another barrier for all of us.''
 And yet, a defensiveness could also be found. Many Hispanics seemed eager to warn Democrats that a single nomination -- of a judge whom most Americans are still getting to know -- might not be enough to win unending Hispanic loyalty come Election Day. 
 Some of those interviewed said Hispanic appointments mattered less than issues affecting them directly, like immigration and the economy.
 ''There's not going to be this enormous outpouring of ethnic triumph,'' said Roberto Suro, the author of ''Strangers Among Us: Latino Lives in a Changing America.'' 
 Rather, Mr. Suro said, Judge Sotomayor's selection represents one significant step toward recasting the way Hispanics are viewed.
 ''It's been easy to connect illegal immigration with Hispanic identity,'' he said. ''This puts it in a very different context.''
 Judge Sotomayor, in her brief appearance with President Obama, emphasized her poor roots in the Bronx, and praised her mother for working long hours so she could go to private school. 
 That history lies at the center of her appeal for Carlos A. Cerna, 74, a Salvadoran-American who chatted with fellow retirees from his home country outside a restaurant in Los Angeles. Within hours of her selection, Mr. Cerna had already read up on Judge Sotomayor. He recited the details of her childhood and Ivy League schooling, as if rattling off the qualifications of a sports star.
 ''Of course, it would have been great to have someone of Central American origin,'' Mr. Cerna said. ''But she got picked, and I think it's very good.''
 Other Hispanics also lamented that the first Supreme Court justice of Hispanic ancestry did not have roots in their own community. Here in Miami, Ana de Pozo, 24, finished her rice and beans at El Palacio de Los Jugos, and said, ''We are waiting now for a Cuban.'' 
 In Los Angeles, Mario Trujillo, president of the Mexican American Bar Association, said he had sent a letter to the Obama administration on behalf of Justice Carlos R. Moreno, a Mexican-American on the California Supreme Court who had been among those considered for the United States Supreme Court. 
 But the historic moment seemed mostly to temper nationalistic pride. Mr. Trujillo praised Judge Sotomayor's intellect and accomplishments, then welcomed her point of view.
 ''She has the true Latino experience, not only in her last name,'' he said. ''Look at her upbringing back East. It is an emotional story.''
 Perhaps not surprisingly given Judge Sotomayor's Bronx roots, Hispanic New Yorkers were especially emotional. Puerto Ricans -- the city's largest Hispanic group, with 790,000 people -- have sometimes clashed with newer arrivals to neighborhoods they long dominated, but that seemed to be forgotten for a moment. 
 Assemblyman Espaillat said he had stopped by his mother's home in Washington Heights on his way to Albany, and ''the first thing she told me when I walked in the door was that the Latina was nominated for the Supreme Court.'' 
 How much the excitement will benefit Democrats in the scramble for the Hispanic vote remains to be seen. But if recent history is a guide, Republicans are at a disadvantage.
 Four years after President George W. Bush reached a historic high for Republicans, winning about 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his re-election, Mr. Obama won 67 percent of the vote in November to Senator John McCain's 31 percent. Swing states like Florida and New Mexico tilted to his column in large part because of Latino turnout
 Many Hispanics have been expecting a bold thank you from Mr. Obama ever since November, and on Tuesday, many said they wanted more than Judge Sotomayor. 
 At a table outside Miami Dade College here, a group of mostly Hispanic students said the focus on the judge's identity felt outdated and obscured more important issues like the economy. 
 ''Maybe at first, you're like, 'Oh, she's Puerto Rican, cool,' '' said Ozzy Garcia, 23, a computer engineering student born in Cuba and raised in the Dominican Republic. ''After that, it doesn't matter.''
 Mr. Suro, a former director of the Pew Hispanic Center, said the selection would buy the president a little bit of ''breathing room'' on immigration overhaul, an issue that Hispanics desperately want to see addressed. 
 And Henry Solano, the interim president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said the Democrats would need to make even more Hispanic appointments before the community could be relied on for votes. 
 ''I don't know if any one decision will make or break the relationship an elected official has with any community,'' Mr. Solano said. 
 Still, there were a few early signs of a shift. Mr. Cerna, the Salvadoran-American, said, ''Obama has taken into account Latinos, and the other administration did not keep watch.''
 Even Mr. Home, the Colombian at El Palacio del Los Jugos, who is a Republican, said the pick probably won Mr. Obama a few votes in the next election. 
 ''He knows by appointing a Latin woman, they're going to have that nice, fuzzy feeling,'' he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 29, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the reaction of Hispanics to the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court misstated, in some editions, the name of the college where a group of students said that the emphasis on the judge's identity obscured more important issues like the economy. It is Miami Dade College, not Miami-Dade Community College.

HEADLINE: Big Oil Warms to Ethanol

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: JENNINGS, La. 

 BODY:
For decades, the big oil companies and the farm lobby have been fighting about ethanol, with the farmers pushing to produce more of it and the refiners arguing it was a boondoggle that would do little to solve the country's energy problems.
 So why are technicians for BP, the giant oil company, now working at an experimental ethanol plant in this old Louisiana oil town, helping to make it more efficient?
 The erstwhile enemies, it turns out, are gradually learning to get along, as refiners increasingly see a need to get involved in ethanol production. Ethanol, made chiefly from corn, now represents about 9 percent of the country's market for liquid fuels. And the percentage is growing year after year because of federal mandates. With the nation's thirst for gasoline, and the ethanol that is blended into it, expected to revive when the economy does, the oil companies want to be in a position to take full advantage. 
 The interest expressed by big oil companies is coming in the nick of time for small companies that desperately need capital and cannot find it these days in the private markets. Take the case of Verenium Corporation, a small company based in Cambridge, Mass., that here in Jennings is testing new forms of biofuels in alliance with BP. Instead of ethanol made from food crops, the partners are devising a version from grasses in the sugar cane family. 
 The experiments here are preparation for building a second, $250 million plant in Florida with the capacity to produce 36 million gallons a year of new biofuels -- the first commercial plant of its type built with oil company money and expertise. Verenium scientists have already developed a secret sauce of enzymes and microbes that ferment and distill biomass into ethanol. Now BP is contributing technical expertise aimed at getting the temperatures and pressures in the vats just right. 
 Commercial success is not assured, of course. But the fact that a major oil company has even made an alliance to go commercial with Verenium is considered a breakthrough by many ethanol executives. 
 ''Any time you get Big Oil into the game, that changes the paradigm because nobody can go large scale chemical engineering like Big Oil,'' said Brent Erickson, an executive vice president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group. 
 Only two years ago, BP had only a minuscule investment in biofuels. But since then the company has committed $1.5 billion to various projects. Along with its work with Verenium, it entered a partnership with a Brazilian concern last year to produce ethanol from sugar cane. 
 Lessons learned in Louisiana may eventually help convert Brazilian cane into more advanced biofuels, researchers say, producing a potentially vast new reserve for BP. 
 BP also speaks with optimism about a partnership with DuPont to test production of biobutanol, an advanced liquid alcohol fuel that is made from the same feed stocks as advanced ethanols and is compatible with existing pipelines and car engines. Executives say they hope to begin making the fuel in large amounts by 2013.
 ''We can see biofuels as being a really big potential reservoir,'' said Phil New, president of the company's BP Biofuels unit. ''For an energy firm to get into sugar cane farming is a pretty big move.'' 
 Oil companies are still skeptical about conventional ethanol, especially the type made from corn, which they say corrodes pipelines and is inefficient. 
 The plant here is just one sign that the big oil companies are now at least grudgingly accepting biofuels -- particularly those made from wastes and nonfood sources, which do not bear corn ethanol's stigma of raising food prices. 
 The big change came in the 2007 energy law enacted by Congress that set ambitious mandates for refineries to blend increasing amounts of biofuels over the years. By 2022 they will be obliged to blend 36 billion gallons of biofuels, or more than three times current levels. 
 ''If the government is going to make a market happen, we needed to be able to participate commercially in that market,'' Mr. New said.
 The oil companies also say that as crude oil becomes ever more difficult and expensive to find, biofuels can bolster their reserves. 
 ''There will be a need for all these fuels,'' said Graeme Sweeney, executive vice president for future fuels and carbon dioxide at Royal Dutch Shell. He predicted that the 1 percent of the world's transportation fuels that are biofuels today ''could easily be 10 percent in the next decade or so.''
 Shell was the first of the big oil companies to venture significantly into the new biofuels, getting its toes wet in 2002 by providing money to a Canadian company called Iogen Corporation to research making ethanol from plant waste. Shell would not discuss how much money it is now investing in biofuels, but said it had quadrupled biofuel research spending since 2007.
 Shell has also formed partnerships with a variety of small companies at work on improving enzymes that break down various plants and waste materials for ethanol, making fuels from algae and even biogasoline from sugary liquids derived from plant materials. Chevron has formed a joint venture with Weyerhaeuser to develop biofuels from wood waste. 
 And Valero Energy Corporation, the country's largest petroleum refiner, has snapped up seven corn ethanol plants from VeraSun Energy in recent months since VeraSun filed for bankruptcy protection last fall. Valero has suggested that it could transform the plants for newer blends of ethanol.
 Each initiative is still small compared with the companies' multibillion-dollar oil exploration and refining budgets, prompting skeptics to say they are more interested in improving their image than producing clean fuels.
 ''If we depend too heavily on the big oil companies to drive the biofuel agenda,'' warned Jeff Broin, chief executive of the ethanol producer Poet, ''we'll be using large volumes of oil for many, many years to come.''
 But taken together, the research projects and deals are a sharp contrast to the scaled-back oil company projects in other alternative energy sources like hydrogen and solar. And the support is welcome for small entrepreneurial companies that are long on new technologies and short on capital.
 ''With any start-up company, people say 'Wow, but is it going to work?' '' said Randy Cortright, founder and chief technical officer of Virent Energy Systems. His company wants to make a biogasoline from plant sugars that is chemically similar to gasoline produced by conventional petroleum refineries. 
 He said Shell's investment raised his company's credibility with lenders ''by giving their vote of confidence in this technology, spending resources and providing their own people for development.'' Shell also will eventually distribute the product, he said, ''and they already have the infrastructure for taking the product to the fuel pump so the consumer can use it.''
 Arnold R. Klann, chief executive of BlueFire Ethanol, a company that converts municipal waste into ethanol and is seeking financing to build plants, said lenders wanted to know that an ethanol company had credible long-term customers to generate revenues. He said he had draft contracts with two major oil companies he could not yet identify that wanted to invest in his operations and use his fuels.
 ''There is tremendous interest by the oil companies to invest in these first-of-a-kind projects,'' Mr. Klann said. ''Where they were initially investing very tentatively in new technology development, in the last year they have begun to finally invest in companies that are building commercial production facilities.'' 
 In Jennings, BP technicians advise Verenium technicians on what types of metals to use to line their pipes, what kind of valves will last longest and how to position blades in fermenting tanks to best mix chemicals and feed stocks. It is all an effort to reduce the price of the product to quickly compete with conventional ethanol and perhaps, eventually, with gasoline. 
 ''We are the chef, and they are more like the restaurant manager,'' said Mark G. Eichenseer, Verenium's vice president for operations. ''We have the recipes, and they have the experience and know-how to select the pots and pans.''

HEADLINE: Preserving Time In a Bottle (Or a Jar)

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
FOR Eugenia Bone, opening the kitchen cupboard in her SoHo apartment is like dipping into a favorite TV show. ''The jars are like characters, with story lines that I remember,'' she said recently, scrabbling around in search of a jar of yellowfin tuna preserved in olive oil and salt. ''Seeing them brings back the farm where I bought that case of artichokes, or the day we picked all those cherries.'' 
 When the tuna came to light, the date on the label was discouraging: 2006. ''The Feds wouldn't like it,'' she said, referring to Department of Agriculture recommendations that home-preserved food be eaten within a year. ''But it's still going to make a great lunch.''
 Ms. Bone, who has just published a canning cookbook titled ''Well-Preserved'' (Clarkson Potter), is not the blue-ribbon farm wife usually brought to mind by the phrase ''home preserving expert.'' She spent her youth in a plastic miniskirt, smoking and running between punk music shows on the Lower East Side. Now 50, a typically jumpy New Yorker and the mother of two teenagers, she grows nothing, though she is a regular hunter-gatherer at farmers' markets. 
 But with her finely developed palate -- she is a daughter of the influential Italian-American cookbook author Edward Giobbi -- Ms. Bone has joined a growing movement of home cooks who are interested in preserving flavor, not just food. 
 ''When I was young, we were just trying to desperately hold on to things,'' said Edon Waycott, whose ''Preserving the Taste'' (Hearst Books, 1996) is one of the group's bibles. She makes preserves from the mulberries, guavas and boysenberries she grows at home in Malibu, Calif., and was raised on working farms in North Carolina and New Jersey. ''Now everything is available all the time, but capturing the ripeness and deliciousness of a strawberry is harder than it was back then,'' she said. 
 Preserving food cannot be considered new and trendy, no matter how vigorously it's rubbed with organic rosemary sprigs. But the recent revival of attention to it fits neatly into the modern renaissance of handcrafted food, heirloom agriculture, and using food in its season. Like baking bread or making a slow-cooked tomato sauce, preserving offers primal satisfactions and practical results. And in today's swirl of food issues (local, seasonal, organic, industrial), home preserving can also be viewed as a quasi-political act. ''Preserving is an extension of the values that made you shop in the farmers' market in the first place,'' Ms. Bone said. 
 ''There's an incredible surge of interest recently,'' according to June Taylor of Berkeley, Calif., a pioneer in using local, seasonal produce and as few added ingredients as possible in her expensive, delicious fruit preserves. ''People want to take back their food and their skills from the industrial giants.'' 
 People are also looking for thrifty, crafty ways to eat well. In a time of high food prices, job losses and food safety scares, home canning is booming, with sales of equipment already up almost 50 percent over last year, according to the Jarden company, which makes both Ball and Kerr canning supplies. 
 Stacks of locally grown, peak-ripe produce are about to appear at farmstands and markets -- then disappear for another year. The time window is opening for pickling artichokes, simmering berries and suspending plums in time, and syrup. 
 On Sunday, about 80 people are expected at a community kitchen in San Francisco's Mission District, to preserve 500 pounds of ripe apricots trucked in from local organic farms. ''The morning team will macerate them in sugar, cardamom and vanilla and the afternoon team will process them,'' said Anya Fernald, who conceived the project and publicized it on Facebook and on www.yeswecanfood.com. 
 Shares in the apricots (future canning parties will tackle cucumbers in July and tomatoes in September) have been sold online, with a discount for those who show up to work in the kitchen. ''By joining C.S.A.s or shopping at farmers' markets, people have made the commitment,'' Ms. Fernald said, referring to community-supported agriculture programs, in which people buy a weekly share of a farm's output. ''Now they will learn to deal with the ingredients.'' 
 Canning, especially the friendly sounding ''small batch'' model, reduces the seasonal bounty to a series of manageable afternoon projects. (By contrast, older recipes call for bushels, rather than quarts, of produce.) ''It's not a huge annual event, but all of a piece with the way I eat and cook every day,'' said Georgianne Mora, who lives in South Londonderry, Vt., and blogs at www.acookinglife.typepad.com. ''The most flavor, from the best ingredients, with the least interference from me.'' Ms. Mora, a purist among purists, has experimented extensively with jams cooked almost entirely by the heat of the sun, and sells them at farmers' markets. 
 Like most ideologically tinged movements, preserving has its warring factions, its fault lines and its taboos. Many American home-canning classics -- the kinds that win prizes at county fairs, like peas and carrots, dilled green beans, fruit jellies stiffened with pectin -- are considered too sweet, too plain or too artificial by these cooks. 
 ''I have never made one jar of jam with pectin,'' declared June Taylor, referring to the naturally derived thickener that is a staple of both industrial and home canning. (It is called for in many recipes on the Agriculture Department's canning Web site, the National Center for Home Food Preservation, www.uga.edu/nchfp/, considered the most reliable resource.) 
 Pectin is present in most unripe fruits and many ripe ones, but Ms. Taylor, Ms. Mora and others consider the prepackaged stuff, available in liquid and powder form, unnatural. Some produce their own pectin as cooks did for centuries, by boiling down the juice of green apples. This is the method espoused by Christine Ferber, the French jam goddess whose tiny workshop at the eastern edge of Alsace is hallowed ground for lovers of fruit preserves. (Her jams are sold at Pierre Herme's pastry shops in Paris, and her book, ''Mes Confitures,'' begins with a recipe for green apple jelly.) 
 Even the pectin rebels generally follow the U.S.D.A.'s strict guidelines for canning procedures, which have become even stricter over the last two decades. ''After the 1970s there was a real crackdown,'' said Blake Slemmer, a lifelong canner and self-described ''homesteader'' in Atlanta who translates the detailed U.S.D.A. instructions into plainer language on his Web site, www.pickyourown.org. 
 ''In the 1980's there was a hard look at the science,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Andress, director of the National Center for Home Food Preservation, who has worked with the U.S.D.A. for 25 years on developing the guidelines. ''Canning is much safer and more reliable than when we began.'' Current regulations forbid the simple open-kettle canning, in which hot food is spooned into hot jars, sealed, and left to cool. Now virtually all food must be processed after it goes into the jar, and cooks are firmly discouraged from canning vegetables other than tomatoes. (The high acidity of most ripe fruits helps discourage spoilers; most vegetables have no such natural protection.) 
 But experienced canners say that the warnings unnecessarily discourage novices. ''You should be clean, but you shouldn't be paranoid,'' Ms. Mora said. ''Imagine the conditions in which these techniques were developed.'' 
 Although the science of preserving doesn't change, tastes, economies and ideologies do. 
 Community canneries, where local farmers and cooks could once bring their produce to be canned, or do it themselves using large-scale equipment, have mostly disappeared. But in the Hudson Valley, a group in Schoharie County recently received a grant to help open a new one. Peter Pehrson, who is leading the project, said he was inspired and alarmed by the wasted produce on local farms that are geared for the commercial food market. 
 ''The tradition here is for the community to come in and pick up the gleanings,'' he said. ''I couldn't believe how much was left lying in the field.'' Mr. Pehrson said he was raised on farms and knew that even basic preserving equipment could solve the problem and create a new resource: locally grown canned vegetables. 
 ''Like most home cooks and gardeners, I overbuy, I overplant, and then the moment of reckoning comes,'' he said. 
 Buying too much at the farmers' market is the main reason Ms. Bone learned to can a decade ago. She loved good food, especially Italian food, and the preserving recipes that other canners used to win ribbons at county fairs just didn't have the deep, complicated tastes she remembered from her father's kitchen and visits to his family in Italy. Out of necessity, she began to develop her own safe recipes for canned foods she found useful, like pickled cauliflower and marinated artichokes. 
 ''How much jam and dill pickles can a person get through?'' Ms. Bone asked. Her book includes master recipes -- for preserves like stewed onions with marjoram, lemony baby artichokes, and figs in brandy -- and recipes for dishes that use them up. She is all about the churn of the kitchen, the movement of ingredients from the counter to the cupboard and freezer, back to the counter, to the table, and out. ''It's all part of the kitchen eco-system,'' she said. ''It all gets used in the end.''
 She stepped away from a stovetop of boiling pots to arrange herself in a yoga pose. ''In full peacock your elbows really dig into your stomach,'' she said, balancing on her forearms. ''Cooks like it because it keeps things moving through the intestinal tract.'' 
 She doesn't decorate her jars with calico, or stick charming labels on them, and is unconcerned about the color of her asparagus and the occasional overcooked batch of artichoke hearts. 
 ''I'm not in it for the looks,'' she said. ''If it tastes good, I'll eat it. If it doesn't taste good, I'll make it taste good.'' 
 Recipe: Sun-Cooked Strawberry Preserves Adapted from Georgianne Mora Time: 20 minutes plus at least 6 hours' maceration and 2 to 4 days' sun-cooking
 Adapted from Georgianne Mora
 Time: 20 minutes plus at least 6 hours' maceration and 2 to 4 days' sun-cooking
 2 quarts ripe, unblemished strawberries, rinsed (or raspberries, blackberries or blueberries)
 1 1/2 to 2 cups sugar
 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice.
 1. Watch the weather: sun-cooking requires two or three full days of sunshine and temperatures above 80 degrees. Trim stems or leaves off berries and taste; if they are very sweet, use smaller amount of sugar. Toss berries and sugar in a glass or ceramic bowl. Let sit for at least 6 hours or overnight. Stir occasionally to distribute sugar as it dissolves.
 2. Transfer berries to a nonstick or stainless steel pot and add lemon juice. Gradually bring mixture to a boil, then immediately reduce to a high simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Pour into a large stainless steel or plastic tray (or several, depending on size) into a layer 1 to 1 1/2 inches deep.
 3. Set in direct sun and cover with netting or cheesecloth to keep bugs out and to allow evaporation. Stir gently every few hours. Leave out all day, or at least eight hours; bring indoors (or cover securely) at dusk, set out again in the morning. 
 4. Watch for syrup under berries to thicken. Depending on weather, this will take two to four days. Mixture may bubble as it heats, but if it starts to foam, can it immediately and use as syrup. (Foam indicates the beginning of fermentation; syrup will still be safe and delicious.) If weather changes, or if mixture does not seem to be cooking, proceed with slow-cooking, below. 
 5. When all syrup thickens, pour it and fruit into a pot and gently bring to a boil. Pour into sterilized glass jars; tighten lids. Place jars in a deep pot with water to cover. Boil jars for 10 minutes, then remove from pot with jar lifter or tongs. Let cool on counter, untouched, 4 to 6 hours. After 12 to 24 hours, check seals: lift each jar up by the lid, and press the lid to make sure the center is sucked down tight. 
 Store in a dry dark place for up to one year. Refrigerate after opening. 
 Yield: About 2 pints.
 Note: Jam can be slow-cooked instead of sun-cooked. After macerating fruit in sugar, gently simmer mixture in a large pot, preferably nonstick, for 1 to 2 hours. Stir often; do not boil. When thickened, proceed with canning. 
 Recipe: Pickled Asparagus Adapted from ''Well-Preserved'' by Eugenia Bone (Clarkson Potter) Time: 1 hour, plus at least 4 hours' cooling and 4 weeks' resting
 Adapted from ''Well-Preserved'' by Eugenia Bone (Clarkson Potter)
 Time: 1 hour, plus at least 4 hours' cooling and 4 weeks' resting
 About 5 pounds asparagus, thin to medium-thick
 2 1/4 cups distilled white or white wine vinegar (labeled at least 5 percent acidity)
 4 tablespoons salt
 2 garlic cloves, slivered
 1 teaspoon dill seed (optional)
 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper flakes
 1/4 teaspoon whole allspice (optional)
 1/4 teaspoon cumin seed (optional)
 1/4 teaspoon coriander seed (optional)
 Hard-boiled eggs, extra virgin olive oil and freshly ground black pepper, for serving.
 1. Cut bottoms off asparagus to make them fit upright in a pint jar. Asparagus tips should be at least 1/2 inch below lid. (Reserve bottoms for another use.) 
 2. Pour about 2 inches water into a skillet large enough to hold asparagus lying down; bring to a boil. In batches, blanch asparagus: place in skillet, bring water back to a boil, and then immediately remove and run under very cold water or dunk in ice water. Set aside to drain.
 3. Combine remaining ingredients in a saucepan with 2 1/4 cups water and bring to a boil. Stir occasionally and cook just until salt dissolves; turn off heat. 
 4. Prepare 4 clean, hot pint jars and bands, and new lids. (Dip in boiling water, or run through dishwasher.) When jars are dry but still hot, pack asparagus into them, wedging spears in tightly. There should be enough for 3 or 4 full jars: do not half-fill jars. 
 5. Pour in vinegar solution, just to barely cover tips of asparagus. Make sure to leave 1/2 inch air space above vinegar solution. Distribute garlic slivers and spices evenly among jars. Wipe rims with a clean paper towel dipped in hot water, place lids on top and screw on bands. (Not too tight, just firmly closed.)
 6. Prepare a boiling-water bath in a deep pot with a rack. Place jars on rack and pour water over them, making sure water covers jars by 2 to 3 inches. Bring water back to a rolling boil over high heat, start a timer for 10 minutes, then reduce heat and gently boil. When timer goes off, turn off heat and wait 5 minutes before removing jars with jar lifter or tongs. Let cool on counter, untouched, 4 to 6 hours. After 12 to 24 hours, check seals: lift each jar up by the lid, and press the lid to make sure the center is sucked down tightly. 
 7. Store in a cool, dark, dry place (not refrigerator) for 4 weeks before using, or up to 1 year. Refrigerate after opening. To serve, drain off pickling liquid and arrange asparagus on plates. Add hard-boiled egg, drizzle with oil and shower with black pepper. 
 Yield: 3 or 4 pint jars.

HEADLINE: In Siberia, the Death Knell of a Complex Holding a Deadly Stockpile

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Soon after the Soviet Union's collapse, an American inspection team arrived at a decrepit storage complex in Siberia. The front gate was guarded by a scrawny teenage soldier who had not been paid in months. Giant sheds seemed to hold little of value. Why else would their doors be secured only with rusty bicycle locks?
 The reality was far more disturbing: the sheds contained two million artillery shells and warheads filled with nerve agents, extremely deadly substances, row after row, stacked like cordwood. Many were portable, and a single one detonated in a stadium or other crowded area could kill tens of thousands of people. 
 Today, the site has been transformed. The inspection in 1994 was a catalyst for a far-reaching American plan to destroy those chemical weapons, culminating in the formal opening scheduled for Friday of a facility nearby to carry out the work.
 The new facility, built with $1 billion in American aid, represents a milestone in a longstanding partnership between the United States and Russia to safeguard and in many cases liquidate enormous quantities of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons manufactured by the Soviet Union.
 This overall arrangement between the nations has often been troubled, and the project to eradicate the chemical weapons site in the Siberian city of Shchuchye, first proposed in 1996, has been repeatedly delayed. Some members of Congress sought to end financing, asserting that Russia should pay for the program itself, and the United States Defense Department's oversight of the project was questioned by Congressional auditors.
 For its part, Russia imposed unwieldy regulations on the project, and it was reluctant to use its own money. In general, the Kremlin under Vladimir V. Putin has grown much more secretive about these weapons sites, making it more difficult for American officials to verify how money is being spent.
 Still, American and Russian officials are hailing the opening of the new facility at Shchuchye (pronounced SHOO-che), 1,000 miles east of Moscow and just east of the Ural Mountains. They said these chemical weapons were in some respects a far more potent terrorist threat than nuclear ones because they are much easier to steal and deploy.
 The opening of the facility underscores how the United States and Russia have been able to hew to certain arms agreements even as overall relations soured during the Bush administration. 
 ''This is one of the most historic steps forward ever in nonproliferation,'' said Paul F. Walker, who took part in the 1994 inspection as a Congressional aide and is now a senior official at Global Green USA, an affiliate of an environmental organization begun by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader.
 ''One of the most dangerous chemical weapons arsenals in the world is finally getting demilitarized,'' Mr. Walker said. ''And it's been a long, long time.''
 As the early inspection of Shchuchye demonstrated, Russia's economic and political disarray in the early 1990s had severe consequences for its military infrastructure. American officials became alarmed that unconventional weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists.
 In 1991, two senators, Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, proposed a program to help the countries of the former Soviet Union secure and destroy those weapons.
 However rocky, the relative success of the Nunn-Lugar program has been cited by some Obama administration officials as offering hope for negotiations on future treaties. Russian and American officials are now engaged in talks on a new version of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or Start, which expires in December.
 The shells and warheads at Shchuchye contain about 5,950 tons of nerve agents, including sarin and VX. To dispose of them, a hole will be drilled into each, and the agents will be drained and mixed with other chemicals to neutralize them. The residue will be solidified in asphalt or a similar material.
 While the facility's formal opening is on Friday, it began preliminary operations in March. Russia ended up allocating roughly $600 million for the project, and other countries contributed as well.
 It has taken years to develop the process to eliminate the nerve agents, with the Russians choosing not to incinerate them because of local opposition. It might be five years or more before all the weapons are neutralized.
 ''It turns out that it is a lot easier to produce chemical weapons than to destroy them,'' said Igor V. Rybalchenko, a scientist who is a senior adviser to the Russian government.
 Mr. Rybalchenko said the methods being used were safe. However, environmental groups expressed concern about the potential for accidents at the new facility. They contend that the Russian government has long violated environmental laws at such sites.
 Lev A. Fyodorov, president of the Russian Union for Chemical Safety, said people in Shchuchye had seen fires and other accidents at the storage complex in recent years, yet the government had never publicized them or explained what safety measures it had undertaken.
 ''At American storage bases, many kinds of accidents have occurred, and we know about them,'' Mr. Fyodorov said. ''In Russia, do we know about such things at Russian bases? Of course not. I am a Russian citizen, and the Russian government does not tell me anything. Do we need to destroy chemical weapons? Of course. But do we need to violate the environmental rules of Russia to do this?''
 Russia and the United States have the vast majority of the world's chemical weapons, and they have pledged to dispose of them under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Both countries have encountered problems in financing and logistics, and they are not expected to meet the 2012 deadline.
 Shchuchye, in fact, has only 14 percent of Russia's chemical weapons, which are kept at seven sites.
 But Shchuchye is considered perhaps the most critical location because many of the nerve agents are in shells. The city is close to Kazakhstan, which itself is near Afghanistan.
 Senator Lugar recalled that he often had to fend off Congressional opposition to the Shchuchye project, especially from Republicans who said that American aid was allowing Russia to spend its own money on bolstering its military.
 But Senator Lugar, who plans to attend the opening ceremony on Friday, said that on an earlier visit, a single gesture showed that the storage site endangered the whole world.
 ''I took one of those shells,'' he said, ''and put it in a briefcase.''

HEADLINE: Securing Chemical Plants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Chemical Plant Safety'' (editorial, May 17), you call for action, but it is action that is already well under way to safeguard chemical facilities. 
 We agree that securing chemical facilities against deliberate attack is crucial to protecting Americans. That is why we didn't wait to act. Since 9/11, our members have invested more than $6.5 billion to enhance security at their facilities. We also called on Congress to raise the bar on security across the nation, and in 2006, it took that step. 
 The federal government has issued a comprehensive regulatory program establishing clear and stringent requirements for securing everything from chemical facilities to warehouses and university labs. The rules require facilities to address a wide range of threats, from preventing a bomb-laden car from reaching a target to preventing theft or diversion of materials from a site.
 By not boxing facility operators into a singular approach for securing their facilities, the rules allow and encourage operators to consider a wide array of security measures from process changes to hardening their facilities. 
 It should come as no surprise that we do not support regulatory proposals, crafted under the guise of security, that are veiled attempts to ban critically essential products vital to our nation's economy and well-being. Going forward, we will continue to build on the bipartisan efforts and work with Congress and the Obama administration to protect our facilities, employees and communities.

HEADLINE: A Defiant North Korea Test-Fires 3 More Missiles

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; Reporting was contributed by Mark McDonald from Hong Kong, Hiroko Tabuchi from Tokyo, Thom Shanker from Washington, and Neil MacFarquhar from the United Nations.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
One day after its nuclear test drew angry and widespread condemnation, North Korea further antagonized the international community on Tuesday by test-firing three short-range missiles.
 In addition, a South Korean newspaper reported on Wednesday that American spy satellites had detected plumes of steam and other signs of activity at a North Korean plant that reprocesses spent nuclear fuel to make weapons-grade plutonium. The report from the newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, appeared to support a claim by North Korea in late April that it had restarted its reprocessing plant at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the capital. 
 The missile firings came just hours after South Korea said it would join an American-led initiative to stop the global trafficking in unconventional weapons. The North responded Wednesday by reiterating its position that it would consider it a declaration of war if South Korea actually stopped and searched any North Korean ships as part of that program. 
 The developments sharpened the confrontation between North Korea and much of the world -- especially the United States -- as the United Nations Security Council vowed to fashion a resolution that could impose further sanctions on the increasingly belligerent North.
 The missiles launched Tuesday were surface-to-ship and surface-to-air projectiles, a South Korean official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. The South Korean news agency Yonhap said the missiles had a range of 80 miles. They were apparently launched from a base on the eastern coast into the sea opposite Japan, further rattling nerves in the region. 
 There was no official comment on the missile firings by either the North Korean authorities or the South Korean Defense Ministry. 
 After its nuclear test on Monday, its second in less than three years, the North test-fired three short-range missiles, also off its east coast. An intelligence official in Seoul said that move indicated that North Korea was ''getting its back up'' about the possibility that United States military aircraft would fly near North Korea in an effort to collect radiation data from the nuclear blast.
 At the Pentagon, officials said the military on Tuesday sent a specially designed surveillance plane into international airspace around North Korea to collect particles from the test. The airplane has high-technology ''sniffers'' on board to collect radioactive materials that might have seeped up from the underground test.
 The particles from the first surveillance flight were to be sent to laboratories in the United States, and a second flight was planned over the next day or two, officials said.
 South Korea's long-delayed participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative, a program to curb trafficking in unconventional weapons, followed a statement on Monday by the Security Council that unanimously condemned the nuclear test and called it a ''clear violation'' of a previous resolution.
 At the United Nations, the five permanent Security Council members and Japan and South Korea met for 90 minutes Tuesday to discuss possible new sanctions as well as ways to strengthen provisions in a 2006 resolution that have never been put into effect, like halting and inspecting North Korean vessels at sea. 
 Ambassadors were tight-lipped about potential new sanctions, and diplomats said no written proposals had begun to circulate. All seven nations were said to have agreed on the need to send a strong message to North Korea. ''We are in agreement on the goals,'' said Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador. But the Chinese ambassador, Zhang Yesui, deflected questions about how strong a resolution his country would support.
 In Japan, the lower house of Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution on Tuesday condemning the North's nuclear test, and it threatened to step up sanctions against the North.
 ''Japan, as the world's only nation to ever suffer a nuclear attack, cannot condone'' North Korea's repeated nuclear tests, the resolution said. North Korea's recent belligerence has also prompted Japan's governing party to debate whether Tokyo should consider pre-emptive strikes against states considered hostile -- actions that would probably require changes to Japan's pacifist Constitution.
 North Korea appeared unfazed by the world's condemnation, which included strong rebukes from allies like China and Russia. On Tuesday in Rodong Sinmun, the North's main Communist Party newspaper, North Korea declared that it was ''fully ready for battle'' against the United States, accusing President Obama of ''following in the footsteps of the previous Bush administration's reckless policy of militarily stifling North Korea.''
 North Korean officials have said that South Korea's full membership in the initiative would be seen as a ''declaration of undisguised confrontation and a declaration of a war.'' The international effort was begun in 2003 by the Bush administration in order to interdict shipments -- especially at sea -- that were suspected of containing unconventional weapons, their related materials and delivery systems. 
 Russia, Britain, France and Israel are among the 95 signers of the initiative, which India, Pakistan and China did not sign. 
 South Korea had wavered on joining the initiative for fear of provoking the North. But on Tuesday, President Lee Myung-bak, who came to power with a promise to take a tougher approach toward the North, spoke with Mr. Obama about the North Korean threat and the South's decision to join the effort.
 On the phone, Mr. Lee emphasized to Mr. Obama that the United States and its allies ''should not repeat the pattern'' of ''rewarding'' North Korea's provocations with dialogue and economic aid, as they did after the North's first nuclear test in October 2006.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths LUBY, ROBERT MAURICE

 BODY:
LUBY--Robert Maurice, of Cheshire, CT, formerly of Meriden, passed away on Friday evening, May 22, after a long and glorious life one week before his 95th birthday. Mr. Luby lived at Elim Park, Cheshire, CT. Mr. Luby is survived by his wife of 65 years, Ruth McGee Luby. Mr. Luby was born in Meriden, CT on May 29, 1914, and was the son of the late William J. Luby and Ellen O'Donnell Luby. 
He resided in Meriden for nearly 90 years. Mr. Luby attended St. Joseph School, and was graduated from Meriden High School in 1932. He graduated from Yale College in 1936 and Yale Law School in 1939. He then opened his practice of law in Meriden. He was a veteran of World War II. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942, and served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 3rd Engineer Special Brigade, 32nd Division. He spent most of his service in the South Pacific Theatre as an Amphibious Engineer and Shore Battalion Commander, participating in the military campaigns of the Bismarck Archipelago, Luzon, Southern Philippines, and New Guinea. He also served as Combat Liaison Officer on the staff of General Ogden. Following the Japanese surrender, he served in the first Provisional Government for the Island of Hokkaido. He was awarded a Bronze Star for bravery, and was honorably discharged in 1945 with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Mr. Luby returned to the practice of law in Meriden after the war, and was the founding partner of Luby Olson, P.C. He held many leadership positions in the community during his lifetime, including President of the Meriden Boys Club, the Meriden Wallingford Hospital, and the Home Club. He served as Chairman and Director of the Home Bank and Trust Company, and Director of the Bradley Home, the H. Wales Lines Co., the C.N. Flagg Company, and the Meriden Gravure Co. He was a founding member of the Meriden Industrial Development Corp., a small group of private citizens who sought to preserve space for industrial growth to increase employment in the Meriden and Wallingford area, and which is now known as Research Parkway. He also played a key role in the formation and development of the Cuno Foundation. Mr. Luby and his wife Ruth shared a love of travel, history and reading. They traveled to Ireland, England, France, Spain, Italy, Egypt, New Guinea, China, Thailand, India, Panama, Peru, and throughout the United States and Canada. He never missed a birthday, first communion or a graduation. He was a frequent spectator at his grandchildren's softball, basketball, and horse riding competitions. He loved his family, lunch at Fischer's with his law partners, history, the novels of Louis L'Amour, Yale, and Sunday afternoon naps. Despite his sustained efforts over many years, his golf game was an object of sympathy. In addition to his wife, Mr. Luby is survived by three children and their spouses, Deborah Luby Rie and her husband John Rie of Westbrook, CT, Robert M. Luby Jr. and his wife Karen Grava of Wallingford, CT, and Attorney Thomas S. Luby and his wife Paula of Old Saybrook, CT; by four grandchildren, Jessica Ruth Hammatt and her husband James Adam Wrubleski of Westbrook, Caroline Ruth Luby and Katherine Mary Luby of Old Saybrook, CT, and Elizabeth Theresa Luby of New York City; by four nieces, Jane Luby, Mary Luby Larsen, and Ann Luby Adamczyk, all of Meriden, and Ellen Luby Larsen of Middlefield; by his sister-in-law Agnes Stazewski Luby of Meriden and formerly of Kensington; by three step- grandchildren, Johanna Wolfe of Rockville, MD, Jacob Williams of Woodbury, CT and Colby Williams of Secaucus, NJ; and by two great grandchildren, Hannah Elizabeth Wrubleski and Cooper James Wrubleski. Mr. Luby was predeceased by his brothers William J. Luby Jr. and James F. Luby.

HEADLINE: Russians Spend Big For a Piece Of Facebook

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
A Russian investment firm, Digital Sky Technologies, has invested $200 million in the social networking company Facebook in return for a 1.96 percent stake, the two companies said Tuesday.
 The investment values Facebook's preferred stock at $10 billion, a $5 billion drop from October 2007 when Microsoft paid $240 million for a 1.6 percent stake. With the latest round of financing, Facebook has raised about $600 million since it was founded in 2004. 
 Mark E. Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief, said that the Microsoft investment was made at the ''absolute peak of the market'' and that it was a part of Facebook's partnership with Microsoft, which includes advertising and search agreements. 
 ''Relative to the economic conditions for when the Microsoft deal happened and that being more of a strategic partnership than a straight financial investment, we feel really good about the progress we've made,'' Mr. Zuckerberg said in a conference call with reporters. 
 At the time of Microsoft's investment, Facebook's $15 billion valuation drew criticism for being unrealistically high and a sign of a bubble in social network investments. With the new valuation, Facebook is demonstrating to its critics that it is living up to its early promise. Facebook turned down better-known firms in the United States who reportedly offered to invest at lower valuations. 
 As with any private company valuation, it is simply a data point, venture capitalists say. Only when Facebook is sold to another company or sold to the public will a value be determined. 
 ''It's hard to extrapolate that's what the company is worth at this point,'' said Braden Berg, a lawyer in the Silicon Valley office of Mintz Levin who works with start-ups and venture capital firms. He said it was a valuable valuation, ''and that may have been one of Facebook's motivations.'' 
 The fresh capital will provide a cushion for the company as it continues its fast-paced growth and explores new revenue sources beyond advertising. 
 Facebook did not need the money, Mr. Zuckerberg said. Its revenue is growing 70 percent year over year. He said the company would be able to run its operations from cash flow in 2010, even without the additional capital. 
 ''The financing will serve as a cash buffer to support our continued growth, allowing us to scale,'' he said. 
 Yet some Facebook observers have questioned whether a company growing so quickly, particularly overseas, where the online advertising market is smaller, can achieve these financial goals. 
 Facebook had 307 million visitors worldwide in April, almost triple the number a year ago, and 79 percent of them are outside the United States, according to comScore. It is quickly using cash to pay for the bandwidth and storage needs of the exploding user base abroad. 
 Digital Sky Technologies, which will not get a seat on Facebook's board, will be able to help Facebook, which makes most of its money from ads, figure out new ways to make money outside the United States. It is a prominent Internet investor in Russia and Europe, where it owns stakes in Web companies that account for 70 percent of all page views on the Russian-speaking Internet, according to the firm. 
 Its portfolio companies include two large social networks, Forticom and vKontakte, and a Russian Web portal, Mail.ru. They have various business models, such as collecting micropayments from users and selling virtual goods.
 These companies have figured out how to make money outside the United States much better than Facebook has, said Yuri Milner, chief executive of Digital Sky Technologies. He said that he was confident that Facebook would also be able to tap into these sources of revenue. ''We believe the current valuation reflects that,'' he said.
 Digital Sky Technologies also plans to buy at least $100 million of Facebook stock from current and former employees, the companies said. Details of the transaction will be announced in a few months. This will let some Facebook employees receive cash before the company is sold, something Mr. Zuckerberg said would not happen in the near future. 
 ''It's not something we're thinking about right now, it's not something we're rushing toward,'' he said. ''We'll do it when it's the right thing for the company.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Could Take 70% Share Of G.M. in Latest Recovery Plan

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and DAVID E. SANGER; Micheline Maynard reported from Detroit and David E. Sanger from Washington. Nick Bunkley contributed from Detroit and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
In better times, many employees of General Motors called their company ''Generous Motors'' because of its rich benefits.
 Now G.M. may stand for something else: Government Motors.
 The latest plan for the troubled automaker, which is expected to file for bankruptcy by Monday, calls for the Treasury Department to receive about 70 percent of a restructured G.M. 
 Including the more than $20 billion that has already been spent to prop up G.M., the government will provide G.M. at least $50 billion to get the company through Chapter 11, people with direct knowledge of the situation said Tuesday. By some estimates in Detroit, tens of billions beyond that amount may be required. 
 The United Automobile Workers, meanwhile, will hold up to 20 percent through its retiree health care fund, and bondholders and other parties will get the remaining share. Shareholders would be virtually wiped out. 
 Although it has been clear for weeks that Treasury would have a majority stake of a reconstituted G.M., a 70 percent share -- a figure that could still change -- is higher than what had been expected. 
 The prospect of a G.M. effectively owned by the government raises a number of thorny questions. Countless policy decisions -- on matters such as fuel economy standards, tax incentives to replace aging cars and green technology initiatives -- will present conflicting interests. 
 For example, with $30 billion invested in G.M. and Chrysler thus far, would the government tip the scales in favor of those companies when buying vehicles for its fleets? Will Ford find itself at a disadvantage, since it has turned down federal money?
 There are cultural challenges, too. Can the government help turn around a company known for its bureaucratic approach to business? 
 Aides to President Obama have consistently said they would be reluctant shareholders, and they plan no operating role in the company. 
 ''No one is going to put U.S. government employees on the G.M. board,'' one person close to the ongoing discussions said on Tuesday. 
 The day-to-day running of the firm, this person said, would be left to professional managers, and the government would not be involved in decisions about closing factories, renegotiating contracts or selecting product lines.
 But that may not be so easy. Already, members of Congress have been calling Steven Rattner and Ron Bloom, who are running the auto task force, to complain about the closing of Chrysler and G.M. dealerships in their states. 
 As factories close or move, those calls most likely will grow more intense, in part because members of Congress will have a hard time explaining to constituents how the government could own 70 percent of the company and still have no control over deciding which factories stay open and which are closed.
 Mr. Obama's representatives may also feel compelled to weigh in on the design of new models to achieve his goals for greater fuel efficiency and lower emissions.
 ''Every decision down to what material is used in the bumpers will be seen, rightly or wrongly, as government-influenced,'' said one person who was a consultant to Mr. Obama's task force. But clearly the administration will have oversight to select or remove management as it already had in ousting Rick Wagoner as chief executive in March.
 Back in December, Mr. Obama, as the president-elect, suggested that he wanted to avoid an uncontrolled bankruptcy. Now, only five months later, his White House is embracing it as a highly efficient solution, given the quick if painful bankruptcy of Chrysler.
 ''G.M. is a more complicated company,'' said one person familiar with the government's strategy discussions with G.M. ''It is global, and much bigger. Every day we come upon a question with G.M. that didn't exist in Chrysler, which is a pretty simple company.''
 While G.M.'s aid does not approach the $180 billion that American International Group received from the government, the tab dwarfs the $18 billion that Mr. Wagoner estimated the company would need last year when he appeared before Congress.
 The government plan calls for the creation of a new G.M., with its better assets like Cadillac and Chevrolet, that might emerge from bankruptcy by the end of the summer. The rest of G.M. would be sold or liquidated in a process that could take much longer.
 As recently as last month, G.M. said in a regulatory filing that it expected the U.A.W.'s health care trust, called a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, or VEBA, to receive 39 percent of the company, bondholders 9 percent, shareholders one percent, and the rest going to the Treasury. 
 The U.A.W. negotiated a bigger stake at Chrysler, with a retiree health care trust expected to own 55 percent of the company once it emerges from bankruptcy.
 The union made clear to its members Tuesday that its leverage with G.M. was limited.
 ''Without government financial assistance, G.M. would surely fail, with devastating consequences including massive plant closures and a probable liquidation of the company,'' the U.A.W. told its members. Bondholders, who hold $27 billion in G.M. debt, were unhappy with the plan because it gave them a much smaller stake than the U.A.W. trust, to which G.M. owes $20 billion. 
 Bondholders finish voting early Wednesday on a tender offer, widely expected to fail, that would exchange their holdings for shares. G.M. said it needed 90 percent to accept, or otherwise it would file for bankruptcy.
 Despite their protests, some legal experts say that G.M. and the government are likely to prevail in bankruptcy court because the company would not be alive today without its loans.
 ''It is unfair treatment, and I think the bondholders are being discriminated against,'' said Evan D. Flaschen, chairman of the financial restructuring group at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani. ''But the government has also put in more than $15 billion into G.M., so in a real sense it's theirs to allocate.''
 Meanwhile, union members are voting on a sweeping series of contract changes similar to those already approved at Ford and Chrysler. Under them, U.A.W.'s trust would receive 17.5 percent of G.M., and a warrant equal to another 2.5 percent of G.M. at a later time.
 The union also is receiving an additional $9 billion in a note from G.M. and preferred stock in the new company, to go with its other shares, which it conceded the fund might not be able to sell for years.
 Separately, a federal district court judge denied on Tuesday a motion in Chrysler's bankruptcy case, filed by three Indiana state funds, that would have effectively derailed the company's pending sale to Fiat.

HEADLINE: Careers That Work For Families

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The big influx of highly educated workers into finance in the last two decades has been the subject of some national hand-wringing lately. President Obama, college presidents and economists have all worried aloud that Wall Street has hoarded human resources that might otherwise have gone to science, education, medicine or other fields. 
 Now, new research is suggesting that the shift also brought another cost -- a cost that fell mainly on the people, especially women, who took jobs in finance. Among elite white-collar fields, finance appears to be uniquely difficult for anyone trying to combine work and family. 
 Finance, on this score, is worse than law and worse than academia. It is far worse than medicine, which emerges from the research as the highly paid profession with the most flexibility. Near finance at the bottom of the list is consulting, another field that became more popular in the last two decades. 
 The research, by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz of Harvard, answers a question that college students, for all their careful career planning, rarely consider: which jobs offer the best chance at balancing work and family life? A decade or two after college, however, that question often comes to dominate conversations among friends and between spouses.
 On almost every aspect of work-life balance, finance and consulting look pretty bad. People who take time off in those fields suffer large penalties, both in terms of money and career opportunities, once they return to full-time work. And part-time jobs are hard to come by, which often forces people to make a choice between working a 70-hour week and leaving a job entirely. 
 One set of statistics neatly summarizes the findings. After surveying Harvard College alumni 15 years after graduation, Ms. Goldin and Mr. Katz estimated the average financial penalty for someone who had taken a year and a half off and then returned to work. In medicine, that person earned 16 percent less than a similar doctor who had not taken time off. Among people with no graduate degree, the gap was 25 percent. For both lawyers and Ph.D.'s, it was about 29 percent.
 For M.B.A.'s, a group dominated by finance workers and consultants, it was 41 percent. Given how much money many make, they can probably do just fine even after such a pay cut. Yet the size of it suggests that time off puts them on a completely different career track. 
 ''The good news is that there are at least some professions where women have been able to carve out a set of policies that are compatible with family life,'' Jane Waldfogel, a Columbia professor who studies families, told me. ''The challenge for the next generation -- and it isn't just about women -- is to extend this to other occupations.''
 Ms. Goldin and Mr. Katz, who are two of the country's leading labor economists and have published the crux of these findings in the American Economic Review, studied Harvard graduates from the last 40 years. That allowed them to compare a fairly similar group of students over a long period, but had the disadvantage of creating a decidedly atypical survey group. 
 So the two economists compared their results to two other surveys -- the National Survey of College Graduates, run by the National Science Foundation, and a study of University of Chicago business school graduates -- and found broadly consistent patterns.
 According to the most recent National Survey, for instance, 21 percent of doctors in their late 30s and early 40s work less than 35 hours a week. The share was roughly 14 percent for M.B.A. graduates, as it was for lawyers and people with Ph.D.'s.
 The idea that medicine offers more choices than other elite professions may come as a surprise, given that medical training requires notoriously long hours of study. But once doctors reach their 30s, many of them seem to be rewarded with a wider set of options than their counterparts in other fields. 
 When I heard about the new findings, I immediately thought of two friends of mine, a pediatrician and ophthalmologist married to each other and living in Colorado. Their years of training were typically grueling. While they were in medical school and residency in Northern California in the 1990s, they were surrounded by people at dot-coms who were working shorter hours and making vastly more money.
 But today, they have the best work-life balance of any parents I know. She works two and a half days a week and is on call eight weekends a year. He arrives at his office early every morning and takes short lunches so that he can work four days a week. He is also on call 10 weeks a year. They have jobs they love, and they spend a lot of time with each other and their children.
 As Al Franken, the comedian turned politician, has observed, ''Kids don't want quality time. They want quantity time -- big, stinking, lazy, nonproductive quantity time.'' And research on emotional and intellectual development suggests that kids are right to want what they do.
 Obviously, certain medical specialties still don't allow for much flexibility. But a significant number do. (The same seems to be true of public policy and a few other fields; among people with a master's degree in something other than business, the average pay penalty for taking time off was 13 percent, slightly below what it was for doctors.) 
 A telling example of a flexible field, Ms. Goldin points out, is obstetrics. It seems to be the archetypal field that must operate on someone's else clock -- a baby's. Yet as the ranks of female obstetricians have grown, they have figured out how to change that. 
 Group practices are now the norm, and the doctors take turns being on call. A family's primary obstetrician isn't guaranteed to be the one who delivers the baby. In many practices, every doctor will see a woman at least once during her pregnancy, so she knows everyone who may deliver her baby.
 Wall Street, consulting firms and law firms have resisted this group approach to work. The partners claim the work is too complicated to be handed from one employee to another. In some cases, that's no doubt true. Often, though, I bet it isn't. ''Why are women's bodies less complicated than someone's account?'' Ms. Goldin wryly asks.
 The general resistance to group work -- and to flexibility -- instead seems to stem from old habits, much as obstetricians once would have scoffed at the notion of a group practice. The downsides of allowing people to share work would probably be outweighed by the benefits of being able to hire talented people who want satisfying careers and aren't willing to work 70-hour weeks. 
 For now, that group remains largely female. But there is some reason to hope that fathers will be increasingly drawn to such jobs as well. Over the last four decades, according to the economists Mark Aguiar and Erik Hurst, men have increased the average amount of time they spend taking care of children. (Harvard men, however, have not, the Goldin-Katz data show.)
 The question of how to balance work and family is almost inevitably a thorny one. Easy answers, free of compromise and sacrifice, are rare, especially for people who don't earn nearly as much money as doctors. 
 But if you're a teenager or college student trying to decide what to do with your life, you at least may want to start thinking about the question. I promise: Most of you will spend a lot of time thinking about it later.

HEADLINE: A Trailblazer And a Dreamer

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Contributors to this article include Jo Becker, David Gonzalez, Jodi Kantor, Serge F. Kovaleski, William K. Rashbaum, Benjamin Weiser, Manny Fernandez, Karen Zraick, Colin Moynihan, Richard Perez-Pena and Michael Powell from New York; and Charlie Savage, Scott Shane and Neil A. Lewis from Washington. Kitty Bennett, Itai Maytal and Barclay Walsh contributed research.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
She was ''a child with dreams,'' as she once said, the little girl who learned at 8 that she had diabetes, who lost her father when she was 9, who devoured Nancy Drew books and spent Saturday nights playing bingo, marking the cards with chickpeas, in the squat red brick housing projects of the East Bronx.
 She was the history major and Puerto Rican student activist at Princeton who spent her first year at that bastion of the Ivy League ''too intimidated to ask questions.'' She was the tough-minded New York City prosecutor, and later the corporate lawyer with the dazzling international clients. She was the federal judge who ''saved baseball'' by siding with the players' union during a strike. 
Now Sonia Sotomayor -- a self-described ''Nuyorican'' whose mother, a nurse, and father, a factory worker, left Puerto Rico during World War II -- is President Obama's choice for the Supreme Court, with a chance to make history as only the third woman and first Hispanic to sit on the highest court in the land. Her up-by-the-bootstraps tale, an only-in-America story that in many ways mirrors Mr. Obama's own, is one reason for her selection, and it is the animating characteristic of her approach to both life and the law.
 ''Personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see,'' Judge Sotomayor (pronounced so-toe-my-OR) said in 2001, in a lecture titled ''A Latina Judge's Voice.'' ''My hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and extrapolate them further into areas with which I am unfamiliar. I simply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging. But I accept there will be some based on my gender and my Latina heritage.''
 From her days going to the movies with cousins to see Cantinflas, a Mexican comedian whom she once called the ''Abbott and Costello of my generation,'' to her current life in the rarefied world of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Judge Sotomayor, 54, has traveled what Mr. Obama called ''an extraordinary journey.''
 In her 2001 address, she spoke longingly of the ''sound of merengue at all our family parties'' and the Puerto Rican delicacies -- patitas de cerdo con garbanzos (pigs' feet with beans) and la lengua y orejas de cuchifrito (pigs' tongue and ears) -- that appealed to the ''particularly adventurous taste buds'' that she called ''a very special part of my being Latina.'' 
 Today, Judge Sotomayor's culinary tastes range from tuna fish and cottage cheese for lunch with clerks in her chambers, to her standard order at the Blue Ribbon Bakery: smoked sturgeon on toast, with Dijon mustard, onions and capers. She works out three times a week, putting in three miles on the treadmill in the court's gym. Divorced and with no children, she enjoys the ballet and theater and lives in a condominium in Greenwich Village -- both a subway ride and a world away from the housing projects where she grew up.
 Yet a few things have not changed: her feeling of herself as ''not completely a part of the worlds I inhabit,'' as she said in one speech; her drive and ambition; and her willingness to speak up about her own identity as a Latina and a woman. In many ways, she is walking through a door she pushed open herself. On the bench, Judge Sotomayor may be a careful deliberator, but off it she has been a tireless advocate for Latinos.
 In 1976, she wrote her senior thesis at Princeton on Luis Munoz Marin, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico, and dedicated it in part ''to the people of my island -- for the rich history that is mine.'' She has lectured at the University of Puerto Rico School of Law. In 2001, she was a speaker at a Princeton-sponsored conference titled ''Puerto Ricans: Second-Class Citizens in 'Our' Democracy?'''
 In describing his criteria for a Supreme Court pick, Mr. Obama said he was looking for empathy -- a word that conservatives, who are already attacking Judge Sotomayor, have described as code for an activist judge with liberal views who will impose her own agenda on the law. Her critics also raise questions about her judicial temperament, saying she can be abrupt and impatient on the bench.
 But Judge Sotomayor's friends say she is simply someone who will bring the ''common touch'' that the president has said he prizes to her understanding of the law.
 ''I think she's compassionate and empathetic, and I think she is going to really listen to people who are alleging that they have been victimized in some way,'' said Robert H. Klonoff, dean of the Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Ore., who attended Yale Law with Judge Sotomayor and considers her a friend. Dean Klonoff, who last saw the judge in her New York chambers the day after Mr. Obama's election, compares her to Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court's first black justice, for the perspective he says she would bring to the court.
 ''She had such a different path,'' he said. ''There were so many people that had Roman numerals after their names and long histories of family members who had gone to Yale, and here was this woman who was from the projects, not hiding her views at all, just totally outspoken. She's one of those where, even at a school with great people, I knew that she was going to go on and do amazing things.''
 Childhood in the East Bronx
 There was something of a pioneer spirit among the Puerto Ricans who settled into the East Bronx after braving tenements farther south or poverty back on the island. To settle into the Bronxdale Houses, as Sonia Sotomayor's family ultimately did in the 1960s, was to find a haven of sorts, according to people who lived there then.
 ''Here was a paradise,'' said Ricardo Velez, who was among the earliest tenants when he moved to his apartment in 1956. ''It was beautiful.''
 This was the place where Sonia's parents, Celina and Juan Sotomayor, intended to raise their children -- Ms. Sotomayor and her brother, Juan, who is now a doctor in Syracuse. The couple met and married during World War II after Celina was discharged from the Women's Army Corps, the WACS, the outlet for women of her generation to give to the war effort. Celina Sotomayor had left Puerto Rico at 17 to sign up, shipping off to Georgia for her training with no relatives in the mainland United States.
 While her husband worked at a tool-and-die factory, Celina Sotomayor -- by all accounts the driving force in her daughter's life -- went on to become a telephone operator at Prospect Hospital, a small private hospital in the South Bronx, and later received her practical nurse's license. The family's life was upended when Sonia's father died at 42, in part from heart complications that had kept him out of the Army. Celina Sotomayor, a widow with two young children and no savings, began working six days a week.
 Her daughter retreated into books. Sonia Sotomayor loved the Nancy Drew mysteries, she once said, and yearned to be a police detective. But the doctor who had diagnosed her diabetes told her that she would not be able to do that kind of work. (The White House says Judge Sotomayor's diabetes, a disease that can ultimately cause blindness, heart disease and kidney ailments, has been under control through insulin injections and careful monitoring for decades and does not affect her work.)
 A 'Perry Mason' Moment
 She also spent hours watching ''Perry Mason'' on television. An episode that ended with the camera fixed on the judge helped her set a new career goal, she told The Associated Press in 1998. ''I realized that the judge was the most important player in the room,'' she said at the time.
 The Bronxdale Houses were still ethnically mixed when the Sotomayors lived there, and neighbors say it felt mostly safe. But Judge Sotomayor recalled in a 1998 interview with The A.P. that temptation was lurking nearby.
 ''There were working poor in the projects,'' she said. ''There were poor poor in the projects. There were sick poor in the projects. There were addicts and non-addicts and all sorts of people, every one of them with problems, and each group with a different response, different methods of survival, different reactions to the adversity they were facing. And you saw kids making choices.''
 Parents made choices, too. For Celina Sotomayor, education was the highest priority; she bought her children an Encyclopaedia Britannica, a novelty in the projects. ''She was famous for the encyclopedia,'' said Milagros Baez O'Toole, a cousin.
 Roman Catholic schools of that era were embraced by many working-class Puerto Rican parents who saw the public schools as too rowdy and dangerous. The Sotomayor family, which is Catholic, was among them. Judge Sotomayor attended Cardinal Spellman High School in the Northeast Bronx, which opened in 1959 and earned a reputation as a school for high achievers. She graduated as valedictorian in 1972.
 Jeri Faulkner, who was a freshman when Judge Sotomayor was a senior, remembers black students sat at one table in the cafeteria, and Latino students at another. But Ms. Faulkner, who is now the school's dean of students, said Ms. Sotomayor inspired her.
 ''As a freshman, when you're looking at seniors, you're a little awestruck with them,'' Ms. Faulkner said. ''She was smart. She always had time for you if you needed to speak to her. She didn't belittle your questions. She wasn't aloof. She was one of us.''
 When Ms. Sotomayor entered Cardinal Spellman in the late 1960s, boys and girls were rigidly segregated into opposing wings of the school, with a nun stationed at a central point to enforce gender separation. But this ''co-institutional'' arrangement was abandoned while she was there, and the sexes mixed freely by the time she graduated. Ms. Sotomayor had a sweetheart, Kevin E. Noonan. ''She was irrepressible, very popular, very bright, very dynamic,'' said one classmate who asked not to be named. ''She wasn't overbearing about it, but you knew she was in the room.''
 By then, the Sotomayor family had moved to a new apartment in Co-op City -- a clear step up from the projects. The family's Co-op City kitchen table became a regular gathering spot for food and conversation for Sonia's classmates and debate team buddies.
 ''Sonia was very much the ruler of the kitchen-table debate,'' said Kenneth K. Moy, the son of Chinese immigrants who was a year ahead of her at both Spellman and later Princeton. ''She was very analytical, even back then. It was clear to people who knew her that if she wasn't going to be a lawyer, she was going to be in public life somehow.''
 Mr. Moy said Ms. Sotomayor's crowd was a diverse mix of students that included immigrants from struggling families and others from well-to-do parts of Westchester County. They endlessly hashed over not only school gossip, but also Vietnam -- where their friends were serving in a war that had divided the school -- as well as the country, race relations and social justice, he said.
 Sonia's mother, Celina, would return home after long hours working as a nurse and feed the crowd of teenagers rice and beans and sometimes pork chops. ''I can't tell you how many times I said, 'Is there another pork chop?' -- and there was,'' said Mr. Moy, now a lawyer in Oakland, Calif. Later, he urged his friend to follow him to Princeton. But he was candid, he said, about what she would face there as a Puerto Rican from a modest background.
 ''I told her I don't want you to come here with any illusions,'' Mr. Moy recalled. ''Social isolation is going to be a part of your experience, and you have to have the strength of character to get through intact.''
 Adjusting to Princeton
 When Ms. Sotomayor arrived at Princeton in the fall of 1972, she was one of the only Latinos there: there were no professors, no administrators, and only a double-digit number of students. Princeton women were sharply outnumbered as well; the first ones had been admitted only a few years earlier, and some alumni had protested their increasing ranks. (Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who graduated just a few months before Ms. Sotomayor arrived, belonged to one of the groups that protested.) 
 Ms. Sotomayor was terrified: she barely raised her hand in class initially, and years later, she confessed to a friend at Yale Law School that she could ''barely write'' when she arrived at Princeton. So she barricaded herself in the library, earning a reputation as a grind (her diligence would pay off with her eventual election to Phi Beta Kappa). She spent her summers inhaling children's classics, grammar books and literature that many Princeton peers had already conquered at Choate or Exeter.
 She also readily accepted help. When Ms. Sotomayor arrived in Nancy Weiss Malkiel's history class in the spring of her freshman year, for example, she seemed unprepared, Ms. Malkiel recalled in an e-mail message. But Ms. Malkiel tutored her in how to read sources and write analytically, and by late in the semester, Ms. Sotomayor was flourishing. 
 By her junior year or so, ''I don't remember her being shy or reticent about much of anything,'' said Jerry Cox, a classmate. 
 Ms. Sotomayor also became involved in campus politics. After heavy lobbying, she joined Accion Puertorriquena, an organization working for more opportunity for Puerto Rican students. 
 ''Sonia had to be persuaded to join us,'' said Margarita Rosa, a friend from high school. ''We were a ragtag-looking bunch, and she was always methodical in her decision making.''
 Soon Ms. Sotomayor was co-chairwoman of the organization, which filed a formal letter of complaint with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, accusing the university of discrimination in hiring and admission.
 ''The facts imply and reflect a total absence of regard, concern and respect for an entire people and their culture,'' she wrote in an opinion article in The Daily Princetonian. ''In effect, they represent an effort -- a successful effort so far -- to relegate an important cultural sector of the population to oblivion.''
 In her student thesis, which she dedicated to nine friends and family members, Ms. Sotomayor wrote about Puerto Rico's long struggle for political and economic self-determination. While Munoz Marin created great hope among Puerto Ricans, ''the island has continued to be plagued by unemployment, absentee ownership and dependency on mainland revenues,'' she concluded. When Ms. Sotomayor graduated, she was awarded the Pyne Prize, the university's highest undergraduate award, presented for a combination of strong grades and extracurricular work. Even before she won, everyone on campus seemed to know who she was. ''I certainly admired her from afar,'' said Randall Kennedy, now a professor at Harvard Law School and along with Ms. Sotomayor, a member of Princeton's Board of Trustees. 
 Ms. Sotomayor went straight to Yale Law School, where she researched and wrote her way onto the law review by analyzing the arcane constitutional issues that would determine whether Puerto Rico would be allowed to maintain access to its seabed if it became a state.
 Even when she described positions with which she disagreed, ''she was scrupulous about giving the strongest form,'' said Stephen L. Carter, who edited her submission and said Ms. Sotomayor was just as tolerant a debater in class. 
 Her submission was ''inspired by deep social concern about having the poorest area in American jurisdiction survive economically,'' said Edward Rubin, another editor. ''It was very scholarly and balanced even though it was inspired by social concern.'' Classmates remember just how hard she worked on it, polishing and repolishing it again.
 At Princeton, Ms. Sotomayor had volunteered with Latino patients at a state psychiatric hospital in Trenton, and now she showed a similar desire to pull away from her elite environment. ''She felt an affinity with the African-American janitor, the workers, people in the cafeteria,'' recalled Rudolph Aragon, a classmate and who headed the Latin, Asian and Native American association with Ms. Sotomayor. ''There were so few minority students that we had to combine forces,'' he said. 
 Her closest friends at the school were all outsiders: Mr. Aragon, who is Mexican-American, along with three other students -- a fellow Puerto Rican, a Mohawk Indian and an African-American, he recalled.
 After hours they would retreat to one another's apartments for baseball games -- Ms. Sotomayor watched ecstatically as Reggie Jackson delivered the 1977 World Series to the Yankees -- or to a local club where the law students danced alongside the locals. Ms. Sotomayor was still a grind, her friends said, but she also smoked, drank beer and danced a mean salsa. 
 She somehow seemed older than her classmates, several said -- perhaps because of her difficult childhood, or maybe because she was already married. (She and Mr. Noonan, who would become a biologist and later a biotech patent lawyer, wed in the summer of 1976, but divorced seven years later.) And she knew exactly what she wanted after graduation: to be a litigator. She was ''tough, clear, very quick on her feet,'' said Martha Minow, now a Harvard Law School professor who advised the White House on the selection. 
 An Imposing Prosecutor
 She would soon get plenty of practice. In 1979, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, hired Ms. Sotomayor on the recommendation of Jose A. Cabranes, then a teacher at Yale Law School and now a federal appeals court judge. She became a young prosecutor in a city struggling with a drug- related crime wave, joining a trial unit that handled everything from misdemeanors to homicides. 
 ''Some of the judges like to push around young assistants and get them to dispose of cases,'' Mr. Morgenthau recalled. ''Well, no one pushed around Sonia Sotomayor; she stood up to the judges, in an appropriate way.''
 In her fifth year in the office, she was interviewed for The New York Times Magazine about the prosecutors working for Mr. Morgenthau. She was described as an imposing woman of 29 who smoked incessantly, and spoke of how she had coped in a job that some liberal friends disapproved of.
 ''I had more problems during my first year in the office with the low-grade crimes -- the shoplifting, the prostitution, the minor assault cases,'' she said. ''In large measure, in those cases you were dealing with socioeconomic crimes, crimes that could be the product of the environment and of poverty.
 ''Once I started doing felonies, it became less hard. No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous.''
 In 1984, Ms. Sotomayor left the district attorney's office and joined Pavia & Harcourt, a boutique commercial law firm in Manhattan.
 ''We had an opening for a litigator, and her resume was perfect,'' said George M. Pavia, the managing partner who hired her. ''She's an excellent lawyer, a careful preparer of cases, liberal, but not doctrinaire, not wild-eyed.'' 
 A large part of Ms. Sotomayor's work was fighting the counterfeiters who copied products of Fendi, the luxury goods company, and its well-known ''double F'' logo. Sometimes, that meant suing counterfeiters to stop them from importing fake Fendi goods. 
 At other times, it involved more derring-do: if the firm had a tip from the United States Customs Office about a suspicious shipment, Ms. Sotomayor would often be involved in the risky maneuver of going to the warehouse to have the merchandise seized. One incident that figures largely in firm lore was a seizure in Chinatown, where the counterfeiters ran away, and Ms. Sotomayor got on a motorcycle and gave chase.
 In July 1987, Mario M. Cuomo, then the governor, appointed Ms. Sotomayor to the board of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which helps low-income people get loans to buy homes. In 1992, when she left the unpaid board position, it passed a resolution honoring her for consistently defending the rights of the disadvantaged to secure affordable housing'' and serving as the conscience of the board concerning ''the negative effects of gentrification.''
 A Docket of Notable Cases
 In 1991, the first President George Bush nominated Ms. Sotomayor to be a federal district judge in the Southern District of New York. But she was informally selected by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who shared her working-class and parochial school roots and who was convinced, former aides said, that Ms. Sotomayor would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.
 Leaving private practice for public service meant that she would never be as wealthy as many of her peers. Financial disclosure forms that Ms. Sotomayor filed in 2007 show that her primary asset is her Greenwich Village condo, which she bought in 1998 with the help of two mortgages totaling $324,000 from Chase Manhattan Bank. Her last reported savings account balance was between $50,000 and $100,000, and she held no stocks or other significant investments. In addition to her judicial salary, she earned small sums for teaching at the law schools at New York University and Columbia University. 
 But her confirmation, in August 1992, made her the first Hispanic federal judge in the state. She joined a federal district courthouse in New York City whose docket is rich with everything from so-called drug mule cases to white-collar crimes and securities litigation.
 She had several notable cases as a district judge on religious liberties. In 1993, she struck down as unconstitutional a White Plains law that prohibited the displaying of a menorah in a park. In 1994, she ordered New York prison officials to allow inmates to wear beads of the Santeria religion under their belts, even though prison officials said the beads were gang symbols. 
 Other notable cases included a 1995 ruling in which she ordered the government to make public a photocopy of a torn-up note found in the briefcase of a former White House counsel, Vincent Foster, who committed suicide. And in 1998, she ruled that homeless people working for the Grand Central Partnership, a business consortium, had to be paid the minimum wage. 
 But Judge Sotomayor's most celebrated case came in 1995, when she ended a prolonged baseball strike by ruling forcefully against the baseball team owners and in favor of the ballplayers, resulting in a quick resumption of play. For a brief period, she was widely celebrated, at least in those cities with major-league teams, as the savior of baseball. 
 In 1997, President Bill Clinton nominated her to become a judge on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York. In filling out her Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire, Judge Sotomayor seemed to evoke the same concerns for the real-world impact of rulings that Mr. Obama has said he is seeking.
 ''Judges must be extraordinarily sensitive to the impact of their decisions and function within, and respectful of, the Constitution,'' she wrote. She arrived at her hearing with a New York construction contractor, Peter White, whom she introduced as ''my fiance'' and who was photographed helping her on with her robe after she was sworn in as an appellate court judge. The relationship ended not long after that, roughly 10 years ago, according to a friend.
 It took the Senate more than a year to confirm her. Republicans delayed a vote, drawing an accusation from Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who is now the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, that they feared that Mr. Clinton would try to elevate her to the Supreme Court.
 But Alfonse M. D'Amato, then a Republican senator from New York, eventually helped push through a vote, and she was confirmed 67 to 29 in October 1998. Among those voting in her favor was Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who remains a leading Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
 Over the next decade, Judge Sotomayor would hear appeals in more than 3,000 cases, writing about 380 majority opinions. The Supreme Court reviewed five of those, reversing three and affirming two, although it rejected her reasoning while accepting the outcome in one of those it upheld. 
 A No-Nonsense Reputation
 She would develop a reputation for asking tough questions at oral arguments and for being sometimes brusque and curt with lawyers who were not prepared to answer them.
 The 2009 edition of the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which includes anonymous comments evaluating judges by lawyers who appear before them, presents a mixed portrait of Judge Sotomayor. Most of the unnamed lawyers interviewed said she had good legal ability and wrote good opinions. But several also spoke very negatively of her manner from the bench, saying she could be abusive of lawyers appearing before her and using words like ''bully,'' ''nasty'' and ''a terror.''
 But one former clerk defended her style. 
 ''Personality- and style-wise, she is a dynamo,'' said Lisa Zornberg, who clerked for her in 1997-98 and is now an assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York. Lawyers ''who come before her know she always shows up on her game'' and ''doesn't tolerate unpreparedness, nor should she.''
 Judge Sotomayor has had several rulings that indicate a generally more liberal judicial philosophy than a majority of justices on the current Supreme Court, leading some conservatives to label her a ''judicial activist.'' 
 In 2000, for example, she wrote an opinion that would have allowed a man to sue a government contractor he accused of violating his constitutional rights. In 2007, she wrote an opinion interpreting an environmental law in a way that would favor more stringent protections, even if it cost power plant owners more money. The Supreme Court reversed both decisions.
 The ruling by Judge Sotomayor that has attracted the most attention was a 2008 case upholding an affirmative action program at the New Haven Fire Department. A group of white firefighters sued because the city threw out the results of a test for promotions after few minority firefighters scored well on it. The Supreme Court is now reviewing that result.
 Several of Judge Sotomayor's appeals court clerks described her as a rigorous boss. Her clerks' offices surround her own office and are within earshot, and she calls out to them when she has questions. She sometimes asks for the full records of trial transcripts and motions for a case that was on appeal, something her experience as a district judge has made her more interested in than some other judges.
 Judge Sotomayor has also developed a reputation for treating her clerks as a family -- taking a strong interest in their personal lives and careers, attending their weddings, keeping framed pictures of her former clerks and later, their children, in her office, and keeping in touch with them as a friend and mentor. She has told friends that one of her greatest regrets is that she herself was never a law clerk.
 James R. Levine, a New York lawyer who clerked for Judge Sotomayor in 2001-2, recalled that during his interview with her as a law student, the first question she asked was about himself and his family, while every other judge with whom he interviewed had first asked about issues like the topic of his law review note. The interview would turn intellectually rigorous, he said, but first she wanted to get to know him as a person.
 Staying True to Her Roots
 She has also tried to stay down to earth, friends say. Melissa Murray, who worked for the judge from 2003-4 and is now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, recalled going to a Yankees game with Judge Sotomayor. The judge, a Yankees fan, bought tickets in the bleachers, which Ms. Murray said the judge preferred as a more ''authentic experience,'' and she appeared to be known to several in the crowd.
 ''We were on the way to the bleachers and people were, like, 'Judge! Judge!' '' Ms. Murray recalled. ''She is really well known in the South Bronx and kind of a role model in the community.''
 Ms. Rosa, the friend who also went from a low-income childhood to Princeton and law school, said that the experiences that someone like Judge Sotomayor accumulated in her rise from the housing projects of the Bronx to the threshold of the Supreme Court would leave a vivid understanding of how the world works.
 ''We came up in a period of time with a sense of conscience about social justice,'' Ms. Rosa said. ''It grounded us in a set of values that told us our lives could be about something more than ourselves and the size of our bank account. That is a lesson many of us carry.''
 In her 2001 speech, Judge Sotomayor reflected on how she applies that lesson.
 ''Each day on the bench I learn something new about the judicial process and about being a professional Latina woman in a world that sometimes looks at me with suspicion,'' she said.
 ''I can and do aspire to be greater than the sum total of my experiences but I accept my limitations,'' Judge Sotomayor added. ''I willingly accept that we who judge must not deny the differences resulting from experience and heritage, but attempt, as the Supreme Court suggests, continuously to judge when those opinions, sympathies and prejudices are appropriate.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 29, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A Woman in the News article on Wednesday about Judge Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, misstated, in some editions, the year in which she was confirmed as the first Hispanic judge on the federal bench in New York State. It was 1992, not 2002. The article also misspelled, in some editions, the given name of the former Republican senator from New York State who helped push through the October 1998 vote in which Judge Sotomayor was confirmed as a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York. He is Alfonse M. D'Amato, not Alphonse.

HEADLINE: The North Korea Puzzle: A Leadership Mystery Inside a Nuclear Enigma

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Eric Schmitt and Thom Shanker contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In dealing with North Korea, American officials are reduced to studying two-month-old photographs of its reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il, to calculate how long he is likely to live. The new administration's North Korea team includes a special emissary who works part time as an academic dean and a State Department official who has yet to be confirmed by Congress.
 And as President Obama tries to find a way to punish North Korea for its latest nuclear test and missile launchings, his senior aides acknowledge that every policy option employed by previous presidents over the past dozen years -- whether hard or soft, political or economic -- has been fruitless in stopping North Korea from building a nuclear weapon. 
 ''As much as they understood this was going to be an issue, they weren't ready for a nuclear test in May,'' Marcus Noland, an expert on North Korea at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said of Mr. Obama and his advisers. ''They're in a situation now where they have to contain and manage a crisis.''
 That crisis, officials and independent experts said, is all the more treacherous because of the deep political uncertainty in North Korea. American officials say they believe that Mr. Kim, in rapidly declining health, is maneuvering to make his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, his successor, perhaps after a period in which his brother-in-law, Jang Seong-taek, would serve as a regent.
 The nuclear test and the test-firing of six short-range missiles, the American officials said, must be understood within the context of this internal struggle to extend the Kim dynasty's rule for another generation.
 But they warn that the information coming out of North Korea is frustratingly vague and inconclusive. Mr. Kim, officials noted, skipped a recent meeting with Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov. Chatter about the health of Mr. Kim has spiked in Beijing and in Seoul, where North Korea-watching is an obsession.
 Even a recent official photo of Mr. Kim, which shows him alive but feeble, is open to conflicting interpretations, an official said: it may be that North Korea wants to show that he is still in control, or it may be that it is signaling that the end is near and appealing for help in a perilous transition.
 ''People who tell you they know what's going on there don't know,'' said one official, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak publicly. ''What's undeniable is that there are substantial challenges to all the previous approaches to North Korea.''
 Of the options still on the table, the measures that the Obama administration seems most drawn to would constrain the North Korean government's access to funds. These steps, which would be carried out by the Treasury Department either openly or covertly, would be directed at banks in Europe and the Middle East that are used by the Kim family, officials said.
 The administration may also raise its pressure on China and South Korea to cut off investments in North Korea -- a delicate task, given Beijing's reluctance to appear to bow to American influence.
 Finally, the United States and South Korea could start boarding ships traveling to and from North Korea that they suspect are carrying nuclear technology. But American officials said they were wary of doing that because of the risk of a military confrontation.
 The United States, experts say, has little choice but to continue negotiating with North Korea through the six-nation process, which also includes South Korea, China, Russia and Japan. The Obama administration may have to dispense with the usual bag of carrots and sticks, however.
 ''The North Korean leadership cares about internal matters, not external matters,'' said Wendy R. Sherman, who coordinated North Korea policy in the Clinton administration. ''They care about external matters only insofar as it helps ensure the survival of the regime.''
 Under those circumstances, she said, North Korea is not likely to be receptive to incentives. And it may have concluded that having nuclear weapons is a necessity for its own preservation. The detention of two American television journalists by North Korea injects another combustible element. The two journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, were arrested in March and charged with illegally entering the country with ''hostile'' intent. Their trial, set for June 4, ''is a risk but also a possibility,'' depending on how the North handles the case, Ms. Sherman said.
 All of this adds up to a formidable diplomatic challenge for the Obama administration, at a time when its energies are being consumed by Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran. North Korea lacks the high-powered attention that those countries are receiving.
 The special representative for North Korea policy, Stephen W. Bosworth, is a well-regarded diplomat and a former ambassador to South Korea. But he divides his time between this assignment and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, where he is dean. 
 Kurt M. Campbell, an Asia security expert nominated to become the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, is likely to play a significant role. But he has not yet been confirmed.
 The State Department spokesman, Ian C. Kelly, said Mr. Bosworth took part in meetings on North Korea by phone from New York on Monday and was in Washington on Tuesday. ''Ambassador Bosworth is fully engaged, full-time engaged,'' he said.
 Among the other influential players on North Korea policy, officials said, are James B. Steinberg, deputy secretary of state, and Jeffrey A. Bader, senior director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council. Mr. Steinberg will attend a regional security conference in Singapore this week, where he will accompany Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates to meetings with defense ministers from Japan and South Korea, the Pentagon said.
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first senior American official to speak openly about how a succession struggle would complicate dealings with North Korea, has worked the phones over the past three days.
 But, officials said, it is ultimately Mr. Obama, a young president at the dawn of his administration, who will have to decide how to deal with Mr. Kim, an aging leader at the twilight of his.

HEADLINE: Antitrust Laws Loom as Hurdle in Obama Effort to Overhaul Health Care

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's campaign to cut health costs by $2 trillion over the next decade, announced with fanfare two weeks ago, may have hit another snag: the nation's antitrust laws.
 Antitrust lawyers say doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and drug makers will be running huge legal risks if they get together and agree on a strategy to hold down prices and reduce the growth of health spending.
 Robert F. Leibenluft, a former official at the Federal Trade Commission, said, ''Any agreement among competitors with regard to prices or price increases -- even if they set a maximum -- would raise legal concerns.'' 
 Already, some leaders of the health care industry who appeared at the White House on May 11 say the president may have overstated their cost-control commitment. Three days after the gathering, hospital executives said that they had agreed to help save $2 trillion by gradually slowing the growth of health spending, but that they did not commit to cutting the growth rate by 1.5 percentage points each year for 10 years.
 White House officials say even the more limited commitment is significant. Under current law, federal officials predict that health spending will grow an average of 6.2 percent a year, to $4.4 trillion in 2018.
 Mr. Obama is asking the industry for detailed proposals to control costs. But so far the administration has not offered the industry any relief from antitrust laws and has, in fact, vowed to step up enforcement. 
 As a presidential candidate, Mr. Obama said consumers had suffered because of ''lax enforcement'' of antitrust laws in many health insurance markets.
 In 1993, when President Bill Clinton made the last major effort to overhaul the health care system, the lobby for the drug industry, then known as the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, devised a voluntary cost-control plan. Under it, each drug company offered to limit the annual increase in the average price of its prescription drug products to the increase in the Consumer Price Index.
 The Justice Department rejected the proposal, saying it would violate antitrust laws. In blocking the proposal, the department said the Supreme Court had made clear that agreements setting maximum prices were just as illegal as agreements that set minimum ones. 
 ''Such maximum price-fixing agreements create the risk that the maximum prices will become minimum or uniform prices,'' the department said in a business review letter signed Oct. 1, 1993, by Anne K. Bingaman, then the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division.
 In 1978, hospitals also asked the Justice Department for an assurance they would not be charged with antitrust violations when they undertook a ''voluntary effort'' to curb costs as an alternative to legislation proposed by President Jimmy Carter. The department would not provide such an assurance.
 Many savings now envisioned by the health care industry would require much closer cooperation by independent doctors and hospitals, taking them into a gray area of the law where federal agencies have not provided clear guidance.
 In a recent letter to the Senate Finance Committee, the American Hospital Association said uncertainty about enforcement of the antitrust laws ''makes it difficult for a hospital and doctors to collaborate to improve care'' and lower costs.
 Doctors often want to collaborate and share information about prices without sharing financial risk or fully merging their office practices. The American Medical Association has asked Congress to revise antitrust laws so doctors can collectively negotiate with insurers over fees and other issues.
 The Federal Trade Commission has repeatedly challenged such collective action as illegal price-fixing, even though doctors say they are at a severe disadvantage in trying to negotiate with giant insurance companies.
 A new study by an economist at Northwestern University, Leemore S. Dafny, finds that a growing number of geographic markets are dominated by a handful of insurance companies, and that the decline in competition may contribute to higher prices.
 Among the groups that say they have joined together to rein in health costs, besides the hospital and medical associations, are America's Health Insurance Plans and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
 Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy group, said he was wary of such joint efforts.
 ''When companies that control the health care system get together to change it, there is a serious risk that they are doing it to stifle competition at the expense of consumers,'' Mr. Court said.
 The Federal Trade Commission says that while cooperation among health care providers can benefit consumers, it can also increase the bargaining power of hospitals and doctors, making it easier for them to set prices and eliminate competition.

HEADLINE: U.S. Home Sales Rise, but Supply Soars

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
A glut of unsold homes continued to grow last month, fed by a new wave of foreclosures, even though sales of existing homes rose, a national real estate trade association said Wednesday.
 The National Association of Realtors reported that the inventory of unsold houses, townhouses and condominiums rose to 3.97 million in April, the highest level since November. At the current rate of sales, it would take 10.2 months to exhaust those unsold properties.
 ''We've got all this looming inventory out there, and the likelihood that whatever gains we see in sales are going to be pretty anemic,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR. ''If you look at the broad middle of the market, price adjustment has a long way to go because of this whole inventory issue.'' 
 Housing experts said more homes would come on the market as the job market deteriorated, threatening previously secure homeowners. 
 An additional 313,000 homes entered foreclosure in the first two months of 2009, according to First American CoreLogic, a real estate analysis firm. More are expected as one-time delays to foreclosures end, and lenders resume proceedings against delinquent homeowners. 
 Although home builders are starting few new projects, the supply of houses is still overwhelming the market. The Realtors' association said inventories grew last month even though sales of previously owned homes picked up as buyers went looking for bargains and lower-priced properties.
 The median home price nationwide climbed slightly, to $170,200 in April from $169,900 in March, the group reported. Prices, however, were down from $201,300 in April a year ago.
 Across the country, existing home sales rose 2.9 percent in April from a month earlier but were down 3.5 percent from a year ago, the National Association of Realtors reported. Sales rose 11.6 percent in the Northeast and were up modestly in the South and the West.
 As sales in some markets pick up, home prices are still dragging on the bottom. 
 Prices of single-family homes fell as fast as ever in March, according to figures released Tuesday by the closely watched Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index. Home values in 20 major metropolitan areas fell 18.7 percent from a year earlier, an almost identical drop to that of the previous month.
 Patrick Newport, United States economist at IHS Global Insight, said prices needed to fall even farther to work off excess supplies.
 ''That will bring more people into the market who will start buying homes,'' he said. ''Eventually that will get rid of the inventory.'' 
 To some degree, the same factors dragging down home prices are the ones that have revived sales in some regions. 
 Activity has picked up in some hard-hit markets where the foreclosure crisis is the most acute and housing prices have fallen the most. In places like Florida, Arizona and parts of Southern California, potential buyers are getting back into the housing market, enticed by low prices and some of the lowest mortgage rates in years.
 The agents' association estimated that about 45 percent of all sales in April were foreclosures, and brokers in distressed markets are bracing for more.
 ''Inventory numbers here are getting worse, not better,'' said Mike Morgan, a real-estate agent in Florida who writes about the housing market. ''We have more homes than we have people to live in them.''

COSTCO PLANS TRIAL 
 Of Food Stamps
 Citing the recession, Costco has announced that it will begin accepting food stamps in its two New York City stores -- one in Astoria, Queens, and the other in Sunset Park, Brooklyn -- on a trial basis, starting next month. 
 If the experimental program shows there is sufficient demand by food stamp users, and if it does not harm efficiency, the company said, it will begin accepting food stamps at all of its New York City stores, including one planned for East Harlem. 
 Costco was criticized recently for being one of the few large food retailers that refused to accept food stamps. Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and Wal-Mart all accept them.
 Costco said in a statement that it was not planning to roll out the food stamp program beyond the city. The two New York stores were selected for the trial because of the high numbers of food stamp recipients in the surrounding areas, the company said.
 The chief executive of Costco, James D. Sinegal, said in a statement that the company was taking the step to try to ''be a part of the solution to the financial burden that many people are facing today.''
 Eric N. Gioia, a Queens city councilman whose district includes the Astoria Costco, which is within walking distance of several large housing projects, has made a campaign of asking the company to change its policy. And in East Harlem, members of the local community board had also pressed the issue.
 Last week, William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller and a mayoral candidate, raised the food stamp issue, asserting that it was in Costco's interest to accept food stamps given the economic climate. (The city currently holds about $66 million in Costco stock through its various pension funds, which Mr. Thompson oversees.)
 City officials welcomed Costco's announcement. 
 ''By accepting food stamps, Costco will allow more New Yorkers than ever to have access to fresh, healthy foods at wholesale prices -- and it will be good for Costco's bottom line,'' Mr. Gioia said. He first learned that Costco did not accept food stamps in 2007 when he tried a one-week food-stamp-allowance diet.
 Mr. Thompson said in a statement: ''Costco's new policy will be a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Having more options and being able to buy in bulk will allow financially strapped families to stretch their dollars further.''
 Betsy Gotbaum, the city's public advocate, who has also pressed the company on food stamps, said in a statement, ''With today's news, I'm hopeful that Costco has recognized both the severity of this economic crisis, and the potential to expand its customer base.''
 The food stamps cannot be used toward the Costco membership fee.
 On Wednesday, the state attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, said that regardless of the outcome of the pilot program, the East Harlem store should accept food stamps because it had received tax subsidies and financing as part of a community development program in Harlem.
 In an interview, Mr. Cuomo said, ''I believe that legally they have an obligation to accept them in this store because of the benefits they received.'' JENNIFER 8. LEE

HEADLINE: Summer Break? I'm Working on It

BYLINE: By MANDY KATZ

 BODY:
KRISTEN BARNETT, a high school sophomore in Sherborn, Mass., hoped to multitask this summer, combining outdoor adventure and Spanish-language practice with meeting her school's community service requirement. A volunteer tour to Costa Rica run by Global Works Travel fit the bill perfectly. But the price -- more than $4,500 -- did not. ''We're more nervous than we have been in the past'' about finances, said Leslie Barnett, Kristen's mother, who owns a small business and whose husband works in software. 
 The solution? Kristen will cover half the fee with baby-sitting, refereeing youth soccer and cash from her grandmother, while her parents will stint on upkeep. ''Our house needs to be painted, our driveway should be paved, and the cars need work,'' Ms. Barnett said. ''We are really stretching to make this work.'' 
 A tight job market and recession budgeting may fall hardest on high school students who depend on summer job income. But now they pose a challenge even for affluent teenagers, as families that might once have readily paid for service-travel, precollege courses or sleep-away camps reconsider their options. 
 Still, even as consumers cut back on everything from taxis to Tiffany, families like the Barnetts are scraping together steep fees to keep their children challenged this summer. At a time when the overall travel industry is in a slump, operators of camps, and educational and volunteer travel programs say they are surprised at the sustained interest. As for parents, many tend to echo the programs' marketers and describe them in terms like ''investment'' and ''value.''
 Programs with price tags of $1,000 to $2,000 or more a week are proving relatively recession-proof. Applications for precollege programs at Boston University, Amherst, Carnegie Mellon and other institutions are near or above last year's levels, directors say; some -- like Brown University's -- are expanding.
 Service programs like Global Works, with trips ranging from 20 days in Nicaragua for $3,195, to a 27-day French home stay for $6,195, report interest only slightly below last year's. Global Leadership Adventures, which runs tours to Africa, Asia and Latin America, has enrolled 50 percent more students this year than last, and B'nai B'rith Youth Organization is filling seats on its Israel tours. The American Camp Association, with 2,800 member camps, predicts that, after a late start to the enrollment season, bunks will be nearly full. 
 The difference in 2009, program operators say, is that parents are deliberating longer and seeking discounts. They are also picking shorter, cheaper versions of programs. To offset the costs, many parents are also asking children to contribute and cutting back their own vacations. 
 ''When you have a 16-year-old and he's excited about doing something, you encourage it,'' said Jill D., a lawyer in New York who asked that her surname not be published. She and her husband have canceled a family trip and their own summer vacation to free up $5,000 for their son's Caribbean scuba program. 
 Some companies find their strongest draws are cheaper offerings. Global Leadership offered just one short itinerary in 2008, to Guatemala. But most of its expanded enrollment this year is in programs lasting two weeks or less, costing about $4,000 total, said Andrew Motiwalla, executive director. 
 Scholarship availability influences would-be participants in the precollege program at Boston University, where teenagers study everything from filmmaking to engineering. Applications have risen for six-week programs, said Alexandra Adams, the assistant director. Requests for tuition assistance are also up substantially, spurring a 15 percent increase in allocations. 
 Some travel programs also offer subsidies. Global Works gives occasional $1,000 discounts as well as a few full-tuition grants, and increased such outlays by 30 percent this year, said Craig Fahey, an owner and director. The company also pushed back its March 1 deadline for nonrefundable deposits by a month. ''We have a lot more questions about payment plans'' from parents this year, Mr. Fahey added. 
 Natalie Lupowitz, a teacher from Oceanside, N.Y., and her husband, Howard, used a payment plan for a final year at Camp Scatico in Elizaville, N.Y., for their 14-year-old son, Lewis. As his contribution, Lewis has been working with his father at flea markets on weekends, saving the family the $120-a-day cost of an outside employee. ''We all have to pitch in,'' his mother said. ''I think it makes camp all that much more worthwhile. He will remember, 'I went and I earned it.' '' 
 Allison Connors, a bank executive in Amherst, N.Y., is also relying on teenage sweat equity. Her daughter, Maddie, planned on a Spanish-immersion summer, but a six-week $8,000 trip exceeded the family's budget. Working with a consultant, the Connors picked a two-week volunteer trip to Fiji that, with air fare, is about $2,500. (Ms. Connors said the $1,100 she paid the consultant, Everything Summer, helped her ''know the full range of high-end program options.'') To help pay for it, Maddie will work the rest of the summer marketing her family's fledgling online business. And the Spanish immersion? ''Instead of doing it in Spain, you can do it in Buffalo,'' at a Hispanic community center, Maddie's mother suggested. 
 For students whose budgets exclude fee-based options, finding jobs and internships is a challenge. Even volunteer positions can require students to pound the pavement, cautioned Nancy Lublin, chief executive of DoSomething.org, which matches young people with grants and service opportunities. Perhaps competition is up from students unable to pay for camp or find work, she theorized. At Do Something's New York offices, internship interest is so strong, they may be sitting two to a desk this summer. 
 Paying work is becoming even tougher to find, as under-employed adults are now ''applying for jobs they've never been interested in,'' like summertime restaurant positions, said Austin Lavin, a founder of MyFirstPaycheck.com, which offers job advice and entry-level listings. Still, he said, with luck and preparation, some students will find work.
 Better yet to have experience, like Max Craft, 16, of Bethesda, Md. Max and his parents, a substitute teacher and a State Department economist, had thought this might be his year to splurge on a community service tour, said his mother, Karen Craft. 
 ''And then the economy tanked,'' Ms. Craft said.
 So, when the garden store where Max worked last year asked him back at $7.25 an hour, ''I said, 'Honey, investment bankers are going to be applying for those jobs,' '' Ms. Craft recalled. Exaggeration notwithstanding, Max took the position. 
 ''Look, summers are still a little bit for resting and recharging,'' said Deena Maerowitz, a college-admissions consultant in Brooklyn. ''There's a lot of pressure that they have to have the singular, most amazing experience to put on their resume.'' But admissions officers tell her, ''It doesn't matter to us if you climbed Mount Everest or if you started your own nonprofit or if you worked in a retail store. What's important to us is what you got out of your experience.''

HEADLINE: Appliance Anxiety: Replace It Or Fix It?

BYLINE: By JULIE SCELFO

 BODY:
APPLIANCES -- big, sturdy labor savers -- seem like they should last forever. But according to data from Consumer Reports, at least a fifth of gas ranges, dishwashers and washing machines sold between 2003 and 2006 broke within three years. And pity the purchasers of side-by-side refrigerators with ice machines and dispensers: after three years, 37 percent of them needed service.
 With 20.96 million major appliances shipped to retailers in the United States in just the first four months of this year, that's a lot of broken products in America's future. 
 Retailers and service technicians have long advised that it often makes sense to buy a new product rather than repair a broken one. They use the 50 percent rule: if a repair would cost half or more of what it costs to buy a new product, the product should be replaced. A new product is also likely to be more energy efficient. 
 But with the country deep in a recession, repairmen say many consumers are rejecting this suggestion and, like their forebears during the Depression, trying to spend as little as possible.
 Recently, Sibylla Waters, 46, a homemaker in Odenton, Md., who has two children living at home, hired Landers Appliance in Baltimore to repair a plastic detergent dispenser on her Roper dishwasher for $179, even though the machine is seven years old and could be replaced for about $400. Since buying her home in 2005, she and her husband, James, who works as a computer technician for the state, have repaired a washer, a dryer and a water heater. Why not keep this machine running, Mrs. Waters asks, ''especially if it will most likely last a few more years or so?'' Besides, the couple already gave in once and bought a new dryer in February when repairing it seemed impossible. ''They came out three different times and always had the wrong parts so I finally got fed up with it,'' she said.
 Kathryn Harvey, 53, a mother of four who works as a toll collector on the New Jersey Turnpike, said that she bought a Maytag washing machine five years ago that recently began ''screeching.'' Although the repair, at $239 plus tax, is only about $150 less than a new machine, Ms. Harvey says every penny counts, particularly since her husband, a truck driver, had his workweek cut by one day. ''I have two sons in college already and my 18-year-old twins are going to college,'' she said. ''If I can milk the washing machine to make it work a little longer, talk to it and make it happy, that's what I'm going to do. I need every cent.''
 But getting anything repaired can be frustrating. To stay profitable, service companies book multiple appointments on the same day, forcing consumers to sit home and wait for hours. And because it would be impossible for technicians to drive around with every possible replacement part, some repairs require a follow-up visit that can be subject to the same inconveniences.
 Frustrated consumers have created Web sites to vent. Paul Makulski, a 55-year-old accountant in Waterloo, Ontario, started such a site after trying to get Electrolux to fix the handle on his Frigidaire over-the-range microwave after he had already paid to repair it twice. ''I phoned Electrolux, which wasn't easy, because their voice asks you to phone a different number, then that number tells you to phone a different number,'' he wrote in the site's inaugural complaint. ''Then the person who answers the phone says to call back because everybody who knows anything is on lunch.'' Mr. Makulski was eventually told in an e-mail message, also posted, that the defect might be due to mounting the over-the-range microwave ''over a gas range.''
 Typically manufacturers outsource warranty service to another company, which subcontracts the actual work to a third party. So after contacting the manufacturer, consumers frequently find themselves calling yet another number, and then later, after the service call has been arranged, communicating with a third party -- who inevitably seems to have a different idea about when the work will be done and what the warranty covers.
 Appliance-repair rage has also driven at least one person, a 42-year-old woman in northern England who says she endured six months of rescheduled appointments and other delays, to hold a repairman hostage until he fixed her washing machine. ''I am not proud of what I did,'' Tracey Fox told The Daily Telegraph in January, ''but it was the only way I was going to get something done.'' 
 After the nightmare comes the bill. Manufacturers intentionally charge a lot for replacement parts as a way of encouraging consumers to buy more products, said Ronald Sawyer, an appliance servicer in Cohoes, N.Y., and a founding member and executive director of the Professional Service Association, an appliance repair industry group. 
 ''When manufacturers came up with a machine that retails for $400, that price covers all parts,'' he said. ''But when it breaks down and you needed a new timer, the timer alone could cost $250. Manufacturers create the technology when they design new machines, they control the manufacturing process, they make the replacement parts, so we're at the mercy of the manufacturers.''
 LG Electronics was the only one of the five biggest manufacturers to acknowledge that replacement parts can be costly. (General Electric, Electrolux and Samsung all sidestepped the question. Whirlpool said it could not respond by press time.) John I. Taylor, a vice president at LG Electronics USA, said the reason parts can cost half or more of the price of the appliance is that ''there are thousands of specialized parts for appliance products -- maintaining inventories of replacement parts that may or may not get used can be costly.''
 The complexity of warranties makes matters worse. Years ago, most manufacturers gave warranties of at least two years. Now, warranties on most midrange appliances are just one year, say retailers and service providers. (Boutique companies like Sub-Zero and Miele typically provide coverage for longer periods.)
 The best way to avoid the hassle of repair, according to numerous repairmen and Consumer Reports, is to buy the simplest possible appliance. ''The more doo-dads, the more stuff you add to an appliance, the more likely it's going to need a repair,'' said Mark Kotkin of Consumer Reports National Research Center. Consumers would also be wise to recognize that the more sophisticated the equipment they buy, the more complicated -- and expensive -- the repairs can be. 
 Still, few products will last as long as those made during the 1960s and 1970s. ''The old Maytag washer your grandmother had, she bought that thing and used it for 35, 40 years,'' Mr. Sawyer said. ''It held up like nothing was ever going to go wrong with it. Today, you just don't get that quality.''

HEADLINE: At Circus Job Fair, No Thrill Seekers Needed

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER

 BODY:
A job fair for Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus may conjure visions of strapping gymnasts in spandex, carnival barkers and more clowns than you can fit in a small car. But the 150 positions being offered at KeySpan Park in Coney Island on Wednesday were for far less fanciful jobs. 
 Ringling Brothers is preparing for its first extended show -- the Coney Island Boom-a-Ring! -- in a Brooklyn neighborhood best known as a seaside amusement attraction. But Coney Island is also a historically poor area with a high unemployment rate.
 In a light drizzle, more than 500 people, many from the surrounding housing projects, waited for hours for an interview. They crossed their fingers for the chance at less than three months' work as ticket takers, ushers and custodians, starting at minimum wage.
 ''I thought there would be more people,'' said Rafael Fernandez, 35, who lives nearby. ''Coney Island is hurting a lot. I know a lot of people looking for work right now.''
 Pam Harris, the executive director of Coney Island Generation Gap, a youth-focused nonprofit group, sent volunteers into the community to knock on doors and pass out fliers advising residents of the circus job opportunities.
 ''The economic downturn here has hit us really hard,'' she said.
 The group that showed up was a mix of college graduates, high school students, recently laid-off professionals and many who have been looking for work longer than they cared to admit. Most said they were ready to sign up for any employment, even if it was temporary. The circus, which will feature 12 shows a week, runs from June 18 through Sept. 7.
 ''I apply everywhere,'' said Sean Jones, 34, who had traveled for several hours to apply. ''They say 'we're not hiring,' or 'come back in a couple of months,' or I put the application in and never hear from them again.''
 ''A lot of jobs don't hire teens,'' said Catherine Clark, 16, cradling her son, Paris. ''But I'm not like everybody else. I'm mature, plus I have a child. I need a job.''
 Lynn B. Kelly, president of the Coney Island Development Corporation, which is leading the redevelopment of much of the area and helped organize the event, said that turnout at the job fair had exceeded expectations.
 ''It may be a function of the market,'' Ms. Kelly said. ''Or it may be that, how often in life do you get a chance to say you've worked at the circus?''

HEADLINE: A 'Safe Haven' Looks Less Secure

BYLINE: By DWIGHT CASS and RICHARD BEALES

 BODY:
With a flight to quality last year pushing up Treasury bond prices and risky loans looking like losses waiting to happen, banks plowed money into government bonds. And until about mid-May, when prices of 10-year securities topped 100 cents on the dollar, that looked like a good bet. 
 Now, however, this safe haven does not look so secure. A rebound in risk appetite and worries about America's credit rating have drained some air from the Treasury market bubble. A 10-year bond now fetches only a little over 95 cents on the dollar. 
 That may not seem like much of a drop, but if you think of banks leveraging up their positions, it could result in some nasty losses. How much so? American depository institutions hold some $581 billion in various types of government obligations on reserve with the central bank, according to Federal Reserve statistics.
 Of course, the cost of financing these positions has also plummeted. The London interbank offered rate for three-month dollar borrowings is now a mere two-thirds of a percentage point. And a steeper yield curve is a boon for banks looking to earn their way out of trouble through fat net interest margins. 
 But one could argue that Libor is being artificially depressed as a result of intervention by the United States government to prop up bank credit. If the government were to withdraw those measures -- say, by pulling its borrowing guarantees, its liberal discount window collateral requirements or other programs -- Libor could easily rise to a level appropriate for the industry's average single-A to double-A credit. That was over 5 percent in 2006, for example.
 Should that happen, and if longer rates were also to struggle higher, banks would run the risk of losing money on their hordes of Treasuries, just when their plummeting prices make them hardest to unload. If so, this port in the storm could turn out to be quite choppy.
 Seeking Simple Rules
 The government's plan to get bad assets off bank balance sheets always carried the risk that banks could game it. But the Public Private Investment Program won't work if Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation set overly complicated rules, whether on avoiding bank conflicts or in any other part of the plan. So they need to settle for simplicity -- which means imperfection.
 The Treasury's plan involves the government subsidizing buyers of banks' bad assets by offering cheap nonrecourse leverage. The idea is to give investors a chance to make money and to get illiquid markets moving and help increase asset prices toward the levels that banks are holding them, thereby minimizing further losses if they offload them.
 It is clear banks should not be buyers and sellers of the same assets. That would make it too easy to artificially inflate asset values and transfer remaining losses to American taxpayers. But industry groups are lobbying for banks to be allowed to participate, in a general sense, as buyers under the program as well as sellers.
 Yet having banks buy each other's bad assets runs the risk of a similar artificial result. After all, a ''you buy mine and I'll buy yours'' attitude among banks helped sustain the structuring and sale of questionable securitized products for longer than might otherwise have occurred.
 But banning banks that could be sellers from participating as buyers sounds both impractical and potentially damaging to the program. That is because banks are significant participants in all kinds of markets through their in-house investment desks and asset management affiliates, and excluding all their tentacles would reduce investor interest as well as being a logistical nightmare.
 The answer could be some simple rules, bearing in mind that most investors in the Public Private Investment Program are expected to be pooled together in funds run by asset managers.
 Banks could (and should) be banned from having any material interest in any pool buying their own assets. They could be restricted to a modest (say 10 percent) interest in any pool buying assets from other banks.
 There may be other options. But whatever solution the Treasury and the F.D.I.C. devises needs to be straightforward. Some gaming of the system could still occur, and taxpayer-supported banks could make money out of program, too. 
 That might be galling to some, but it could be the price of the program's success. After all, as the American Bankers Association, led by Edward L. Yingling, noted in a comment letter to the F.D.I.C., it would be somewhat odd ''to hamper a program designed to benefit banks because of a concern that banks would benefit.''

Broadway musicals and plays had total gross receipts of about $943.3 million during the 2008-9 theater season, a slight increase from the previous season and a record for total grosses, according to data released this week by the Broadway League, the trade association of theater owners and producers. Those numbers reflect the enduring appeal of entertainment as a form of escape in the midst of a recession, some producers said on Wednesday.
 ''We're thrilled,'' said Philip J. Smith, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns 17 Broadway theaters. ''It's a combination of a lot of things, including some very fine plays that were well received by the critical community. Historically, in times of economic hardship and war, people find the theater is always a great means of escape. Whenever everyone else is hurting, things are on the upbeat in theater, like the movies. Entertainment is an escape.'' 
 The increase in grosses was small, though. The previous record for grosses was set during the 2006-7 theater season, which had total grosses of $938.5 million. Broadway shows grossed $937.5 million in 2007-8. That season, however, was affected by the stagehands' strike, which lasted 19 days and closed many shows. (The average admission cost that season was $76.43; this season it was $77.66, according to calculations by the Broadway League.) 
 Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, said that while the numbers did not represent a big upswing, the analysis of Broadway was different from that of other industries. He agreed with Mr. Smith that in bad times, people turn to entertainment 
 ''The theater does not grow by leaps and bounds; it's incremental,'' Mr. Gersten said. ''The number of theaters in play is finite. At the end of the year, the closings made people gloomy, but surprisingly a new crop sprang up. 
 '''I think everybody has been surprised by how well the theater's done,'' Mr. Gersten continued. ''The prevalent thing, it seems to me: if life in New York has shrunk and tourists are not coming, the theater should have contracted. But the theater didn't contract, it has perked up.''
 Last summer and fall, a few producers prepared for the recession by postponing or canceling planned Broadway shows, and a few other producers closed musicals, including ''Spring Awakening'' and the long-running ''Hairspray.'' Some cited a lack of capital from investors; others expressed concern that audiences might stay away because of the economy.
 Many producers offered substantial discounts to plays and musicals to offset a decline in attendance because of the recession. 
 The Broadway League used approximations for the end-of-year grosses -- the most recent season began May 26, 2008, and ended May 24, 2009. The league factored in the estimates of grosses for the now-shuttered musical ''Young Frankenstein,'' which chose not to release its weekly box-office data.
 Paid attendance was down by 1 percent this year over last year. Attendance for both years was roughly 12 million, with a loss of between 10,000 and 30,000 people this season compared with last season. The 2006- 7 season set a record for attendance, with 12.31 million people. The 2008-9 season was the third highest. 
 James B. Freydberg, who has been producing on Broadway since the early 1980s, said looking at attendance figures for commercial shows might provide a better analysis of Broadway's health than grosses. Tickets prices have increased so much since the early 1980s that comparisons are difficult, he said. The Broadway League has been collecting data since 1957. 
 ''I agree that it was an amazingly good season considering what is happening in the economy,'' Mr. Freydberg said. ''But the prices are quite different, so I don't think you can make a comparison in gross sales. In attendance, it's also quite different from the early '80s because we now have between 8 and 12 productions a year on Broadway from the three nonprofit theaters -- Roundabout, Lincoln Center and the Manhattan Theater Club.''
 Although ticket prices have gone up substantially over the years and more nonprofit theaters are mounting Broadway productions, even a $6 million increase in grosses is a reason to rejoice, said Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the Roundabout Theater. 
 ''It seems to me the fact that it's up even a little bit is a triumph for the industry, considering that everything else in the economy is down,'' Mr. Haimes said. ''What is significant is that the retail economy is going down and we have remained stable in a terrible recession. I find it extremely encouraging.''
 Last season, the Roundabout had 42,000 subscribers, a little more than the season before, and renewals for the next season are on target, Mr. Haimes said. 
 This season, 43 shows opened on Broadway, according to the Broadway League report. They included 10 new musicals, 8 new plays, 4 musical revivals and 5 special performances, the highest number of shows since the 1982-83 season, when 50 productions opened.
 Charlotte St. Martin, executive director of the Broadway League, said the numbers are a cause of celebration given the economic climate.

HEADLINE: More Small Banks Ailing As Recession Toll Mounts

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Despite signs that the nation's biggest banks are stabilizing, more small and midsize institutions are coming under stress as the recession continues. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said Wednesday that the number of banks on its list of ''problem'' institutions had grown to 305 in the first quarter, the most since 1994, and up from 252 at the end of 2008. From January through March, 21 small or medium-sized banks failed, and 15 more have gone in the second quarter. 
 The findings underline the toll the credit crisis continues to take on the nation's smaller banks, which are weighed down by souring commercial real estate loans and mounting losses. 
 ''The first quarter results are telling us that the banking industry still faces tremendous challenges, and that going forward, asset quality remains a major concern,'' said Sheila C. Bair, the F.D.I.C. chairwoman.
 By contrast, the nation's biggest banks, especially the 19 that recently underwent stress tests by federal regulators, appear to be gaining momentum after most returned to profitability in the first quarter. Many that were virtually insolvent early in the year are finding it increasingly easy to raise capital, and are rushing to strengthen their financial positions now in the event that the economy worsens. 
 On Wednesday, Bank of America, deemed among the weakest of the big banks, said it had raised $26 billion in capital, or 76 percent of the $33.9 billion in common equity the government told it to raise as a result of its stress test. PNC Financial, a large regional lender based in Pittsburgh, said Wednesday that it had raised more than $600 million by issuing common stock to meet the regulators' demands.
 Combined with a two and a half month rise in financial shares, the ability of large banks to raise money is a sign that confidence has returned, at least for now, in the giants of the financial industry. Only a few months ago, their existence as independent institutions seemed to be in question. 
 Now, the ease of raising money calls into question how urgently another move planned by the government to improve the health of the banking industry -- a program to purge toxic assets from bank books -- is needed, Ms. Bair said Wednesday. If banks can raise capital without taxpayer backing, that could allow them to keep such assets until the value rebounded with an improving economy. 
 Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said investors were treating the 19 biggest banks differently from smaller institutions because the large ones are considered too big to fail.
 ''There has been a ring fence drawn around the 19 banks,'' Mr. Cassidy said. By contrast, BankUnited of Florida, a big regional bank that was not part of the stress tests, was allowed to go under last week.
 Banks may still be tested, however. Economists worry that rising unemployment and difficult business conditions will mean a worsening of the loans on banks' books, especially among medium and small banks, which are particularly exposed to commercial real estate loans made in their regions.
 Also, more American homeowners who once had solid credit are falling behind on their mortgage payments, raising the prospect of an additional wave of foreclosures that could exacerbate bank losses and add pressure to the financial system and the broader economy. 
 Banks are bracing for worse losses on credit cards. On Wednesday, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said this business could lose 9 percent in the second quarter and bleed money for the rest of the year. Card losses from Washington Mutual, the Seattle-based savings and loan that JPMorgan bought last year, were expected to rise especially sharply.
 Banks charged off $37.8 billion in bad loans in the first quarter, the F.D.I.C. said, almost twice the $19.6 billion in the same quarter a year earlier, a sign of further deterioration in the quality of assets on their books. The amount of loans and leases that were not fully paid off rose by $59.2 billion in the quarter, and were $154.3 billion higher than last year, the agency said. 
 And while better trading revenues at big banks helped the industry turn a first-quarter profit of $7.6 billion, compared with a loss of $36.9 billion in the fourth quarter, banks and savings and loans set aside $60.9 billion in the first quarter to cover potential losses, an increase from $36.2 billion a year earlier. 
 A rising number of bank failures could shrink the amount of insurance for deposits in the F.D.I.C. fund. One widely watched measure of this ratio fell to 0.27 percent in the first three months of the year from 0.36 in the fourth quarter. Last week, the F.D.I.C. sought to replenish the fund by levying an emergency fee on banks proportionate to the size of their assets, a move that big banks complained would favor smaller banks. 
 Stuart Plesser, a banking analyst at Standard & Poor's in New York, said smaller banks were more vulnerable to a souring economy than larger institutions because they were more specialized or focused on a particular region. 
 But the repercussions of the failures among the smaller institutions were not as severe for the overall economy as they would be if a larger bank stumbled, he said. ''The big banks are more important to the economy,'' Mr. Plesser said. ''It's not as big a hit if the small fail.''

HEADLINE: Talk of 'Underlying Conditions' May Add to Flu Worries

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS; Reporting was contributed by Jack Begg, David W. Chen, Ann Farmer, Donald G. McNeil Jr. and Mathew R. Warren.

 BODY:
In announcing this week that swine flu had been implicated in the deaths of two more New Yorkers, the city's health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, added a by-now familiar caveat: Both of them, he said, had ''underlying conditions.'' 
 He went on to enumerate a list of conditions that could aggravate the effects of swine flu and that characterize a large portion of New York's population: diabetes, asthma, heart disease, lung disease, a weakened immune system and, possibly, obesity.
 He did not even mention three other risk factors that alone apply to more than 1.2 million New Yorkers and 50 million Americans: pregnancy, being younger than 2, or being older than 65. 
 Since the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, the phrase ''underlying medical condition'' has been transformed from a snippet of medical jargon into a household phrase. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had fully absorbed the new vocabulary lesson by the city's second swine flu death on Sunday, that of a woman in her 50s. In an expression of empathy, he said his father had also died in his 50s, ''because of an underlying health condition.'' (In his autobiography, the mayor wrote, his father had heart damage from childhood rheumatic fever.) 
 Dr. Frieden intended his warning, which he has applied to all four New York deaths so far linked to the H1N1 virus, to be at once helpful to those who might be more at risk for the disease and reassuring to those who are not.
 But it may apply to so many households that efforts to control public fears by using the term may be having something of an adverse effect. Even accounting for people who have more than one condition, statistics suggest that the city's long list of red flags may encompass as many as one in three people.
 ''Many, many people share the same underlying causes that my husband had, and if he's at risk, many people are at risk,'' said Bonnie Wiener, the widow of Mitchell Wiener, 55, the first New Yorker to die of swine flu, on May 17. 
 She disputed the city's assertion that underlying conditions were a factor in his death. ''He was overweight and he was taking medicine for high blood pressure,'' she said. ''How many people 50 and above don't?'' 
 About 50 percent of swine flu hospitalizations globally and about 70 percent of those in the United States seem to involve underlying conditions. Besides Dr. Frieden's list, they include anything that makes it difficult for patients to clear their lungs, which can include some severe mental problems, seizure disorders or neuromuscular disease. 
 They include chronic heart, liver and kidney disease; suppressed immunity, whether caused by H.I.V. or drugs taken by cancer or transplant patients; and blood diseases like sickle-cell anemia, which lowers the blood's ability to carry oxygen. 
 A similar list of conditions applies to any strain of flu.
 About 400,000 New Yorkers have asthma, the city's most common chronic childhood illness; about 700,000, or 12.5 percent of adults, have diabetes; about 100,000 have H.I.V.; about 17,000 women are pregnant at any time, a conservative estimate, and about 900 people have tuberculosis, another risk factor, according to 2008 city statistics.
 There are about 1 million New Yorkers older than 65 (although there is some evidence that people born before 1957 may have antibodies to H1N1) and 228,000 younger than 2. Obesity -- which the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suspect may play a role because it can impede lung functioning and immune responses -- is practically epidemic. One-third of adult Americans and more than 1 million adults and teenagers in New York City are considered obese, but those with severe obesity are considered more at risk. 
 ''We were surprised by the frequency of obesity among the severe cases that we've been tracking,'' Dr. Anne Shuchat, the centers' director of immunization and respiratory disease, said at a May 19 press conference.
 The centers' officials have said that pregnancy is a risk factor because it suppresses the immune system to protect the fetus and can decrease lung capacity.
 Compounding the anxiety is that public health officials, citing medical confidentiality, have refused to disclose not just the identities of those who have died but even the most basic information about their health conditions. (Mr. Wiener's case was widely known because of his long career in the school system.)
 Judy Trunnell, 33, a teacher from South Texas, was the first American citizen to die of swine flu, in early May, after delivering a healthy baby girl by Caesarean section. A Texas Health Department spokeswoman said she had ''chronic underlying health conditions,'' which her husband, Steven, later denied on CNN.
 More details came to light a week later through a routine scientific study, a weekly ''Morbidity and Mortality'' report by the federal disease centers. Without using her name, it said she had a history of psoriasis (not considered an underlying condition) and mild asthma, in addition to her pregnancy.
 Warnings about underlying conditions appeared to be propelling people toward bursting emergency rooms. At Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, Sally Maugeri, an unemployed kitchen worker who had a cough, had brought in her nephew, Salvatore Soria, 10, who had been sick with coughing, vomiting and diarrhea, and his mother, Joanne Maugeri, 50, on Tuesday. 
 They had a trifecta of underlying conditions: Salvatore had a history of asthma, while Sally Maugeri was nine months pregnant and said that diabetes ran in her family. ''The fact that he's sick and I'm pregnant, I wanted to come in to see if he has the swine flu,'' she said. ''Because I have underlying symptoms, it makes me more scared.''
 Doctors diagnosed pneumonia in Salvatore and sent him home with amoxicillin, an antibiotic.
 On Wednesday, Shanaz Hossain brought in her son, Abir, 12, and daughter, Zarin, 10. Abir had a fever of 103.6 at home, Mrs. Hossain said, but her worries were aggravated by his asthma, the dreaded underlying condition that she had heard about on the television news. Abir's private doctor had diagnosed strep throat, but his mother took him to the emergency room for a chest X-ray. ''Of course I am still worried,'' she said. 
 Such anxiety has been a headache for doctors. They say that people with underlying conditions who have flu symptoms should consult their doctors, but that visiting an emergency room full of sick people may actually put them in more danger.
 ''Like the asthmatics, we'd really prefer that pregnant women would stay away from the emergency departments,'' said Dr. Steven J. Davidson, the chairman of the hospital's emergency medicine department.
 But City Councilman John C. Liu, who represents Flushing, Queens, where the outbreak is widespread, said the Bloomberg administration had failed to disclose enough information to a jittery public. ''The cloak of secrecy is not alleviating anyone's fears, whether they're real or perceived,'' he said. 
 But Dr. Scott Harper, a city epidemiologist, said that looking at the conditions behind just a handful of deaths could give people a false sense of security.
 ''This isn't an issue of secrecy, it's an issue of privacy,'' Dr. Harper said. ''If you're talking about two deaths in this size population, to be able to make decisions about your personal health knowing about medical details on those two deaths doesn't seem realistic. What does seem realistic is to look at things that are published widely.''

An article on Wednesday about a warning from federal health officials that doctors should promptly prescribe antiviral drugs for patients with suspected flu, without waiting for the results of flu tests, misspelled the surname of the director of immunization and respiratory diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She is Dr. Anne Schuchat, not Shuchat. (Her surname was also misspelled in an article on May 28 about public fears over swine flu.)

HEADLINE: Getting the Loan Officer on Your Side

BYLINE: By SCOTT MEDINTZ

 BODY:
To hear some small-business owners talk, getting a loan remains all but impossible. And yet, many bankers claim that their small-business loan volume is up significantly. So, is the small-business credit crisis over or not?
 At first blush, the evidence seems contradictory. On one hand, many national banks have drastically cut back small-business lending. In addition, Advanta, a major issuer of small-business credit cards, declared on May 12 that it was closing customer accounts to new charges. 
 On the other hand, the Federal Reserve's April survey of lending practices showed credit conditions have loosened. The Small Business Administration says the weekly volume of loans to small businesses is up more than 25 percent since March. And community banks, those smallish, old-fashioned institutions that make up the vast majority of the country's 8,300 banks, say that they are ready to take back customers from the national lenders.
 Much of the confusion has its roots in contrasting banking strategies. Big national banks are much more likely to have been drawn into the morass of securitized loans, credit-default swaps and the like, which has forced them to preserve capital by curtailing lending. 
 The smaller banks, meanwhile, have traditionally made their livings off of loans that they carry on their own balance sheets to individuals and small businesses. For them, despite the economic crisis, the current situation is more or less business as usual.
 Indeed, a May survey of 1,500 small businesses by Barlow Research Associates found that companies that applied to small banks for loans in the past year were three times as likely to get credit as those who applied to large banks.
 Nick Sarillo, owner of two Chicago-area pizza restaurants called Nick's Pizza & Pub, says he recently found himself on the wrong side of that divide when he sought to borrow $2.3 million to open a third location.
 In late 2007, he was engaged in the loan review process with LaSalle Bank -- historically a popular regional lender for Chicago-area small businesses -- when LaSalle was acquired by Bank of America, the financial giant. 
 Bank of America told Mr. Sarillo it wanted 20 percent down, twice what LaSalle had been requesting. Then, he said, after two months of slow sales last year at his restaurant in Elgin, Bank of America doubled the required down-payment again, forcing him to postpone the deal. 
 Now, he said, he is shifting his business to the First Community Bank in Elgin. A spokeswoman for Bank of America said the bank does not comment on individual customers. But she said, ''We continue to develop small business relationships and are committed to the small business customer and space.''
 Bankers say that some of the confusion in the marketplace has been caused by ill-founded complaints by small-business owners. Consider that most small companies are not looking for loans: the Barlow survey found that 70 percent of small businesses had not applied for any credit in the past year. That, said Bob Seiwert, head of the American Banker Association's Center for Commercial Lending and Business Banking, is because fewer businesses see opportunities to grow in a down economy -- and the businesses that do come looking for loans tend to be financially vulnerable and thus most likely to be turned down for sound banking reasons. 
 ''The fact is, a lot of borrowers just aren't creditworthy,'' said Sherrill Stockton, senior vice president of Sonoma Bank, which is part of Sterling Savings Bank in Spokane, Wash. ''But it's human nature, if you get turned down, to go around saying that there are no loans available.''
 Bankers say that small-business owners looking for a loan should start by knowing which business measures -- debt-to-equity ratio, for example, or net margins -- lenders focus on when evaluating loan applications in their industry. Bankers say would-be borrowers should demonstrate exactly how they plan to use the money and why the plan makes sense.
 This month, for instance, Chandan Patel borrowed $3.7 million from Sonoma Bank to buy her second hotel property, a Comfort Suites hotel in Castro Valley, Calif. She said she had demonstrated to her banker that she would be able to increase the property's average daily rate, a critical yardstick in the hotel industry, by raising room prices while improving customer service and adding amenities. It helped that she was able to point to a track record of maintaining an unusually high daily rate at her other property. 
 Both bankers and borrowers say the human side of lending requires as much attention as the technical aspects. Small-business owners should cultivate a relationship with a local banker -- ideally, long before they need a loan -- and treat that relationship as a long-term partnership.
 Bob Davis, chief executive of Virtual Driver Interactive, which makes driving simulators, benefited from a personal banking relationship when he was looking to buy his California business from his former employer late last year in the early days of the financial crisis. For tax reasons, the deal had to happen in just 90 days, or it would not happen at all. And because the business had been part of a larger operation, its financial performance was difficult to demonstrate. ''It wasn't an easy sell,'' Mr. Davis said. 
 He happened to meet Greg Patton, the chief executive of Sierra Vista Bank in Folsom, Calif., at a local golf course, and Mr. Patton invited him to spend a couple of hours talking about the business. ''No numbers, no spreadsheets, let's just talk,'' Mr. Patton told him. 
 After the talk, Mr. Patton became an advocate for the deal, Mr. Davis said. He asked for a set of financials and a two-year projection for the business. More important, though, he coached Mr. Davis through the loan review process. More than once during the process, issues came up that could have scuttled the deal. Each time, Mr. Davis says, huddled with his bankers and found a solution. The $900,000 loan went through in February, just ahead of the deadline. 
 Still, business loan applicants should expect to be closely scrutinized, especially by smaller community banks that have generally eschewed the formula-based lending practices many national banks adopted in recent years.
 But Ranjit Kushwaha, who recently borrowed in the high six figures to buy the building in Monterey, Calif., that houses his Indian Summer Restaurant, was glad to see his bank being careful. ''They made me jump through all kinds of hoops,'' he said. ''They're very cautious -- but that's good. Otherwise, we'd all end up with the same problems again.''

HEADLINE: Markets Fall On Worries Of Inflation

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve is spending more than $1 trillion to keep interest rates low and help credit flow, but investors are getting worried that those efforts are starting to falter.
 The specter that government spending may stoke inflation and push up borrowing costs rattled Wall Street Wednesday, dragging stocks lower on concerns that Washington is issuing more bonds to finance the economic recovery than investors are willing to buy. 
 Higher interest rates could throw a new wrench into credit markets, stifle lending and prolong the recession. 
 There is still a healthy demand for short-term government debt. But investors who suspect that inflation is looming are leery of locking themselves into a 30-year Treasury bond that pays relatively low interest. As a result, the difference in yields between two-year and 10-year notes grew to one of its widest points ever on Wednesday, showing the hesitance toward longer-term government debt.
 ''What I think we're seeing here is flat-out concern about the amount of debt the government's going to be issuing,'' said James Grady, director of fixed-income trading at TD Ameritrade. ''People are realizing they don't want to own bonds.''
 The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose to its highest level since November on Wednesday. The note fell 1 17/32, to 94 30/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.73 percent from 3.55 percent late Tuesday.
 Rates on a 30-year fixed Fannie Mae mortgage hit 4.69 percent, up from 3.94 percent a week ago. 
 Analysts said the gyration in bond markets was putting the Fed in an increasingly tough position.
 Although the central bank has aimed its official interest rate at near zero, a historic low, if market interest rates continue to rise, the Fed would face more pressure to expand its purchases of $300 billion in longer-term Treasuries, analysts said. But to do so, it would have to print even more money, a move that could dilute the value of dollars already in circulation and lead to inflation down the road.
 At its most recent meeting in late April, the Fed's Open Market Committee said some policy makers recognized that the central bank might need to increase its purchases of Treasuries ''at some point to spur a more rapid pace of recovery.'' 
 It was an unlikely day for credit jitters to drive markets lower. An auction of five-year Treasury notes went better than analysts had expected, drawing the most demand from foreign buyers in months. And Moody's Investor Service said that it was not about to cut the United States government's triple-A credit rating, despite fears that the price tag for stimulating the economy is too high.
 Still, investors who thronged to the safety of government bonds last year are getting edgy about Treasury's plans to issue $2 trillion in new debt. More money is flowing back into stock markets and riskier ventures like corporate bonds, reducing the demand for government debt just as Washington is issuing more than ever. ''Interest rates are going to rise, and rise more than expected,'' said Hugh Johnson, chairman of Johnson Illington Advisors. ''It really scares you as an investor.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 173.47 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 8,300.02 ,while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.9 percent, or 17.27 points, to 893.06. Less severe declines in technology stocks helped to contain losses on the Nasdaq composite index, which was down 1 percent, or 19.35 points, to 1,731.08. 
 Some investors used the day to book profits from Tuesday's trading, when the Dow bounced 200 points on slivers of data showing that consumers were feeling more optimistic about the economy. Consumer-geared companies surged higher on hopes that consumers would shake their funk and spend money at shopping malls, rather than sock it away.
 ''It's a little frothy, and it doesn't take much to turn it one way or the other,'' Bart Barnett, head of equity trading at Morgan Keegan, said of the stock market.
 As the troubled automaker General Motors appeared to edge closer to filing for bankruptcy, investors fled the company's stock. Shares of G.M. fell 20 percent to $1.15 as bondholders rejected an agreement to forgive billions in debt that would have given them a 10 percent stake in the company.
 Other automakers were also swept up in the broad decline, which tugged all sectors of the market lower. Ford was down 1.1 percent, and New York-traded shares of Toyota, Honda and Nissan also fell.
 The price of gold was lower, and the dollar gained ground against the euro but sank against the British pound. 
 The price of crude oil climbed $1 to $63.45 a barrel in New York after Saudi Arabia's oil minister predicted that oil prices could reach $75. As oil prices have risen from their recent lows of $33 a barrel, gasoline costs have crept up, raising some concerns about inflation in energy prices.

HEADLINE: Preparing Workers for Jobs After the Junkyards Go

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
It takes a certain humility to head back to school at the age of 52 and learn as a child would, through picture books and basic words sketched on a blackboard.
 But Gustavo Zeron, a Honduran immigrant who works nine hours a day at a junkyard, swallowed his pride and signed up for the classes, which the city is offering in an effort to give laborers of soon-to-disappear businesses in Willets Point skills to find new work.
 ''That's the only opportunity I have to get out of this place,'' Mr. Zeron explained in Spanish as he headed for the No. 7 train to travel the 12 stops to class one recent evening. 
 He is not the only worker who wants to escape Willets Point, a bedraggled industrial triangle that neighbors the Mets' new ballpark in Queens. Inside auto shops with names like Stubborn Used Tires and Latin American Mechanic and Muffler, summers are so hot and winters so cold that fingers become deformed with time, making a worker's hands look like claws. Underground, there are no water or waste pipes. Outside, the landscape of unpaved streets resembles a muddied quilt of rivers and lagoons. 
 Neglected for many years, Willets Point is now poised for transformation. A $3 billion, 10-year redevelopment plan approved late last year calls for razing all of the businesses -- auto shops, scrap yards, an Indian food manufacturer and a few construction companies -- and replacing them with a hotel, homes, a conference center and stores.
 As part of the deal, the area's workers are being offered free training to learn to use a computer, wait on tables, keep books, fix cars or simply speak English. It is a challenging student body, made up primarily of illegal immigrants, who by law are not allowed to work. The city has devoted $2.5 million to the program, known as Willets Point Worker Assistance, and instituted a sort of don't ask, don't tell policy: School is open to all, regardless of immigration status. 
 ''We made a decision not to think about this,'' Madelyn Wils, executive vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said in an interview. She added: ''Look, they have to support their families, they live here, and we didn't want them to fall through the cracks.''
 The program has faced intense opposition, not from anti-immigrant groups, but from some of Willets Point's small-business owners and their workers, who said the money would be better used to help them relocate. 
 When a team of instructors from LaGuardia Community College, which is carrying out the program, brought a mobile classroom to Willets Point in October, protesters surrounded the vehicle. When the team returned on foot in February, some business owners refused to let the instructors speak to their workers. 
 ''I don't see the point in training people who can't work if there's no guarantee they'll ever find jobs,'' said Marcos Neira, a Colombian immigrant who owns Master Express Deli and Restaurant on Willets Point Boulevard.
 Protesters also gathered in March outside a community center in Corona, Queens, where the college was holding an open house, heckling the workers who filed past them on their way inside. 
 ''That's when we realized we had broken through,'' said Linda Barlow, the program's director.
 The program has 183 students, just a fraction of the estimated 2,000 people who work in Willets Point. There are some workers who oppose the program and have refused to join it. But most who have not signed up fear that by registering, they might end up being deported, Ms. Barlow said.
 The first class was held on April 2, at LaGuardia's Long Island City campus, about 20 minutes from Willets Point on the Manhattan-bound No. 7 train. There have been a few snags, like the constant changes in classrooms that Ms. Barlow blamed on the college's growing enrollment, which has made it hard to manage the available space. The program will have its own dedicated space starting next month, she said.
 The students are a microcosm of the Willets Point work force: 145 are men, 115 are illegal immigrants and most know little or no English, she said. Ages vary, as do the workers' education levels. 
 There are those who want to learn English. Others have bigger ambitions, like Mr. Zeron, who spends his days climbing in and out of the piles of cars in the junkyard, fetching mufflers, radiators, bumpers and other used parts that customers want.
 He came here from his country's capital of Tegucigalpa in 1999, after a hurricane left him unemployed and destitute. He has made a living at Willets Point since then, and with the money he has earned, he put his four children through school, paid for the youngest to spend a year in Denmark as an exchange student and is building a house for his family back home.
 He said he had a degree in mechanics from a Honduran technical school and worked as a contractor for the American Embassy in Tegucigalpa before the hurricane, fixing typewriters. His goal is to return there and open his own business, this time fixing computers. The problem is that he knows nothing about computers, so in addition to English classes, he is taking a Spanish-language course called Aprenda Microsoft Windows y la Internet, or Learn Microsoft Windows and the Internet.
 ''I want to update my knowledge,'' Mr. Zeron said.
 In his English as a second language class on May 7, 21 students convened around large wooden desks, rehearsing the words in a dialogue between a factory foreman and his apprentice: supply closet, log book, conveyor belt. 
 The students seemed to share similar goals. Jary Alvarez, 27, of Washington Heights, who had two years of college in Honduras and works fixing flat tires in Willets Point, is learning English because ''it could help me for the rest of my life, wherever I am,'' he said.
 Daniel Maldonado, 45, of Corona, who had no more than an elementary school education in Ecuador, said he was tired of losing clients to other mechanics who were able to speak the language.
 Victor Espinoza, 59, a Peruvian who now lives in Elmhurst, Queens, fell short of receiving a bachelor's degree in economics back home because he failed to complete his final project. He is now learning English ''because I don't want to be an island in this country,'' he said. Mr. Espinoza, who works at a junkyard, said that he hoped to be a bell captain or a receptionist at a hotel.
 ''Of course, we would rather know that our jobs will be there, that the businesses in Willets Point aren't going anywhere,'' he said. ''We couldn't win the fight against the city, so we should take advantage of what the city is giving us.''

HEADLINE: Barclays Expands Its Investment Bank

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
Robert E. Diamond Jr., president of Barclays, just moved his New York office to the former Lehman headquarters on Seventh Avenue, across town from the old Barclays Capital building. 
 He is elated, he says, by the size of the investment banking business the company has acquired in America. 
 In what may be a rarity in the world of high finance, Barclays is in the middle of a wide-ranging expansion plan. 
 In the last three months, Mr. Diamond and five other executives at Barclays Capital, the investment banking unit, have gone on a hiring spree, adding more than 450 research, equities and merger advisory professionals in Europe and Asia from rivals like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. They plan to hire more than 300 before the end of the year. 
 In Europe, Mr. Diamond declined to buy Lehman's European and Asian operations, seeing too much overlap and a lack of clout. Instead, he wants to build those businesses himself. 
 ''Our mission is to become one of the premier investment banks of the world,'' Mr. Diamond said. ''We're not trying to catch the market. This is a long-term investment.''
 After turning Barclays Capital into one of the biggest risk management and financing firms in Europe, Mr. Diamond says he now has a unique opportunity to benefit from a decimated market and expand into equities and merger advice to compete with rivals like Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, two of his former employers. 
 Many investors have cheered the initiative, as demonstrated by the stock's strong performance. Barclays shares in London have risen 91 percent this year, while British rivals like HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland have fallen. 
 Despite the huge pullback created by the financial crisis, investment banking remains a lucrative sector for banks, bringing in high-profit, high-margin business. Although the market for initial public offerings of stock is stagnant right now, companies are still looking for advice on debt offerings, deals and mergers.
 Unlike many other banks, Barclays has avoided tapping government aid in the wake of the crisis, despite recording $:5 billion in write-downs last year. 
 But some investors worry that it did not mark down the value of assets aggressively enough, and concerns about potential losses from its loan book continue to haunt it. To raise capital, Barclays is selling its iShares exchange-traded funds business and studying a sale of BGI, the asset management business and one of its crown jewels.
 Irfan Younus, an analyst at NCB Stockbrokers, welcomed Mr. Diamond's push into equities but said he was concerned about Barclays' ''immediate problem.'' 
 ''Will the new investment banking franchise be strong enough to offset the potential future losses from their loan book?'' he asked.
 The investment banking business of Lehman has significantly helped Barclays' bottom line. Barclays said in March that it had a ''strong start'' to the year after reporting a 49 percent increase in profit for the second half of 2008 because of gains from Lehman.
 Barclays also may not have the option of sitting still. Analysts say the company needs to build a matching equity business in Europe and Asia to make the Lehman acquisition work. The financial crisis flooded the job market with bankers and traders, creating a good hiring environment. 
 The latest growth plan is a huge gamble at an uncertain time for the investment banking industry. And bringing in top bankers does not by itself build a successful investment banking operation. Competitors like HSBC Holdings and Bank of America had tried such expansion plans before, only to retrench later. 
 Christopher White, a fund manager based in London at Threadneedle Asset Management, which holds Barclays shares, cautioned that the sector was not likely to return to its boom years.
 ''There are risks because we don't know how investment banking will look like in the future and how it will be regulated,'' he said. ''But it's a logical expansion of their franchise and the timing is good.'' 
 The company has a long way to go to catch up with competitors in market share. Including the Lehman business, Barclays Capital ranked seventh in equity capital markets in the United States this year but 22nd in Europe, according to Dealogic. In merger advice, the bank was sixth in the United States but 21st in Europe.
 And others are also hoping to take advantage of available talent during the downturn. Societe Generale is hiring 35 senior bankers in Europe and Russia to prepare for a market recovery. The merger advisory boutique Perella Weinberg Partners just hired two bankers in London.
 Jerry del Missier, president of Barclays Capital and based in New York, is leading the hiring for equities. Hugh E. McGee III, head of global investment banking, is in charge of building the mergers and acquisition business. 
 In just one month, Sam Dean, former global co-chief of equity capital markets at Deutsche Bank, will join in the same job in London; and Jim Renwick, who helped UBS build an equity capital markets business, has been hired to run corporate brokering and stock underwriting in Britain. Two former Goldman Sachs trading specialists, Howard Spooner and Damian Bunce, have also joined.
 Mr. McGee and Paul Parker, a former Lehman banker who is now head of Barclays Capital's global merger advisory business, hired Mark Warham, former chairman of investment banking for Britain at Morgan Stanley, and Matthew Ponsonby, formerly Citigroup's global co-chief of infrastructure investment banking, as co-heads of European mergers and acquisitions. Barclays plans to hire 65 senior bankers before the end of the year.
 ''The opportunity to recruit people who were in positions of industry leadership has not been this strong since the tech bubble burst,'' said Gerald A. Donini, Barclays Capital head of global equities based in New York. ''It's an environment where people are generally more willing to discuss opportunities.''

HEADLINE: Massachusetts, Model for Universal Health Care, Sees Ups and Downs in Policy

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Despite a weakening economy, Massachusetts continued to measure gains in the share of residents who reported having a steady source of health care in 2008, its second year of near-universal coverage, a new study has found. 
 But the annual survey, taken each fall since 2006, also raised red flags regarding the ability of residents to actually use that care, with growing numbers saying they could not afford needed treatments and many reporting shortages of primary care physicians.
 The study's authors wrote that there were lessons for Washington, where Congressional committees are incorporating much of the Massachusetts model into federal health care legislation.
 ''Although major expansions in coverage can be achieved without addressing health care costs, cost pressures have the potential to undermine the gains,'' wrote the researchers, Sharon K. Long and Paul B. Masi of the Urban Institute.
 The difficulties in receiving care were severest among low-income residents, who have gained the most from expanded access under the state's law, passed in 2006. It requires most residents to have health insurance and provides state-subsidized plans for the poor. Massachusetts now has the country's lowest percentage of the uninsured -- 2.6 percent, compared with a national average of 15 percent.
 But the study, which was scheduled for publication Thursday in the journal Health Affairs, found that increased demand for care from the newly insured was confronting an insufficient supply of willing physicians. One in five adults said they had been told in the last 12 months that a doctor or clinic was not accepting new patients or would not see patients with their type of insurance. The rejection rates for low-income adults and those with public insurance were double the rates for higher-income residents and those with private coverage. 
 The authors concluded that the high rejection rates helped explain another important finding: that there has been little change in the use of emergency rooms for non-emergency treatment. Among low-income residents -- defined as those with incomes of less than three times the federal poverty level, or $66,150 for a family of four -- 23 percent said their last trip to an emergency room had been for a non-emergency, the same as in 2006.
 The report sets the stage for legislative recommendations expected next month from a state commission that hopes to slow the growth in health spending. The commission has already drafted principles calling for a system of global payments to networks of doctors, hospitals and other providers. The networks would be paid for an individual's ongoing care, rather than for each procedure or office visit, providing an incentive to keep patients healthy rather than merely treating their ailments. 
 The researchers found consistent yearly increases in the percentage of residents who said they had a usual source of care and who had seen a doctor or dentist in the past year. But they concluded that initial gains in procuring needed care had begun to erode by the fall of 2008.
 For instance, the share of people from low-income families who did not get needed care in the previous year because of cost dropped to 17 percent in fall 2007 from 27 percent in fall 2006. But it then jumped to 18 percent last year.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Shows Same Moves In the Ring

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
True, the site was the Steve Malzberg conservative talk radio show Wednesday afternoon on WOR, not WrestleMania XXV. But, as the June 2 primary approaches, it's hard not to see New Jersey politics as more and more like professional wrestling, only with guys you really, really don't want to see in spandex tights or black unitards. 
 The performers all play familiar, tightly scripted roles: the fire-breathing conservative, the electable Republican moderate, the Democratic heavyweight. The elections play out in predictable cycles, first in the right versus right-center Republican undercard and then in the main bout in November. And upsets happen with the frequency of the Undertaker delivering a Tombstone Piledriver to a semiconscious opponent and not winning a match. 
 Aside from Bret D. Schundler, an unconventional conservative who was the Republican nominee for governor in 2001, the establishment moderate always seems to win the Republican primary. And their reward has been losing every statewide race since Christie Whitman was elected governor in 1997. New Jersey hasn't elected a Republican senator since Clifford Case in 1972. 
 One could argue that circumstances this year are particularly propitious for a different script. It would, in fact, be true. One could also argue that Rey Mysterio, hit on the head with a chair and lying half dead in the ring, can't possibly get off the mat until, wow, he stirs and miraculously recovers. 
 Even Steven M. Lonegan, the former mayor of Bogota, and this year's conservative standard-bearer, concedes the story line has been deja vu all over again, with the Republican establishment candidate running right in the primary, winning the nomination, then tacking back to the left in the general election and losing.
 ''It's the same show over and over again, and over and over again the Republicans have lost,'' he said. ''And the worst thing is that we haven't done anything policywise to turn New Jersey around and make it an economic power again. It's been an utter failure on the part of the party.''
 Mr. Lonegan, who played the same role in 2005, has appealed to the Republican base with conservative staples (anti-abortion, anti gay marriage, cracking down on illegal immigration, solving the fiscal mess in Trenton), combined with a centerpiece issue of a flat tax and calls for radical downsizing of state government.
 It got enough traction with Republican primary voters that Christopher J. Christie, the former United States attorney for New Jersey, who seemed inclined to dispense with the preliminary act, was forced to re-engage, establish his own conservative bona fides and run ads taking on Mr. Lonegan. Polls now show Mr. Christie with a lead of around 20 percentage points, but some say the race is tighter than that. 
 THE primary reason for thinking the main bout could be different, of course, is that polls indicate Mr. Corzine is in worse shape than Mickey Rourke's character in ''The Wrestler.'' Amid a widespread sense that New Jersey government is hopelessly broken, and crushing property tax bills, Mr. Corzine, with approval ratings hovering around 40 percent, defines an incumbent in danger of losing his job. If Mr. Christie wins the Republican nomination, his image as a corruption-busting prosecutor won't hurt, either.
 But Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said it's still the same story line, with voters needing more than a compelling personal story to elect a Republican.
 ''What voters really respond to is the level of specificity that gives them a way to hold someone accountable, and Chris Christie is avoiding like the plague making any such statement about any issue, and I think that's going to hurt him when this becomes a race of attacks back and forth on personal levels, which it will,'' Mr. Murray said. ''He has nothing to fall back on.''
 And, given the off year, with only a smattering of major races including Virginia governor, New York City mayor and New Jersey governor, the national Democrats -- starting with Barack Obama -- can do a lot more to help Mr. Corzine than the national Republicans (Newt Gingrich? Dick Cheney? Sarah Palin?) could do for Mr. Christie.
 Nothing is forever, and maybe this will be the year the New Jersey Republicans manage not to lose. Given the state's horrific fiscal mess, it would be a novel idea if the main event came down to who has the best ideas for solving it, starting with property taxes. But that's probably a story line too outlandish for anyone to believe.

HEADLINE: The Health Insurance Labyrinth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As a family physician for 47 years, I totally agree with Paul Krugman's May 22 column, ''Blue Double Cross.'' Health care insurers are more bureaucratic than any government agency. They often deny choice of doctor, and refuse to pay for care. 
 My experience with the government programs, Medicare and Medicaid, is that the reimbursement for services may be low, but there is one uniform set of rules to follow. 
 Each health care insurer has a different set of rules. The reimbursement for services varies widely and the doctor sometimes doesn't know where to send the patient for laboratory or other tests. Furthermore, the physician often doesn't know whether the prescriptions he or she writes will be covered. 
 As Mr. Krugman reports, insurance companies are still bad for your health. 
 Melvin H. Kirschner Granada Hills, Calif., May 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I am a dual citizen, born and raised in Canada. After attending graduate school in the United States, I returned to Canada, first of all because of its much better health system. During my time in the United States, I heard many astonishing lies about Canadian health care.
 Someone said that Canadians can't choose their own doctors. Sorry, wrong. It's Americans whose choice is constrained, by health maintenance organizations.
 Another person said Canadian-style care is more expensive. In fact, Canadians pay far less and still get a high standard of care and are healthier and live longer than Americans.
 Someone else said that Canadian health insurance involves tons of paperwork. Wrong again. Canadian medical insurance and billing is a miracle of simplicity and economy. Anyone who has ever been to an American hospital knows how much paperwork -- mostly financial -- is involved, and how many different bills they get from how many different parties.
 Americans deserve far better than their current system, because most of them can't simply move to a country with a rational, humane vision of health care.

HEADLINE: Hezbollah Says It Is Talking to European Union and I.M.F.

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon 

 BODY:
Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group, has talked with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union about continued financial support to Lebanon in the event the group's political alliance wins the June 7 parliamentary elections, Hezbollah officials said Wednesday. 
 The talks this month reflected concerns here about a possible drop in international donor and investor confidence should the political alliance led by Hezbollah -- considered a terrorist group by the United States and Israel -- gain a majority for the first time. Many analysts believe that outcome is likely, though the race is considered too close to call. 
 Lebanon's current governing majority, which has tried unsuccessfully to disarm Hezbollah, has depended on heavy financial support from the West and oil-rich Persian Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia. In Beirut last week, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said future American support to Lebanon, which includes military aid, would depend on the elections' outcome. 
 European governments have not issued any such veiled threats, and Western leaders have recently shown a greater willingness to engage in political dialogue with Hezbollah's patrons, Iran and Syria. Britain's Foreign Office said in March that it would re-establish relations with Hezbollah's political wing. 
 The European Union provides about $84 million a year to Lebanon, and the International Monetary Fund provides about $114 million, aid that will be coming up for reauthorization soon. 
 The monetary fund has not negotiated a possible loan with members or sympathizers of Hezbollah, Simonetta Nardin, a spokeswoman for the fund, said in an e-mail message. But the agency routinely meets with the main political parties in Lebanon and with members of Parliament, Ms. Nardin said. Future loans with the monetary fund were not discussed, she said.
 The practical effects of an election victory by Hezbollah and its allies would be limited because they already play important roles in the cabinet, and any new government would almost certainly preserve a ''blocking minority'' for the opposition. 
 But a victory would be symbolically important, especially for Arab states concerned about the influence of Iran and Syria. Saudi Arabia has provided at least $2 billion to Lebanon's central bank since 2006, along with many other aid programs. Lebanon's public debt is more than $45 billion. 
 ''It depends how people choose to express their political sentiments in financial terms,'' said Rami Khouri, the director of the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut. ''Many people don't like the Chinese government, but choose to invest a lot of money there.'' 
 Lebanon's centrality in Arab politics could help to mitigate any losses. Qatar, which has good relations with Iran and Syria, has also provided aid to Lebanon, and could afford to increase it.
 Another question for donors is the financial and economic priorities of Hezbollah and its allies, which remain relatively unknown, said Nassib Ghobril, the head of research and analysis for Byblos Bank. 
 Hezbollah's election platform is more economically populist than the current majority's, but the group will have fewer seats in Parliament -- and, perhaps, less interest in such matters -- than its major Christian political partner, the Free Patriotic Movement, whose economic platform is not so different from its electoral opponents', emphasizing privatization and accountability. 
 Lebanon's public debt may limit the options of any future government, Mr. Ghobril said.

HEADLINE: Talks Fail to Secure Deal on Loan for G.M.'s European Unit

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Nelson D. Schwartz reported from Paris and Carter Dougherty from Berlin. Micheline Maynard contributed reporting from Detroit, and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
In a negotiating session here that stretched until nearly 5 a.m. Thursday, German and American negotiators failed to agree on a crucial bridge loan to sustain Opel and the rest of the European operations of General Motors in the event the beleaguered automaker files for bankruptcy.
 But officials did manage to narrow the field of potential suitors for Opel to two companies, Fiat, the Italian automaker, and Magna, a Canadian auto parts giant. A Belgian private equity firm as well as a Chinese automaker were knocked out of contention.
 German leaders expressed frustration with the United States Treasury, citing inadequate guarantees that European assets would be protected from the likely bankruptcy filing in American courts and that German money would be used only for Opel.
 ''We don't have the assurances we need to approve a bridge loan,'' said Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the German economy minister. German and American negotiators will return to the bargaining table to iron out the bridge financing on Friday, but it was further complicated by a request from G.M. for an additional 300 million euros, or $418 million, on top of the already promised 1.5 billion euro aid package from Berlin. 
 Rather than watching the horse race, G.M. officials in the United States focused on Opel's securing bridge financing so it can survive until a new owner can take over. After emerging from the likely bankruptcy proceedings, G.M. will retain a minority stake under the proposals submitted by Magna as well as by Fiat. 
 After the all-night session here, Frank Stronach, the chairman of Magna, said his company was willing to provide the additional 300 million euros in bridge financing but wanted a German government guarantee in the event the deal fell through.
 ''We have lots of cash,'' Mr. Stronach said. ''We have no problem.''
 Much of the meeting Wednesday night and early Thursday morning centered on forming a trust that would protect Opel and the rest of G.M.'s European operations from being pulled into any American bankruptcy proceedings. Through the night, the Germans went over the trust's possible structure while also negotiating with officials of the Treasury, as well as G.M.
 At one point the German negotiators grew so frustrated with the Treasury's representative here that they arranged a video link to Washington to speed up the talks. 
 Though the failure to come up with an agreement Thursday surprised many observers, the negotiators in Berlin and Washington are still aiming to reach a deal before the June 1 deadline imposed by the White House for G.M. to restructure.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel and other German leaders evaluated the potential bidders hours after bondholders at G.M. rejected an offer to exchange $27 billion in debt for a small amount of stock. G.M. had said that without the bondholders' approval, it would seek bankruptcy protection
 By keeping the bidding process alive, the German government can increase its leverage over Opel's eventual buyer, experts said, safeguarding German jobs while potentially lowering the amount of additional government aid required in the future.
 ''Germany is in the comfortable position of selecting a bidder from several candidates, and will try to get as many concessions in terms of jobs and financial support as possible,'' said Arndt Ellinghorst, an analyst with Credit Suisse in London. 
 Whoever emerges as the winner, the conclave in Berlin marked the end of an era for American industry in Europe, as G.M. prepared to yield control of businesses that date back eight decades.
 G.M.'s direct link to Germany began when it acquired Opel in 1929, and survived the Great Depression, World War II and the rise of new competitors from elsewhere in Europe as well as Asia. But weighed down with debt, and losing critical market share in North America, G.M. had little choice but to give up majority control of its unprofitable European operations as bankruptcy loomed.
 Magna, a Canadian auto parts maker that has teamed up with Russia's Sberbank, emerged as the favorite of German leaders, who fear that a rival offer by the Italian automaker Fiat could cost more jobs.
 ''The chancellor has to examine the offer by Magna very closely because in my opinion, as far as I'm informed, it's the most realistic, the best offer,'' said Peter Struck, the parliamentary leader of the Social Democrats, who, with the Christian Democratic Union of Mrs. Merkel, form Germany's governing coalition.
 But Fiat's charismatic chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, met with Mrs. Merkel on Tuesday in a last-ditch attempt to sell her on Fiat's plan, which would make Opel part of a global giant including Fiat and Chrysler that could ultimately produce nearly six million cars a year.
 G.M. officials in the United States are more focused on Opel's securing the $1.5 billion in bridge financing rather than in endorsing one bidder.
 Initially, potential acquirers were seeking 5 billion to 7 billion euros in state aid, but as the talks go on and the bidders become more desperate, Mr. Ellinghorst added, they might be willing to forgo a part of that money.
 Hans-Werner Sinn, the president of the Ifo Institute in Munich, and a prominent German economist, concluded in a study that the bidders for G.M.'s European assets were demanding 198,000 euros to 296,000 euros per job saved -- figures that Mr. Sinn called ''extortion.''
 ''The interested parties know full well that we are in the middle of a national election campaign,'' Mr. Sinn said. ''In these times, it is almost impossible for politicians to let a tradition-laden company like Opel to go bankrupt.''
 The Chinese offer came after Berlin's May 20 deadline for bids, and consisted of only a three-page proposal, making German officials skeptical that Beijing Automotive was up to the task of reviving Opel and disentangling it from General Motors.
 But the interest from the Chinese signaled how drastically the auto industry landscape has shifted, as power moves to more efficient Japanese companies from Detroit and its once-formidable companies like G.M. and Chrysler, which are burdened by debt and the cost of health insurance for hundreds of thousands of current workers and retirees.
 G.M.'s troubles and the support of Sberbank for the Magna bid, however, also open the door for Russia to raise its profile in the global auto industry.
 Car manufacturing in Russia has lagged badly behind the West for decades, even while the market for vehicles boomed recently as Russians' wallets were fattened by trickle-down oil money.
 The Russian state bank intends to buy a share in Opel in exchange for a commitment to form a joint venture with Russia's deeply troubled carmaker, the Gorky Automobile Factory, or GAZ, according to Elena Sakhnova, a transportation analyst at VTB Bank in Moscow.

HEADLINE: For Obama, a Few Words And a Fund-Raising Focus

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Seventeen minutes.
 That's how long President Obama spoke Wednesday when he dropped by Nellis Air Force Base, a short hop from the Las Vegas Strip, before resuming his multimillion-dollar West Coast fund-raising swing.
 After he announced his selection for the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Mr. Obama set off for Nevada and California. The only public event on his two-day schedule was a speech marking the 100th day of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the $787 billion plan intended to jump-start the economy.
 So Mr. Obama shed his jacket, rolled up the sleeves of his tieless white shirt and embarked on a tour of the largest array of solar panels in the Western Hemisphere, a field of 72,000 panels positioned to capture the broiling desert sun. 
 He swept into the Thunderbird Hangar at the Air Force base, delivered one of the shortest speeches of his political career and boarded Air Force One for Los Angeles.
 ''It's always a pleasure to get out of Washington a little bit,'' Mr. Obama said, a grin growing wide across his face. ''Washington's O.K., but it's nice taking some time to talk to Americans of every walk of life outside the nation's capital. And there's nothing like a quick trip to Vegas in the middle of the week.''
 There was, however, little time built into his schedule to ''talk to Americans,'' at least for those who did not write a check to a Democratic cause.
 All presidents, as the head of their political parties, eventually become the fund-raiser in chief. But against the backdrop of a punishing recession, the balance is a delicate one, which is one reason the president did not hold town meetings or come face-to-face with many voters.
 That's not to say that Mr. Obama did not have a successful trip.
 Inside the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, where Bette Midler normally performs, Mr. Obama was in the spotlight on Tuesday night and Ms. Midler was a guest, along with Sheryl Crow and Rita Rudner. The president raised more than $2 million for the re-election campaign of Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader.
 Mr. Obama left no doubt that he enjoyed the trappings of his new job. Speaking to an audience of more than 4,000 people, Mr. Obama recalled staying at Caesars Palace when he was campaigning. ''I thought I had a pretty nice room, but now that I'm president, they upgraded me,'' he said. ''I got the upgrade! And it's a really nice room now.''
 The president flew Wednesday to Los Angeles, where he had no stops scheduled until an evening fund-raiser at the Beverly Hilton. Jennifer Hudson, the Academy-Award-winning singer and actress from Chicago, was set to perform at a gala that organizers said would bring in at least $4 million.
 Mr. Obama was not scheduled to leave Beverly Hills, which infuriated Representative Jim Costa, Democrat of California. The state is teetering on bankruptcy, he said, and unemployment has climbed above 20 percent in some cities across the Central Valley.
 ''He's not showing us any empathy,'' Mr. Costa told The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress. ''He told us he would visit the heartland of California. He's coming again, and he's not doing so.''
 The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was asked why Mr. Obama was not addressing the dire situation in California during his visit.
 ''The notion that the president isn't concerned about the economic conditions of this country I don't think holds a lot of validity,'' Mr. Gibbs said, ticking through steps the administration has taken to lend aid. ''I think most people in California are confident of that as well.''

HEADLINE: In Beijing, Pelosi Seeks Cooperation On Climate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, met China's two top leaders on Wednesday to discuss cooperation on energy and environmental problems, and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said Beijing would join Washington to ''push for positive results'' at the next global warming summit meeting this fall in Copenhagen.
 Mr. Wen's public statements, reported by the state's Xinhua news agency, offered no specifics, however, and some experts here noted that the two nations' official positions on reducing climate-changing pollution remained far apart. 
 Ms. Pelosi and five House legislators involved in energy and environmental issues met with Mr. Wen and separately with President Hu Jintao on the third day of an eight-day tour of China. 
 In a statement issued late Wednesday, a Pelosi spokesman said the meetings had also addressed North Korea's recent nuclear test and missile launchings, human rights issues, the global economic crisis and intellectual property rights. Beyond expressing general hopes that North Korea would resume multilateral talks and concern about China's human rights record, the statement offered little detail.
 In a speech on Tuesday in Beijing, Ms. Pelosi, a California Democrat, called the climate change issue ''a game changer in the U.S.-China relationship'' and ''an opportunity we cannot miss.''
 ''We are the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the world,'' she said, at a meeting of the U.S.-China Clean Energy Forum, an alliance of Chinese economic officials and American leaders from business and government. ''We have a responsibility to ourselves, to each other and to the world. We must work together.''
 After Wednesday's meeting with Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Wen appeared to agree. ''China will cement policy dialogue with the United States, take the joint tackling of climate change as an important aspect of cooperation, and push for positive results in the Copenhagen climate change conference,'' the successor to the 1997 meeting in Kyoto, Japan, which produced the last global warming agreement.
 Much of the world is looking to the United States and China, which together emit nearly half the world's climate-changing gases, to find common ground on a new treaty that will reduce pollutants.
 The United States has said that any new global climate agreement will have to restrict the growth of emissions in China, the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases. 
 Just last week, however, China issued a new position paper on climate change that rejected any mandatory caps on its emissions and demanded that wealthy countries provide at least .5 percent to 1 percent of their gross domestic product to help developing countries upgrade technology and cope with the results of climate change.
 A bill being considered by the House would compel the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to at least 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and to 83 percent below by 2050. But that plan is well below the opening demand by Chinese leaders, who want developed nations to reduce 2020 emissions by 40 percent from 1995 levels, and it falls short of commitments by the European Union as well. 
 American officials have already rejected the Chinese proposal as unattainable. The Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning research organization, said in a report published Wednesday that the House legislation was unlikely to win enough Chinese support for the two nations to present a united front at the Copenhagen talks in December.
 A leading Beijing expert on climate change economics, Zhang Shiqiu, said Wednesday that she was optimistic that the two nations would reach some accord on global warming before the Copenhagen meeting. But she also cautioned that American negotiators needed to appreciate the steps that China had already taken to improve its environment.
 ''Many Chinese -- not only politicians, but academic society and the general public -- would say that before the U.S. blames China, the U.S. should clean up first,'' said Ms. Zhang, a professor of environmental economics and policy at Peking University.
 By some estimates, China's huge package of stimulus spending aimed at addressing the global economic crisis includes more measures aimed at improving energy efficiency than the American package. The economic downturn has also reduced energy use, though most likely temporarily.
 But China remains highly inefficient in energy use by global standards. And its rapidly expanding industrial economy, with its dependence on electricity from coal-fired power plants, is by far the world's fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide emissions.

HEADLINE: Miles to Go in China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Worried about heavy reliance on imported oil, Chinese officials have drafted automotive fuel economy standards that are even more stringent than those outlined by President Obama last week, Chinese experts with a detailed knowledge of the plans said on Wednesday.
 The new plan would require automakers in China to improve fuel economy by an additional 18 percent by 2015, said An Feng, a leading architect of China's existing fuel economy regulations who is now the president of the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation, a nonprofit group in Beijing. 
 The plan is going through the interagency approval process, with comments sought from automakers, and is scheduled for release early next year, he said.
 The Chinese government tends to make few changes in automotive regulations once the interagency review process has started.
 The average fuel economy of family vehicles in China is already higher than in the United States, mainly because cars in China tend to be considerably smaller than those in the United States -- and are getting even smaller because of recent tax changes. 
 Cars with small fuel-sipping engines are now subject to a 1 percent sales tax, while sports cars and sport utility vehicles with the largest engines are subject to a 40 percent sales tax. Stricter fuel economy standards have won support from four interest groups within the Chinese government, said a Chinese government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue.
 Many in the government see a strategic and geopolitical need to reduce China's reliance on oil imports, the official said. China was self-sufficient in oil until 1995, but soaring demand means that China now imports nearly three-fifths of its oil, much of it from potentially unstable countries along sea lanes controlled by the United States Navy.
 Others in the government are concerned about limiting toxic air pollution and see reductions in the total combustion of gasoline as one way to achieve this. Still other officials are worried about the potential for international efforts to limit China's emissions of global warming gases, or view greater fuel economy as a way to increase the competitiveness of Chinese car exports.
 ''Different stakeholders have different views,'' the official said.
 China uses a different system from the United States to regulate fuel economy. China sets minimum standards for each of 16 weight categories and tests only urban fuel economy, not highway driving.
 Adjusting for these differences is difficult and controversial. Mr. An estimated that the average new car, minivan or sport utility vehicle in China already gets the equivalent of 35.8 miles a gallon this year based on the American measurement system of corporate averages and will be required to get 42.2 miles a gallon in 2015.
 By comparison, President Obama announced last week that each automaker will be required to reach a corporate average of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016.
 The details of China's new fuel economy standards may favor domestic automakers at the expense of multinationals, several auto industry officials said. That is because the new rules call for the steepest increases in fuel economy -- as much as 26 percent -- for midsize and compact cars, market segments where multinationals are strong. Subcompacts, a market where domestic automakers are stronger, will be required to increase their gas mileage by as little as 9 percent compared with the existing standards, which took effect on Jan. 1.
 Large cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles will face percentage increases between those extremes. The Chinese government had already cracked down on these vehicles by setting very high gas mileage benchmarks for them as part of the existing rules.
 When told late Wednesday of China's gas mileage plans, Michael Dunne, the managing director for China at J. D. Power & Associates, the consulting firm, said that Japanese, Korean and German automakers had models of very small cars that they might start building in China if they have trouble meeting the new standards for larger models.
 ''The short-term impact is it would favor the Chinese, no doubt about it,'' he said. ''Global automakers care so deeply about this market that they'll do whatever it takes, and adjust.''
 Automakers were cautious in their responses to the Chinese initiative.
 ''Ford China is pleased to be part of the industry consultation process on fuel efficiency,'' said Whitney Small, a Ford spokeswoman. ''Given our role in the process, it would not be appropriate for us to comment prematurely on an ongoing discussion.''
 Several auto industry officials said that while a substantial increase in fuel economy standards is inevitable, two other issues have not yet been resolved.
 One issue is how China treats imports. The current fuel-economy standards ban the production of any vehicle in China that does not meet the minimum requirement for its vehicle weight range. But imports are exempt, so practically all of the sport cars and large sport utility vehicles sold in China are imported.
 One possibility is to tax imported or domestically produced vehicles that fall short of the standard instead of banning them. The United States does this. But new taxes are bureaucratically complex to impose in China. Imports made up only 1.9 percent of China's car market in the first four months of this year because of heavy import taxes.
 The other unresolved issue is whether China will impose corporate average fuel economy standards in addition to minimum standards for each vehicle weight range, auto industry officials said. This would make it harder for companies to specialize in larger vehicles that may consume more fuel but may also be more profitable.

HEADLINE: South Koreans Express Fatigue With a Recalcitrant North

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: PAJU, South Korea 

 BODY:
Peering at North Korea in the hazy distance from the demilitarized zone, standing under an upbeat mural trumpeting improved relations between the separated countries, a visitor from South Korea struck a skeptical note. 
 ''We sent them food, fertilizer, factories, more than we give our own poor people,'' said the South Korean, Lee Soon-hwan, a 30-year-old office worker. ''And all they pay us back with is this nuclear test.''
 After years of hope that relations with the North would thaw if the South tried to coax it into engagement, regional experts and others speak of growing disenchantment. Many South Koreans reacted with exasperation and even anger to North Korea's nuclear test on Monday, uncharacteristically harsh responses in a country that has long been more tolerant of its unruly northern neighbor than have its allies in Washington and Tokyo. 
 Partly, the reaction reflects the outrage here at the timing of the test, coming as South Korea was in mourning over the suicide of a former president on Saturday. 
 But there are also signs of fatigue with a recalcitrant North that has responded to the South's largess by continuing to build up its nuclear arsenal.
 ''There has been a paradigm shift in how South Koreans view North Korea,'' said Jeung Young-tai, a North Korea expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification. ''The nuclear test has made people feel that North Korea has gone too far, and it's high time for us to be tough on North Korea.''
 The engagement policy followed years of enforced separation and relentless anti-North propaganda that ignored South Korea's deep emotional bonds with the other half of the peninsula, forced apart, as they see it, by big-power politics during the cold war. The so-called sunshine policy began in the late 1990s and was broadly popular, even surviving the first North Korean nuclear test in 2006. 
 But Mr. Jeung said that people now felt no safer after 10 years of engagement and that the latest nuclear test, along with the North's test-firing of a long-range rocket last month, had driven home to many in South Korea their need to build up their own military, and stick with their traditional ally, the United States. 
 Such a shift may bring South Korea closer in many ways to Washington. A sign came Tuesday, when President Lee Myung-bak announced that South Korea would belatedly join the Proliferation Security Initiative, an American-led program to intercept ships suspected of carrying unconventional weapons. The South had refrained from joining for fear of angering the North.
 At the same time, fundamental differences with the United States remain. While Washington has in the past spoken of blockades and further isolating North Korea, few South Koreans are talking about cutting off aid and economic relations completely. 
 Instead, the South Korean public appears ready to accept continued engagement, but with new demands that North Korea also show good faith, particularly by curtailing its weapons program. 
 Still, even talk of imposing conditions on aid suggests a shift in attitudes for South Koreans, who have long viewed the North as a proud but poor cousin that should be tolerated and led toward eventually peaceful reunification. Such sentiments guided South Korean policy for a decade, as Seoul opened an industrial park and a mountain resort in the North, and extended it hundreds of millions of dollars in aid.
 Those ties began to sour after the election last year of Mr. Lee, a conservative who said aid should be offered only if the North ended its nuclear program. Weariness with the North has also grown over the past year, after the North responded to Mr. Lee's tougher stance by temporarily closing access to the Kaesong industrial park, detaining a South Korean accused of slandering the North Korean government, and test-firing a long-range rocket in April.
 ''South Koreans are feeling frustration and fatigue with the North Korea relationship,'' said Daniel Pinkston, North East Asia deputy project director at International Crisis Group, an nonprofit organization that tries to prevent deadly conflicts. ''They want more reciprocity.''
 While there have been no recent public opinion polls, the shift has begun emerging in online chat rooms and newspaper opinion articles, like one in JoongAng Ilbo on Wednesday entitled ''Stop Being Suckers for Kim Jong-il.'' 
 The tougher attitudes were also apparent in more than a dozen recent street interviews with South Koreans at places like the Unification Observatory in Paju, an hour northwest of Seoul overlooking the demilitarized zone. 
 Many of those interviewed said they were frustrated that North Korea seemed to be pushing their country around, although the South was the one opening its pocketbook. And while no one called for cutting off the North outright, most agreed that South Korea should get more benefits, and more respect, for its money.
 ''I'm tired of the whole relationship,'' said Kim Bong-jin, 52, who owns a machinery factory nearby. ''The past administrations have supported North Korea too excessively, and the result is nuclear weapons.''
 His friend, Lim Jae-hyung, 52, a technician, said, ''We have the money, we should be getting more from it.'' 
 From the observatory, the vastly different levels of wealth between the Koreas were plainly visible. In the North Korean town of Maegol, people could be seen walking along dirt roads between gray buildings with no vehicles in sight. By contrast, a busy six-lane highway cut through Paju, a popular tourist area with a go-kart track, a drive-in theater and rows of gaudy ''love'' hotels.
 While conservatives have always taken a hard line toward the North, many on the left who supported the sunshine policy also say they are fed up with the North Koreans. This was particularly evident among supporters of former President Roh Moo-hyun, who jumped to his death on Saturday. A suicide note suggested that he was despondent about a corruption investigation.
 Mr. Roh had pursued friendly engagement with the North, and many of those who mourned him at makeshift altars on Wednesday expressed anger at the North over the nuclear test, which they called an unforgivable show of callous disregard.
 ''It is unbelievable that they would do this at such a sad and sensitive time,'' said one mourner, Kang Han-seung.

HEADLINE: Bring Zimbabwe In From the Cold

BYLINE: By GREG MILLS and JEFFREY HERBST. 
Greg Mills is the director of the Brenthurst Foundation, a research organization in Johannesburg that promotes economic growth in Africa. Jeffrey Herbst, the provost of Miami University of Ohio, is the author of ''States and Power in Africa.''

 BODY:
AFTER years of rightly criticizing President Robert Mugabe's authoritarian rule in Zimbabwe, Western countries now face a different, and difficult, set of decisions. 
 Since February, Zimbabwe has operated under a unity government led by Mr. Mugabe with the opposition's leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, as prime minister. Had last year's elections been free and fair, Mr. Tsvangirai would have been elected president, but instead of continuing to contest the results he eventually agreed to serve as prime minister. The transition has not been smooth; cabinet posts have been divided up awkwardly, while many people inside and outside the country have criticized Mr. Tsvangirai for seemingly being co-opted by Mr. Mugabe. 
 As a result, Western governments have been standoffish even though the unity government has taken important steps, notably lowering Zimbabwe's 231 million percent inflation by abandoning the Zimbabwean dollar in favor of the American dollar and other foreign currencies. Last week, for example, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the United States wasn't ready to resume aid to Zimbabwe and urged the ouster of Mr. Mugabe, while other Western donors have said they will not provide significant development assistance until there is firm evidence that the power-sharing agreement is working. Human Rights Watch has gone further by arguing that development aid should not be released until there are ''irreversible changes on human rights, the rule of law and accountability.''
 The reluctance of Western governments and human rights groups to embrace the current Zimbabwean government is understandable. There is, in particular, no real reason to believe that Mr. Mugabe, after decades of dictatorial rule and abuse, has suddenly embraced multiparty democracy. If he had, after all, he would not be president now.
 But Zimbabwe may well be a case where the best is the enemy of the good. Mr. Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change, went into the unity government with its eyes open. ''We had won the election but we did not have the support of the military,'' Mr. Tsvangirai told us this month in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital. ''We did not want to be the authors of chaos. Instead we need to soft-land the crisis, stabilize the situation through peace and stability and democratic consolidation.'' Accordingly, he views Mr. Mugabe as ''both part of the problem and part of the solution: we cannot untangle the tentacles of the state without him.'' 
 Mr. Tsvangirai has set himself the difficult task of trying to dislodge Mr. Mugabe's ousted party from the state apparatus that it has controlled for more than a quarter-century. In many countries that process would require extensive violence against the regime. The ''soft landing'' that the Movement for Democratic Change has chosen is a difficult path but one which it has firm strategic reasons to opt for, reasons that deserve more careful consideration from international donors.
 And Mr. Tsvangirai and Zimbabwe need help desperately. Per capita income is half what it was in 1997. Once the largest economy in the region after South Africa, Zimbabwe is now the smallest, after tiny Swaziland and Lesotho. 
 The United Nations calculates that just 6 percent of the work force is formally employed. More than 65 percent of the population urgently needs food assistance. Nearly 100,000 people have been struck by cholera in the last six months. While it used to be called the breadbasket of southern Africa, Zimbabwe now produces only about one-third of the grain it needs; tobacco, once its main export crop, has fallen to around one-sixth of the 2000 peak, the effect of the seizure of white-owned farms begun in earnest this decade. 
 Revealing as they are, these figures do not tell the full story. Take the University of Zimbabwe. Once a prestigious southern African institution, today it is without functioning sewers or running water. Many of its 12,000 students have left, its two teaching hospitals close intermittently, and departments like geology and surveying are shuttered. Lacking chemicals and equipment, the chemistry department stopped all experiments in 2007. 
 To consolidate progress, donors should end their ambivalence about the unity government and begin to support Mr. Tsvangirai's aims. Development assistance can be allocated directly. Replenishing the hospitals and re-equipping schools are measurable and defined projects. More generally, Western governments and nongovernmental organizations should become more publicly enthusiastic about the unity government, especially because they haven't been able to offer a better option. 
 The Movement for Democratic Change has also recognized that the only way to deal with the tsunami of advisers and aid agencies that will eventually come is to establish a single entry point into the government for donors, likely in the prime minister's office, instead of allowing aid to go directly to ministries that may be run by Mugabe partisans. Donors should support this effort as a way to strengthen Mr. Tsvangirai.
 There will be setbacks in Zimbabwe, but they can be overcome. As Mr. Tsvangirai told us, ''Ask any Zimbabwean in the street -- no one wants to reverse the process.'' Instead of standing back and waiting, donors should do their part to help bring Zimbabwe back from the brink.

HEADLINE: Haitians Here Illegally Study Rumors for Signs Of Pause in Deportation

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
For Danie, who moved from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to the United States in 2001 to live with her grandparents, there has never been a good time to go home. 
 Haiti, which has stumbled from grave political unrest to catastrophic natural disasters, remains one of the world's poorest nations. So although Danie, 22, is an illegal immigrant, she has decided to stay in New York City. She lives in Cambria Heights, Queens, and is about to graduate from college with a degree in education. She hopes to become an elementary school teacher, but fears that her lack of a Social Security number will leave her few options beyond doing menial labor in an underground economy. 
 The desperation of Haitians was underscored this month when at least nine people drowned after their boat -- crowded mostly with people fleeing Haiti -- sank off the Florida coast. 
 ''Things are easier here,'' Danie said, speaking on condition that she not be identified by her full name because she feared detection. ''There's more security, people find food easier, you have money, somewhere to stay.'' 
 But Haitians in New York -- the city with the largest population of Haitian descent outside Port-au-Prince -- are hopeful about a proposal under consideration by the Obama administration that would provide relief for her and tens of thousands of other illegal Haitian immigrants.
 After four hurricanes and tropical storms in 2008 killed hundreds of people, wiped out most of Haiti's food crops and caused nearly a billion dollars in damage, the country's government asked the United States to grant undocumented Haitian immigrants what is known as temporary protected status. The designation would shield them from detention and deportation for a set period of time, and allow them to work legally, while Haiti tries to recover.
 Such relief has occasionally been granted to immigrants who are unable to return safely to their home countries because of armed conflict or environmental disasters. It is currently in effect for people from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Somalia and Sudan. 
 Supporters of temporary protected status for Haitians say that Haiti is in no condition to absorb tens of thousands of deportees, and that its recovery may depend, at least in part, on a continuing flow of remittances sent home by illegal Haitian immigrants in the United States. Those remittances totaled $1.87 billion last year, according to estimates by the Inter-American Development Bank. 
 The Bush administration denied Haiti's request in December. In February, the Obama administration, in a letter from the Department of Homeland Security to immigration advocates in Miami, said it would continue to deport Haitians. And anti-immigration lobbying groups have vowed to oppose any change in the policy. 
 But immigrant advocates and the Haitian diaspora's civic leadership have continued to apply pressure on the administration and pore over the tea leaves of rumors and leaks for indications of a policy shift. 
 They say that in recent weeks, they have drawn hope from a number of developments. In April, on the eve of a trip to Haiti, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the administration was reviewing its deportation policy for Haitians. During the trip, she also spoke about the importance of remittances to Haiti.
 Haitian advocates in New York say they have heard that the government has been detaining and deporting only those with criminal records, rather than those accused solely of immigration violations. 
 Barbara Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the government would continue to detain and deport Haitians who violate immigration laws but that under a recently executed agreement with the Haitian government, the American immigration authorities were focusing on those with criminal records.
 ''Our priority -- and we've clearly articulated it -- is removing those who are criminal aliens and have final orders of removal,'' she said.
 Ricot Dupuy, the manager of Radio Soleil, a Creole-language station with storefront offices on Nostrand Avenue in Flatbush, Brooklyn, said that suggestions of changing sentiment in Washington seemed to have calmed Haitians in New York.
 ''It's kind of quieted down because of the belief that with Obama, they stand a better chance,'' said Mr. Dupuy, who is the host of a nightly radio program of news analysis and social commentary. 
 In interviews, about two dozen Haitians and Haitian-Americans in Brooklyn and Queens said that if the Obama administration accelerated deportations, it would tear apart their community, splinter families and add a crushing burden on their homeland.
 ''Haiti cannot take another burden,'' said Mathieu Eugene, a Haitian-American member of the City Council who represents Flatbush and other Brooklyn neighborhoods with large Haitian populations. Last month, the Council unanimously approved a resolution he sponsored in support of protected status for Haitians.
 One recent morning at La Baguette Shop, a Haitian bakery in Cambria Heights that sells baked goods with a French influence, like pain au chocolat, the owners and several customers discussed the state of affairs in Haiti and the effects of deportation.
 Katie Richard, a home health care aide in her 40s who emigrated from Haiti, said she was particularly concerned about young Haitians who were brought to the United States as small children, raised as Americans and were now being deported to a country they did not know. 
 ''He doesn't know anybody -- he doesn't have any family,'' she said. ''It's bad for them. It's bad for us, too.'' 
 Advocates for Haitian immigrants say that if the Obama administration approves protected status, the measure would most likely apply only to Haitians who were in the United States before the inauguration. But some opponents of temporary protection fear that it would encourage more Haitians to make perilous sea crossings in hopes of being grandfathered in. 
 Others complain that while temporary protections for immigrants can sometimes be justified, the government has been too liberal in extending the time frames. Temporary protected status ''should be used just to stop the flow back home for a relatively short period of time until a country gets back somewhat to where normal was before the emergency,'' said Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, a public policy group that seeks to reduce immigration.
 While no one knows exactly how many Haitians would be eligible for protected status, Ms. Gonzalez, the immigration spokeswoman, said about 30,000 in the United States have exhausted their legal options and face final court-issued deportation orders. Many more are still in litigation or have not yet come to the attention of the authorities, officials say. 
 Haiti's long history of hardship has made its citizens realists. Many in New York made it clear that in spite of the hopeful signs for protected status, they were not holding their breath. And those here illegally said that regardless of the outcome, they still planned to press forward with their lives in the United States.
 ''They stay until they catch them and send them back,'' said one illegal Haitian immigrant in Cambria Heights, a day laborer and father of two, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
 Then he considered one positive side of being deported. ''If they catch you, they buy a ticket for you!'' he said. His laughter was that of a man who knew he was at least free to make fun of his own situation.

HEADLINE: Stalemate at Ground Zero

 BODY:
After yet another impasse between the developer and the owner of the World Trade Center site, Mayor Michael Bloomberg invited the big players to Gracie Mansion last week. Around the table were the developer, Larry Silverstein; Gov. David Paterson of New York; Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey; Sheldon Silver, the New York Assembly speaker; and staff galore. 
 It was not exactly the quiet setting for complicated negotiations but it did emphasize the importance of resolving this latest disagreement quickly and fairly. If not, the Sept. 11 memorial is unlikely to be ready in time for the 10th anniversary of the attacks. 
 Mr. Silverstein and top officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, are barely talking to one another. He wants to reopen a 2006 building agreement with the authority, citing delays by the authority and the weakness in the economy. 
 At the mayor's meeting, Mr. Silverstein made his pitch that the authority should use its money to help him build two skyscrapers that the private market won't finance in the current climate. Basically he is asking the authority, which has limited resources and many other demands, to get even deeper into real estate speculation. 
 The authority should instead be focusing on what it has already committed to: building the substructure for the 16-acre site, the Calatrava PATH terminal and the tallest tower. The authority's designers have also come up with an interim proposal to build multistory bases for some of Mr. Silverstein's towers. Those could house retail shops until the market needs more skyscrapers. 
 The authority's board has authorized over $800 million so far to help with Mr. Silverstein's financing. The mayor and his dealmakers should not drain any more of the funds the authority needs to maintain and manage the bridges, tunnels, ports, terminals and airports in the metropolitan area. We all want the ground zero memorial and the other structures finished. But it cannot come at the expense of the authority's primary mission.

HEADLINE: In the Gilded World of Per Se's Kitchen

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
In the kitchen of Per Se, the wallet-busting restaurant on Columbus Circle, there is a sign of blue tiles reading ''Sense of Urgency'' on the wall. That -- the urgency -- arrived a little early last month when, at 6:15 one evening, there were already eight tickets -- seven tasting menus and an a la carte snapper -- stacked up on the rail.
 The pleasant hush of the cocktail hour was over, and three calottes de boeuf grillee were sputtering like split wicks in a pan. Platters clanked; saucepans sizzled; the harried garde manger was fidgeting with his peach palms. The servers at the marble-countered ''pass'' -- there to receive the finished dishes -- shifted from one foot to the other like gamblers waiting anxiously at the track. 
 Then another dupe came in, and David Breeden, the head chef for the evening, called the ticket loud enough for everyone to hear. ''Order for two -- one tasting, one veg!'' he shouted like a captain of artillery. ''One and one!'' the kitchen shouted back. 
 You would think that in a lingering recession, the real urgency at Per Se would come from money matters, from the natural inclination of budget-conscious eaters to set aside their Visas for the moment and sate themselves on $13 Kung Pao chicken dinners instead of on a menu whose base cost is $275 a head. 
 But in fact, the kitchen -- 5,000 steel-and-tile square feet of it -- is a lesson in the little-known field of gastro-economics: When it comes to fine dining in New York, the fiscal situation is often irrelevant. Elites will always and forever be elites.
 ''People are still going out to eat,'' said Jonathan Benno, the chef de cuisine. While Per Se has endured a 10 percent drop in reservations and has started offering a less expensive a la carte Salon Menu in the lounge, Chef Benno said that this provided the chance ''for the concierge at the Mandarin to call up Mr. and Mrs. Smith from Chicago and quickly slip them in.''
 His kitchen, which is brighter than a beach house (and only slightly smaller than the dining room itself), has something akin to a gold vault or the Queen of England's bedroom, existing in an atmosphere above such trivial indignities as battered stock portfolios and recessionary slumps. Even as the rest of the planet scrapes together money for the rent check, there seems no end to the bountiful provisions that stream in through its doors: 30 two-pound pompanos from Florida; a box of fresh langoustines from Scotland; 20 whole rabbits from Vermont.
 The space itself is endlessly divided, with separate sub-kitchens devoted to pastries, ice cream, bread, fish, spices, produce, animal and vegetable stocks and the rendering of freshly butchered meat. The main -- or cooking -- kitchen is an inhumanly immaculate expanse of burner rings and countertops where, according to tradition, the stations move clockwise from canape to entremetier. Above it all, there is a video screen with a real-time uplink to Per Se's sister restaurant, the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif., four time zones and 3,000 miles away.
 By 8 o'clock, the dupes were 20 deep, and Mr. Breeden called successive orders with a scowl. There was $5,500 on the rail, and out there, in the untouched world, somebody was paying for it all.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Cures A Bankruptcy, But Tests Loom

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Detroit and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.

 BODY:
When President Obama announced the government's reorganization plan for Chrysler in late April, he promised the bankruptcy would be ''quick,'' ''efficient,'' and ''controlled.''
 And Chrysler is, in fact, hurtling through the process and appears on track to emerge soon as a new company, just one month after its Chapter 11 filing.
 Then the hard part begins. 
 Chrysler will have lower labor costs, less debt, and a new partner in the Italian automaker Fiat. But it will be competing in a brutal marketplace that may make bankruptcy court seem, by comparison, like a refuge.
 Americans are hardly in a car-buying mood, and people who are shopping are steering clear of Chrysler showrooms.
 Part of the reason is the cloud of bankruptcy hanging over the company. General Motors, which is also on the brink of filing for Chapter 11, is also losing customers because of its fragile financial condition and uncertain future.
 But Chrysler is even more vulnerable than G.M. because its products are heavily tilted to pickups, minivans, and sport utility vehicles that have fallen out of favor with fuel-conscious consumers. Fiat has promised to add small and sporty cars to Chrysler's lineup, but they won't be available for nearly two years.
 Chrysler, which has been subsisting on federal loans since the beginning of the year, will also need to stretch the $7 billion it is getting from the Treasury Department to cover its losses until the Fiat alliance starts paying off. 
 To save money, Chrysler has idled most of its plants so it can sell off a big backlog of new cars and it drastically scaled back spending to develop new products. 
 ''We have to see the consumer supporting this company by buying their product, which hasn't been happening,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with the research firm IHS Global Insight. ''Just because they emerge from bankruptcy doesn't mean that all of their problems will be solved, by any stretch of the imagination.''
 With its court hearings moving quickly -- even two months would be considered lightning-quick -- a newly reorganized Chrysler could come out of bankruptcy as early as next week.
 When it emerges, the company will have a new ownership structure, with a union retiree trust owning 55 percent, Fiat holding a 20 percent share that could eventually grow to 35 percent, and the United States and Canadian governments owning minority stakes.
 It will also have a new board, and a new chairman -- C. Robert Kidder, the former chairman of Borden Chemical and of Duracell. 
 Fiat's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, may also run Chrysler. He is already delving into Chrysler's future product plans and suggesting changes, according to people in the company.
 Although Fiat will provide small cars, new engines and advanced technology to Chrysler, the Italian automaker will not put any money into its new partner.
 For all the challenges it faces, Chrysler at least will have a chance to succeed, analysts said, because the company has shed its debt, cut workers and factories, and funded half of its health care obligations to retirees with stock.
 ''Only time will tell, but certainly all these changes put the company in a position where it can be competitive,'' said Mark DeGennaro, a bankruptcy expert at the firm Gruppo, Levey & Company.
 While it represents a new beginning for the 84-year-old company, Chrysler has stumbled in two previous attempts to reinvent itself.
 In 1998, the German automaker Daimler-Benz stunned the auto world by absorbing Chrysler in a $36 billion merger.
 However, the marriage of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars and Chrysler trucks and S.U.V.'s failed, and Daimler put the American division up for sale in 2007.
 Its next owner, the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, tried to streamline Chrysler and then find alliances with other automakers that would broaden its product lineup. That strategy also stumbled, which, along with a weak economy, led to Chrysler's bankruptcy filing on April 30. 
 The process has been pushed along quickly and methodically by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez. The hearings have shed new light on Chrysler's troubles. 
 One of the first witnesses during Wednesday's hearing, on the sale of many of the automaker's best assets to a newly reconstituted Chrysler, was Thomas W. LaSorda, who retired last month as Chrysler's vice chairman.
 In his testimony, Mr. LaSorda recounted how he had scoured the world last year for partners or buyers for Chrysler. He discussed deals that fell through with Nissan and G.M., and failed efforts to get Korean and Indian auto companies interested in creating alliances with Chrysler.
 An attorney for a group of Indiana state pension funds, which is opposing the sale, pressed Mr. LaSorda as to whether Chrysler could have sold the company rather than strike a noncash deal with Fiat.
 ''Nobody was willing to give us a nickel,'' Mr. LaSorda said.
 Fiat's offer to provide small, fuel-efficient cars, he said, was ''just as good as cash or better.''
 After 32 years in the auto business with G.M. and Chrysler, Mr. LaSorda said it was clear to him that the company would continue to spiral downward unless it could update its vehicle lineup.
 The Indiana pension funds' attorney, Glenn Kurtz, spent much of Wednesday's hearing arguing that Chrysler's secured lenders, including the funds, could have gotten more money from a liquidation than the $2 billion from the Treasury to eliminate nearly $7 billion in debt.
 Mr. Kurtz produced several e-mail messages between Chrysler executives and consultants, and members of the presidential auto task force that, he said, showed the bankruptcy case was being ''hurried.''

HEADLINE: Some Apparel Makers and Retailers Surpass Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Several apparel makers and retailers, including Polo Ralph Lauren, posted better-than-expected quarterly results Wednesday, helped by tight management of expenses and inventories. 
 American Eagle Outfitters, which topped expectations by a penny, said it was seeing early indications of its business stabilizing.
 Expectations have declined for apparel retailers and manufacturers, which are among the hardest hit sectors in the recession as consumers trim spending for items other than essentials like food.
 Polo, a fashion wholesaler and retailer with upscale brands like Polo and Club Monaco, said net income tumbled to $45 million, or 44 cents a share, from $103.5 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier.
 But excluding charges, Polo said it earned 86 cents a share, soaring past analysts' average estimate of 40 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Revenue in the period, which ended March 28 and was the fourth quarter of Lauren's fiscal year, fell 1 percent to $1.22 billion, hurt by same-store sales declines and the stronger dollar, which reduced the value of overseas sales.
 Stock in Lauren, which is based in New York, declined 35 cents, to close at $54.03 a share.
 American Eagle, which caters to teenagers, posted a profit of $22 million, or 11 cents a share, down from $43.9 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding one-time items, profit was 8 cents a share, better than the 7 cents a share forecast by analysts.
 Sales in the period, which ended May 2 and was the first quarter of American Eagle's fiscal year, fell 4 percent, to $612 million.
 Stock in American Eagle, which is based in Pittsburgh, fell 15 cents, to close at $14.33 a share.

HEADLINE: Geithner Preparing for Trip to China

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Timothy F. Geithner, who before his confirmation as Treasury secretary unintentionally charged that China was ''manipulating'' its currency, will make his first trip to that country since taking office and meet with its leaders next week amid rising concern about China's willingness to continue buying United States debt.
 The Treasury announced on Wednesday that Mr. Geithner had meetings scheduled with President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice Premier Wang Quishan. He will also promote American business interests and press the case for both countries, which are the world's biggest emitters of the heat-trapping gases that contribute to climate change, to work to limit the pollution. 
 During his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Mr. Geithner vexed Chinese officials when, in written answers to questions from senators, Mr. Geithner wrote that ''President Obama -- backed by the conclusions of a broad range of economists -- believes that China is manipulating its currency.''
 Under a 1988 law, if the administration formally reports to Congress that China is intentionally holding down the value of its currency, the renminbi, and in turn the price of its exports, such a finding could lead to the imposition of trade barriers.
 Treasury officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, later said that Mr. Geithner's written comment about China's currency had been mistakenly included in his responses to senators, and that the administration was not signaling a more confrontational stance than the Bush administration had taken toward trade with China.
 As the officials recounted, after Mr. Geithner ended his oral testimony, members of the Senate Finance Committee had submitted scores of questions that had to be answered before the panel's vote on his nomination the next morning. Treasury aides worked all night to complete them, using a compilation of Mr. Obama's campaign statements.
 One of those was the president's comment that China manipulates its currency, a charge that is popular with the unions that are a major force in Democratic politics. Many labor unions believe that, by pegging the renminbi to the dollar, the Chinese give their exports an unfair trade advantage over more expensive American products. 
 That the administration would now back off that statement is another example, along with Mr. Obama's struggles to end the war in Iraq and close the prison at Guantanamo, of the difficulties of reconciling campaign promises and governing realities.
 Treasury officials have not indicated whether currency rates will be on the agenda. Perhaps the chief issue facing global markets is the extent to which China will continue investing heavily in Treasury bills. 
 If China believes the dollar is going to decline in the future, given the ballooning United States debt, it could reduce its purchases. Investors worry that a spat over currency issues could push China to reduce its investments in Treasuries, putting the American economy at risk.
 Mr. Geithner's China trip has been long planned but falls at an inopportune time. Monday is the deadline by which a Treasury-led auto task force must decide whether to force General Motors into bankruptcy protection. The administration is expected to choose the bankruptcy route and to take a 70 percent stake.
 Mr. Geithner will speak on economic relations at Peking University on Monday and visit the Beijing Capital Museum to recognize American companies' role in China's economic development, including on clean energy.
 In an event with personal meaning, Mr. Geithner will meet with officials of the Ford Foundation. His father, Peter F. Geithner, oversaw the foundation's Asia development programs; the family lived in India and Thailand. In a coincidence only recently confirmed, the elder Geithner was in charge of a program for which Mr. Obama's mother worked in Indonesia, where Mr. Obama spent four years as a child.

HEADLINE: Toys 'R' Us Makes Deal For Schwarz

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Toys ''R'' Us announced early Thursday that it had bought F. A. O. Schwarz, one of the oldest toy retailers in the nation and a staple on Fifth Avenue, where the flagship store is guarded by rosy-cheeked toy soldiers. 
 ''At its core this is about one of the world's greatest brands,'' Gerald L. Storch, chairman and chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us, said in an interview on Wednesday after the deal was completed. ''It's a store that's steeped in tradition as well as popular culture.'' 
 Mr. Storch declined to say how much Toys ''R'' Us, the ubiquitous toy and baby supplies store, paid for F. A. O. Schwarz, a privately owned company he had wanted to acquire for several years.
 Founded in 1862 and visited by millions of people each year, F. A. O. Schwarz has become part of the fabric of New York City. A Christmastime visit is a tradition for many families, if only to gawk at stuffed animals that are so enormous, children cannot get their arms -- let alone their minds -- around them. 
 The store also had a classic role in a scene in the 1988 movie ''Big,'' in which Tom Hanks uses his feet to bang out ''Chopsticks'' and ''Heart and Soul'' on a giant keyboard. Mr. Storch said a keyboard is still on display on the store's second floor. ''There's not a kid or an adult alive that doesn't remember Tom Hanks in 'Big' at F. A. O. Schwarz.'' 
 There is one other F. A. O. Schwarz toy store, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, where shoppers are greeted by an animated Trojan horse. Toys ''R'' Us is buying both stores, as well as the company's Web site and catalog operations. F. A. O. Schwarz stores inside Macy's will be phased out by November. 
 Toys ''R'' Us underscored that it would operate all the F. A. O. Schwarz businesses under the F. A. O. Schwarz name and maintain the hands-on shopping experience at the stores. 
 Mr. Storch said he had no immediate plans to build any additional F. A. O. Schwarz stores. At the moment, he is focused on ''making sure that the customers from these stores feel like they're even better than they've been.''
 Sean McGowan, an analyst with Needham & Company, said F. A. O. Schwarz was once a chain of dozens of stores, ''but it's important for most people to be reminded how small F. A. O. has become.'' 
 Toys ''R'' Us is carrying billions of dollars of debt, though Mr. McGowan pointed out that the acquisition of F. A. O. Schwarz ''certainly shows some strength on Toys 'R' Us's part.'' 
 He said the acquisition would probably not cost the company much but could help raise its profile. ''The association with the premier toy brand in the world is probably a plus,'' he said. 
 Like many retailers, Toys ''R'' Us is using the economic downturn to take market share. This year, Toys ''R'' Us bought eToys.com, babyuniverse.com and the resource site ePregnancy.com. 
 The acquisitions help the company dominate the toy segment, leaving Wal-Mart and Target as its main competitors. 
 ''We feel that New York is a very important market,'' Mr. Storch said. F. A. O. Schwarz would also help it serve an international clientele, he said.
 F. A. O. Schwarz's chief executive, Barry Erdos, will not remain with the company after the sale. Toys ''R'' Us, which has more than 1,500 stores worldwide, said it would offer positions to all of the 300 employees at the New York and Las Vegas F. A. O. Schwarz locations. 
 F. A. O. Schwarz was bought by D. E. Shaw & Company in 2004. Toys ''R'' Us operated as a public company from 1978 until July 2005. At that time, an investment group consisting of affiliates of Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Vornado Realty Trust acquired the company for $6.6 billion.

JAPAN DAY
 In Japan no occasion is too small to warrant a gift. A visit to a friend, the signing of a lease or a return from a short trip is accompanied by a small token or simple cash. So it is no surprise that in 1912 the Japanese saw fit to send cherry trees to cities in the United States, including New York, where some took root in Central Park. 
 It was with this gift-giving spirit that three years ago the organizers of Japan Day at Central Park approached the task of mounting a celebration of their culture. 
 ''We really wanted to show our appreciation toward New York,'' said Kumiko Yoshii, the executive producer of Japan Day, who helped start the event. ''We're studying here, working here, doing business here, and New York as a community has welcomed us.'' 
 The token: On Sunday morning East Meadow will be transformed into hives of activity that surround a performance space. A tea ceremony, origami lessons and calligraphy making will be some of the offerings ringing the meadow, and more contemporary fare will be available in the form of miniature robot sumo battles and the ''real'' Hello Kitty. As if the festival weren't gift enough, visitors to these tents and others can collect stamps that make them eligible for a prize. And there will be a free Japanese food sampling area, with treats like gyudon (beef bowl) over rice and gyoza (dumplings). 
 The main draw here, though, is the performances. Grouped into three categories -- labeled cool, traditional and merely concert -- the roster includes the dancer Kenichi Ebina, who blends hip-hop and martial arts; Taro Masuda, a violinist from Japan who plays traditional music; Ai Kawashima, the chart-topping Japanese pop singer; and members of the International Karate Organization Kyokushinkaikan, above, who will conduct an interactive demonstration.
 Festivalgoers will also have the opportunity to show a little gratitude of their own. Visitors receive totes, wristbands and CDs in exchange for donations toward the Central Park Conservancy's cherry tree initiative. (Four-mile Japan Day run at 8 a.m. Festival: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., East Meadow, Central Park, 212-398-7145, japandaynyc.org/main; free.) MONICA DRAKE

HEADLINE: Organic Dairies Watch the Good Times Turn Bad

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: RANDOLPH CENTER, Vt. 

 BODY:
When Ken Preston went organic on his dairy farm here in 2005, he figured that doing so would guarantee him what had long been elusive: a stable, high price for the milk from his cows.
 Sure enough, his income soared 20 percent, and he could finally afford a Chevy Silverado pickup to help out. The dairy conglomerate that distributed his milk wanted everything Mr. Preston could supply. Supermarket orders were skyrocketing.
 But soon the price of organic feed shot up. Then the recession hit, and families looking to save on groceries found organic milk easy to do without. Ultimately the conglomerate, with a glut of product, said it would not renew his contract next month, leaving him with nowhere to sell his milk, a victim of trends that are crippling many organic dairy farmers from coast to coast. 
 For those farmers, the promises of going organic -- a steady paycheck and salvation for small family farms -- have collapsed in the last six months. As the trend toward organic food consumption slows after years of explosive growth, no sector is in direr shape than the $1.3 billion organic milk industry. Farmers nationwide have been told to cut milk production by as much as 20 percent, and many are talking of shutting down.
 ''I probably wouldn't have gone organic if I knew it would end this way,'' said Mr. Preston, 53.
 Here in New England, where dairy farms are as much a part of the landscape as whitewashed churches and rocky beaches, organic dairy farmers are bearing the brunt of the nationwide slowdown, in part because of the cost of transporting feed from the Midwest. The contracts of 10 of Maine's 65 organic dairies will not be renewed by HP Hood, one of the region's three large processors. In Vermont, 32 dairy farms have closed since Dec. 1, significantly altering the face of New England's dairy industry.
 ''We expect to lose a lot more farms this year,'' said Roger Allbee, Vermont's secretary of agriculture.
 Hood and the two other big processors, Horizon Organic and Organic Valley, say cutting contracts, pay and production are necessary to absorb overproduction and offset softening demand. Organic Valley, a nationwide cooperative, told Maine organic dairy farmers last month that its sales growth had dropped to near zero from about 20 percent six months ago.
 ''Our inventory is overstocked,'' said John B. Cleary, the cooperative's New England regional pool coordinator.
 For many farmers, the changes coincide with crushing debt resulting from the cost of turning organic, which can run hundreds of thousands of dollars. In addition, the price of organic feed has doubled in the last year. Credit has dried up for some, and others say it is nearly impossible to sell cows and so thin their herds. 
 And while processors project growth of about 6 percent in organic milk sales this year (a decline from the 12.7 percent reported for 2008 by the Organic Trade Association), some analysts say that forecast is far too optimistic. The United States Department of Agriculture says sales of organic whole milk in February were 2.5 percent lower than in February last year, with sales of organic reduced-fat milk 15 percent lower.
 ''We're in big trouble,'' said Craig Russell, an organic dairy farmer in Brookfield, Vt., who owes $500,000, mostly from converting his farm to organic in 2006. 
 Mr. Russell quit a day job as an accountant to farm full time last year. ''I made more money in six months than in five years of conventional farming,'' he said, but his farm is now barely hanging on. The price he receives from the distributor dropped another $1 per hundredweight on May 1, just when he most needed money to prepare for the summer grazing season. 
 ''It's going to cost me more to make milk than sell milk,'' he said. 
 In an effort to provide a safety net, Vermont last month expanded a low-interest loan program for farmers. 
 While most conventional farmers are accustomed to withstanding price volatility, ''organic hasn't weathered this kind of storm,'' said Mr. Allbee, the state's agriculture secretary. Farmers are finding that organic food is not for every consumer, he said, ''and doesn't guarantee that you will have a market forever.'' 
 Some farmers are considering selling their organic milk on the conventional market just to make some quick money. Others are looking to sell raw, or unpasteurized, milk directly to the public. The Vermont House of Representatives passed a bill this month to increase the amount of raw milk a farmer can sell that way.
 At the annual meeting of the Maine Organic Milk Producers last month in Waterville, farmers debated whether they could tap into the locavore movement, marketing their milk as local food. Russell Libby, the organization's executive director, wondered, ''Is it possible to produce a product with a Maine label on it?''
 Right now it is not, because some Maine milk is processed out of state. But farmers like Aaron Bell, whose contract with Hood will not be renewed when it expires, thinks the idea will save their farms. 
 ''We're so remote, we're high and dry otherwise,'' said Mr. Bell, whose farm is in Maine's easternmost reaches. ''Unless we find our own market.'' 
 Back in 2006, Mr. Bell carried the banner for organic dairy farming, appearing with his wife on Martha Stewart's show to promote small family farms. He still believes in organic food, but not so much in the business model.
 ''They say it's heaven for the small farmer,'' he said, ''but the small farmer is the one screaming the loudest right now.'' 
 Bruce Drinkman, who milks 60 cows on his organic farm in Glenwood City, Wis., has seen his income drop 40 percent since Jan. 1. To keep the farm going, he has dipped into his retirement savings and dropped his health insurance. But without a loan, his wife has had to draw money from her I.R.A. to help out.
 ''Our Plan B is if we don't have a decent year, we're done,'' said Mr. Drinkman, who has farmed for 30 years. 
 ''I'm 46,'' he said. ''I wonder what I will do if I can't farm anymore.''

HEADLINE: Savings on Labor Allow Work on Residential Skyscraper to Resume

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Two months ago, work stopped abruptly at the 37th floor of the 76-story Beekman Tower as the developer Bruce C. Ratner desperately sought to cut costs on the project, a glass and stainless steel apartment building in Lower Manhattan.
 Just as abruptly, work resumed this week on the tower, which will be the architect Frank Gehry's first skyscraper and the tallest residential building in the city. 
 The developer, who had threatened to cap the building at 40 stories, said he was able to retain Mr. Gehry's distinctive wavy-wall design and the tower's full height, while paring labor expenses and taking advantage of falling prices for construction materials and appliances for the tower's 900 apartments.
 Mr. Ratner, chief executive of Forest City Ratner Companies, is one of a dozen developers who have approved a long-awaited and unusual project-labor agreement in which the city's construction unions backed a series of concessions on work rules that proponents said would save builders as much as 20 percent on labor costs. Although some developers heatedly debate the exact value of the agreement, it is part of an effort to keep the building boom from running out of steam in the face of falling real estate prices and a severe recession.
 ''We're thrilled to be going back to work,'' said MaryAnne Gilmartin, an executive vice president of Forest City Ratner. ''It's a great project and a great building.''
 Gary La Barbera, president of the union alliance, the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, and Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers' Association, said the labor agreement was unprecedented and a first step in restructuring the New York construction industry. Already, they said, 12 projects representing more than $2 billion worth of construction activity and 10,000 jobs have applied for and received tentative approval.
 ''This agreement will help our industry and the city get back on its feet and working men and women back on jobs sites,'' Mr. La Barbera said.
 Other projects affected by the agreement include a hotel under construction at Eighth Avenue and 44th Street; a second Ratner tower under construction at 80 DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn; and Tower 111, a new 47-story building on West 32nd Street. Few of the 12 projects had actually stopped work, but the officials claimed that the agreement would allow the developments to proceed on a sound economic footing or to begin work. They said two dozen more projects are under consideration for the agreement.
 In a statement released by his office, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said: ''New York City's construction industry faces real challenges today, but labor and management in the industry are not content merely to wait for a national rebound. Instead, they are taking measures to do something about it now.''
 Still, some developers say the agreement is worth far less, perhaps only 8 percent in savings, and not enough to get some stalled projects moving again, especially in cases where they paid high prices for land. 
 ''God bless them,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''But I don't think they're going to save much money.''
 The history of the Beekman is a barometer of the undulations in the city's real estate market. The project was conceived in 2007, at the height of a construction boom. The luxury tower, which will stand 867 feet high, or slightly taller than Trump World Tower, near the United Nations, will include a public school on the first four floors and an ambulatory care center for New York Downtown Hospital.
 But by the time the site, south of the Brooklyn Bridge, had been excavated, Mr. Ratner, like many other developers, was unable to obtain a construction loan, and work halted in December 2007.
 It took the developer three months to raise $680 million for construction. In a nod to the softening market, Mr. Ratner switched from condominiums to rentals and modified Mr. Gehry's design, using a standard curtain wall instead of one with a gently wavy surface on one of the tower's eight sides.
 But the market continued to sour as apartment rents fell amid a glut of expensive units, especially downtown. Bankers and government officials say that annual rents downtown are about one-third less today than the $80 per square foot that Mr. Ratner and other developers had expected.
 As a result, Mr. Ratner stopped work again in late March. 
 Ms. Gilmartin, of Forest City Ratner, acknowledged that the rental market had declined, but she said that Beekman Tower's design and high-end finishes would put it in a class by itself.
 ''The savings we achieved go a long way toward insulating the project from any dip in rents or any protracted period of time required to lease up the building,'' she said. ''We're really bullish on this building.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses China for Tough Response to North Korea

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States is pressing China to consider taking a variety of severe sanctions against North Korea, including the inspection of suspect ships and planes, as it tries to ratchet up the global response to Pyongyang's latest nuclear test, administration officials said Thursday.
 But it is not clear that the Chinese government has the stomach for a heightened showdown with North Korea, these officials said, even though its criticism of the underground test on Monday was unusually vehement. 
 The administration's initiative reflects a belief that the greatest threat posed by a nuclear North Korea is the leakage of critical weapons parts or fissile material to other states or terrorist organizations, rather than the prospect of North Korea's making one of its neighbors a target for a bomb. President Obama's national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the proliferation threat in some detail in a speech in Washington on Wednesday evening.
 The White House has not said publicly whether it supports enforcing a 2006 United Nations Security Council resolution, passed after the North's first nuclear test, that permits the inspection of ships suspected of carrying missile parts or nuclear technology.
 Those operations could be tricky: North Korea has said it will regard such an action as an act of war, and American intelligence about North Korean shipments has been poor. The North's involvement in the construction of a Syrian nuclear reactor went undetected for years, until shortly before Israel destroyed the reactor in September 2007.
 Yet there is a growing conviction in Washington and other capitals that North Korea's actions demand a stronger response than the usual menu of economic sanctions and political rebukes that have left the nation isolated but unbowed in its pursuit of nuclear status.
 The administration is also seeking China's cooperation in a global effort to disrupt the flow of money to North Korea's ruler, Kim Jong-il, and his family, officials said. Some of that money is suspected to be held in Chinese-owned banks, making such an effort diplomatically sensitive.
 Still, a senior official said he was ''pleasantly surprised'' by how open China was to cooperating with the United States. China has historically tolerated the erratic behavior of Mr. Kim, worrying more about a calamitous collapse of his government than about his nuclear ambitions. But the recent test and missile launchings, the official said, may have crossed a line with China's leaders.
 ''At the level of Chinese irritation, this is historic,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. ''Normally, the Chinese urge us not to react. But they are reaching a point where they could be agreeable to using more of their own weight.''
 The Chinese, officials said, have taken note of South Korea's decision this week to join an American-led security campaign to stop the spread of nuclear material, as well as the harsh words about North Korea from some parts of Japan's political establishment. The United States is to discuss efforts to intercept ships coming from North Korea with officials from South Korea and Japan at a regional security conference this weekend in Singapore, where the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, will meet with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts.
 The deputy secretary of state, James B. Steinberg, will attend those meetings, and will then travel to Tokyo for further meetings with Japanese officials, according to the State Department. Mr. Steinberg may also be involved in negotiations with the Chinese, a senior official said.
 At home, the United States continued to rally support for a resolution in the United Nations. The State Department spokesman, Ian C. Kelly, said no agreement was likely to be reached for at least two days.
 While the major powers uniformly condemned North Korea's test, there was some confusion Thursday about whether Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council and is a member of the multilateral talks on North Korea's nuclear program, was balking at additional sanctions.
 A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Andrei Nesterenko, told reporters in Moscow, ''We do not need to use the language of sanctions.'' Still, American and Japanese officials said they did not believe that Russia had retreated from its tough initial response.
 Because North Korea would regard the interception of its ships as an act of war, the Bush administration decided not to do that after the North's first nuclear test in 2006.
 The United States and South Korea have already raised the alert level for their forces in South Korea to its highest level in three years -- increasing the number of surveillance flights and satellite reconnaissance -- reflecting what military commanders say is a ''grave threat'' from North Korea.
 Whatever the risks, some independent experts are advising the Obama administration to put all options on the table, including a military strike on North Korea's nuclear sites and missile launching pads. ''We could have stopped this last nuclear test if we had chosen to,'' said William Perry, a former defense secretary who negotiated with North Korea during the Clinton administration. ''We could have stopped the first one if we had chosen to.''
 ''That requires military action, and I'm not recommending military action,'' Mr. Perry said, speaking Thursday at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''But somewhere along in this series of coercive actions, one can imagine an escalation, and if the ones that are less do not succeed, we have to be willing to consider the other ones.''
 The nuclear test and North Korea's other actions, he said, suggested that the government no longer viewed its nuclear program as a chip to be used in negotiations with neighbors or the United States. Rather, he said, North Korea is determined to remain a nuclear-weapons state.
 This presents Mr. Obama with a different set of calculations than either President George W. Bush or President Bill Clinton confronted.
 ''We now have a new situation that has not appeared before,'' said Brent Scowcroft, a national security adviser to President Gerald R. Ford and the first President Bush, who spoke on a panel with Mr. Perry. Under these circumstances, he said, the United States had both more leverage and incentive to enlist the cooperation of China, as North Korea's most influential neighbor.

HEADLINE: Credit Relief May Not Last Long

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
The experience of being choked to death can concentrate a person's attention. When the chokehold is removed, a feeling of relief, perhaps even of exhilaration, is to be expected.
 But allowing a person to breathe may not be enough to restore him to health.
 In that regard, 2009 is starting to feel a little like 1980. 
 Then, as in recent months, a sudden credit contraction choked off economic activity. When the credit squeeze eased, a sense of relief spread. Within a few months, consumer confidence leaped amid expectations that both employment and business conditions would soon improve.
 The improvement came, but it did not last long. 
 When the current credit crisis was at its worst, even financially solid companies could not get short-term financing. Banks did not trust one another, and trade financing dried up. One result was a collapse in inventories, as imports sagged even more than final demand.
 Now, thanks to government financing of debts as diverse as mortgages and commercial paper, credit is more readily available. That should provide a lift to orders and at least a temporary boost for countries, including China and Germany, that rely on export markets.
 ''The free fall in global trade seems to have halted,'' said Josh Green, the chief executive of Panjiva, a company that monitors customs declarations.
 Credit markets have opened at least a bit. Corporate bond offerings are up, and many big banks have been able to raise billions in dollars by selling stock, something that would have been unthinkable a few months ago. 
 But enthusiasm may still be getting ahead of reality. Government-financed credit has its own problems, which will grow. The banks still have toxic assets on their books, and the number of bad loans is rising.
 Moreover, the world economy, which was so dependent on America's borrow-and-spend behavior, has not found a replacement. ''Have we put into place a new engine for global spending, or even repaired the old?'' asked Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. 
 The enthusiasm of markets is even creating its own problems, pushing up long-term interest rates and thus the cost of mortgages. 
 The 1980 credit squeeze came because the government, seeking to combat inflation, slapped on credit controls in March. President Jimmy Carter urged Americans to put away their credit cards. The economy promptly tanked.
 With borrowing difficult, private investment declined at an annual rate of 30 percent in the second quarter of 1980. No subsequent quarter was half that bad -- until the 22 percent drop in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 The problems in 1980 were in some ways very different from the current ones. Interest rates were high and inflation seemed to be out of control. Ending the government-induced credit contraction did not solve those problems. It took a sharp and prolonged recession, which soon arrived. 
 This crisis was made in America, but it has had the largest impact on countries that sold a lot of goods to the United States. ''Thus the crisis punishes the frugal more than the profligate,'' Martin Wolf wrote this week in The Financial Times. ''It seems so unfair. It is not. The frugal depend on the profligate.''
 Restocking of inventories may help exporters to show economic growth in the current quarter, but that effect will fade. The profligate seem unlikely to resume their bad old ways, if only because they cannot borrow as they used to -- despite the recent relaxation in credit markets -- when they had billions of dollars in home equity they could withdraw and spend. 
 In 1980, recalled Henry Kaufman, who then was Wall Street's most influential economist as the bond market guru at Salomon Brothers, ''the financial malaise was in the big institutions, because they had been lenders to Latin America, but it was not as widespread as it is today.'' 
 In the end, many of the big American banks of that era were replaced by a crop of growing regional banks that had not made the same mistakes. The old Bank of America was folded into NCNB, which took the old name but not most of the old management. Wachovia, another North Carolina bank, grew to be a major player. Citicorp was absorbed into Travelers, becoming Citigroup. Now Wachovia is gone, absorbed into Wells Fargo after it faltered, and Citigroup survives as a government ward.
 In baseball terms, the financial system had a good crop of minor leaguers available when the big league stars went onto the disabled list in the 1980s. Now the minor leaguers are also battered and bruised. 
 Bailouts and government spending do appear to have warded off Great Depression II, but the current government-supported financial system may not be enough to do much more than keep the economy breathing. In the words of Mr. Kaufman, whose prescient warnings of credit market excesses in recent years were largely ignored by Wall Street, ''we do not have the financial firing power to lift this economy in any meaningful way.''
 If he is right, the end of the current recession is unlikely to produce much of a recovery.

HEADLINE: The Big Inflation Scare

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Suddenly it seems as if everyone is talking about inflation. Stern opinion pieces warn that hyperinflation is just around the corner. And markets may be heeding these warnings: Interest rates on long-term government bonds are up, with fear of future inflation one possible reason for the interest-rate spike.
 But does the big inflation scare make any sense? Basically, no -- with one caveat I'll get to later. And I suspect that the scare is at least partly about politics rather than economics. 
 First things first. It's important to realize that there's no hint of inflationary pressures in the economy right now. Consumer prices are lower now than they were a year ago, and wage increases have stalled in the face of high unemployment. Deflation, not inflation, is the clear and present danger. 
 So if prices aren't rising, why the inflation worries? Some claim that the Federal Reserve is printing lots of money, which must be inflationary, while others claim that budget deficits will eventually force the U.S. government to inflate away its debt.
 The first story is just wrong. The second could be right, but isn't.
 Now, it's true that the Fed has taken unprecedented actions lately. More specifically, it has been buying lots of debt both from the government and from the private sector, and paying for these purchases by crediting banks with extra reserves. And in ordinary times, this would be highly inflationary: banks, flush with reserves, would increase loans, which would drive up demand, which would push up prices.
 But these aren't ordinary times. Banks aren't lending out their extra reserves. They're just sitting on them -- in effect, they're sending the money right back to the Fed. So the Fed isn't really printing money after all. 
 Still, don't such actions have to be inflationary sooner or later? No. The Bank of Japan, faced with economic difficulties not too different from those we face today, purchased debt on a huge scale between 1997 and 2003. What happened to consumer prices? They fell.
 All in all, much of the current inflation discussion calls to mind what happened during the early years of the Great Depression when many influential people were warning about inflation even as prices plunged. As the British economist Ralph Hawtrey wrote, ''Fantastic fears of inflation were expressed. That was to cry, Fire, Fire in Noah's Flood.'' And he went on, ''It is after depression and unemployment have subsided that inflation becomes dangerous.''
 Is there a risk that we'll have inflation after the economy recovers? That's the claim of those who look at projections that federal debt may rise to more than 100 percent of G.D.P. and say that America will eventually have to inflate away that debt -- that is, drive up prices so that the real value of the debt is reduced. 
 Such things have happened in the past. For example, France ultimately inflated away much of the debt it incurred while fighting World War I. 
 But more modern examples are lacking. Over the past two decades, Belgium, Canada and, of course, Japan have all gone through episodes when debt exceeded 100 percent of G.D.P. And the United States itself emerged from World War II with debt exceeding 120 percent of G.D.P. In none of these cases did governments resort to inflation to resolve their problems.
 So is there any reason to think that inflation is coming? Some economists have argued for moderate inflation as a deliberate policy, as a way to encourage lending and reduce private debt burdens. I'm sympathetic to these arguments and made a similar case for Japan in the 1990s. But the case for inflation never made headway with Japanese policy makers then, and there's no sign it's getting traction with U.S. policy makers now.
 All of this raises the question: If inflation isn't a real risk, why all the claims that it is?
 Well, as you may have noticed, economists sometimes disagree. And big disagreements are especially likely in weird times like the present, when many of the normal rules no longer apply. 
 But it's hard to escape the sense that the current inflation fear-mongering is partly political, coming largely from economists who had no problem with deficits caused by tax cuts but suddenly became fiscal scolds when the government started spending money to rescue the economy. And their goal seems to be to bully the Obama administration into abandoning those rescue efforts.
 Needless to say, the president should not let himself be bullied. The economy is still in deep trouble and needs continuing help.
 Yes, we have a long-run budget problem, and we need to start laying the groundwork for a long-run solution. But when it comes to inflation, the only thing we have to fear is inflation fear itself.

HEADLINE: Forests and the Planet

 BODY:
A major shortcoming of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on climate change was its failure to address the huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the destruction of the world's rain forests. A proposal that rich nations be allowed to offset some of their emissions by paying poorer counties to leave their rain forests intact was shot down after European environmental groups objected. They argued that it would allow rich countries to buy their way out of their own obligations. The planet has been paying for that colossal blunder ever since. 
 Deforestation accounts for one-fifth of the world's greenhouse gases -- about the same as China's emissions, more than the emissions generated by all of the world's cars and trucks. And the world is doing far too little to stop it. An estimated 30 million acres of rain forest disappear every year, destroying biodiversity and pouring billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
 The global warming bill now working its way through the House seeks to change this destructive dynamic in two ways. It sets up a carbon trading system that is expected to raise upward of $60 billion annually through the sale of pollution allowances. Five percent of that would be set aside to help prevent deforestation, either through a special international fund or as bilateral grants to poor countries. 
 In addition, the bill would allow for the kinds of offsets proposed and rejected in Kyoto, Japan. For example, a power company having trouble meeting its emissions limits could satisfy some of its obligations by paying to reduce deforestation elsewhere in the world. 
 The economics make sense. It is a relatively inexpensive way for industrialized nations to get credit for reducing global emissions while they make the necessary investments to control their own pollution. And it is a good deal for poor countries. The World Bank estimates that an acre of rain forest converted to crops is worth $100 to $250. It's worth far more under a system that puts a value on carbon. An average acre stores about 200 tons of carbon; assuming a low price of $10 a ton, that acre is suddenly worth $2,000. 
 A big effort will still be required to resist the loggers, miners, ranchers and politicians who have had their way with the rain forests for years. And any plan must include safeguards and inspection mechanisms to ensure that the allowances and offsets are being used properly.
 But with the rain forests shrinking and the planet warming up, it's crucial to get the right incentives in place -- first as part of broad climate change legislation in the United States, then as part of a new global treaty that the world's nations hope to negotiate in the fall.

HEADLINE: Harlem in Time-Lapse Photography

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
From the time he arrived in the United States from Chile as a college student in 1965, the photographer Camilo Jose Vergara has been haunting, and haunted by, American cities. 
 He lives in New York but has spent the better part of the past four decades in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles, urban centers with big, poor, largely segregated minority neighborhoods. He has also frequented smaller, fallen-apart industrial cities like Camden, N.J., and Gary, Ind., places he calls ''permanent ghettos.'' 
 By his own estimate he has returned to Gary more than a hundred times. 
 On each visit he has done the same thing: take pictures, mostly of buildings, often the same ones, recording over decades their abandonment, disintegration, demolition and replacement by cheaper structures, or parking lots, or by nothing at all. 
 This vigilance has produced several books, among them two great, generative visual essays in architectural anthropology, ''The New American Ghetto'' (1995) and ''American Ruins'' (1999), and exhibitions like ''Harlem, 1970-2009: Photographs by Camilo Jose Vergara'' now at the New-York Historical Society. 
 His self-created job as documenter is demanding. It can require the fearlessness of a reporter in a war zone and the solicitous detachment of a doctor doing rounds, though Mr. Vergara doesn't claim these qualities. He has said in interviews that he goes where he goes and does what he does because he needs to. 
 Focusing on images of constant material change distracts him from anxieties, transports him back to the decaying, now disappeared world of his childhood, and connects him empathetically to an American culture from which he otherwise feels removed. Far from being a brash photographic adventurer, he is more like a ghost haunting ghosts. 
 The ghosts are unusually vivacious in the 100 pictures of Harlem at the New-York Historical Society. Mr. Vergara first visited that neighborhood soon after he arrived in New York in 1968, at the age of 24. Urban poverty and ill-conceived urban renewal had already done irreparable damage. New York was jittery with change. He started taking pictures. 
 At the time he was exploring a genre broadly known as street photography. (Helen Levitt was an artist he particularly admired. An exhibition of her work at Laurence Miller Gallery is reviewed on Page 29.) And the earliest pictures in the historical society exhibition are shots of people going about their lives on Harlem sidewalks: black children playing with white Barbies on a stoop, a nervous wedding party gathered in front of a church. 
 Although tied down by a Midtown desk job, Mr. Vergara returned regularly to Harlem on his lunch hours, establishing a repeat-visit pattern that would lead to time-lapse architectural sequences stretching over years. 
 In 1977 he photographed the exotic-looking exterior of a nightclub-bar called the Purple Manor at 65 East 125th Street, the wide facade, with sets of double doors, painted a very 1970s lavender; the windows, fitted with decorative paper borders, had a jazzy hourglass shape. The club's clientele was reputed to move in upper levels of the drug trade. 
 By 1980 much had changed. In a picture Mr. Vergara took that year, the bar is gone and its premises divided into two small storefronts painted different colors: the one on the left baby blue, the one on the right fire-engine red. Over several years the storefronts also took on different functions, each of which Mr. Vergara photographed. 
 In 1980 the left-hand storefront was a fish-and-chips shop, a year later a discount variety store. After an initial lag in activity, the storefront on the right began selling women's clothes before turning into a smoke shop, an identity it retained for some years, even as its neighbor morphed from furniture store to unisex boutique to beauty salon, with superficial alterations at each change. 
 Both stores hit hard times in the recession-plagued 1990s. The facades are marked up, the sidewalk cluttered. Then in 2004 the two stores were reunited to accommodate a Sleepy's mattress showroom. But within a few years that franchise moved on. In 2008 the space that had been the Purple Manor 30 years earlier was plate-glass-fronted, accessible to the disabled, and for rent. 
 Mr. Vergara takes us through all these dramatic shifts in function, fashion and fortune with an attitude of studied neutrality. He shoots storefronts always straight on, from the same distance, in unmoody light. The results are urban photography as archaeological field work. Over the span of eight images we see many changes, but we aren't asked to feel good or bad about them. We're meant to think: Look what life does. 
 By contrast an unmistakably elegiac current flows through Mr. Vergara's single pictures of Harlem architecture. The Renaissance Ballroom and Casino on West 137th Street, built in the 1920s as a showcase for performers like Count Basie and Duke Ellington, is now a moldering pile. A 19th-century fire watchtower in Marcus Garvey Park, the only surviving example of its kind, looks rickety and vulnerable. 
 A group of buildings on Madison Avenue near 127th Street that Mr. Vergara shot in 1982 is, we learn from his terse wall label, long gone. ''There is now an empty lot in this space.'' 
 And yet, however ambivalently, an upbeat note comes through. Harlem is, after all, an economic success story. Old town houses, once derelict, are being preserved. Tenements abandoned in the 1990s have been rehabilitated. Churches are flourishing. Storefronts have paying occupants. 
 That the occupants may be McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, and that portions of 125th Street are now corporate-brand shopping malls, may not be unalloyed good news. But the neighborhood around them suggests a degree of material security that its equivalents in Camden, Detroit and Gary can, at this point, not even dream of. 
 The show's true source of warmth, though, lies in the unusually high number -- for Mr. Vergara -- of pictures of people, of a kind that bring him full circle to the street photographer he was 40 years ago. 
 He made some wonderful portraits back then: one of a Bolivian Indian in traditional clothes in East Harlem in 1970 is in the show. And he's making some beauties now, as in his 2008 picture of the street evangelist Pierre Gaspar, known as the Hallelujah Man, and a 2009 shot of a man and child walking past billboard-size portraits of Malcolm X and Barack Obama on West 125th Street. 
 But in portraits, as in architectural pictures, time marches on. A man wearing overalls poses for the camera in what looks like a densely planted sunlit field. The year is 1990. From a wall label we learn that the man's name was Eddie; that he was originally from Selma, Ala.; and that he farmed an empty lot on Frederick Douglass Boulevard between 118th and 119th Streets. We further learn that today, almost two decades later, a luxury apartment occupies the lot and ''a Starbucks has opened on the exact spot where Eddie stands.'' 
 In ''American Ruins'' Mr. Vergara lists works of art in various mediums that have influenced him deeply. He mentions the photographs of Levitt, Eugene Atget and Walker Evans. From literature he cites the death-obsessed novels of Dostoyevsky and the apparition-filled stories of that connoisseur of decay, Edgar Allan Poe. 
 Miles Davis, Mahler and the British composer John Dowland, who wrote his sad songs of longing from exile in France, are on the list. Among artists, he singles out Piranesi, the Dutch landscapist Jacob van Ruisdael, and Claude Monet, particularly Monet's images of Rouen Cathedral with its facade disintegrating into light. 
 The reason for Mr. Vergara's attraction to Ruisdael -- painter of crumbling towers, castles and cemeteries -- seems obvious. And he specifically likens Piranesi's vast, hollow, exitless prisons to the bombed-out American cities in which he has spent so many years. He makes no direct connection between Monet's spectral cathedral -- is it falling down or coming together? -- and the facades morphing, dying and resurrecting in the Harlem photographs, but I think he could. 
 ''Harlem, 1970-2009: Photographs by Camilo Jose Vergara'' is at the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, through July 12. ''Storefront Churches: Photographs by Camilo Jose Vergara'' opens at the National Building Museum in Washington on June 20.

A photograph on Friday with an art review of ''Harlem, 1970-2009: Photographs by Camilo Jose Vergara'' at the New-York Historical Society, using information provided by Mr. Vergara, was published in error. While three of the photographs in a series showed the storefront at 2038 Fifth Avenue in 1992, 1996 and 2007, the fourth photograph, showing a laundry, was of an adjacent building. It did not show 2038 Fifth Avenue in 1999.

HEADLINE: Married With Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By ANDREW J. CHERLIN. 
Andrew J. Cherlin, a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University, is the author of ''The Marriage-Go-Round: The State of Marriage and the Family in America Today.''

DATELINE: Baltimore 

 BODY:
 IN times of economic crisis, Americans turn to their families for support. If the Great Depression is any guide, we may see a drop in our sky-high divorce rate. But this won't necessarily represent an increase in happy marriages, nor is the trend likely to last. In the long run, the Depression weakened American families, and the current crisis will probably do the same. 
 We tend to think of the Depression as a time when families pulled together to survive huge job losses. The divorce rate, which had been rising slowly since the Civil War, suddenly dropped in 1930, the year after the Depression began. By 1932, when nearly one-quarter of the work force was unemployed, it had declined by around 25 percent from 1929. But this does not mean that people were suddenly happier with their marriages. Rather, with incomes plummeting and insecure jobs, unhappy couples often couldn't afford to divorce. They feared that neither spouse would be able to manage alone. 
 Today, given the job losses of the past year, fewer unhappy couples will risk starting separate households. Furthermore, the housing market meltdown will make it more difficult for them to finance their separations by selling their homes. 
 After financial disasters (and natural ones as well) family members also tend to do whatever they can to help each other and their communities. In a 1940 book, ''The Unemployed Man and His Family,'' the sociologist Mirra Komarovsky described a family in which the husband initially reacted to losing his job ''with tireless search for work.'' He was always active, looking for odd jobs or washing windows for neighbors. Another unemployed man initially enjoyed spending more time with his young children. These men's spirits were up, and their wives were supportive. 
 The problem is that such an impulse is hard to sustain. The men Komarovsky studied eventually grew discouraged, their efforts faltered, and their relationships with their wives and teenage children often deteriorated. Across the country, many similar families were unable to maintain the initial boost in morale. For some, the hardships of life without steady work eventually overwhelmed their attempts to keep their families together. The divorce rate began to rise again in 1934 when employment picked up, providing some unhappy couples with the income they needed to separate. The rate rose during the rest of the decade as the recovery took hold. 
 Millions of American families may now be in the initial stage of their responses to the current crisis, working together and supporting one another through the early months of unemployment. During the Depression this stage seemed to last a year at most. Today, it might last longer. Wives now share with their husbands the burden of earning money, and the government provides more assistance.
 But history suggests that this response will be temporary. By 1940 the divorce rate was higher than before the Depression, as if a pent-up demand was finally being satisfied. The Depression destroyed the inner life of many married couples, but it was years before they could afford to file for divorce. 
 Today's economic slump could well generate a similar backlog of couples whose relationships have been irreparably ruined. So it is only when the economy is healthy again that we will begin to see just how many fractured families have been created.

HEADLINE: Forum Says Climate Shift Brings Deaths

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Global warming is causing more than 300,000 deaths and about $125 billion in economic losses each year, according to a report by the Global Humanitarian Forum, an organization led by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general. 
 The report, to be released Friday, sifted data sets and existing studies of health, disaster, population and economic trends. It found that human-influenced climate change -- mainly by exacerbating flooding and drought -- was elevating the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition, diarrheal disease, malaria and heat-related ailments. But even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions. 
 Along with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.
 Roger A. Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the forum's report was ''a methodological embarrassment'' because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable regions. Dr. Pielke said that ''climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention.'' But the report, he said, ''will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed.''
 However, Soren Peter Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. The report appeared aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.
 In a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards while still curbing the emissions of the heat-trapping gases linked to global warming. More than 90 percent of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report.
 The next round of preliminary talks leading up to the December negotiations is scheduled to begin Monday in Bonn, Germany. 
 Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economist, was one of 12 experts who vetted the report for the forum. He acknowledged that some of the report's conclusions were oversimplified. Still, he said, he endorsed the report's message. He and others who work in vulnerable regions like Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, he said, are convinced that global warming is already harming communities.

HEADLINE: Ahead, a Summer of Deals

BYLINE: By DANA JENNINGS

 BODY:
AS summer looms, many beach lovers are still pondering this question: Is the economic downturn going to wash out my annual vacation on the ocean? 
 And up and down the East Coast, those who rent out vacation properties are wondering about that, too. So far this spring -- from Cape Cod to the Jersey Shore, from Ocean City, Md., to the Outer Banks of North Carolina to Myrtle Beach, S.C. -- real estate agents are reporting that business is down from last year. In some spots, it's absolutely sluggish.
 Part of the reason is that potential renters are waiting longer before they commit, agents say. ''People are doing more window-shopping,'' said Ryan Swaim, general manager of Dunes Realty in Garden City Beach, S.C., near Myrtle Beach. ''They're pulling the trigger much later.''
 While that situation is giving property owners a case of the nerves, it appears to be working in favor of renters. Many Web sites devoted to renting vacation homes on or near the Atlantic have long lists of specials, both short term and for the entire summer, meant to lure the undecided. 
 In Ocean City, for example, a five-bedroom house that sleeps 16 and has a view of the bay has been reduced from $3,100, to $2,995, for the week of July 4; the house is being rented by Century 21 New Horizon. Ocean City also has a significant condominium market, and many condo units are being offered there at reduced rates.
 Farther north, in Dennisport on Cape Cod, a six-bedroom house near the ocean is renting for $1,000 a week less throughout July, down from its usual $6,900; the house is being offered on HomeAway.com, which currently lists around 100 special offers on Cape Cod. 
 A report released last week by HomeAway, which represents 200,000 vacation properties in the United States, found that about 66 percent of its vacation rental property owners had offered special deals or incentives so far this year in response to the economy.
 The report, which focused on the first quarter of this year, found that 27 percent of owners had discounted rental rates by specific dollar amounts, while 24 percent had discounted by a set percentage off their normal rental rate. 
 Owners are also trying to lure renters by offering an additional night with the purchase of a specific number of nights, cleaning services at no additional cost and by not requiring a minimum stay. Mike Butler, chief commercial officer at HomeAway, said there was a $3,000 property in Wellfleet Harbor on Cape Cod that was offering a $500 discount and two dozen fresh oysters.
 Once upon a time, the dynamics of summer rentals were simple. The person who wanted to rent would often book six months to a year in advance, even as three or four other potential renters were checking out the property.
 ''In years past, if a place didn't rent by March,'' said Mr. Swaim of Dunes Realty, ''it wasn't going to rent.''
 Pam Maguire, a broker with Diane Turton, Realtors, which covers the Jersey Shore, said May and June used to be the months when agents were focused on renting out smaller, off-the-beach places.
 But with growing inventory, increased use of the Internet as a shopping tool and now the recession, those days are long gone, real estate agents say.
 And when customers do decide they want a place, they are renting for shorter periods than they used to. ''People are renting for one week,'' Ms. Maguire said, ''rather than one month.''
 Then they want to haggle. Theresa Smith, director of vacation rentals for Kinlin Grover GMAC Vacation Rentals on Cape Cod, said: ''Everyone's negotiating. It would be unusual that no one is negotiating.''
 The tactic seems to be working. Ms. Smith said that on Cape Cod, where business has been down sharply, customers were often getting 5 to 10 percent off on a spectrum of properties, from modest cottages to grand homes on the water.
 Mario Boccabella is one of those successful Cape Cod negotiators. He got a four-bedroom house just a block from the beach in West Harwich for $2,500, $800 off the asking price. Mr. Boccabella, a real estate broker who lives in Wellesley, Mass., said getting a reduced price was a matter of knowing what he wanted, being willing to search, realizing that the market had plenty of inventory and being willing to pay the entire price up front. 
 He said that he had visited the Cape three times, looking at about a dozen places to find the right rental for him and his family for the last week in August. ''When you drove around,'' he said, ''you could see the for-rent signs everywhere.''
 Property owners say they are discounting because they don't want to play a game of economic chicken.
 ''I've got to get this thing rented,'' said Betty Kowalski, referring to a four-bedroom oceanfront house that she and her husband, Rich, rent out on Long Beach Island in New Jersey. Ms. Kowalski says she has commitments for only three weeks so far this season, and that July 4 and Labor Day are still open.
 She said that she and her husband, who own two other vacation properties on Long Beach Island, rented the house, in the community of Harvey Cedars, for $10,000 to $14,000 a week last year. They are listing the house at $8,000 to $9,800 a week this summer but are also offering a 20 percent discount on top of that.
 ''People are being very, very cautious,'' Ms. Kowalski said, referring to potential renters. ''I just want to pay my bills.''
 Which is why there are plenty of specials available. 
 For the week of July 4, Outer Banks Blue Realty Services in North Carolina is offering a five-bedroom house near the ocean in Corolla for $2,975, marked down from $3,975.
 And in Garden City Beach in South Carolina, there are dozens of specials available on the Dunes Realty Web site for the week of July 4, ranging from $285 off a two-bedroom oceanfront condo originally at $1,135, to $1,050 off a six-bedroom oceanfront home that sleeps 14, originally at $5,250.
 Though business is down from a year ago, most real estate agents interviewed said their markets had picked up noticeably the last month as more potential renters have decided that they can indeed take a vacation this summer, even if it's only for one week -- and perhaps lured by specials and discounts. 
 While the recession has made people think twice, maybe even three times, about renting a vacation home, it also may be driving up inventory. The HomeAway market report states, ''One in five owners new to the vacation rental market cited economic conditions, including the need to generate additional income, a recent job loss, the inability to sell the home or the risk of foreclosure, as the reason why they started renting their vacation home.''
 Which, of course, makes the job of people like Ms. Maguire even more difficult. But she's not yet ready for potential renters to pack away their beach umbrellas and forgo their summer dream of sipping an especially fine sauvignon blanc on an oceanfront deck.
 Speaking, perhaps, with the optimism needed for her job and certainly for real estate agents up and down the East Coast, Ms. Maguire said, ''There's no question that people can still get a great place on the shore.''

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE TREASURE OF ULYSSES DAVIS,' through Sept. 6. Ulysses Davis (1914-1990) was a Savannah, Ga., barber who whittled and carved wooden sculptures in his shop when business was slow. Organized by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, this show is by far the largest presentation of Mr. Davis's sculpture to be seen outside Savannah and the first to reveal the full scope of his imagination. His best-known works, carvings of historical figures, take a backseat to hybrid beasts and hydra-headed figures. It makes clear that he wasn't just a patriotic folk artist, or an African-American artist affirming his heritage, or an inward-looking, visionary artist. He was all of these, which is to say that no single cliche of ''outsider'' art quite fits him. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. 20090528
 (Karen Rosenberg) 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. 20090528
 (Ken Johnson)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GUSTAVE CAILLEBOTTE: IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS FROM PARIS TO THE SEA,' through July 5. Thirty-some years ago, the museum had a big success with a Caillebotte retrospective that more or less introduced American audiences to an artist who was an Impressionist by association rather than by style or temperament. His three best-known pictures, ''The Floor Scrapers,'' ''The Pont de l'Europe'' and ''Paris Street, Rainy Day,'' all grand urban scenes from the late 1870s, are absent from this show, which is a more modest enterprise than a survey, with emphasis falling on less-focused late work. But Caillebotte was a painter as interesting for his weaknesses as for his strengths, and any exposure is valuable. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090528
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FASHIONING FELT,' through Sept. 7. Tribute is paid to the world's oldest textile (no loom required) in all its sturdy, cosseting, beautiful, shape-shifting, dye-friendly majesty. The show includes contemporary furnishings, garments, jewelry and room dividers as well as two large installation works. The felt runs from raw to cooked -- that is furry to gossamer -- and in some of the most intriguing instances it is mated with lacquer, plastic, LED lights, metal or coral beads, as well as silk, linen or cotton. There are episodes of frivolity. A few earlier works -- including a Mongolian runner and a saddle blanket -- reunite function and decoration and distort familiar motifs in wonderful ways. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)20090528
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AVEDON FASHION: 1944-2000,' through Sept. 6. The first museum retrospective devoted to Richard Avedon's fashion photography exudes a contagious joie de vivre. With postwar Paris as a stage set, Avedon made fashion photography new by adding movement and then narrative to his images, along with ironic self-awareness and a buoyant exuberance. The best of his early images are as perfect as the best work of Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns from this period and as profoundly representative of it. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Smith)20090528
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'KRAZY! THE DELIRIOUS WORLD OF ANIME + MANGA + VIDEO GAMES,' through June 14. This show addresses a vibrant chapter in the history of visual storytelling: a specifically Japanese set of approaches that has gained a worldwide following over the past two decades. It will not live up to its promise for devoted followers of Japanese pop culture, but as a multimedia sampler including comics, graphic novels, video games, action figures, animated cartoons and more, it might entice the uninitiated to explore the field more deeply. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)20090528
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'RECLAIMED: PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JACQUES GOUDSTIKKER,' through Aug. 2. This show of paintings returned to the family of Goudstikker, a prominent Dutch gallery owner who died while fleeing the Nazis, is many exhibitions in one. It's a portrait of an enormously successful art dealer who shaped tastes and markets between the wars. It's a marriage of Northern Baroque and Southern Renaissance painting. Most of all, it's an extraordinary, continuing tale of looting and restitution. At the center of all these stories is a small black notebook, used by Goudstikker to catalog his inventory of some 1,400 works and now on display, in actual and digitized form, at the Jewish Museum. Other highlights include a landscape by Salomon von Jacobsz Ruysdael and a portrait by Rembrandt's pupil Ferdinand Bol. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090528
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THEY CALLED ME MAYER JULY: PAINTED MEMORIES OF A JEWISH CHILDHOOD IN POLAND BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST,' through Oct. 1. Introducing the reluctant painter and accidental memoirist Mayer Kirschenblatt, now 92, who has devoted the last two decades to documenting life between the wars in and around the provincial city of Opatow (Apt in Yiddish), Poland. Wrought with irresistible detail and folk-art dispatch, the paintings begin with his mother's kitchen and reflect an omnivorous curiosity about everyday everything, aided by an apparently photographic memory. Labels pick up where the paintings leave off; words and images combine in a marvel of a book accomplished in collaboration with the artist's daughter, a folklorist whose career choice was shaped by her father's stories. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)20090528
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF THE KOREAN RENAISSANCE, 1400-1600,'through June 21. The Korean gallery at the Met is a trim, tall, well-proportioned box of light. But it's just one room, and a smallish one at that, a reflection of the museum's modest holdings in art from this Asian country. So it's no surprise that the expansive-sounding show is a small thing too, with four dozen objects, most of them -- ceramic jars, lacquered boxes, scroll paintings -- compact enough to be stashed in a closet. But what it lacks in grandeur, it makes up for in fineness, and in rarity.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090528
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRANCIS BACON: A CENTENARY RETROSPECTIVE,'through Aug. 16. This 66-work survey starts with the stagy existentialism of Bacon's early work (the semi-human fiends, screaming popes, flanks of beef) and proceeds to the effulgent colors, insistent rhythms and true anguish of his grand triptychs and portraits. It suggests that his greatest achievement was his ability to paint convincingly men having sex and sometimes making love. As his hero Picasso had done for men and women, Bacon turned sexual passion into a pictorial event, using paint on canvas with finesse and no small sense of drama, while operating under cover of modernism. For once, the male gaze turned emphatically self-ward.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.20090528
 (Smith)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIVING LINE: SELECTED INDIAN DRAWINGS FROM THE SUBHASH KAPOOR GIFT,'through Sept. 7. This almost supernaturally beautiful exhibition presents 40 mostly small drawings by Indian miniaturists of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Rendered with amazing skill, the subjects include bearded aristocrats and bejeweled women; hunting scenes; wild animals and mythic beasts fighting; and gods, goddesses and demons ascending and descending. The art of drawing does not get much better than this.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090528
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,'through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090528
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PICTURES GENERATION, 1974-1984,'through Aug. 2. With this historical survey, the Met tackles a subject in American contemporary art -- namely, a critical and innovative body of media-influenced work produced between two major economic booms -- that has been begging for full-scale museum attention, and gives it the full old-master treatment. Much of the art itself -- painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, video, installation, prints, music and books by 30 artists, most of them still active and caught young here -- continues to look good. There are things to quarrel with, from the sweeping ''generation'' concept to a surprising, un-Met-like factual error in the wall labels: the original ''Pictures'' show had five artists, not four; one, Philip Smith, has been deliberately excised here in the interest of writing a neater history. Still, the show is a big step into the pertinent present for this museum.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090528
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,'through Oct. 25. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending 130 feet from one end of the open-air deck to the other and rising 29 feet overhead. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.20090528
 (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,'through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters.(212) 708-9400, moma.org.20090528
 (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'INTO THE SUNSET: PHOTOGRAPHY'S IMAGE OF THE AMERICAN WEST,'through June 8. Almost every one of this resonant exhibition's approximately 150 pictures dating from 1850 to 2008 evokes tension between the myth and the reality of the great American West. Its overall perspective is predictably bleak, but it is loaded with arresting images, from the 19th-century group portrait of the outlaw gang the Wild Bunch in suits and bowler hats, to Irving Penn's glamorizing studio shot of five Hells Angels and their two girlfriends.(212) 708-9400, moma.org.20090528
 (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: AERNOUT MIK,through July 27. Something is happening in this Dutch artist's videos, but you don't know what it is. Displayed on single flat screens or as multiple projections on custom-built walls in various locations at the museum, they seem to document chaotic, emotionally charged, newsworthy situations involving scores of people. As you watch, you keep hoping to discover what exactly is the cause of the commotion, but no clarification arrives. They are by turns mesmerizing, tantalizing and frustrating.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20090528
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TANGLED ALPHABETS: LEON FERRARI AND MIRA SCHENDEL,'through June 15. This overly full show mixes together partial accounts of the work of two important South American artists instead of focusing on one. Leon Ferrari (Argentine, born 1920) and Mira Schendel (Brazilian, born in Switzerland, 1919-1988) shared an interest in abstraction contaminated by language, line and modest materials, especially paper and wire. But Ferrari is, at heart, a sardonic, sometimes grandiose Conceptualist, whose best works elaborate a maniacal, nonsense calligraphy. Schendel was a purist with a Zen slant, adept at transferring random marks and letters to rice paper, from which she also made ephemeral sculptures. While the show opens a window on a complex history that ran parallel to, not behind, postwar art in the United States, the double survey suggests a failure to commit. Our loss.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090528
 NEUE GALERIE: 'BRUCKE: THE BIRTH OF EXPRESSIONISM IN DRESDEN AND BERLIN, 1905-1913,' through June 29. The original bad boys of 20th-century German art are featured in this visually aggressive show, specifically Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Pechstein and their driven, putative leader, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Together they revived a rawness of feeling, form and execution that had been largely absent from European art since the Middle Ages, but they also unleashed a palpable Dada swagger before Dada. As their dreams had not yet been trammeled by World War I, theirs was still a fairly cheerful barbarism, based on the belief that they could retrieve what was good and natural in the world if they just took off their clothes, danced around a bit and made art. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)20090528
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'THE GENERATIONAL: YOUNGER THAN JESUS,' through July 5. The latest local survey to challenge the pre-eminence of the Whitney Biennial is big, international in scope and age-specific. As the title implies, only artists 33 or younger were considered for inclusion. The result is a serious, carefully considered show, but one that with a few magnetic entries aside -- a video by Cyprien Galliard; an animation by Wojciech Bakowski; a madcap Ryan Trecartin installation -- feels sedate for a youthfest. Despite the global reach, it's oddly familiar, like a more-substantial-than-average weekend gallery hop in Chelsea and the Lower East Side, right down to token African and Asian imports. Still, there are many intriguing artists to look (and listen) for, among them the filmmakers Keren Cytter and Luke Fowler; the digital whiz-kid Mark Essen; and Guthrie Lonergan. There is also, as it happens, a much livelier survey to be found in an accompanying book called ''Younger Than Jesus: Artist Directory,'' which features nearly 500 artists who didn't make the final exhibition cut. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. 20090528
 (Cotter)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through Oct. 24. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20090528
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/ OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Never-Neverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. 20090528

 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KALUP LINZY: IF IT DON'T FIT,' through June 28. Kalup Linzy's video work, in which the artist appears in drag and lends his overdubbed voice to almost all the characters, has a complex ancestry. A family tree would have to include the Wayans brothers, RuPaul, John Waters and Eddie Murphy on one branch, and the highbrow canon of dress-up artists, from Cindy Sherman to Yasumasa Morimura, on another. Mr. Linzy's first museum solo includes 22 videos made since 2002, with a total running time of about three hours. It includes his series ''Da Churen,'' his antic reimagining of the popular soap opera ''All My Children''; more recent episodes focus on the art world and feature Mr. Linzy's newest persona, Katonya the emerging artist.

 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SADIE BENNING: PLAY PAUSE,'through Sept. 20. A new stop-action animation by this former film prodigy uses an avalanche of simple, almost naive gouache drawings, sometimes tinted with color, to prowl the margins of urban society. The result is low-key with undercurrents: a picture of the everyday sublime riddled with suggestions of longing, otherness and the difficulties of connection. Solveig Nelson has provided its beautifully accurate (yet largely electronic) soundtrack of city sounds, whether a subway singer or squirrels rifling through a garbage can, people talking in a bar or gates being called in an airport.(212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090528
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CLAES OLDENBURG: EARLY SCULPTURE, DRAWINGS, AND HAPPENINGS FILMS' AND 'CLAES OLDENBURG AND COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN: THE MUSIC ROOM,'through Sept. 6. This pair of exhibitions lean heavily on the Whitney's sizable collection of Oldenburg and Oldenburg/ Van Bruggen drawings, some of which were shown in 2002. But they also include newly restored, never-exhibited films of Mr. Oldenburg's Happenings and a major kinetic sculpture, ''Ice Bag -- Scale C'' (1971), brought back to life by conservators. A centralized gallery of early drawings and soft sculptures defines Mr. Oldenburg's epicurean branch of Pop, with works like ''Giant BLT (Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich)'' and ''French Fries and Ketchup'' (both 1963), served up on low, platterlike pedestals.(212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20090528
 Galleries: Uptown
 ERNESTO NETO: 'ANTHROPODINO,' through June 14. A spectacular dream of an installation of gauzy fabric, dangling pods, dinosaurish wooden bones and cavernous interiors occupies much of the Park Avenue Armory's 55,000-square-foot, 80-foot-high Wade Thompson Drill Hall. With its domed central structure and ethereal canopy, Mr. Neto's construction glows like a magical destination in a children's movie. Park Avenue Armory, at 67th Street, (212) 616-3930, armoryonpark.org. (Johnson)20090528
 SIGMAR POLKE: 'LENS PAINTINGS,' through June 19. The artist's first show here in 11 years introduces the fruits of an improvised, if machine-executed, technique, by which Mr. Polke covers each of his canvases or fabrics with a thin sheet of combed plastic that hardens into a crude, lenticular surface. He applies images, daubs and pours of paint before and after. The visual confusion is initially intriguing, and the usual caustic beauty is achieved. The only problem is that so far the experiments mostly rehash familiar Polke motifs. These too need to broach new territory. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, michaelwerner.com. (Smith)20090528
 Galleries: 57th Street
 JACK YOUNGERMAN: 'TRIADS/QUADRADS,' through June 26. Mr. Youngerman's new paintings have an exhilarating punch. In bright Playskool colors and with a direct, slightly brushy touch, he has been creating centered, hard-edged abstractions on star-, diamond-, three-leaf-clover- and oval-shaped plywood panels. They have a numinous vibe, like altar paintings for a pagan cult or heraldic emblems for a mystical knighthood. Washburn Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780, washburngallery.com. 20090528

 Galleries: Chelsea
 PHIL COLLINS: 'WHEN SLAVES LOVE EACH OTHER, IT'S NOT LOVE,' through June 20. The main attraction in this video-making conceptualist's show is a sophisticated parody of a Spanish television soap opera, made in Mexico City, using professional television actors. The 28-minute film tells a tangled tale of love, intrigue, betrayal and murder involving two maids, a gardener and the wealthy couple they work for. Though not as funny or imaginative as it should be, it is entertaining. Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com. 20090528

 'PICASSO: MOSQUETEROS,' through June 6. The takeaway from this staggering exhibition of around 100 late paintings and prints: in the main, Picasso only got better. Canvases depicting musketeers, entangled lovers and thick-limbed nudes abound. All look fabulous in the naturally lighted, unencumbered spaces -- free of lobbies, text panels and admission charges -- which contribute to the once-in-a-lifetime intensity. The combined effect contradicts generations of received opinion, proving that in his last decade in particular (1962-72) Picasso often achieved an emotional rawness, physical immediacy and joyful pictorial wickedness that was new to his art. His involvement with ceramics and the shorthand speed of glaze paintings undoubtedly contributed, as suggested by two paintings on tiles in the show. Like the 1908 masterpiece ''Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' these works turn painting inside out. If they have not similarly changed the course of art history, give them time. First they deserve their due. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)20090528
 CHARLES RAY, through June 27. More than 20 years ago Mr. Ray created a piece of kinetic sculpture that became famous, even though hardly anyone saw it: ''Ink Line'' (1987), a fine stream of black ink flowing from a little hole in the ceiling to another in the floor. It is here publicly exhibited for the first time, along with two other pieces from the '80s: ''Moving Wire,'' in which the ends of a length of wire snake in and out of fine holes drilled into the wall, and ''Spinning Spot,'' a circular section of the floor, 24 inches in diameter, spinning at 33 1/3 r.p.m. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Johnson)20090528
 LISA ROSS: 'UNREVEALED,' through June 13. That installation art of an extraordinary sort is as old as humankind receives further buttressing from large color photographs documenting holy sites in the Zinjiang Uyghur region in northwest China. In desert terrain, indigenous Muslims mark the graves of their dead with tangles of tall sticks and flags. Modest graves can be just a few sticks and a flag or two. Religious leaders, who are often viewed as saints, merit relatively large, shrine-like masses that are as high as 60 feet. Either way, the structures' spirituality is self-evident. A video whose only sound is the flags flapping in the wind further explains their power. Daneyal Mahmood Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 675-2966, daneyalmahmood.com. (Smith)20090528
 DIRK SKREBER, through June 27. The startling centerpiece of this exhibition is a pair of real cars, each wrapped around a vertical steel pole. The ''sculptures'' were produced at an automobile-safety testing operation, where big machines hurled the cars against the poles at speeds over 40 miles per hour. Also on display is a series of large, oddly blurry pictures of beautiful women. They suggest a fading connection to the eternal feminine, while the smashed cars evoke a faustian industrialism.

 UNICA ZURN: 'DARK SPRING,' through July 23. A fiction writer and poet, Zurn (1916-1970) suffered a series of mental breakdowns during the last decade of her life, and it was during that time that she produced most of the playfully improvised, sometimes hallucinatory nightmarish drawings in this fascinating show. Wandering, loopy lines enfold intricate patterns of dots, petals and serpentine stripes punctuated by eyes, faces, birds, fish, snakes and flowers.

 'NOBLE TOMBS AT MAWANGDUI: ART AND LIFE IN THE CHANGSHA KINGDOM, THIRD CENTURY B.C.E. TO FIRST CENTURY C.E.,' through June 7. In the early 1970s three tombs were discovered in southeastern China. Because they had never been plundered and because of the unusually well-preserved state of their contents, the discovery caused a worldwide sensation in archaeological circles. This show presents about 70 of more than 3,000 objects that were excavated, including fabric samples, lacquer ware, lamps, grooming tools and wooden figurines.

 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: 'DIRT ON DELIGHT: IMPULSES THAT FORM CLAY,' through June 21. Ignoring the art-craft divide, this bold show examines ceramics in its own right. With George Ohr as Jackson Pollock, it ranges from postwar greats like Peter Voulkos and Ken Price, to younger eminences like Adrian Saxe and Arlene Shechet, to new arrivals like Sterling Ruby, Jessica Jackson Hutchins and Jeffry Mitchell. The clash of approaches to beauty, technique, scale, color and finish is exuberantly edifying. It foments hope that the Minimal-Conceptual-Relational art religion (important as it is) could wither away, and curators of contemporary art could regain full use of their eyes and thus their brains. 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Smith)20090528
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHEPARD FAIREY: SUPPLY AND DEMAND,' through Aug. 16. The surprise of the first museum retrospective for the creator of the Obama ''Hope'' poster is that almost everything he does, from abstracted images of Andre the Giant to his album covers for Led Zeppelin and other bands, is visually arresting. But in tracking his 20-year evolution from aesthetic anarchist to savvy, all-purpose designer and illustrator, the exhibition inadvertently casts doubt on his authenticity as a radical street artist. 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, (617) 478-3100, icaboston.org. 20090528

 ZOE LEONARD, through Sept. 7. Always an exceptionally moving artist, though only sporadically visible, Zoe Leonard has an exhibition at Dia:Beacon, an hour and a half north of the city. It is different from some of her earlier shows: cooler and less intimate, documentary in form, broadly social in scope. At the same time, it shares a sensibility with what has come before, one attuned to realities of constant change, which as often as not means loss. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)20090528
 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN ART, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION: 'MAMI WATA: ARTS FOR WATER SPIRITS IN AFRICA AND ITS DIASPORAS,' through July 26. Mami Wata is Mother Water, Mother of Fish, goddess of oceans, rivers and pools, with sources in West and Central Africa and tributaries throughout the African Americas, from Bahia to Brooklyn. Usually shown as a half-woman, half-fish, she slips with ease between incompatible elements: water and air, tradition and modernity, this life and the next. Provider of riches, she is the natural bailout savior for our time, and this exhibition, organized by the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles, presents her in all her shape-shifting glory. The show's creator, Henry John Drewal, has compressed three decades of Mami watching into vivid visual form; the Washington curator, Christine Mullen Kreamer, has devised a fantastic, subaqueous showcase for a powerhouse spiritual diva. 950 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. 20090528

 MICHELLE HANDELMAN: 'DORIAN'; closes on Sunday. Inspired by Oscar Wilde's ''Picture of Dorian Grey,'' Ms. Handelman's video installation is a downbeat mix of ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' set to ethereal, avant-garde music. Following the nightmarish adventures in hipsterland of a young woman named Dorian, it takes viewers on a delirious bad trip from innocence to experience.

 RON NAGLE: 'BOOKENDS, WEEORAMAS AND FLAREWARE'; closes on Saturday. This California artist has been creating small ceramic wonders since the 1960s. The eight delightful and diminutive sculptures in this show revolve around the form of bookends: twin, L-shaped structures between which you could sandwich a couple of slim volumes of poetry. The cracker-thin ends have matte, granular surfaces lovingly glazed in hues ranging from earthy grays to Sunday funnies primaries. They also have sexually and scatologically suggestive elements nicely offsetting the hallucinogenic beauty.

 ALBERT OEHLEN; closes on Saturday. This unpredictable German painter continues to insist that any painting is foremost the story of its own making, and then makes it extremely entertaining. Here slap-dash Abstract Expressionist brushwork is applied to canvases selectively collaged with Spanish posters. The distinction between hand-worked and machine-made would seem obvious, except that it's not, and then it is. The notion of trompe l'oeil is upended; blazing white canvas plays a starring role. The results are both culturally witty and formally rigorous. Luhring Augustine Gallery, 531 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9100, luhringaugustine.com. (Smith)20090528
 ALBERT OEHLEN: COMPUTER PAINTINGS; closes on Saturday. In these black-and-white paintings made, or started, in the early 1990s, Mr. Oehlen created on the computer an infrastructure of grainy, spiraling lines full of live-wire snap and fizz that he then supplemented with bits of collage and brushwork. Warhol and Pollock are invoked. This exhibition makes obvious the need for one devoted to Mr. Oehlen's color computer paintings from the same period. They're even better. Skarstedt Gallery, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 737-2060, skarstedt.com. (Smith)20090528
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'JENNY HOLZER: PROTECT PROTECT';closes on Sunday. After decades of pelting us with unsettling, increasingly relevant portents, Jenny Holzer can say, ''I told you so.'' This 15-year survey proves that her signature LED-sign conflations of poetry, politics, reading and seeing are ever more dazzling; her warnings about the military-commercial-entertainment complex ever more pertinent. In addition, as time has overtaken her, Ms. Holzer has turned from soothsaying to simply reporting the facts. Her latest light works and paintings take their language and motifs entirely from declassified and redacted government documents concerning the war in Iraq. This is a beautiful show, but not a pretty sight.(212) 570-3600, whitney.org.20090528

HEADLINE: Campaigns Address Today's Anxieties By Looking Back

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
ADVERTISING almost always wants to be upbeat, the better to jolly consumers into, well, consuming. So it is startling to see a spate of campaigns invoking some of the most downbeat times America has ever endured: the desperate decade that began when the stock market crashed in 1929 and continued through the Great Depression.
 For instance, a campaign for Farmers insurance talks about how the company was started ''a year before the crash.'' 
 ''Back then,'' an announcer says in a television commercial, referring to the financial crisis of March 1933, ''when others paid claims with i.o.u.'s, we paid cash.''
 The clothing retailer Brooks Brothers is reprinting advertisements that appeared during dire years like 1934. Newspaper ads for the Gourmet Garage chain of food stores promote special sales called ''new deals'' -- complete with drawings of a grinning Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
 Commercials for Allstate insurance discuss the company's founding in 1931 as the spokesman Dennis Haysbert walks past period photographs that include depictions of the Dust Bowl. Print ads for Soyjoy bars, which also cite the Dust Bowl, describe how ''the Great Depression turned the land of opportunity into a land of despair.''
 And a catalog for the Postal Service, selling a new stamped envelope bearing an image of Seabiscuit, describes how the horse ''raised the spirits of a beleaguered nation during the Great Depression.''
 The look back at the 1930s is inspired by current financial conditions, which many economists have described as the worst since the Depression. Those comparisons are much on the minds of consumers, according to agency and marketing executives.
 ''A lot of people are drawing that parallel,'' said Kevin Kelso, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Farmers Insurance Group in Los Angeles. ''They sort of feel the 'D word' is perhaps in the air.''
 Farmers recently began running its history-themed campaign, created by the Richards Group in Dallas. The point is ''not to dwell on 'Are we in a depression?' '' Mr. Kelso said, but rather to communicate that ''there have been hard times we have weathered together -- and come out stronger than we were going in.''
 ''We see it as an optimistic message,'' he added.
 Consumers expressed those same feelings during tests of the Soyjoy campaign, said Lisa Bennett, chief creative officer at the DDB West unit of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group.
 ''People said, 'The Great Depression is somewhat similar to what we're going through now, and we did come out of it,' '' said Ms. Bennett, who is based in San Francisco. 
 Likewise, the campaign for Soyjoy, sold by a division of Otsuka Pharmaceutical, ''is focusing on the positive aspects rather than the negative,'' she added, recounting how farmers planted soybeans to replenish the soil with nitrogen.
 ''With the stabilization of the land helping to stabilize the economy,'' the ad says, ''America was slowly pulled out of the Great Depression.''
 The first marketer to revisit the '30s may have been Allstate, which began running its commercials in January. The campaign was created by Leo Burnett in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe.
 The spots were meant to address that ''the public was more than a little worried about its money,'' said Lisa Cochrane, vice president for marketing at the Allstate Corporation in Northbrook, Ill., ''and casting some wary glances at the insurance industry.''
 Allstate's birth during the Depression, as a division of Sears, Roebuck & Company, was a catalyst for the commercials, she added, which begin with Mr. Haysbert declaring dryly that ''1931 was not exactly a great year to start a business.'' 
 He goes on to say that ''through the 12 recessions since,'' Allstate has ''noticed that after the fears subside, a funny thing happens. People start to enjoy the small things in life: a home-cooked meal. Time with loved ones. Appreciating the things we do have ... the things we can count on.'' 
 The tone is meant ''not to be depressing,'' Ms. Cochrane said, ''but to be optimistic, to say to Americans, 'Hey, together we can do this; together we can survive this.' ''
 ''One thing about the Depression: things were bad,'' she added, ''but we were all in the same boat.''
 Asked if ads about bad times are a risk, Ms. Cochrane replied: ''I don't ever think it's a risky thing when you tell the truth, and tell it in a way that's comforting.''
 Indeed, she said, in her 32 years in the business, ''I have never received so much unsolicited, plain-old-everyday-American correspondence'' praising a campaign.
 One result is a sequel, Ms. Cochrane said, that seeks to sound like people who lived through the Depression talking about ''the good old days, when the best thing was to have a potluck supper or to go fishing.''
 The new commercial starts with Mr. Haysbert intoning: ''In the last year, we've learned a lot. We've learned that meatloaf and Jenga can actually be more fun than reservations and box seats. That who's around your TV is more important than how big it is.''
 That light touch is also being taken by Gourmet Garage in New York, which is creating its campaign internally.
 ''I just thought it would resonate with people,'' said Andy Arons, chief executive at Gourmet Garage, who runs the company with his business partner, Adam Hartman, because the ads are ''apropos for the times.''
 Some of the ''new deals'' have been big hits, Mr. Arons said, adding that during the sale on rib-eye black Angus beef, ''we went from selling five or six hundred pounds a week to 3,000 pounds.''
 The only problem with the campaign, Mr. Arons said, is that some of the younger generation has looked at the caricature of F.D.R. and asked: '' 'Who's that guy? And why is he smoking?' '' 

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Gourmet Garage food stores have promoted ''new deals.''
A Depression-era insurance office was depicted in a campaign for Farmers. One of the company's executives said the point was that ''there have been hard times we have weathered together.''
 Allstate's commercials began running in January and featured the actor Dennis Haysbert. They recalled the insurer's founding in 1931 as part of Sears, Roebuck and carried an optimistic tone.

HEADLINE: Still Working, but Forced to Make Do With Less

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: LINCOLN, Calif. 

 BODY:
The Ferrells have cut back on dance lessons for their twin daughters. Vaccinations for the family's two cats and two dogs are out. Haircuts have become a luxury. 
 And before heading out recently to the discount grocery store that has become the family's new lifeline, Sharon Ferrell checked her bank account balance one more time, dialing the toll-free number from memory.
 ''Your available balance for withdrawal is, $490.40,'' the disembodied electronic voice informed her.
 At the store, with that number firmly in mind, she punched the price of each item into a calculator as she dropped it into her cart, making sure she stayed under her limit. It was all part of a new regimen of fiscal restraint for the Ferrells, begun in January, when state workers, including Mrs. Ferrell's husband, Jeff, were forced to accept two-day-a-month furloughs. 
 For millions of families, this is the recession: not a layoff, or a drastic reduction in income, but a pay cut that has forced them to thrash through daily calculations similar to the Ferrells'. Even if workers have managed to avoid being laid off, many employers have cut back in other ways, reducing employees' hours, imposing furloughs and even sometimes trimming salaries. 
 About 6.7 million people were working fewer than 35 hours a week in April because of ''slack work or business conditions,'' nearly double the number a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A recent survey of 518 large companies by Hewitt Associates, a human resources consulting firm, found 16 percent had cut pay and 20 percent had cut hours or imposed furloughs, far more than the firm has seen in previous recessions. (The actual percentage of workers affected is likely to be significantly lower.)
 Some have managed to absorb the shrinking of their paychecks with minimal pain, especially households where a second income has helped cushion the blow.
 Melissa Saavedra, a customer service technician for the City of Redlands, Calif., who normally earned about $38,000 a year, took a 10 percent pay cut along with other city workers in January. 
 In part because Ms. Saavedra's husband was still employed at an electronics company, the family of five had so far made only modest adjustments. She and her husband take their lunch to work now; she tries to buy meat on sale at the grocery and clips coupons. ''We probably had extra money left over every month,'' she said. ''Now there's less of that money, but we're still O.K.''
 For families like the Ferrells, however, who were already just a car repair or an appliance breakdown away from falling behind, even a modest step down can bring hard choices.
 The furloughs meant a roughly 9 percent reduction to Mr. Ferrell's $72,000-a-year salary as an industrial hygienist, in which he evaluates health hazards in the workplace. The couple and their two sets of twins -- the older twins are 7 and the younger are 20 months -- have had to make do with about $450 less per month.
 Should they cut the $315 a month they were spending on ballet lessons for the older twins? What about the $55 a month for the satellite television service they had because they could not get regular cable in their semi-rural home here about 40 miles outside of Sacramento? 
 Rising living expenses over the last few years had mostly exhausted the family's savings and led to several thousand dollars in credit card debt.
 The Ferrells had only recently begun to relax a bit after Mr. Ferrell, 55, received a 5 percent raise in December. But the furloughs, which are slated to extend at least to mid-2010, took away the raise and then some, dropping Mr. Ferrell's take-home pay to $4,856 a month from $5,308.
 In January, the couple sat down at their computer in their cluttered living room and waded through their major bills, including the mortgage, utilities and car insurance. The Ferrells concluded they had just $1,200 a month left over to cover everything else, from groceries to diapers. 
 Many of their remaining expenses seemed impossible to reduce by much, like the roughly $360 a month for gas. It quickly became apparent how little the family had left over for necessities like food. 
 ''People just say: 'Oh, it's just a 10 percent pay cut. Cut the fat out of your budget,' '' Mrs. Ferrell said. ''But we've cut the fat. We've cut the fat all along, and so this is really pushing us close to the bone now.''
 Mrs. Ferrell began mapping out family dinners a month in advance on a refrigerator whiteboard. Instead of grocery shopping at regular supermarkets, she began loading up her minivan once a month at WinCo, a giant, no-frills discount grocery chain.
 ''That way I can control exactly what I buy,'' she said. ''I make menus so that I don't over-shop, or don't impulse-purchase at the store.''
 Mrs. Ferrell estimated the approach saves the family as much as $200 a month.
 When the Ferrells told the children's dance teacher they might have to take a break, she let them attend free for a month. Eventually, the couple decided to continue to pay for lessons, on a reduced schedule, which saved $65 a month. 
 ''They're little girls, and they shouldn't have to worry about it,'' Mr. Ferrell said. ''They should be able to enjoy their childhood. They only get the one.''
 The couple decided to keep the satellite television because of the children's programming. 
 But Mrs. Ferrell has not had a haircut in six months; Mr. Farrell longer than that. They have also cut back on trims for the older twins.
 ''We put a lot of conditioner in,'' Mrs. Ferrell said.
 When the family ran short on sliced bread, Mrs. Ferrell hauled out the breadmaker. She takes few pictures of their toddlers now, because of the cost of film and developing. The Dollar Store has become a regular stop. 
 The air-conditioning in Mrs. Ferrell's minivan broke recently. Instead of fixing it, she tries to drive only when it is cool out, or go to places where she knows she can park in the shade. 
 In the end, a stash of savings bonds that Mrs. Ferrell's grandparents gave her as a child, which the couple had hoped to save for a home renovation, has become the family's salvation. In late March, Mrs. Ferrell redeemed one for $2,300. She calculates that at their current rate they have enough bonds to last another year. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, however, is proposing an additional 5 percent salary cut. Mrs. Ferrell hopes her family can simply hang on.

HEADLINE: Oil Rises As OPEC Keeps Quota Unchanged

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
OPEC decided at a meeting on Thursday in Vienna to keep production quotas unchanged, banking on a recovery in oil demand toward the end of this year.
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, responsible for 40 percent of global crude supply, agreed to maintain production quotas at 24.845 million barrels a day, the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said. It is the second time this year the 12-member group has met without revising that total. 
 ''The market is oversupplied, it's true,'' Abdalla Salem el-Badri, the OPEC secretary general, told a news conference afterward, saying the group had decided against cutting output to avoid sending the ''wrong signal'' and disrupting an economic recovery. ''If we are able to keep this $60 to $70 price for the remainder of the year, it will be fine,'' he said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
 Oil futures in New York have gained 45 percent this year on speculation that demand would revive as the global economy started to recover. Prices were little changed immediately after OPEC's decision. Later in the day, an inventory decline helped raise crude prices to a six-month high. Oil closed at $65.08 on Thursday in New York.
 ''I don't think there was any way they could justify cutting again at $60-plus crude,'' said Mike Wittner, head of oil research at Societe Generale in London. ''If they can maintain discipline and limit the production creep that comes with higher prices, stocks should start to come down.''
 OPEC has yet to complete previous reductions that came into effect at the start of the year.
 Saudi Arabia is the only member so far to have curbed production to below its national quota, according to estimates from OPEC and the International Energy Agency. 
 The energy agency, which is based in Paris, cut its oil-demand forecast for a ninth consecutive month in May, predicting global consumption this year would fall the most since 1981. Mr. Naimi of Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday that while he expected consumption to recover in Asia, he had yet to see signs of increasing demand in Europe or in the United States.
 The group's next meeting will be on Sept. 9.

OFFSHORE
 Opens on Friday in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Diane Cheklich
 1 hour 32 minutes; not rated 
 Is there a tougher sell in today's downsized, penny-pinched marketplace than a comedy about the migration of American jobs to India? ''Offshore'' is about to find out. 
 Taking broad swipes at both cultures, this low-budget, mildly diverting endeavor from Diane Cheklich follows the fallout when a modular-furniture manufacturer in Michigan outsources its call center to Mumbai. Informed by e-mail, the company's disgruntled employees rebel when their training officer (Deb Tunis, a real-life corporate trainer) is forced to drill their overeducated, underpaid replacements. Interracial hazing ensues.
 Filmed mostly indoors in the Detroit area and Mumbai, ''Offshore'' shuttles between American anger and Indian industriousness with no discernible difference in production values or acting ability, both of which are call-center appropriate. Malaika Shenoy, playing one of the beleaguered hirees, puts her back into her role as a former phone-sex operator but is hampered by a script that veers from infantile to ugly and a director who doesn't know when to say ''cut.'' At times the camera clung so long to the end of a scene that I was convinced that its operator had fallen asleep.
 Though not without its charms -- the scenes in Mumbai are comically chaotic -- ''Offshore'' might have raised more chuckles when it was made, in 2006, than in the economic chill of 2009. And not only in Michigan. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

HEADLINE: U.S. Manufacturing Orders Rose Sharply in April

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
In a sign that business investment may be stabilizing, orders for goods like metals, machinery and electronic equipment picked up in April, the government reported on Thursday.
 The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods rose 1.9 percent last month, by $3 billion to a total of $161.5 billion. That was a larger increase than expected, but it came after a sharp drop of 2.1 percent in March. 
 After that decline, shipments of durable goods fell 0.2 percent in April, and total inventories fell 0.8 percent. But businesses ordered more fabricated metal products, machinery and motor vehicles.
 Excluding military orders, the number of new durable goods orders increased 1 percent.
 By some measures, economists have said, a sharp decline in industrial output and business activity is beginning to level off. Manufacturers say their outlook is improving slightly, and sharp declines in industrial production have decreased this spring. Construction spending rose modestly in March, and some home builders are beginning to feel a bit more optimistic.
 But economists said that the figures released Thursday hardly indicated a swift turnaround.
 ''The absolute worst is over, but what we have now is still quite bad,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note. ''Just about the only thing we can say with real confidence is that the headlong plunge in orders after the Lehman bankruptcy is over.''
 Also on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment insurance fell 13,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 623,000. 
 But the number of continuing jobless claims rose to 6.8 million -- more than double their level of 3.1 million a year ago. With employers still cutting jobs as they try to save money, people are finding it harder to get new work. The Labor Department said that 27 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for six months or more.

HEADLINE: The Hoped-For Laser Miracles

 BODY:
The world's most powerful installation of lasers will be dedicated in California on Friday before a throng of well-wishers. The new National Ignition Facility, or NIF, is touted as an important step toward maintaining the nation's nuclear deterrent, developing fusion energy and conducting basic research. We hope its next few years will go a lot better than its problem-plagued development phase. There is a high risk of failure. 
 NIF, in a building the size of a football stadium, is built on an awesome scale, as described by William J. Broad in Science Times on Tuesday. It will use 192 lasers to fire light beams through a complicated array of mirrors and amplifiers to pulverize a tiny target filled with hydrogen fuel. The resulting heat and compression are supposed to fuse the hydrogen atoms into helium, releasing transient bursts of thermonuclear energy.
When first proposed in 1994, the facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was expected to cost $1.2 billion and be completed by 2002. But technical, practical and managerial problems caused repeated delays and drove up costs to $3.5 billion or more. Now NIF will be coming into operation barely ahead of a competing laser facility under construction in France. 
 The project's primary purpose has always been to help weapons scientists ensure the reliability of the American nuclear arsenal without underground testing. The notion is that experiments under the extreme conditions of fusion would allow bomb makers to study the physics of nuclear weapons without exploding them and check the accuracy of computer codes that calculate how well weapons will perform. It is a worthy goal, but some experts believe there are better ways to ensure reliability and question NIF's importance.
 The latest focus, at least in promoting the project, has been the potential to achieve fusion energy, a carbon-free, widely available source of power should it ever prove attainable. The principal goal over the next year or two is to reach self-sustaining ''ignition,'' the point at which more energy is produced from fused atoms than is applied to make it happen. Scientists at NIF seem confident that they will succeed, but so many things have to go right simultaneously that many experts deem ignition unlikely any time soon. And even ignition is a long way from achieving practical, economical fusion power. 
 A more immediate payoff could come from basic research on processes that occur under pressures and temperatures typically found at the cores of stars or giant planets. Some critics view NIF as an expensive toy for weapons scientists. But the energy potential is alluring enough that all of us should root for NIF to succeed.

HEADLINE: Declining Book Sales Cast Gloom At an Expo

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
The juggernaut of Stephenie Meyer's ''Twilight'' series could not overcome the overpowering effects of a global recession last year as publishers sold fewer books in 2008 than the year before, according to the Book Industry Study group, a trade association.
 Publishers sold 3.08 billion copies in 2008, down 1.5 percent from the 3.13 billion copies sold the previous year, according to Book Industry Trends 2009, an annual report that analyzes sales in the United States. Higher retail prices helped to lift net revenue just 1 percent, to $40.3 billion from $39.9 billion. 
 The numbers confirm a litany of dreary news that has emerged from the publishing industry since last fall, when booksellers began seeing significant declines in store traffic. The trend has not abated this year, as publishers have continued to report double-digit sales declines. Borders Group announced Tuesday that first-quarter sales dropped 12 percent.
 Against this backdrop, publishers, authors, booksellers and librarians are gathering in New York for BookExpo America, the industry's annual convention, which runs through Sunday. 
 Authors including Richard Russo and Lisa Scottoline, as well as celebrities like Julie Andrews and Steven Tyler, lead singer of Aerosmith, will be featured, while several panels will focus on the effects of digital publishing on the beleaguered industry. 
 Attendance is down 14 percent from about 35,000 who attended in 2007, the last time the convention was held in New York. Many publishing houses have toned down their customary parties from splashy sit-down dinners to cocktails-only events. 
 The data from Book Industry Trends reflected a change in methods as the Book Industry Study Group hired Outsell, a research company, to survey publishers and solicit sales data. Previously, researchers analyzed already-published numbers. This was the second change in less than five years. In 2005, figures from small and mid-size publishers were added.
 According to the report, sales of adult trade books (fiction and nonfiction for the general market) declined 2.3 percent to 1.35 billion copies from 1.38 billion in 2007. Net revenue in the segment also slid 2.3 percent to $11.13 billion from $11.39 billion. Publishers expressed hope that ''The Lost Symbol,'' a novel by Dan Brown, might increase book sales when it is released in September.
 Somewhat surprisingly, the data showed that sales of juvenile books, which include the hugely popular ''Twilight'' series, fell by 1.3 percent to 889 million copies, from 901 million copies. Leigh Watson Healy, chief analyst at Outsell, said that the blockbuster sales of Ms. Meyer's books were not enough to propel the category forward and could not replace the absence of a new Harry Potter book. 
 But according to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of retail sales, the number of juvenile books sold in 2008 was 154.9 million, up nearly 6 percent from 146.2 million in 2007. (The 2008 numbers do not include nontraditional retailers like grocery or drugstores that were added to BookScan's numbers just last year.) Ms. Meyer's books sold 15.5 million copies in 2008, compared with 11.3 million Harry Pottery books in 2007, the year that the final installment in the series, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,'' was released.
 The report showed strong sales of professional and kindergarten through 12th grade and college textbooks. Ms. Healy said that budget cuts had not yet caught up to these segments. 
 Sales of religious books, previously a bright spot for the publishing industry, plummeted 10 percent to 247 million copies from 275 million copies.
 Michael Hyatt, chief executive of Thomas Nelson, one of the country's largest religious publishers, said the category did not have a top-selling book like ''The Purpose Driven Life'' by Rick Warren or the ''Left Behind'' series last year. The success of those books, Mr. Hyatt said, helped benefit all books in the category because ''when people walked into a store to pick up those titles, they picked up something else.''
 The data examined sales of electronic books for reading devices like Amazon.com's Kindle or Sony's Reader Digital Book. In the adult trade segment, for example, net revenues for e-books totaled $113 million, up nearly 7 percent from $105 million in 2007. Publishers have cited increases much higher than that.

HEADLINE: Hope, but No Advances, in China-U.S. Climate Talks

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Five days of talks aimed at bringing China and the United States closer together on the issue of climate change did not yield substantial progress, according to a Congressional delegation that met with environmental officials and the country's top leaders this week.
 During a news conference on Thursday night, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of House, said she was ''hopeful'' after meeting with a number of officials, including President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. 
 But Representative F. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who took part, said he was discouraged by the Chinese refusal to commit to greater cuts in greenhouse gases while insisting that developed nations do more to reduce their emissions. 
 ''It's business as usual for China,'' said Mr. Sensenbrenner, the ranking Republican on the House Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming. ''The message that I received was that China was going to do it their way regardless of what the rest of the world negotiates in Copenhagen.'' 
 He was referring to the United Nations summit on climate change to be held in Denmark this year, the successor to the meeting in Kyoto, Japan, which produced the last global warming agreement in 1997. In previous statements, China has suggested that developed nations reduce emissions by 40 percent by 2020 from 1995 levels. By contrast, Mr. Sensenbrenner said, Chinese officials have linked their proposed reductions to the size of China's economy, which is growing significantly. The resulting math, he said, would mean ''a significant increase in emissions in China.''
 China and the United States are responsible for nearly half the world's output of carbon gases, although many scientists say the Chinese share is larger and growing at a rapid pace due to its reliance on coal-fired power plants. 
 In addition to discussing climate change, Ms. Pelosi said she raised a number of issues during her talks with Chinese leaders, including intellectual property rights, human rights and North Korea's test of a nuclear device on Monday. 
 While she did not provide details of those talks, she described them as ''candid'' and said they included such delicate topics as Tibet and China's rights record. She said she had ''encouraged conversations with his holiness, the Dalai Lama, or his representatives.'' Until Thursday, Ms. Pelosi, who is known here for her strident criticisms of China's human rights record, had not spoken about the issue in public statements or during an appearance before students and faculty at Tsinghua University. 
 Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House global warming committee, acknowledged that without significant concessions from China, Congress might be disinclined to act on its own package of emissions limits.
 But after years of American intransigence on global warming, Mr. Markey said he thought China would be influenced by the Obama administration's commitment to the issue. ''We leave here with some sense that we can reach an agreement,'' he said, although he added a caveat. ''This is going to be on one of the most complex diplomatic negotiations in the history of the world,'' he said.
 Not everyone involved in the discussions was so pessimistic. During a news conference earlier in the day, Senator John Kerry said he was encouraged by Chinese leaders' commitment to tackling climate change. He noted that China in recent years had tripled its capacity for wind generation, enacted vehicle fuel standards tougher than those in America and closed hundreds of obsolete, coal-fired power plants. ''It's unequivocally the most constructive and productive discussions I've ever had with Chinese officials,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Not So Fast, Nukes

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: OLKILUOTO, Finland 

 BODY:
As the Obama administration tries to steer America toward cleaner sources of energy, it would do well to consider the cautionary tale of this new-generation nuclear reactor site. 
 The massive power plant under construction on muddy terrain on this Finnish island was supposed to be the showpiece of a nuclear renaissance. The most powerful reactor ever built, its modular design was supposed to make it faster and cheaper to build. And it was supposed to be safer, too.
 But things have not gone as planned. 
 After four years of construction and thousands of defects and deficiencies, the reactor's 3 billion euro price tag, about $4.2 billion, has climbed at least 50 percent. And while the reactor was originally meant to be completed this summer, Areva, the French company building it, and the utility that ordered it, are no longer willing to make certain predictions on when it will go online. 
 While the American nuclear industry has predicted clear sailing after its first plants are built, the problems in Europe suggest these obstacles may be hard to avoid. 
 A new fleet of reactors would be standardized down to ''the carpeting and wallpaper,'' as Michael J. Wallace, the chairman of UniStar Nuclear Energy -- a joint venture between EDF Group and Constellation Energy, the Maryland-based utility -- has said repeatedly. 
 In the end, he says, that standardization will lead to significant savings. 
 But early experience suggests these new reactors will be no easier or cheaper to build than the ones of a generation ago, when cost overruns -- and then accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl -- ended the last nuclear construction boom. 
 In Flamanville, France, a clone of the Finnish reactor now under construction is also behind schedule and overbudget. 
 In the United States, Florida and Georgia have changed state laws to raise electricity rates so that consumers will foot some of the bill for new nuclear plants in advance, before construction even begins.
 ''A number of U.S. companies have looked with trepidation on the situation in Finland and at the magnitude of the investment there,'' said Paul L. Joskow, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a co-author of an influential report on the future of nuclear power in 2003. ''The rollout of new nuclear reactors will be a good deal slower than a lot of people were assuming.''
 For nuclear power to have a high impact on reducing greenhouse gases, an average of 12 reactors would have to be built worldwide each year until 2030, according to the Nuclear Energy Agency at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Right now, there are not even enough reactors under construction to replace those that are reaching the end of their lives. 
 And of the 45 reactors being built around the world, 22 have encountered construction delays, according to an analysis prepared this year for the German government by Mycle Schneider, an energy analyst and a critic of the nuclear industry. He added that nine do not have official start-up dates. 
 Most of the new construction is underway in countries like China and Russia, where strong central governments have made nuclear energy a national priority. India also has long seen nuclear as part of a national drive for self-sufficiency and now is seeking new nuclear technologies to reduce its reliance on imported uranium.
 By comparison, ''the state has been all over the place in the United States and Europe on nuclear power,'' Mr. Joskow said.
 The United States generates about one-fifth of its electricity from a fleet of 104 reactors, most built in the 1960s and 1970s. Coal still provides about half the country's power. 
 To streamline construction, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington has worked with the industry to approve a handful of designs. Even so, the schedule to certify the most advanced model from Westinghouse, a unit of Toshiba, has slipped during an ongoing review of its ability to withstand the impact of an airliner. 
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has also not yet approved the so-called EPR design under construction in Finland for the American market. 
 This month, the United States Energy Department produced a short list of four reactor projects eligible for some loan guarantees. In the 2005 energy bill, Congress provided $18.5 billion, but the industry's hope of winning an additional $50 billion worth of loan guarantees evaporated when that money was stripped from President Obama's economic stimulus bill. 
 The industry has had more success in getting states to help raise money. This year, authorities permitted Florida Power & Light to start charging millions of customers several dollars a month to finance four new reactors. Customers of Georgia Power, a subsidiary of the Southern Co., will pay on average $1.30 a month more in 2011, rising to $9.10 by 2017, to help pay for two reactors expected to go online in 2016 or later. 
 But resistance is mounting. In April, Missouri legislators balked at a preconstruction rate increase, prompting the state's largest electric utility, Ameren UE, to suspend plans for a $6 billion copy of Areva's Finnish reactor. 
 Areva, a conglomerate largely owned by the French state, is heir to that nation's experience in building nuclear plants. France gets about 80 percent of its power from 58 reactors. But even France has not completed a new reactor since 1999. 
 After designing an updated plant originally called the European Pressurized Reactor with German participation during the 1990s, the French had trouble selling it at home because of a saturated energy market as well as opposition from Green Party members in the then-coalition government. 
 So Areva turned to Finland, where utilities and energy-hungry industries like pulp and paper had been lobbying for 15 years for more nuclear power. The project was initially budgeted at $4 billion and Teollisuuden Voima, the Finnish utility, pledged it would be ready in time to help the Finnish government meet its greenhouse gas targets under the Kyoto climate treaty, which runs through 2012. 
 Areva promised electricity from the reactor could be generated more cheaply than from natural gas plants. Areva also said its model would deliver 1,600 megawatts, or about 10 percent of Finnish power needs. 
 In 2001, the Finnish parliament narrowly approved construction of a reactor at Olkiluoto, an island on the Baltic Sea. Construction began four years later. 
 Serious problems first arose over the vast concrete base slab for the foundation of the reactor building, which the country's Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority found too porous and prone to corrosion. Since then, the authority has blamed Areva for allowing inexperienced subcontractors to drill holes in the wrong places on a vast steel container that seals the reactor. 
 In December, the authority warned Anne Lauvergeon, the chief executive of Areva, that ''the attitude or lack of professional knowledge of some persons'' at Areva was holding up work on safety systems. 
 Today, the site still teems with 4,000 workmen on round-the-clock shifts. Banners from dozens of subcontractors around Europe flutter in the breeze above temporary offices and makeshift canteens. Some 10,000 people speaking at least eight different languages have worked at the site. About 30 percent of the workforce is Polish, and communication has posed significant challenges.
 Areva has acknowledged that the cost of a new reactor today would be as much as 6 billion euros, or $8 billion, double the price offered to the Finns. But Areva said it was not cutting any corners in Finland. The two sides have agreed to arbitration, where they are both claiming more than 1 billion euros in compensation. (Areva blames the Finnish authorities for impeding construction and increasing costs for work it agreed to complete at a fixed price.)
 Areva announced a steep drop in earnings last year, which it blamed mostly on mounting losses from the project. 
 In addition, nuclear safety inspectors in France have found cracks in the concrete base and steel reinforcements in the wrong places at the site in Flamanville. They also have warned Electricite de France, the utility building the reactor, that welders working on the steel container were not properly qualified.
 On top of such problems come the recession, weaker energy demand, tight credit and uncertainty over future policies, said Caren Byrd, an executive director of the global utility and power group at Morgan Stanley in New York. 
 ''The warning lights now are flashing more brightly than just a year ago about the cost of new nuclear,'' she said.
 And Jouni Silvennoinen, the project manager at Olkiluoto, said, ''We have had it easy here.'' Olkiluoto is at least a geologically stable site. Earthquake risks in places like China and the United States or even the threat of storm surges mean building these reactors will be even trickier elsewhere.

HEADLINE: PENTAGON PLANS NEW ARM TO WAGE COMPUTER WARS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER; John Markoff contributed reporting from San Francisco.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Pentagon plans to create a new military command for cyberspace, administration officials said Thursday, stepping up preparations by the armed forces to conduct both offensive and defensive computer warfare.
 The military command would complement a civilian effort to be announced by President Obama on Friday that would overhaul the way the United States safeguards its computer networks.
 Mr. Obama, officials said, will announce the creation of a White House office -- reporting to both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council -- that will coordinate a multibillion-dollar effort to restrict access to government computers and protect systems that run the stock exchanges, clear global banking transactions and manage the air traffic control system. 
 White House officials say Mr. Obama has not yet been formally presented with the Pentagon plan. They said he would not discuss it Friday when he announced the creation of a White House office responsible for coordinating private-sector and government defenses against the thousands of cyberattacks mounted against the United States -- largely by hackers but sometimes by foreign governments -- every day. 
 But he is expected to sign a classified order in coming weeks that will create the military cybercommand, officials said. It is a recognition that the United States already has a growing number of computer weapons in its arsenal and must prepare strategies for their use -- as a deterrent or alongside conventional weapons -- in a wide variety of possible future conflicts. 
 The White House office will be run by a ''cyberczar,'' but because the position will not have direct access to the president, some experts said it was not high-level enough to end a series of bureaucratic wars that have broken out as billions of dollars have suddenly been allocated to protect against the computer threats. 
 The main dispute has been over whether the Pentagon or the National Security Agency should take the lead in preparing for and fighting cyberbattles. Under one proposal still being debated, parts of the N.S.A. would be integrated into the military command so they could operate jointly. 
 Officials said that in addition to the unclassified strategy paper to be released by Mr. Obama on Friday, a classified set of presidential directives is expected to lay out the military's new responsibilities and how it coordinates its mission with that of the N.S.A., where most of the expertise on digital warfare resides today.
 The decision to create a cybercommand is a major step beyond the actions taken by the Bush administration, which authorized several computer-based attacks but never resolved the question of how the government would prepare for a new era of warfare fought over digital networks. 
 It is still unclear whether the military's new command or the N.S.A. -- or both -- will actually conduct this new kind of offensive cyberoperations. 
 The White House has never said whether Mr. Obama embraces the idea that the United States should use cyberweapons, and the public announcement on Friday is expected to focus solely on defensive steps and the government's acknowledgment that it needs to be better organized to face the threat from foes attacking military, government and commercial online systems. 
 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has pushed for the Pentagon to become better organized to address the security threat. 
 Initially at least, the new command would focus on organizing the various components and capabilities now scattered across the four armed services. 
 Officials declined to describe potential offensive operations, but said they now viewed cyberspace as comparable to more traditional battlefields. 
 ''We are not comfortable discussing the question of offensive cyberoperations, but we consider cyberspace a war-fighting domain,'' said Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman. ''We need to be able to operate within that domain just like on any battlefield, which includes protecting our freedom of movement and preserving our capability to perform in that environment.'' 
 Although Pentagon civilian officials and military officers said the new command was expected to initially be a subordinate headquarters under the military's Strategic Command, which controls nuclear operations as well as cyberdefenses, it could eventually become an independent command.
 ''No decision has been made,'' said Lt. Col. Eric Butterbaugh, a Pentagon spokesman. ''Just as the White House has completed its 60-day review of cyberspace policy, likewise, we are looking at how the department can best organize itself to fill our role in implementing the administration's cyberpolicy.''
 The creation of the cyberczar's office inside the White House appears to be part of a significant expansion of the role of the national security apparatus there. A separate group overseeing domestic security, created by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks, now resides within the National Security Council. A senior White House official responsible for countering the proliferation of nuclear and unconventional weapons has been given broader authority. Now, cybersecurity will also rank as one of the key threats that Mr. Obama is seeking to coordinate from the White House. 
 The strategy review Mr. Obama will discuss on Friday was completed weeks ago, but delayed because of continuing arguments over the authority of the White House office, and the budgets for the entire effort. 
 It was kept separate from the military debate over whether the Pentagon or the N.S.A. is best equipped to engage in offensive operations. Part of that debate hinges on the question of how much control should be given to American spy agencies, since they are prohibited from acting on American soil.
 ''It's the domestic spying problem writ large,'' one senior intelligence official said recently. ''These attacks start in other countries, but they know no borders. So how do you fight them if you can't act both inside and outside the United States?''

HEADLINE: Time Warner Plans to Spin Off AOL, Ending Huge Deal That Failed

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Time Warner's announcement on Thursday that it will spin off AOL was the much-anticipated divorce filing for a multibillion-dollar corporate marriage that came to symbolize an entire era in American business but that had long been acknowledged as a failure. 
 The company argued that despite the hype and hosannas that greeted the merger announcement in January 2000, the intervening decade has proved that each piece will be better off going its own way. 
 The split, which Time Warner executives have said for months was coming, gave a last echo of the dot-com bubble, which burst in the months after the merger was announced. That deal, one of the biggest in history, came at the height of a national infatuation with Internet and media stocks, a time whose reasoning is hard to recall after living through the ensuing bust and boom and in the depths of a severe recession.
 The merger was fed by heady ideas that did not quite pan out -- that big online audiences would necessarily yield big profits, and that there were profound synergies to be had by owning different media.
 Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner's chief executive, has set about paring down one of the world's largest media conglomerates, in particular shedding delivery mechanisms. The company spun off its cable television subsidiary in March. And AOL, though much-reduced in size, remains a supplier of Internet service to millions of people.
 ''We're focusing the company now on its core content businesses -- TV and film production, television networks and publishing,'' Mr. Bewkes said Thursday at the company's annual meeting. But in other recent comments, he has not ruled out also selling the company's magazine arm, Time Inc., one of the world's largest publishers.
 He added that ''for AOL, becoming a standalone company will give it more focus and more strategic flexibility.'' It could also make it easier for AOL to attract talent and raise capital. He said the details of the spinoff had not been determined but that he expected it to be completed around the end of the year.
 With AOL's revenue and profit shrinking steadily for years, analysts have called it a drag on Time Warner's stock price. The stock closed Thursday at $23.55, up 55 cents.
 ''There's still a substantial business at AOL, but Time Warner investors are giving it little to no -- potentially negative -- value, so separating out should be a positive,'' said Richard Greenfield, a managing director of Pali Capital Research. ''It won't be worth nothing, and people have viewed it as worth nothing, or even a liability.''
 More important, he said, was the message that Mr. Bewkes is pursuing a clear, well-understood strategy. ''They said they were going to get rid of cable. They said they were going to get rid of AOL. And they're doing it,'' he said.
 AOL was built on dial-up Internet service, a once-booming, now almost-forgotten, business. And like many dot-coms in the 1990s, its stock price ballooned far out of proportion to its financial performance. Before the merger, AOL's market capitalization was more than twice Time Warner's, but it had less than one-quarter the revenue of its new partner.
 When the merger was announced in 2000, the two companies had a combined market value of more than $300 billion. 
 By the time the deal was consummated in 2001, with Internet stocks plunging and recession taking hold, that had fallen more than $100 billion. Today, the combined market capitalization of Time Warner and the new Time Warner Cable is less than $40 billion.
 Steve Case, the AOL chief and co-founder, who was chairman of the merged company until 2003, has been publicly advocating splitting them again since 2005. On Twitter on Thursday, he insisted that the combination could have worked as planned but was poorly run.
 In one tweet, he wrote, ''Thomas Edison: 'Vision without execution is hallucination' -- pretty much sums up AOL/TW -- failure of leadership (myself included).''
 Time Warner's strategy for AOL has mirrored the entire company's -- a move away from delivery and toward content. It has hired prominent journalists to build a series of online magazines, trying to capitalize on the stream of visitors to its site.
 For three years, AOL has been steadily getting out of the business of paid Internet service, becoming more reliant on advertising sales, but that strategy has been hampered by the worst advertising slump in generations. In March, Time Warner named a new chairman and chief executive of AOL, Tim Armstrong, who had headed advertising sales at Google.
 AOL has about 6 million paying subscribers in the United States, down from 13 million at the end of 2006. Last year, for the first time, subscription revenue was smaller than ad revenue. Over all, AOL had $4.2 billion in revenue last year, down from $9.1 billion in 2002.
 Time Warner as a whole, including the cable unit that is now a separate company, had $47 billion in revenue last year.

HEADLINE: Couturier Seeks Creditor Protection

BYLINE: By SUZY MENKES

 BODY:
Christian Lacroix, the French couturier whose artistic and exuberant pouf dresses propelled him to fame in the 1980s, became the latest victim of the global financial crisis on Thursday when the fashion house bearing his name filed for court protection from creditors. 
 The voluntary petition, similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States, was filed with the commercial court in Paris, which will decide whether to restructure or liquidate the company. 
 Although Lacroix's chief executive, Nicolas Topiol, emphasized that the brand intended to continue operating during the process, the news brought an end to a luxury business model. 
 Founded in 1987 by Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the concept was to start with haute couture, at the apex of the luxury pyramid, and develop from it a range of ready-to-wear apparel, accessories and fragrances. This was the system that had reaped mighty profits for established houses like Christian Dior and Chanel.
 But despite years of critical success, the company failed to break even, let alone turn a profit. Mr. Arnault sold Lacroix in 2005 to the Falic Group, a business based in Florida known for its Duty Free Americas chain. The Falic brothers sought to refocus the luxury brand at the peak, suppressing the lower-priced clothing and jeans lines. 
 ''Since the acquisition of Christian Lacroix SNC, we have been committed to the brand and to its high-end development,'' Mr. Topiol said in a statement. ''We will continue to do so, but the sharp downturn of the luxury market has significantly hurt our revenues.'' 
 The owners had been in discussion with potential financial partners and investors for the last year, Mr. Topiol said, adding ''this process which was in its final phase, was directly hit by the conditions of the financial markets and could not be finalized prior to the filing.'' 
 According to people close to the matter, Lacroix was badly hit in the United States, where it had opened two stores in New York and Las Vegas and where buyers had recently reduced or canceled orders. Ready-to-wear sales for the coming autumn season were down 35 percent and losses for 2008 were 10 million euros ($14 million) on overall revenues of about 30 million euros.
 Mr. Topiol's statement said only that the ''long-term strategy for repositioning of the brand was dramatically hindered'' by the financial crisis. 
 That has been evident for some time across the luxury sector, where even the biggest players are being hurt by recession and financial turmoil. LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods company, recently scrapped a plan to open a Louis Vuitton flagship store in Tokyo. This year, Chanel announced the layoffs of 200 temporary employees. 
 Versace, an independent Italian house, is in a state of turmoil, announcing that revenue fell 13 percent in the first quarter. The board this week approved a three-year plan to steer the company through the economic crisis while continuing to deny rumors that its chief executive of four years, Giancarlo Di Risio, will soon exit the company.
 The lessons seem to be that it is now difficult to survive in high fashion without being part of a corporate group that can invest in product development and flagship stores and that the pyramid model is no longer viable. 
 The modern strategy, as exemplified by the growth of the Giorgio Armani brand, is a sunburst, with the designer at the epicenter and all product categories (except sunglasses, which are technically demanding) under the brand control. 
 Yet, significantly, an Armani Prive couture line was created to add prestige and a direct link with celebrity clients. 
 The loss of Christian Lacroix to Paris haute couture is immeasurable. Although the designer hopes to hold a small presentation during the July couture season, this was the last house established under the formal couture rules. Even a restructuring would most likely have severe implications for the 125-member staff. 
 The grandeur of the couturier's work was displayed this month in the sumptuous gown created for Philomena de Tornos, the bride of Jean de France, Duc de Vendome, a descendant of the French royal dynasty. 
 But just as royalty now has less attention than celebrity, so couture has lost its unique prestige, with the word bandied about by any high-end designer. And whereas fragrances produced from the mystique of haute couture once kept the houses afloat, now it is just as likely that a hip jeans brand like Diesel or a celebrity like Jennifer Lopez will have the perfume hit that has stubbornly eluded Lacroix.
 Mr. Lacroix, who received the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur in 2002, for services to fashion, has other strings to his bow, apart from his colorful and sophisticated collections. He was the creative director for Emilio Pucci, the Italian fashion house, from 2002 to 2005, while he was still within the LVMH group.
 He also has his own XCLX company, for which he has created decor for the French TGV high-speed train, as well as hotel interiors and uniforms for Air France. He has also designed for theater, opera and dance and acted as curator for fashion exhibits, including one currently at the National Museum of Singapore.

HEADLINE: At the Plaza Hotel, Flashbacks and Revelations

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
As an exercise in public relations, it was a success: there were oohs. Certainly there were aahs. There was gawking and pointing.
 There was even a smattering of applause for the guide, Francis Morrone, the author and architectural critic who was leading a new, free behind-the-scenes tour, unveiling to the public the controversial $400 million renovation of a city landmark: the Plaza Hotel at Fifth Avenue. 
 But since this was a tour group of 24 New Yorkers, the first question hardly referenced landmark preservation: ''Could you please speak up?'' Brenda Steere asked, competing with the music track in the Plaza's new subterranean luxury shopping mall. 
 Unfazed, Mr. Morrone gestured for the group to gather more closely around him and tore right into his spiel, part of a new effort at the Plaza to put its best foot forward. 
 Some were pleasantly surprised, as the tour headed upstairs. Looking about the lobby for the Plaza's 181 condominium apartments (most of which have sold for $2.5 million to $50 million), Roberta Balsam said, ''They've improved things over the Trump era,'' adding: ''They got rid of that bright green lobby rug. And Trump liked to paint everything gold.'' A retired New York State government manager, she gave her age as ''old enough to know better than to answer.'' 
 Soon Mr. Morrone led the tour into the Grand Ballroom, that neoclassical fantasyland for lavish rites of passage that was reopened a year ago after a $12.5 million renovation. 
 John Sibley, 76, smiled and said, ''I remember being in white tie and tails here, escorting a beautiful young lady.'' 
 ''And I remember spending my honeymoon here in the Plaza,'' said Mr. Sibley, a retired luxury-luggage salesman who added that ''if you were a New Yorker, well, the Plaza was the epitome.''
 The tours, which began in April, require reservations through the hotel, at (212) 546-5477. They are fully booked until June, Mr. Morrone said, ''because there are so many New Yorkers of a certain age who knew the hotel or had dined there.''
 Miki Naftali, president of Elad Properties, the Plaza's owner, said he wanted to show off the landmark public rooms, which, he said, ''have been restored to their original glory.'' Ergo: the hourlong tours every Tuesday and Saturday afternoon, revealing the Plaza as if it were blinking in the daylight after those three Rip Van Winkle renovation years, off-line from the city's party whirl. 
 Elad bought the property for $675 million in 2004 and spent more than it had expected to turn it into a condominium-and-hotel hybrid. In April 2005, responding to protests against a plan to convert the Plaza to condominiums and stores, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg helped broker a compromise that preserved nearly half the hotel rooms and kept the jobs of more than a third of the Plaza's 900 workers. 
 Along the way, Elad confronted union battles, legal threats by condominium buyers, recession headlines about tenant unrest in its underpopulated underground mall and a continuing embarrassment: the fabled Palm Court restaurant has been closed for the last five months in a search for a new operator.
 But now, Mr. Naftali said, ''We are proud of what we accomplished and wanted to invite New Yorkers and visitors in to see for themselves, to engage them and to reassure them that the legend continues.'' 
 For those in the tour group, nostalgia seemed to outpoint architectural correctness. 
 ''I have many fond memories of the Plaza -- my sister Lenore was married here in 1966,'' said Ms. Steere, 70, a retired theater manager. 
 Mr. Morrone, 51, an adjunct professor at New York University and a former architecture critic for the now defunct New York Sun, said, ''I was completely unmoved by the Plaza drama because I didn't think it was one of the greatest buildings in New York.'' 
 But, added Mr. Morrone, whom Elad pays for the tours, ''the restoration transformed my perception of the Plaza as a great building. This is one of several really great city restorations.'' 
 Plaza critics are less celebratory about the face-lift.
 ''I think it is vulgar,'' said David Garrard Lowe, president of the Beaux Arts Alliance in Manhattan, who advocated the preservation of the hotel in 2005. ''No one in charge had any taste. Not that they haven't spent enough money, but this renovation doesn't hit the right notes. The Plaza has lost its gaiety, its sense of public festivity.''
 Another critic, Michele Birnbaum, president of Historic Park Avenue, who worked to support preservation of the public rooms, said that the new owners had ''violated the integrity of the building.'' 
 Mr. Morrone served up many informational curiosities during the tour: In the renovated Terrace Room, ''the chandeliers are a replica of those in the Palace of Versailles,'' he said. And in the reverberating, unoccupied spaces of the quondam Edwardian Room -- once a restaurant and now a function room -- Mr. Morrone pointed on high to the oft-unnoticed mirrored panels in the ceiling, which ''make the room look even loftier than it is,'' he said. 
 When Mr. Morrone segued to the Palm Court, he asked, ''How many of you had tea here?'' Most hands went up. 
 ''The Palm Court was the place for daddy and his girl on special occasions,'' reminisced Judy Katten, a Manhattan lawyer who gave her age as ''55-plus.''
 In the Oak Room restaurant, Mr. Morrone said, ''With the restoration, I was blown away by how beautiful the English oak is now,'' after decades of smoke residue had been removed. 
 Ms. Steere spoke up again: ''The window treatments just don't fit in here,'' she said, indicating the coppery hangings at five decorative windows. 
 Soon, after vamping a bit more on the room's history, Mr. Morrone pointed up to another eccentricity at the central chandelier, topped by a small statue. ''If you look closely,'' he said, ''you can see there is a maiden hoisting a stein of beer.'' 
 Everyone did. Ooh. Aah.

HEADLINE: Latest Threat for College Sports: Students Balk at Paying the Fees

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
In late April, students rebuffed the financially troubled athletic department at the University of New Orleans. They voted against a fee increase to help pay for varsity sports, leaving the university to consider dropping baseball, basketball and every other sport.
 Battered by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and now whipsawed by state budget cuts during a recession, university officials began scrambling to keep the athletics program out of mothballs. A group of businessmen, led by George Shinn, the owner of the New Orleans Hornets, pledged to raise $2 million by July 1 to keep the teams playing.
 Since March, students at three California universities -- Sacramento State, Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton -- have also voted down fee increases to help pay for athletics. Last year, students at Fresno State voted against a rise in athletic fees, but the university's president imposed a modified increase anyway. As athletic costs rise at a rate that the N.C.A.A. warns cannot be sustained, and as states continue to reduce spending on higher education, many athletic departments are seeking income beyond ticket sales, booster donations and television revenue to help stem the flow of red ink.
 Students seem less inclined to pick up the tab, especially at universities that do not field major-college football teams. 
 ''I couldn't afford the increase they were asking for,'' said Roberto Torres, the president-elect of student government at Sacramento State, where athletic fees would have gradually doubled to $250 a year if the vote in April had passed. ''When you see the cost of living going up and the cost of education going up, it's difficult to raise fees for extracurricular activities such as sports.''
 Besides, Mr. Torres said of Sacramento State athletics, ''I just don't think students care too much about it, because they're not winning the big games.''
 Already facing steep tuition costs, students seem to be growing more reluctant to pay additional fees for everything from athletics to health care to transportation, according to the United States Student Association, which is based in Washington.
 ''We're definitely seeing in recent times students refusing to pay a lot of these fees,'' said Bill Shiebler, national field director for the association. ''There is a spectrum of reasons, ranging from 'I think it costs too much to go to school here' to 'I don't want to support any new fees' to 'I just don't want to have my dollars go to athletics because I don't use it.' ''
 The N.C.A.A. said it did not keep data on such fees. Newspaper surveys in recent years have indicated that more than half of Division I universities rely on student athletic fees, which can range from $30 a year to more than $1,000. Fee increases must be put to a vote at some universities; at others, officials consult students because the money they contribute makes them the equivalent of an important private donor.
 Universities where students recently voted down fee increases seem to have a couple of things in common: They are primarily commuter colleges, where students may be less invested in sports; and they either do not compete in major football conferences or do not have football, which is the largest revenue sport.
 ''Midmajors like us, Division I without football, we're really struggling; student fees make a huge difference,'' said Vic Cegles, the athletic director at Long Beach State, where students voted down a proposed annual $190 increase in March. ''We need facilities. We have a top-25 baseball team, but our kids have no locker room. I don't know how much longer we can compete under those conditions.''
 Not all the votes are binding, in part because relatively few students tend to cast ballots.
 In April 2008, in a general fee referendum, students at Fresno State voted, 777-412, against raising athletic fees to $50 per semester, from $7. Based on a recommendation from a campus fee advisory committee, John D. Welty, the Fresno State president, overrode the vote and approved an increase to $32 per semester for the 2008-9 academic year.
 Mr. Welty said the $1.4 million raised from the fee increase was primarily used to add two women's sports, lacrosse and swimming.
 ''The issue for us was to make sure we continued our commitment to gender equity,'' Mr. Welty said.
 Other universities have shown a greater willingness to vote for increases. Last year, students at North Texas approved a per-credit-hour athletic fee of up to $300 a year to help pay for a new football stadium. Many current students will not have to pay the fee, which goes into effect when the stadium opens, probably in 2011.
 Two months ago, students at Utah State voted to increase their yearly athletic fee to $243, from $113, to help cover a $2.3 million deficit in the operation of varsity sports. Scott Barnes, the athletic director, said officials sought to persuade students that competitive athletics would increase enrollment, donations and visibility.
 ''Athletics are the front porch of the university,'' Mr. Barnes said. ''It's not the most important room in the house, but it is the most visible.''
 Last month, students at New Orleans voted on the very survival of the athletic department, which has an approximately $4 million annual budget and expenses of about $5 million. The university has lost a third of its enrollment (now about 11,000) since Katrina and faces a state budget cut of $15.3 million for the next fiscal year. About $1.4 million of that reduction is proposed to come from money given to the athletic department from the university's general fund.
 To counter the shortfall, officials sought to double New Orleans's student athletic fee to a little less than $400 a year. The vote failed, 1,418-1,251. Eric Gallatin, president of student government, said students were already facing a tuition increase and were reluctant to give more money to athletics when academic programs faced cuts.
 ''Why contribute to athletics when they can seek out other revenue such as sponsors, which they haven't seemed to do?'' Mr. Gallatin said.
 One of the university's basketball recruits has asked to be released from his commitment because of the financial instability, but officials have declined, saying it would set a ''dangerous precedent.'' 
 The university faces the eventual challenge of adding six sports to equal the 15 it had before Katrina, so it can remain in Division I (which requires a minimum of 14). That would cost an additional $2 million annually, said Jim Miller, the New Orleans athletic director.
 Wright Waters, the commissioner of the Sun Belt Conference, which includes New Orleans among its members, said: ''They're like a guy sitting at the blackjack table all night who hasn't seen a face card yet. How many more cards can they be dealt?''

A subheading last Saturday with the Off the Charts column, about jobless rates in the United States and Europe, overstated the effect of the United States' flexibility in hiring and firing workers. While some economists cite statistics showing that such an option does not lead to lower unemployment, the theory has not been proved.

HEADLINE: Revising Report, U.S. Says 1st Quarter Was Not So Bad

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The economy's decline in the first three months of the year was not quite as bad as the government originally believed, kindling hope that the recession was gradually losing force, and that the economy could resume growing by the end of 2009. 
 On Friday, the government offered a less-stark assessment of how quickly American economic output shrank during the first quarter. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product shrank at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the first quarter, compared with its initial estimate of a 6.1 percent decline. Still, the revision was less than the 5.5 percent expected by many economists.
 Consumer spending did not show as much strength as the government initially estimated, but it did increase at an annual pace of 1.5 percent, the government said. The net export figures improved the overall picture of gross domestic product. 
 Inventories shrank less than first reported, which moderated the reported pace of economic contraction. But a smaller reduction in inventories could prove troubling if businesses still have a glut of products. Many companies have struggled to trim inventories to match demand.
 Excluding changes in inventories, the United States economy shrank 3.4 percent in the first quarter.
 ''You're seeing the basic demand for goods and services turning around, and you're having less of an inventory correction,'' the chief economist at Wachovia, John E. Silvia, said.
 Still, if the first three months were slightly less awful than first estimated, they still signaled a painful contraction in the economy. Unemployment rose sharply, putting millions out of work; businesses continued to slash costs and reduce investments; and housing prices tumbled.
 But many economists suggested the worst days of the recession were fading. The economy shrank at an annual rate of 6.3 percent in the last three months of 2008, and economists said they did not expect a return to those precipitous declines.
 ''There's some healing going on,'' the chief economist at T. Rowe Price, Alan D. Levenson, said. ''The sharpest downward adjustments took place late last year and early this year. In the first quarter we saw a sharp inventory correction, and demand is less weak.''

HEADLINE: R.H. Donnelley Seeks Bankruptcy Protection

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
R.H. Donnelley Corporation, the publisher of 600 directories including telephone yellow pages, sought bankruptcy protection from creditors to reduce debt by about $6.4 billion amid mounting losses. The company, based in Cary, N.C., had assets of $11.9 billion and debt of $12.4 billion as of Dec. 31, according to Chapter 11 documents filed in United States Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. Nineteen affiliates also sought court protection. The company attributed the filing partly to ''a significant decline in advertising sales due to the recent economic downturn and increased competition in the local business advertising industry,'' court papers said.

HEADLINE: Trade Diplomat Taps His Deal-Making Past

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris and Stephen Castle from Brussels.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Ron Kirk, the unlikely new United States trade representative, often jokes about not having a deep background in the arcane world he is wading into, a place of impenetrable jargon and negotiations that seem to drag on for decades.
 Mr. Kirk, who served twice as the mayor of Dallas, also concedes he never dealt much before with people like Catherine Ashton, the European trade commissioner, who, to his delight, is a British baroness.
 But in his first weeks in the job, the two of them engineered a quick resolution to a longstanding dispute over exports of American beef from hormone-treated cows to Europe. For his part, Mr. Kirk sees his past professional experience as relevant. 
 ''I bring the urgency, the freshness, the bluntness of a mayor,'' he said in an interview Thursday. ''I'm here to solve problems.''
 While European officials say relations are off to a good start, the contours of Mr. Kirk's trade agenda remain only partly defined. He has vowed to push for a revival of the global Doha round of trade talks, though doubts persist about its prospects. And he indicated that responsibility within the Obama administration for one critically important trade relationship, with China, would remain divided among departments. Mr. Kirk will not accompany Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner on his trip to Beijing over the weekend. 
 In fact, there are questions about the new administration's intentions when it comes to promoting free trade; it is not among 29 priority issues listed on the White House Web site. And in a time of global financial and economic crisis, protectionist sentiments are running high. Americans -- along with people elsewhere -- are dubious about expanding trade deals. 
 ''I understand the pain,'' Mr. Kirk said, adding that his wife's relatives in Detroit include many past or current auto workers. ''To save trade, we've got to do it in a way that we are more responsible, and responsive, to those who are skeptical about it.''
 Mr. Kirk, a big, droll man with an outsize personality, said that he did not have ''deal fever,'' indicating no rush to slam together new trade pacts even if the local politician in him hates for issues with solutions to drag on. 
 He has said that existing accords must be more strictly enforced, particularly on environmental and labor standards, even if the bad economy complicates that work. 
 Some trade specialists see his early remarks as auguring a reassuringly steady course.
 ''So far, the big story is the continuity of U.S. trade policy'' under Mr. Kirk, said Daniel Griswold, director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a research group. ''It's been pleasantly surprising for trade advocates.''
 But Alan Tonelson, a research fellow with the U.S. Business and Industry Council, a lobbying group, criticizes President Obama for focusing on completing bilateral trade deals rather than pushing a more ambitious trade agenda and doing more to combat protectionist practices elsewhere.
 Mr. Kirk seems patient and unperturbed. He suggested that there might be value in starting with smaller agreements like one started with Panama while rebuilding a foundation of public trust in trade.
 He offered no magic solution to narrowing the trade gap with China, saying he hoped Beijing would see its own interest in becoming ''a little less export-dependent and increase domestic consumption, which will give us a little more breathing room.''
 Mr. Kirk has vowed to push for a revival of the Doha round of trade talks, though doubts persist about its prospects. He also suggested it would be ''arrogant'' to think the United States could snap its fingers and revive prospects for a global trade deal, which stalled last year after seven years of off-and-on talks. 
 Still, one World Trade Organization official said that Mr. Kirk had ''created a lot of good will'' among trade diplomats by prominently supporting the talks. He spoke on grounds of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter.
 While Mr. Kirk, 54, left a bipartisan trail of fans behind in Dallas, he remains something of an enigma abroad. He lacks the classic insider background of more recent trade representatives, who had extensive Washington experience. 
 Yet as mayor, Mr. Kirk liked to call Dallas ''the capital of Nafta'' -- the North American Free Trade Agreement. ''He truly saw Dallas as the gateway to international trade,'' said Justin H. Lonon, Mr. Kirk's press secretary and now vice chancellor at Dallas Community College. 
 In some ways, Mr. Kirk follows the model of another Texan, Robert Strauss, who was a lawyer and political activist before being named trade representative by President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Strauss is remembered by some as one of the best, completing the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations and securing its Senate ratification. 
 Bruce Buchanan, a professor of government at the University of Texas, said Mr. Kirk has ''natural skills'' that fit his new job. 
 ''He is very adept at getting groups to work together, and he is very much pro-free trade,'' Mr. Buchanan said. ''He's a man of talent.''
 Mr. Kirk, the first African-American to hold the job, is often compared with President Obama: pragmatic, with abundant charisma, someone who learned growing up to bridge racial and ideological divides. When a race riot broke out at his high school in Austin, Tex., where he was senior class president, he helped mediate. 
 With a law degree from the University of Texas, he went to work for Senator Lloyd Bentsen and later was named the secretary of state of Texas. When Mr. Kirk set his sights on the Dallas mayor's office, it seemed a reach. ''He was,'' Mr. Buchanan said, ''a black man in a very conservative city that did not have a great racial history.'' 
 But by marshaling an unlikely coalition of black voters and white business people, Mr. Kirk easily won election in 1995. 
 He lowered taxes, helped bring down the crime rate and whipped a notoriously dysfunctional City Council into shape. This led to his re-election in 1999 with what Mr. Buchanan called an ''astounding'' 74 percent of the vote. 
 Mr. Obama, while still an Illinois state politician, studied Mr. Kirk's rise. They met and bonded. 
 ''Ron is the kind of guy who never met a stranger,'' said Dave McNeely, a political columnist in Austin. ''He's very affable, gregarious, funny, has a wicked sense of humor, and he brings people together well.''

HEADLINE: Online Celebrity Helps: From Gag Writer to MTV Show Host in 5 Years

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
A little over five years ago Andy Samberg gave up his unemployment checks to take a job writing a few gags for a television special, the MTV Movie Awards. He took a pay cut.
 Still, it turned out to be a good career move. The assignment led to an audition at ''Saturday Night Live,'' a job on that show and growing fame for a series of short digital comedy films, some of which have been downloaded tens of millions of times. And now, in a scene right out of one of the popcorn movies that the awards celebrate, Mr. Samberg is back as the host of the ceremony. (It will be broadcast live on Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern time.) 
 ''It's the American dream,'' said the reality-television maestro Mark Burnett, who is producing the awards show for MTV. ''Junior writer becomes host of the show he used to write for.'' 
 Beyond the usual monologue, Mr. Samberg said, he will season his host duties with as many as five new short films. ''I'm a pretape Charlie,'' he said. He has recruited a mix of talent to accompany him in the films, from Will Ferrell to the singer Taylor Swift to J. J. Abrams, who usually works on the other side of filmmaking (as a creator of ABC's ''Lost'' and director of the new ''Star Trek'' movie.) 
 Mr. Samberg said, with a sprinkling of nervous laughter, ''This is a big show; it's a spectacle.'' He might have been looking at the lineup of guests and presenters, which includes Ben Stiller, Denzel Washington, Cameron Diaz and other Hollywood film names interested in getting in front of the mostly young, mostly movie-oriented and mostly large audience that MTV attracts for the event (as many as 3.6 million viewers for the live show and 20 million for all its showings on the channel). 
 Or the music lineup, headlined this year by Eminem and Kings of Leon. The show also has enough cachet with the Hollywood studios that three of them have contributed clips from coming movie sequels to ''Twilight,'' ''Transformers'' and the ''Harry Potter'' series, all of which will be seen for the first time. Last year's host was Mike Myers, who has had a few hit movies of his own. Mr. Samberg has no blockbusters to his credit. 
 But Mr. Samberg, who is 30, has something else that MTV is most interested in: a sizable following among young viewers of much smaller screens, namely TV sets and computer monitors. 
 ''I guess I reached some point where I got on the radar,'' he said. ''My name seems to come up on things on the Internet.''
 It comes up with some frequency. Several of Mr. Samberg's more than 60 digital shorts for ''SNL,'' produced with his writing partners, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer (the three form the comedy group the Lonely Island, which earlier this year released its first album, ''Incredibad''), have become phenomena online. One, ''I'm on a Boat,'' featuring Mr. Samberg and the rap artist T-Pain, has been viewed more than 25 million times on YouTube -- and that isn't even Mr. Samberg's biggest hit. 
 Two of his other short films, with titles that can't be printed here with impunity, one about trouser accidents (with Molly Sims), the other about unusual gift ideas (with Justin Timberlake), have racked up more than 48 million and 35 million views.
 All of this has made Mr. Samberg a desirable choice for an awards show intended to find new categories for nominations in movies that people actually wanted to see -- rather than the ones usually honored for more ethereal qualities. The most nominated entries this year are ''Twilight,'' ''Slumdog Millionaire'' (an award winner and crowd pleaser) and ''The Dark Knight.''
 The winners, based on fan votes online, come in some rather contrived-sounding categories, like best fight, best kiss and best moment of cognitive dissonance. (That one also has a different formal title.)
 ''That award I still don't totally understand,'' Mr. Samberg said. Van Toffler, the president of MTV, said Mr. Samberg had gotten the nod as host because he is ''the comedian for the digital age.''
 Even with all his Internet exposure, Mr. Samberg said he recognized that this assignment was a significant career opportunity. ''Certainly after doing this, it will introduce me to a lot more people that didn't otherwise know me -- or maybe thought my name was Adam and not Andy,'' Mr. Samberg said.

HEADLINE: Critics Call Delaware A Tax Haven

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
Wall Street, Sand Hill Road, LaSalle Street: Some corporate addresses scream money. Then there is North Orange Street, which whispers it. 
 North Orange, a ho-hum thoroughfare in Wilmington, Del., is, on paper, home to more than 6,500 companies. Many of them are empty shells. They make nothing and sometimes employ just a lone clerk. But all are there for the same reason: to help corporations avoid paying taxes in other states.
 The Obama administration has riled corporate America by cracking down on secretive offshore tax havens. But now a big onshore refuge -- Delaware -- is drawing scrutiny, too. 
 Squeezed by hard times, states are pushing to collect taxes that corporations are avoiding through Delaware shell companies. Maryland has reclaimed $267 million in such taxes, including interest and penalties, and has assessed an additional $143 million. 
 About 20 states have adopted laws that would effectively keep companies from using the decades-old tax loopholes in Delaware. At stake are tens of billions of dollars in annual tax receipts, funds that states say they need during this recession. 
 Critics of the arrangement in Delaware say it cheats state governments out of money. Delaware, these people say, has created its own onshore Cayman Islands. Even the Swiss are complaining, claiming that the United States is letting this homegrown haven flourish even as the I.R.S. pursues offshore shelters. 
 Defenders of the arrangement -- corporate executives, tax lawyers and, unsurprisingly, Delaware officials -- rebuff such criticism. Mailbox subsidiaries like the ones along North Orange Street do nothing to minimize companies' federal tax bills, they say. Corporations must still pay Uncle Sam. Moreover, these people say, many companies are drawn to Delaware for its business-friendly laws and courts, not to save on taxes.
 That is certainly the view at 1209 North Orange Street, a nondescript low-slung building at the corner of West 13th Street. This address serves as a tax minimizer for dozens of brand-name companies, among them Dillard's, the department store chain based in Little Rock, Ark., and Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is part of Yum Brands of Louisville, Ky. All of them, and nearly two-thirds of the Fortune 500, have tax-exempt subsidiaries at this address to reduce their state tax bills. 
 Jerry Daniel, the vice president for government relations at the Corporation Trust Company, which runs 1209 North Orange, does not see what all the fuss is about. After all, the arrangements are legal.
 ''The image of Delaware as a tax haven is totally unfair,'' Mr. Daniel said. ''Even if you incorporate here, you still have to pay a full federal tax bill.''
 That argument does not sit well with David E. Brunori. A professor at George Washington University School of Law and a specialist in state taxes, Professor Brunori said the Delaware loophole was not harmless. 
 ''It is a vehicle for avoiding otherwise legitimate tax liabilities at a time when states need money badly,'' Professor Brunori said. 
 Shirley Sicilian, the general counsel of the Multistate Tax Commission, an intergovernmental state tax agency, said that ''states increasingly want to make sure that income that's earned in their state is actually taxed in their state, particularly in a bad fiscal situation like now.'' 
 At the center of the dispute are legal entities known as Delaware holding companies, which have been around for decades but took off in the 1990s, when accountants began pushing them aggressively. Corporations are allowed to establish these shell companies in Delaware, as well as in Nevada and Wyoming. 
 Typically, they then transfer to these subsidiaries ownership of things like trademarks, patents and investments. Delaware does not tax holding companies set up to own and collect income from such lucrative intangible assets.
 The parent companies of these shells usually pay royalties to the Delaware subsidiaries to lease back those assets. By doing so, they can claim income tax deductions in states where they actually do business. The shells also funnel profit, tax free, back to their parents, in the form of dividends and loans. 
 Some corporations have abused the system. Before WorldCom collapsed in 2002, it shifted $19.4 billion in intellectual property tied to ''management foresight'' to a Delaware holding company. 
 Emboldened by recent court decisions that have challenged such arrangements, a growing number of states are moving aggressively to claim taxes that they say are rightfully theirs. 
 It will not be easy, tax experts say. Many corporations have found new ways to exploit the loophole, said Michael Mazerov, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The moves include creating ''embedded royalty'' companies, in which corporations set up Delaware holding companies that license their assets to other Delaware entities. The secondary Delaware entities buy goods or services from other parts of the company, add in the price of the royalty, and sell them back to the operating company, giving it a tax break on the royalty.
 In recent months, the Delaware loophole has drawn heated criticism from the world's leading offshore tax havens, including Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. 
 In April, a senior official of the Cayman Islands Financial Services Association asserted that Delaware, along with Nevada and Wyoming, promoted tax evasion and money laundering, thus qualifying the United States as a tax haven. Federal officials view the issue as a state matter and are not pushing for changes in Delaware, the home state of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
 In any case, Delaware officials dismiss the idea that their state is some sort of shady tax haven. Richard J. Geisenberger, Delaware's assistant secretary of state, said that the loophole ''is simply a state tax law.'' It does not enable tax evasion, he said.
 Still, the loophole -- and potential for companies to abuse it -- worries Peter L. Faber, a prominent lawyer specializing in state tax at McDermott Will & Emery in Washington. In some cases, a single clerk may tend dozens of shell companies. Even the paperwork associated with these companies is back at the home office. 
 ''I've seen a lot of companies with solid structures, and more with not,'' Mr. Faber said of the Delaware entities.

HEADLINE: Students Relying on Loans Wonder Whether Forgiveness Will Last

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER, RON LIEBER, TARA SIEGEL BERNARD and PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
This article was reported by Jonathan D. Glater, Ron Lieber, Tara Siegel Bernard and Paul Sullivan and written by Mr. Glater and Mr. Lieber.
 If you want to become a public defender, Georgetown University can be a great place to get your legal education. So Heather Gatnarek expects to take on well over $100,000 of debt to get her law degree there and hopes to graduate in three years.
 Here's the problem, though. She's relying on a new federal program that forgives part of the student loan debt for graduates who enter public service fields. And she was scared out of her mind when she read a New York Times article on Wednesday on problems in Kentucky, where significant cuts in one of its loan forgiveness programs have put thousands of indebted public school teachers and nurses in a painful financial squeeze.
 ''I would be completely up a creek'' without a loan forgiveness program, Ms. Gatnarek said. ''I don't know what I would do. Marry someone rich, I guess. People say that I could just do corporate law for a few years, but I wouldn't last two days.'' 
 The problem in Kentucky and another that emerged in Connecticut on Thursday raise a frightening question for millions of young Americans considering jobs like teaching or nursing: Are the state or federal programs that promise to forgive student loan debt for people in those or other public service professions backed by ironclad guarantees? 
 And if the forgiveness isn't guaranteed, how on earth can anyone expect 18- or 22-year-olds to take on tens of thousands of dollars in debt? 
 Without such a promise, how can they know that they won't one day find themselves in a police uniform or in a rural doctor's office suddenly facing personal bankruptcy?
 The good news here is that the federal Department of Education says that almost all its loan forgiveness programs are safe. ''It doesn't depend on some future Congress for us to come through on most of these,'' said Robert Shireman, deputy undersecretary of education. ''The majority of them get appropriations for the life of the programs.'' 
 But many states say that financing their loan forgiveness programs depends on state budgets. Given declining tax revenues, that doesn't inspire much confidence. On Thursday, for instance, Gov. M. Jodi Rell of Connecticut proposed cutting the state's minority teacher grant program, which awards a stipend that is intended to help students pay off their loans, said Constance Fraser, a Connecticut Department of Higher Education spokeswoman. 
 The states' changes -- or the mere threat of them -- are the latest of several ugly financial developments that have shaken individuals of all ages who thought they were playing by the rules. There are the investors close to retirement who thought they were being conservative only to watch their savings decline 25 percent before bouncing back a bit recently. And then there are homeowners in Miami and Las Vegas with plain mortgages who have found the value of their properties plummeting because of the bad behavior of many banks and their customers. 
 As for the loan forgiveness programs, they have been around since at least the late 1960s, according to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the financial aid site finaid.org. States sponsored them first, to keep residents from moving or to encourage graduates to enter careers where there was a shortage of professionals in particular locations or in certain lower-paying fields. Now, the federal government is involved, too.
 The problems in Kentucky, Connecticut and potentially elsewhere, however, have an absurdist twist. Nonprofit state organizations and agencies say they do not have money for loan forgiveness programs in part because of cuts in federal subsidies for student lenders. At the same time, tight credit has also made it difficult for lenders to raise additional funds that they could then lend.
 In other words, the college graduates from years ago who chose banking over teaching or nursing have now made such a big mess of the economy that the teachers who educate the bankers' children have to worry about the status of the loans they took out to learn to teach. Pretty rich, no?
 And so we're left with the sad tale of people like Adam and Katie Thomas. Both Louisville, Ky., teachers of special needs children, the Thomases had a combined $85,000 in student loans. Partway through the payback period on those loans, however, the forgiveness program in their state cut its annual subsidy from 20 percent of the couple's total loan balance to just 1 percent. That pushed them so close to the edge financially that they decided to sell their home and move in with Ms. Thomas's parents.
 We know, we know. How irresponsible of mere teachers to take on that much debt in the first place, right? Many of the online commenters on the article in Wednesday's paper certainly felt this way. 
 But if education is a fundamental right, then it's hard to argue against public policies that try to make sure there are enough teachers to provide that education. And if loan forgiveness is what it takes to get teachers to head to rural schoolhouses or poor urban schools, then that would certainly seem to serve the national interest. 
 So loan forgiveness programs are not some sinister form of social engineering. Nor do they encourage overindebtedness, per se. Education costs what it costs, and if you need to borrow to attend and intend to eat while doing so, then borrow you must. In fact, borrowing to prepare for a career in nursing or law enforcement makes perfect sense if governmental entities are promoting loan forgiveness programs. 
 The problem is that many of those running the programs also admit that there are no guarantees that financing for the loan forgiveness programs will survive the next state legislative session (or that the economy will improve enough for them to find other ways of financing the forgiveness). We found this so disturbing that we decided to call up every single entity, state or federal, that we could find that offered loan forgiveness programs. Then, we asked them point-blank if they would like to offer an absolute promise to borrowers or potential borrowers that the loan forgiveness programs would not go away while the borrowers were still using them.
 Some states ignored us or didn't call back in time. Some were stumped entirely and said the question actually raised Constitutional issues, which left us a bit befuddled (and there was a trained lawyer in our posse). A few insisted that theirs was not a Kentucky situation, so scared were they of being tarred with that state's taint.
 Also, we haven't begun tracking down corporations that offer loan forgiveness to employees. But we'd like to.
 So this is where you come in. We've created an interactive table at nytimes.com/yourmoney with everything we've found so far. If your lender (or law firm or other employer) is not there and you'd like us to ask them to state whether they intend to stand behind their loan forgiveness program, write to yourmoney@nytimes.com 
 We intend to finish this database in the next few weeks and then leave it up, with updates, as a sort of reality check. 
 Meanwhile, a few tips for those of you who are thinking about borrowing a big pile of money or are in the middle of doing so. If you live in a state where loan forgiveness may be in jeopardy, call your state representatives and read them the riot act. It's hard to imagine that the cuts in the Kentucky program, for instance, will stand. Ken Winters, a Republican state senator there, said he expected the issue of financing for the program to come up in January. We'll be watching. 
 Also, ask tough questions when any program is making what seems to be a promise on loan forgiveness. Which loans are eligible? All student loans or only certain types? Is there a limit on the debt that can be forgiven? Is the program guaranteed? By whom? With what funds? For precisely which kinds of public service? Must you apply, and is it selective? And finally, is there a federal program that may make up for some of your state's forgiveness, even if the federal benefits aren't as generous?
 We hate to get all ''X-Files'' on you, but Trust No One. Sure, The Truth May Be Out There, but it sure seems as if the truth can change in ways that can cost innocent public servants tens of thousands of dollars.

HEADLINE: Where Louis XIV Meets Crash and Blade

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
The French call it le graf or le tag: the style of urban artwork that was born nearly four decades ago on New York City subways and brick walls, influencing a generation of artists, self-taught and otherwise, across the world. 
 Now twin sisters, gallery owners in France, have organized an exhibition to celebrate the international stamp and cultural heft of what they prefer to call le street art, a genre that may have more establishment appeal abroad than it does in the United States. The show, ''Whole in the Wall,'' is billed as the largest exhibition of American and European street art from 1970 to today, and includes paintings, sculpture and photography.
 ''It's youth, it's movement, it's lively,'' said Chantal Helenbeck, who with her twin, Brigitte, runs the Helenbeck Gallery in Paris, which held a similar show in November.
 Trailing parfum on a high-heeled tour of the installation before it opened on Thursday in a multistory studio space on Manhattan's far West Side, the sisters explained what drew them to street artists. ''They've changed my vision of my work,'' Chantal Helenbeck said, speaking in French, ''because they haven't gone to school. They are taught by life, and you can see that in their work.'' 
 Brigitte added, ''They bring a joie de vivre to the gallery.'' With works by pioneering Bronx graffiti writers like Crash and Blade and their descendants, including Blek le Rat, a Parisian known for his stencil work, and the anonymous British artist Banksy, the show offers a diaspora that many Americans may not know existed. It's evolved far beyond early tagging (abstractly writing a name or word in spray paint or marker, usually illegally) to more painterly and figurative forms.
 ''When I was shooting graffiti in the late '70s, I thought I was shooting a very local, underground phenomenon,'' said Martha Cooper, whose photographs documenting the scene are included in the exhibition. ''My idea was, this could only happen in New York. And I was so wrong.''
 Instead, street-art culture spread globally. Several of New York's early taggers, like Quik (born Lin Felton in Queens) and Sharp (Aaron Goodstone, Upper East Side), now live in Europe, where they say they enjoy greater acclaim than in the United States and sell more of their work. The Paris show sold out of all 100 pieces, with prices in the hundreds of thousands. (The prices for the exhibition here range from $6,000 to $300,000.)
 To draw an even more direct parallel between hallowed and street culture, one room is outfitted with ornate Louis XIV-era furniture -- gilded consoles and chairs covered in rabbit fur -- surrounded by graffiti pieces and found-object sculptures.
 ''Given the historical significance of the antiques, it sort of confers that what we're doing is credible,'' said Sharp, who splits his time between homes in the Bronx and suburban Paris. Wearing a Zulu Nation pendant and a large pair of square, black Run DMC-style glasses, he patiently explained, in French, the concept of ''outer borough'' to the Helenbeck sisters.
 Jean Gismondi, the owner of the Parisian antiques shop that supplied the furniture (also for sale), didn't know anything about street art when the sisters approached him to collaborate, he said. But he quickly took to it, admiring the craftsmanship.
 ''I see the link between the pieces,'' he said, pointing to a skull covered in plastic doodads by the Queens-born artist Rammellzee that rested atop a 17th-century bureau inlaid with tortoiseshell and mother-of-pearl. ''The mask is Baroque, as Baroque as this.''
 A heavy Rammellzee bracelet embedded with plastic buttons, toys, rhinestones, metal rings and other flotsam? ''With an evening gown, it would be magnifique,'' Mr. Gismondi said in French.
 ''These objects,'' Chantal Helenbeck said, ''are the antiquities of tomorrow.''
 The Helenbecks plan to bring the show to Milan as well as to Stuttgart, Germany, and other cities. Exhibiting this art now, when the economic climate sometimes mirrors that of 1970s New York, makes it particularly relevant. 
 ''In this difficult time, it gives hope,'' Chantal said, offering as an example ''Heart in a Hurricane,'' a painting by Lee Quinones that depicts an apparently homeless man clutching a vibrant rose.
 The juxtaposition of European sensibility and urban New York history was evident at the opening party on Thursday night, which attracted a mix of hipster art students, grungy street-art aficionados and sleek Euros, and served as a reunion of sorts for the old guard of New York taggers. 
 ''You don't usually find all these guys in one place,'' Ms. Cooper said, noting that a half-dozen of the subjects of her seminal 1988 book with Henry Chalfant, ''Subway Art,'' were standing nearby, many now middle-aged and dressed in suits.
 Susan Tencer Rubino, who as a 16-year-old served as a lookout while her boyfriend, Crachee, and Blade illegally spray-painted in the Bronx, came clutching a photo Blade sent her of a No. 5 train tagged with her name. She last saw him around 1976; they reconnected recently through Facebook. (Asked if he knew his mother was such a cool chick, her teenage son, sitting on a stuffed chair nearby, merely shrugged.)
 The party also drew fans like John Misiti, 34, a graf writer who works for the Sanitation Department. (Many of the guys he grew up tagging trains with now work for the M.T.A., he said.) He brought a book of his own work for the artists to sign. ''I wouldn't mind having this in my living room,'' he said, taking in the antiques.
 Though several of the artists in the show have work in major museums, the sense among the members of the original New York generation that they are somehow trespassing among the establishment still sticks.
 ''What's really important in something like this coming to New York is, you can see we're not teenagers defiling property,'' said Blade, whose real name is Steven Ogburn. ''We're making work.''
 A fan passed by and gave him a deferential nod. ''Write that down!'' Blade said. ''They bow to me! There's something you don't see every day.''
 ''Whole in the Wall'' continues through June 27 at the former Splashlight Studios, 529-535 West 35th Street, Manhattan; helenbeckgallery.com.

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 30 about an exhibition of street art at the former Splashlight Studios on West 35th Street in Manhattan, which includes photographs by Martha Cooper, misstated the publication date of the book ''Subway Art'' by Ms. Cooper and Henry Chalfant. It was 1984, not 1988.

HEADLINE: Investor Exits And Leaves Puzzlement

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

DATELINE: Waukesha, Wis. 

 BODY:
 I've seen my share of odd moments during annual meetings, but until Thursday I'd never seen a grown man cry during one.
 O.K., maybe ''cry'' is a bit of an overstatement for what happened. Still, it was pretty startling when, in the middle of his speech to Target Corporation shareholders, William A. Ackman, the hedge fund manager who had waged an expensive, high-profile proxy fight against the company, suddenly choked up and stopped speaking. He wiped away a tear.
 It was early in the meeting, which was held at a soon-to-be-opened Target store in suburban Milwaukee. Target, ever the polite Midwestern company (it's based in Minneapolis), had granted Mr. Ackman time to make a case for his board nominees to the company's shareholders. I suspect that Mr. Ackman already knew he was going to lose; his words had an elegiac quality, like a politician delivering a gracious concession speech. 
 ''This is a great day for Target and for shareholders generally,'' he said -- because this was one of the few times that shareholders have been given a genuine choice for the board. He said that he had begun the proxy fight not because he had a $1 billion-plus investment in Target shares that was seriously underwater -- not at all! -- but because ''we never want Target to be referred to as a 'once-great company.' '' He described the board members Target had nominated -- people he had been denigrating for weeks -- as ''stellar.'' He made it sound as if he had achieved a moral victory just by the fact that he had waged this proxy fight. Somehow, he seemed to believe, it was going to make corporate America a better place.
 Then -- I kid you not -- he started quoting John F. Kennedy. ''We will pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,'' he said. And that's when the tears started welling up. 
 From the start, Mr. Ackman's decision to put Target in his cross hairs two years ago has been a real head-scratcher. The founder of the $4.5 billion hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, Mr. Ackman has gained a well-deserved reputation as an aggressive, even relentless shareholder activist. For years he attacked the monoline insurance companies, especially MBIA, and was finally vindicated when their stock prices essentially collapsed in advance of the financial crisis. He forced Wendy's to divest itself of Tim Hortons, the Canadian doughnut chain. He has a half-dozen similar notches on his belt. Nobody digs into a company's numbers as maniacally as Bill Ackman, and few are as dogged about pushing ideas on companies that he thinks will get the stock price up.
 Over the years, he has also become increasingly comfortable using the news media as a way to help put pressure on companies. When he first appeared on my radar screen, Mr. Ackman was so press-shy he refused to allow Fortune magazine, then my employer, to take his photograph. Now he happily co-hosts CNBC's ''Squawk Box,'' trading bons mots with Becky, Joe and the gang. He has gone from being awkward in public to silky smooth.
 Indeed, Mr. Ackman had become so successful that he was able to raise $2 billion for a fund that would essentially invest in only one company -- and he would then go to work generating ideas to boost the stock price. The company this new fund invested in was Target.
 But why? When somebody like Carl Icahn sets his sights on, say, Motorola, you may not agree with his methods, but you can't deny he has taken aim at a seriously troubled company. But Target? In July 2007, when Mr. Ackman began buying the stock, the shares were trading in the 60s, near the all-time high. More to the point, Target isn't exactly a troubled company. Rather, it is just about the only big-box retailer that has figured out how to compete successfully against Wal-Mart. Its 10-year stock performance is better than Wal-Mart's. Analysts swoon over it. Customers, 80 percent of them women, love it. 
 ''Bill Ackman is an idea machine,'' Target's chief financial officer, Douglas A. Scovanner, told me a few days before the meeting. Sure enough, he began presenting Target management with highly detailed ideas, most of which amounted to sophisticated financial engineering. The company should offload its credit card risk by teaming up with a financial institution, he said. (Target is one of the few retailers to manage its own credit card portfolio, instead of handing it over to a financial institution.) It should buy back $15 billion in stock. And so on.
 Target, in fact, did sell off 47 percent of its credit card operation to JPMorgan Chase, which Mr. Ackman applauded at the time. (Later, he described it as a halfway measure.) But he was far from done. He then began agitating for a series of highly complex real estate transactions, the gist of which was that Target should spin off the land under its stores into a real estate investment trust. This time, after much to and fro -- including many meetings with Mr. Ackman, and much consultation with its investment bankers at Goldman Sachs -- Target declined to follow Mr. Ackman's advice.
 Meanwhile, of course, Target's stock had sunk, in large part because of the financial crisis. ''Target's performance has been unsurprising in that they don't sell a lot of food and drug and other consumable items,'' said Bill Dreher, the senior retail analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. ''From the middle of September to the beginning of March the only thing people wanted to buy were things they could eat or drink. It had nothing to do with any missteps from the board or from management.'' On the contrary, Mr. Dreher gives Target credit for cutting its costs drastically, and keeping the damage to a minimum. The stock, which bottomed out at around $25 a share, has since returned to the low 40s. (It closed Friday at $39.30.)
 You can't help but suspect that Mr. Ackman's subsequent proxy fight, one of the most expensive ever mounted, was an act of pique. His dedicated Target fund had lost, according to numerous reports, some 90 percent of its value, largely because of his own bit of financial engineering: he owned options that accelerated his losses as the stock sank. His real estate idea had been rebuffed by management. (They turned him down in part because they feared a ratings downgrade.) He had asked to go on the board and been turned down for that as well. And though the stock was down, he could hardly argue that Target was poorly run, because it isn't. He was like a spoiled child unaccustomed to being told ''no.''
 Yet to hear Mr. Ackman tell it, the purpose of his proxy fight was completely high-minded: to improve Target's corporate governance. Out went his complaint about Target's unwillingness to ''unlock'' real estate or make a credit card transaction; in came a new series of complaints about the deficiencies of Target's board. He complained, absurdly, that Target lacked credit card experience on the board -- even though one of the best bankers in the country, Richard Kovacevich, the chairman of Wells Fargo, sits on it. He complained about the company's staggered board, and the way it had extended term limits to keep longtime board members. And on and on. ''This is about having the best possible board,'' he said on ''Squawk Box'' a few days before the meeting. He also predicted his slate would get at least one board seat.
 Which, thankfully, it didn't; although the tally is not yet official, Target sent out a press release right after the meeting announcing that its directors had been reelected by a ''comfortable margin.'' And that is as it should be. Although Mr. Ackman is right that shareholders should have more say in electing directors -- something the Securities and Exchange Commission seems finally to be working on -- directors should get the boot only when they are doing a poor job. If management is doing a good job, as Mr. Ackman concedes is the case with Target, and the strategy is sound, as it appears to be, why does it make any sense to remove board members? It doesn't.
 Look, I have nothing against shareholder activists. Sometimes they can do a world of good -- and up until now, Mr. Ackman has generally been one of the good guys. And I'm in favor of good corporate governance as much as the next guy. But corporate governance is not an end unto itself; it is supposed to help make the corporation run better. By waving the corporate governance flag, Mr. Ackman tried to disguise the harsher truth: his effort was deeply misguided, and a huge, expensive distraction for a company trying to struggle through a recession. Despite his high-minded rhetoric, he was doing exactly the kind of thing that gives hedge fund activists a bad name. He made a terrible mistake buying Target when its price was so high, and that's what he couldn't admit.
 Meanwhile, back at the meeting, Mr. Ackman, having finished quoting J.F.K., started echoing Martin Luther King. ''I have a dream,'' he said as his speech came to a close, ''that directors will be elected on character and competence. I have a dream that one day the director nominating process will be transparent. I have a dream that our efforts here will be fruitful.'' Then he choked up again.
 After the meeting, Mr. Ackman met with the news media. I asked him if he planned to hold onto Target's stock, something he had vowed to do in the days leading up to the meeting. ''We plan to continue owning the stock,'' he replied. ''We think this is a great company.
 ''But,'' he added, ''we reserve the right to change our minds if other opportunities arise.''
 Why am I not surprised? As I left the meeting, the only author I wanted to quote was Shakespeare: ''Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.''

HEADLINE: Governor and Comptroller Clash on Pension-Fund Help

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
New York's governor and state comptroller clashed on Friday over how to make up steep losses in the state's pension fund.
 The comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, said that the fund, which declined 26.3 percent for the year that ended March 31, suffered ''the worst year in anybody's memory.'' 
 He said that local governments other than New York City would have to significantly increase their payments into the pension system for the first time in several years, setting off a war of words with Gov. David A. Paterson. 
 The governor said in a statement that such increases would have ''a devastating impact on already overburdened local property taxpayers,'' adding that the comptroller needed to do more to ease costs borne by local governments. 
 Mr. DiNapoli shot back at the governor in his own statement, saying, ''The governor is wrong to dismiss this proposal,'' and adding that it would ''clearly mitigate the impact of rising rates on the state, local governments and taxpayers'' by deferring some of the payment increases. 
 Tensions have been festering between the two men since Mr. DiNapoli criticized increased spending in the state budget that was passed last month. Mr. DiNapoli has also not embraced a proposal by the governor to move future state workers from traditional pensions to a 401(k)-style plan. 
 Over all, the pension fund's value is now at $109.9 billion, down from $153.9 billion a year earlier. The 26.3 percent loss -- Mr. DiNapoli called it a ''startling figure'' -- reflects the sharp downturn in the stock market but not contributions to and payouts from the pension system last year. 
 The loss will require local governments to increase their contributions, from 7.4 percent of their payrolls projected for next year to an estimated 11 percent by early 2011, the comptroller's office said. The news does not directly affect New York City, which has its own retirement system. 
 Governments across the state are already facing severe budget strains. Mr. DiNapoli proposed allowing local governments the option of paying less of an increase now and more -- including interest -- in future years, presumably after the economy and financial markets recover. 
 Mr. DiNapoli defended the fund's performance, saying it held up well compared with similar pension funds. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined nearly 40 percent during the fund's fiscal year. 
 ''We've weathered the storm better than many of our peers,'' he said.
 The report came as past pension fund investment decisions were being engulfed in scandal. Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating allegations that aides to Mr. DiNapoli's predecessor, Alan G. Hevesi, sold access to the fund to investment firms for millions of dollars. 
 The investigation has been a persistent cloud over the office during Mr. DiNapoli's tenure. On Friday, he declined to give details of the performance of the private equity firms that have been at the heart of the investigations.
 ''You're referring to firms that have been cited in the investigation and the indictment,'' Mr. DiNapoli said. ''Because of that, we have some limitations on what we can disclose,'' he said, although he conceded later that neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor Mr. Cuomo's office had directed his office to withhold performance data.

HEADLINE: Some See an Economy in Crisis, but the Intrepid Find Bargains

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
STANFORD L. KURLAND, the longtime president of Countrywide Financial, once one of the biggest mortgage issuers in America, is now running PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust -- the firm that announced last week that it was raising money to buy more distressed mortgages. Not surprisingly, Mr. Kurland's critics accuse him of trying to profit from the downside of what Countrywide and other lenders wrought. 
 One thing is certain, though: Mr. Kurland is not alone in looking to invest in assets that were the hardest hit in the downturn, namely debt, private equity and securitized bonds.
 The reasoning is straightforward, even if the timing is risky.Last fall, the financial crisis was so all-encompassing that many otherwise good investments were sold at steep discounts as people moved their money into the safest investments. 
 Now that a clearer picture of the economy is forming -- albeit not a rosy one -- affluent investors are among the first to look at areas where losses were made worse by excessive borrowing. Still, those who are investing are doing so cautiously.
 ''You can't be fearless,'' said Robert Weissenstein, chief investment officer for the Americas at Credit Suisse Private Bank. ''What is making people go in is they are looking past the noise of the moment. They're recognizing the difference between the reality we live in and how much of that reality is priced in.''
 Here are some of the strategies of that new reality. They have attracted the interest of the very wealthy but could provide insight for other investors: 
 CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES The phrase that echoed through the fall was ''credit crisis.'' The stock market was plummeting, dragging down everyone's retirement accounts. But the bigger problem was that companies could not borrow or refinance their debt. At one point, General Electric's bonds were selling at a level that implied imminent default.
 As is well known now, the indiscriminate selling was driven by fear of total loss and the need to cut large positions backed by heavy borrowing. 
 ''The strange thing is leverage created these opportunities,'' said John Duffy, the United States vice chairman of JPMorgan Private Bank. ''These are the ashes of the high leverage market. This is the most fertile soil for future growth.''
 The fear in the credit markets lingered even after it was clear it was an overreaction. This is the opportunity that high-net-worth investors have been exploiting. 
 ''We were able to look at the credit markets and see the dislocation of prices due to credit and distressed sellers -- not distressed debt,'' Mr. Duffy said.
 While prices for municipal and corporate bonds have started to return to normal levels, prices have not moved as quickly in the bank loan market. Investors who bought loans at 60 cents on the dollar have seen their value rise to 70 cents, according to the Credit Suisse leveraged loan index. But Mr. Duffy said he believed they could still reach 80 to 85 cents. 
 The strategy here was not in believing that the economy had gotten better but in knowing that it was not as bad as the selling indicated. ''You just needed a marginal sign that things weren't that bad,'' Mr. Weissenstein said. 
 REAL ESTATE PLAY Plenty of investors are angry that taxpayer money is being used to bail out delinquent mortgage holders. But the government's intervention in another market, the one for securitized assets, has basically been a handout for savvy investors.
 Part of the explanation comes from the government's term asset-backed securities loan facility, which was created to get the asset-backed securities market working again. It also improved the market for other securitized bonds, particularly commercial mortgage-backed securities. Mr. Duffy said the returns on these bonds could be in the midteens this year.
 There are again many caveats with this strategy. First, it is crucial to pick securities backed by the solidest pool of loans. This is why Mr. Duffy favors commercial mortgage-backed securities -- where a class of bonds consists of, say, 10 mortgages -- over their residential equivalent, which could have more than 100 mortgages in a pool.
 ''The winners here are the ones who are able to do fundamental credit research,'' said Lori Heinel, managing director at Citibank Private Bank. 
 Second, buying bonds backed by real estate is not the same as buying real estate. Ms. Heinel said the buying opportunities for commercial buildings will be better next year. Sorting out the residential market could take longer, depending on the region. 
 Also, the desire now is for assets that can be sold if needed. ''No one wants to get stuck again,'' Mr. Weissenstein said. 
 PRIVATE EQUITY DEALS The need to get unstuck has made the secondary market for private equity a bargain hunter's paradise.
 Before the crash, foundations and endowments fought to buy into private equity deals. Private equity was the way to diversify and increase returns, and many buyers felt they could not get enough. In the fall, though, these investors, particularly universities, found themselves in a bind: as the value of everything else went down quickly, the percentage of their portfolio invested in private equity grew. 
 Then, another problem arose. Unlike publicly traded securities, private equity requires investors to commit money for five to seven years and add more money if the fund requires it. As the economy soured, these capital calls persuaded some of the original holders to sell their investments, often at a steep loss.
 That sell-off created opportunities for high-net-worth investors that have only improved as the crisis has gone on. Last summer, Mr. Duffy said, institutions were turning down 80 cents on the dollar, but they have recently been accepting 35 cents. 
 ''These are forced sellers, and that's what creates the opportunity,'' he said.
 Even if the original investors lose money going forward, investors who buy in now will probably do well. If what someone bought for 35 cents on the dollar rises to 70 cents in three years, that buyer has doubled his money, while the original investor will still be down 30 percent.
 EQUITIES ABROAD Despite the recent stock market rally, the major equity indexes in the United States are still below where they were when Barack Obama was inaugurated as president in January -- and seemingly a lifetime away from their bull market highs. Yet for those who looked to emerging markets, this has been a good year for stocks.
 American depositary receipts -- which allow investors in the United States to own shares in foreign companies without buying them on the local market -- in Brazil, Russia, India and China have performed well this year. Brazil is the leader: its 35 American depositary receipts are up some 45 percent so far this year, as tracked by Bank of New York Mellon. Russia, India and China are up 28 percent, 27 percent and 13 percent, respectively. 
 ''Brazil is a well-balanced market,'' said Anthony Moro, head of emerging markets depositary receipts at Bank of New York Mellon. ''China is a big partner. India is a big partner. They're not overly dependent on the U.S.''
 While that may not be great news for the American economy, it has served some shrewd investors well.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 16, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Wealth Matters column on May 30, about investors who find potential bargains in bonds, real estate and other assets, misstated the level of the major American equity indexes relative to when Barack Obama was inaugurated as president in January. The Dow Jones industrial average, Nasdaq and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were all higher at close of trading on May 29 than they were on Jan. 16, the last day of trading before Mr. Obama's inauguration -- not lower.

HEADLINE: Driving the Bond Markets to Ruin

BYLINE: By JAMES K. GLASSMAN. 
James K. Glassman, who was under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs in the George W. Bush administration, is the president of World Growth, a nonprofit economic-development group.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 GENERAL MOTORS bondholders have until 5 p.m. on Saturday to accept a parsimonious offer to exchange their loans for stock and warrants. Most likely, enough of the creditors will say no to force G.M. into bankruptcy. But there is no escaping the long-term damage that has been inflicted on credit markets by the Obama administration's attempts to reward the United Auto Workers, one of the president's strongest supporters in the last election, while trampling decades of legal precedent regarding owners of corporate debt.
 The G.M. debacle is deja vu all over again. In the Chrysler bankruptcy arranged by the government in April, bondholders also got short shrift, while the union, which might have received little or nothing in a normal bankruptcy, was awarded 55 percent of the company. 
 What's my interest in this? I head a nonprofit group that encourages developing nations to adopt policies that will lead to prosperity -- starting with transparency and the rule of law -- and hold up America as a model. Yet in its high-handed dealings with Chrysler and G.M., the Obama administration reminds me of an irresponsible third-world regime, skirting the law and handing economic prizes to political cronies.
 Under the complicated G.M. plan, bondholders -- ranging from large institutions to low-income retirees -- would receive just 10 percent of the reorganized company, plus warrants that would enable them to get 15 percent more should the company's value reach certain levels, in return for their $27 billion in loans. The government, which could end up putting $70 billion into G.M., would initially get 72.5 percent of the company. 
 In return for money G.M. owes its health trust, the auto workers' union would get 17.5 percent of its stock, warrants to raise that share to 20 percent, along with a $2.5 billion cash payout over eight years and $6.5 billion in preferred stock paying a 9 percent dividend. I agree with bondholders who feel the union is getting at least four times as much of G.M. in return for claims that are, at best, equal to those of the creditors. 
 Even if the courts were to reject the plans for G.M. and Chrysler, the administration's actions in trying to force the deals may damage the credit markets for years to come. The treatment of the bondholders is a warning to investors that the federal government won't hesitate to push them aside in a crisis. 
 Perhaps it's no coincidence that in the wake of the Chrysler deal we have seen a decline in prices for long-term Treasury bonds and a sinking dollar. The Chinese, for example, could view things this way: If the United States is willing to skirt the law to help some of the president's closest political supporters gain large pieces of two of the world's biggest companies, will Washington necessarily stand behind any Treasury securities we own when it becomes politically inexpedient?
 The hardball tactics, furthermore, are unlikely to save G.M. In a normal bankruptcy, the company's assets pass from weak hands to strong. In 2008, a terrible year for the auto industry, G.M. sold 8.4 million vehicles worldwide, collecting revenues of $148 billion that placed it third among non-energy companies on the Fortune 500. 
 G.M. is a global business, with two-thirds of its revenues coming from outside the United States. While sales last year dropped 21 percent in North America, they rose 30 percent in Russia, 10 percent in Brazil and 9 percent in India. In 2008, G.M. sold more than one million vehicles in China, up 6 percent over 2007.
 (The value of its global operations was made clear on Friday when the company reached a tentative deal to sell G.M. of Europe.)
 Of course, the company's problem is that its expenses exceed its revenues. But in strong hands, G.M. could be a going concern. Unfortunately, the new owners, with about nine-tenths of the shares, will be the government and the U.A.W. These are the same hands that shaped much of G.M.'s trouble in the first place. With substantial union co-ownership, labor costs won't be contained; and with the government as the boss, politics may trump markets in decisions on such matters as where to put plants and whether to build big cars or small ones.
 The deal would also put G.M.'s competitors at a serious disadvantage in the short run. Ford, which has been building better cars lately, prudently raised cash against a decline in demand, playing the ant to G.M.'s grasshopper. Now, Ford will face a G.M. buoyed by taxpayer dollars both for manufacturing and for cheap consumer and dealer financing. 
 The same holds true for the manufacturers that hold the key to future auto-making jobs: well-managed, foreign-based companies like Toyota and Honda, which, according to the automotive analysts at CSM Worldwide, will build more cars in the United States next year than G.M., Chrysler and Ford combined. 
 What lesson does federal favoritism toward Chrysler and G.M. teach other businesses that play by the rules? How will our trade negotiators keep a straight face when complaining about subsidies to Airbus or Chinese steel makers? The government should have stepped aside earlier and allowed a normal bankruptcy that would have treated the union and the debt-holders fairly. Fortunately, if the bondholders stand firm, we're likely to see that process begin on Monday.

HEADLINE: A Judge's Focus On Race Issues May Be Hurdle

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The selection of Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court has opened a new battle in the fight over affirmative action and other race-conscious remedies for patterns of inequality, with each side invoking the election of the first black president in support of its cause. 
 Judge Sotomayor, whose parents moved to New York from Puerto Rico, has championed the importance of considering race and ethnicity in admissions, hiring and even judicial selection at almost every stage of her career -- as a student activist at Princeton and at Yale Law School, as a board member of left-leaning Hispanic advocacy groups and as a federal judge arguing for diversity on the bench. 
 Now conservatives say her strong identification with such race-based approaches to the law is perhaps the strongest argument against her confirmation, contending that her views put her outside an evolving consensus that such race-conscious public policy is growing obsolete.
 ''The American ideal is that justice should be colorblind,'' said Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican on the Judiciary Committee. ''As we see people like Barack Obama achieve the highest office in the land and Judge Sotomayor's own nomination to the highest court, I think it is harder and harder to see the justifications for race-conscious decisions across the board.'' 
 Mr. Cornyn added, ''This is a hot-button issue and one that needs to be confronted head on.''
 Gary Marx, executive director of the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network, said he saw a playbook for the campaign against Judge Sotomayor in the successful attacks on Lani Guinier, whose 1993 nomination to a top Justice Department post was withdrawn after an outcry over her writings arguing for alternative voting systems intended to better represent minorities.
 ''We will see 'racial quotas' become a much bigger issue than they might have been had another nominee been brought forward,'' Mr. Marx said.
 But civil rights advocates, including Ms. Guinier, say times have changed in their favor, also citing Mr. Obama's election. In an interview, Ms. Guinier said she saw the debate over Judge Sotomayor's nomination in part as an opportunity for civil rights advocates to push back against the kind of criticism that had thwarted her own nomination.
 ''It is easy to understand the idea of viewing an individual on the content of their character rather than the color of their skin,'' Ms. Guinier said, but race also is a social phenomenon of politics, history and economics that demand deliberate policy responses. 
 Americans often see the issue in an either-or way -- '' you are race-conscious or race-neutral,'' she said. ''But the election of Barack Obama has served as an emancipatory moment, and people are ready to discuss and listen to more nuanced arguments.'' 
 Having Mr. Obama as a spokesman is different as well, said Hilary O. Shelton, director of the Washington bureau of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ''The American people chose change -- symbolically, but in policy as well,'' Mr. Shelton said. ''The American people see things differently now.''
 What is more, many civil rights groups say, Judge Sotomayor's confirmation could provide an anchor against the current direction of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who has led the more conservative bench toward a sweeping re-examination of government reliance on racial classifications, whether in school desegregation plans or landmark voting rights laws. 
 ''The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,'' Chief Justice Roberts wrote in 2007, summing up his approach in one of the most memorable lines of his opinions.
 Samuel Issacharoff, a professor at New York University Law School, said, ''There is a tendency to say 'The time has run, things are different, change has happened,' '' adding, ''It is an emerging theme of the Roberts court.''
 Judge Sotomayor is not known to have identified herself as a beneficiary of affirmative action, but she has described her academic struggles as a new student at Princeton from a Roman Catholic school in the Bronx -- one of about 20 Hispanics on a campus with more than 2,000 students.
 She spent summers reading children's classics she had missed in a Spanish-speaking home and ''re-teaching'' herself to write ''proper English'' by reading elementary grammar books. Only with the outside help of a professor who served as her mentor did she catch up academically, ultimately graduating at the top of her class.
 She became the outspoken leader of a Puerto Rican student group, leading other Hispanics to file a complaint against Princeton with the federal government to force the hiring of Hispanic faculty members and administrators. ''She was very passionate about affirmative action for women and minorities,'' said Charles Hey, another Puerto Rican student.
 At Yale Law School, she was co-chairman of a group for Latin, Asian and Native American students -- a catchall group for nonblack minorities. There she led fellow students in meetings with the dean to push for the hiring of more Hispanic faculty members at the law school. And, friends say, she shared the alarm of others in the group when the Supreme Court prohibited the use of quotas in university admissions in its 1978 decision Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. 
 As a lawyer, she joined the National Council of La Raza and the board of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, two Hispanic civil rights groups that advocate for vigorous affirmative action. As a judge, she has repeatedly argued for diversity on the bench by alluding to the insights she gleaned from her Latina background.
 In one of the few cases dealing with the subject that she helped decide on the federal appeals court, Ricci v. New Haven, she ruled in favor of the city's 's decision to discard the results of an exam to select firefighters for promotion because too few minority firefighters scored high enough to advance. White firefighters who had scored well on the discarded test sued, and the Supreme Court heard arguments on the case in April.
 ''Her nomination and the Ricci case have brought racial quotas back as a national issue,'' said Mr. Marx of the Judicial Confirmation Network.
 The public response, however, is hard to foresee. Few groups conducted public polls on the issue as it faded in recent years, and the results from those that did reveal a consistent ambivalence, said Michael Dimock, a pollster with the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.
 When asked a question about ''affirmative action or preferential treatment for minorities,'' the public has consistently opposed the idea by a margin of two to one. But when asked about ''affirmative action programs designed to help women and minorities,'' an even bigger majority has supported them. 
 And, Mr. Dimock said, the election of Mr. Obama does not appear to have changed either result.

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 30 about the fight over affirmative action in the context of Judge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination for the Supreme Court misidentified a case involving New Haven firefighters on which she and two other appellate judges ruled. The name of the case, now before the Supreme Court, is Ricci v. DeStefano, not Ricci v. New Haven.

HEADLINE: In Global Shift, G.M. Plans Sale Of Europe Unit

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and CARTER DOUGHERTY; Nelson D. Schwartz reported from Paris and Carter Dougherty from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
The global reordering of the auto industry took a big step forward on Friday as an unlikely alliance led by Magna International, a Canadian auto parts maker, and Sberbank of Russia tentatively agreed to buy the European operations of General Motors. 
 The deal was brokered by the German government in Berlin, with negotiations stretching from Moscow to Washington, Detroit, Ontario and New York, where G.M.'s board gathered for a meeting ahead of an expected bankruptcy filing on Monday.
 With sales plunging to levels not seen in decades, auto companies are seeking refuge in mergers or bankruptcy court. Other companies, like Magna and Fiat, are seeing opportunities in beaten-down automakers, hoping to buy them or form alliances on the cheap.
 The deal in Germany will have ripple effects in the United States. 
 Fiat had hoped to grow into a top-tier global company virtually overnight, with its nearly completed alliance with Chrysler and by buying G.M. of Europe, which includes Opel of Germany as well as the British auto company Vauxhall. 
 Although stitching together established companies on different continents is challenging, Chrysler's prospects might have improved as part of a larger company. 
 Now, with Fiat apparently losing out to Magna for G.M.'s European operations, prospects for Chrysler's long-term future could darken. 
 By contrast, a deal for G.M.'s European operations could resolve an important issue for the beleaguered company and help speed its restructuring in bankruptcy court, which appears all but certain.
 ''It's an extremely important step forward for our company and our operations in Europe,'' said Carl-Peter Forster, the president of G.M. Europe, in an interview shortly after the talks concluded at 2 a.m. Berlin time. 
 ''We had three interested parties and it came down to one, Magna, and we hammered out a memorandum of understanding in what was basically 36 hours,'' he said. ''It's a well-founded, pretty detailed M.O.U.''
 Some industry experts immediately panned the proposed Magna alliance with G.M. in Europe, saying the German government had picked the Magna deal over the rival Fiat offer to safeguard nearly 25,000 jobs at home in an election year, while adding yet another player to an industry already burdened by chronic overcapacity. 
 German labor leaders and politicians feared that Fiat would be more aggressive in cutting jobs.
 ''It solves nothing in terms of the industry's structure,'' said Philippe Houchois, an analyst with UBS in London. ''It'll be detrimental to the whole industry's pricing ability, and not much good will come out of this.''
 Losing Opel to Magna would be a blow to Sergio Marchionne, Fiat's chief executive, who was initially favored to acquire Opel.
 After his recent deal for 20 percent of Chrysler, without having to put any of Fiat's money down, Mr. Marchionne had hoped Opel would deliver the kind of scale he believes is crucial for survival in the global auto industry.
 Putting Fiat, Opel, and Chrysler under one roof would have created a company with the capacity to build nearly six million cars a year, which would have made it the second-largest global automaker after Toyota. 
 Instead, Fiat and Chrysler now face competition from a new player, Magna, while Mr. Marchionne and his team work to revive Chrysler's battered fortunes.
 A final deal would lift Magna, whose specialty is making parts and assembling vehicles for other automakers, into the role of manufacturer. Under the terms of the deal as initially proposed by Magna, G.M. would retain a 35 percent stake in the new company, with Sberbank, a bank controlled by the Russian government, taking 35 percent, Magna holding 20 percent and Opel's employees controlling the remaining 10 percent.
 While Sberbank's stake is larger, Magna, along with G.M. Europe's executives, would supply the carmaking expertise to the new company.
 G.M. surprised German officials on Thursday night when it disclosed that an additional 300 million euros would be needed because Opel's finances were deteriorating so quickly.
 Magna and its Austrian-born chief executive, Frank Stronach, have long dreamed of joining the ranks of the automakers it now sells parts to. It is a major supplier of components to G.M., so the two companies already have a relationship, which observers said would help Opel as G.M. navigates its way through the expected bankruptcy process. 
 Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, said that if the Magna deal came through, it would ''take some work to make it a sustainable business.'' 
 Though Magna rose from machine shop to auto parts maker, the company, based in Aurora, Ontario, has deep experience in engineering, assembling vehicles like the BMW X3, a sport utility vehicle, at its Austrian subsidiary, Magna Steyr, in Graz. In 2012 it will begin assembling the Porsche Cayenne, also an S.U.V. 
 The deal also represents a watershed for Russian companies in the West. This month, Vladimir Putin, the Russian prime minister, talked about the Magna offer by phone with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. 
 After initial friction developed between German and American negotiators, as well as G.M., earlier in the week, the tone improved Friday and the pace of negotiations quickened, according to an administration official who insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. A senior member of the Treasury's auto task force in Washington spent the last three days focused on the talks in Berlin, and the Treasury also had a senior adviser there. 
 With roughly two million vehicles a year produced by G.M.'s European operations, Magna will not be in the front ranks of the automotive world. 
 But Magna's trump card could be the Russian market, which could reach annual sales of five million vehicles by 2015, Mr. Dudenhoffer said. By cooperating with Gaz, the Russian automaker, Magna could sell up to 500,000 cars a year there, he said, and steadily increase thereafter. 
 At first, Fiat's abrupt exit from the negotiations was assumed to be a bluff on the part of Mr. Marchionne. But it looks to be an exit for Fiat, which was surprised to learn earlier in the week that Opel would lose 2 billion to 3 billion euros this year, far more than the 1.5 billion euro loss analysts had anticipated, according to officials with knowledge of the negotiations who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
 Politics rather than finances may have been be the crucial factor ahead of an election later this year in Germany. German officials believe the Magna bid will mean fewer job losses than any deal with Fiat. G.M. Europe and Opel employ roughly 50,000 workers in Europe, about half of whom are in Germany. 
 On Friday, the European Commission convened a meeting of ministers to address concerns that the aggressive action by individual countries, like Germany, to protect local jobs, risks dividing the unified market of the 27-nation European Union. 
 In a statement following the meeting, the commission said, ''All participants agreed that any financial support by one or more member states must be based strictly on objective and economic criteria, and not include non-commercial conditions concerning the location of investments and/or the geographic distribution of restructuring measures.'' 
 But the statement failed to satisfy critics who say action, rather words, is needed. 
 ''We have always said there is not a level playing field,'' said Ivan Hodac, secretary-general of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. ''The commission has to create a level playing field because the last thing we need is to get out of this crisis with a destroyed internal market.''
